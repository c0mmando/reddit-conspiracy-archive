        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a teacher.  I&#39;ve been dragged through the mud to get to where I am.  My father was a mechanic, and he had to go through so much red tape to open his own business.  I just finished watching &quot;Illegal Everything&quot; that was posted here earlier.  I&#39;ve been thinking for years now that there needs to be a revolution in the United States.  Peaceful?  Yes.  However, we must state our intentions and stand by our principles.  </p>

<p>The overall idea came to me when in the video a woman was arrested for video taping a police traffic stop in her front yard.  When she returned from the police station, she uploaded the video to youtube and was harassed by the police department.  They followed her friends around and gave them traffic citations for &quot;being more than 12 inches away from the curb.&quot;  My imagination sprang into action and place me in her shoes.  In my day dream, I said &quot;What if I refused to go peacefully?  What if I had some type of trap in my yard that held the officers until I could take legal action, saying that they assaulted me and trespassed with threat of arrest for standing in my own front yard?  What if I started The People&#39;s Government of the United States?&quot;  </p>

<p>I&#39;m very displeased with what our government does.  They lie to us, they take our money, they refuse to protect us, they abuse us, they kill us, they tell us what we can&#39;t do, they are aggressive to other peaceful states such as Libya(another video I watched yesterday was the truth about Gadaffi.  I was highly appalled at what our government is doing.  </p>

<p>What was the last thing that the government did for us?  I&#39;m not talking about Welfare for poor families and such, that comes from OUR tax money(as do a lot of public services), but I cannot think of the last law that was enacted or repealed to assist the citizens.  Now you may ask, &quot;Why did you mention being a teacher at the beginning?&quot;  We are groomed and conditioned to teach your children one specific thing: conformity.  They have to be exactly as everyone else.  And it&#39;s not just the government.</p>

<p>In one case I had a student outside of class ask me about rotting apples.  I explained the process of ethyl alcohol exchange, fermentation, and other such interesting aspects(not of my subject area).  I had a teacher confront me several days later asking &quot;Why on earth would you tell a 6th grader how to make alcohol?!?!&quot;  After asking her what the student said, I quickly learned that this wasn&#39;t about alcohol at all(which I never told him &quot;how&quot; to make).  She didn&#39;t want me telling him anything that wasn&#39;t part of my subject area.  Children are discouraged to ask questions.  Any flame of creativity is stamped out as early as possible.  There&#39;s a large group of teachers in the united states trying to get this changed to &quot;common core&quot;(a new system of teaching students skills and problem solving rather than info), but I have a bad feeling about how this brilliant system will be implemented.</p>

<p>I started typing this in the morning, went to teach, and came back to finish in the afternoon.  I realized from my own apathy towards typing this in the afternoon, people forgive and forget too easily.  They don&#39;t want change.  It&#39;s too easy to distract us from wanting change.  Our newest President promised change, but we never got it.  The only change was the color of his skin.  </p>

<p>Curious, how interested would people be in a completely new government?  A true democracy that involves a voting system sent through e-mail that requires every citizens social security number to log in and vote(on everything).  We need to get rid of the people in government who get millions of dollars to make decisions AGAINST us that we put there.  A 100% release on all secret government info.  If everyone stood up to say something, if everyone stopped paying taxes and stopped voting, if we demanded our own government, would we get it?  </p>

<p>While I agree a complete nonviolent revolution would be impossible, an &quot;attack only when attacked&quot; principle would give that group a strong backing and following.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>as a school teacher you should know the system was designed to manufacture new working class citizens. the real useful information (how money works, how to build wealth and build a successful business, how to find and surround yourself with people who can add value to your enterprises...for instance) is never taught. </p>

<p>the curriculum feeds facts and figures to basically condition kids to conform to and accept a system where they are told when you be at a certain place (school/work), when to take breaks (recess/coffee), when they can eat (lunch) and when to go home after producing all day (grades/products or services) for the people that sign the paycheques (teachers/boss).</p>

<p>all of this, along with the way girls are dressing these days, is exactly why i gave up my aspirations to teach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are very good points.  I&#39;ve dedicated my life to teaching, but I also believe information should be free and easily attainable, so I give it out to my students when they ask.  I promote creativity.  I&#39;m a musician(band director).  There&#39;s just so much force against that ideology that sometimes it&#39;s really hard.  These students are not only conditioned to be as bland as possible, they are conditioned to be violent with each other and automatically disagree with anything they are not taught.  Not just in the sense to disagree with anything &quot;opposing&quot; what they&#39;re taught, if they haven&#39;t heard it before or it hasn&#39;t been directly taught to them in class, they automatically disbelieve it.  We produce a society of skeptics.  Many of us could argue it&#39;s a good thing, but without curiosity against skepticism, we could not make progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>your whole culture is geared towards violence, might makes right, and fuck everything that doesnt jive with the official party line. surely you can see this? the whole american system is rancid with over-competitiveness, greed and ethnocentrism. from an outsiders perspective (im canadian btw so im not getting the perspective that a european gets although id love to hear if im off the mark from a non-american) it seems that the only thing america exports is war and entertainment.  </p>

<p>but i digress...your system cant abide critical thought. thats the bottom line. this goes hand in hand with atheism because religion cant stand up to a thorough examination of claims and philosophy and the american system is in the same boat. you have presidential contenders accusing the other ones of being too educated or not pious enough to lead the country. your media feeds into that and the bullshit filters down to the kids. its hopeless and im sorry to tell you that the next generation will be the ones to being it all down because they wont know any better than to follow orders or make bad decisions based on the shit they are being shoveled by the media. </p>

<p>What we need is a rude awakening. Something drastic and painful. People have to lose something close to them, whether it&#39;s their <strong>perceived</strong> freedom or their lives. It&#39;s the only way to shock people out of the ignorant stupor they&#39;ve allowed themselves to enter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://projects.eff.org/%7Ebarlow/Declaration-Final.html">Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather.
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions.
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions.
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don&#39;t exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our world is different.
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about this too, a real democracy where the people decide everything and do not rely on some politic.
And today, with the Internet, we have the possibility of creating this. The only problem here is the actual government which wants to keep their power...</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why every time I hear &quot;nonviolent revolution&quot;, I remember all the abuse of power from the police.
Do you really think the government will change its opinion on the citizens if they keep acting like sheep just waiting for the police to arrest them ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I stated, it would be an &quot;attack when attacked&quot; scenario, so the moment the government funded police tried to arrest someone under &quot;The People&#39;s Government of the United States,&quot; the people would be allowed to defend themselves in any way possible - provided they were &quot;nonviolently&quot; enacting the beliefs of that government system(when the police went to arrest them).  The initial laws of the government would be nonviolent in nature: You are not allowed to do anything that would harm or deter another person or group physically, extending to financial and other scenarios.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been to local protests and mingled with some of the Occupants, but I&#39;m from small town Arkansas and things like that around here aren&#39;t a big deal.  I realize people have been severely injured, beaten, pepper sprayed and such.  But nothing like that happened in Little Rock or Conway.  People just walked on by and ignored it.  They dwindled after a while because no one was noticing.  Again, I realize this isn&#39;t the case in larger areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are very good points.  I&#39;ve dedicated my life to teaching, but I also believe information should be free and easily attainable, so I give it out to my students when they ask.  I promote creativity.  I&#39;m a musician(band director).  There&#39;s just so much force against that ideology that sometimes it&#39;s really hard.  These students are not only conditioned to be as bland as possible, they are conditioned to be violent with each other and automatically disagree with anything they are not taught.  Not just in the sense to disagree with anything &quot;opposing&quot; what they&#39;re taught, if they haven&#39;t heard it before or it hasn&#39;t been directly taught to them in class, they automatically disbelieve it.  We produce a society of skeptics.  Many of us could argue it&#39;s a good thing, but without curiosity against skepticism, we could not make progress.</p>
