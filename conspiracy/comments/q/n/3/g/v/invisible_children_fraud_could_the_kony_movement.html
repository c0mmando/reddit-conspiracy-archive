    <div class="md"><p>Clearly engineered to play on the emotions of upstanding facebook- enthralled white middle class Americans in order to soften &#39;public perception&#39; on starting this new misadventure in Africa. 5 months after our first black ops dudes publicly hit the ground and 6 years since this &#39;warlord of warlords&#39; has been pushed back into the jungle all of a sudden this is a huge memetic campaign. C&#39;mon...I don&#39;t think so... no accidents here. </p>

<p>You already know what is going on with this propaganda blitz. Africa is the next conquest. God help us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do people not see the parallels to Iraq/Vietnam?</p>

<p>We want influence and presence in resource-rich regions, duh. We&#39;re planning for a future without them.</p>

<ul>
<li>The precious-metal market is currently dominated by China, who has been straining trade with the US.</li>
<li>China has been spreading influence across Africa through aid, and is moving to control Africa&#39;s resources.</li>
<li><p>There is a large store of Cobalt and Copper metals in the Uganda-Congo Rift Valley, and a large percentage of Africa&#39;s untapped oil.</p></li>
<li><p>We want it, too.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s not hard to understand why we&#39;re crusading for oil. The Navy&#39;s had 3-4 aircraft carriers guarding the Persian Gulf/Arabian sea for more than a decade. We have plans to pipe oil in from Canada. We have corporations drilling all over the world, using up everybody else&#39;s  oil before our own. We also have a decade&#39;s worth of on reserve, so we&#39;re pretty set. KONY 2012 is just moving another Risk piece onto Africa. Everything is control of resources.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not for/against going to Africa, I just want everyone to know the real reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>??? I dont think thats the case at all the chinese have been slowly buying up the mineral resources in africa. Everything thats been going on has been a power play for energy security especially in afghanistan. We have already sent troops into africa what the government is doing is getting the okay for military action by gaining the support of citizens who otherwise would oppose it. What im trying to say is that this could be a psyop to get the anti war crowd on board for action by basically tricking them into thinking some not for profit and the young people of america are asking our government to send &quot;advisors&quot; to the regions when in actuality its to gain a foothold in Africa</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would the U.S. need to have its own presence in Africa in order to take advantage of the mineral resources? Labor in Africa is cheaper than dirt and commodities like diamonds are abundant. In what way would it benefit us to cut out the middle man, when the middle man is almost free?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>U.S. needs to a presence in the region in order to lock out China from gaining any more natural assets in the region. China has bought up quite a bit of the mining rights in the region. If The US were to have a presence there it will be easier for US companies to come in and drill for oil and mine. KONY2012 is somebody&#39;s way of getting the left wing in the United States to support military action with boogeyman named Kony as a scape goat. Im not saying that Kony by any means isn&#39;t a war criminal but there are plenty of human rights violators and war criminals in Africa some just as bad or worse than Kony. This is a clear example of crisis economics</p>
