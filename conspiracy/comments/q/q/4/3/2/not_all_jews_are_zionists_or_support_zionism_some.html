       One, I'm not Jewish.  Two, I'll be the first in line to berate any Jew that
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       support Zionism.  However, I'd be first in line to berate ANYONE - Jew or non Jew - who supports Zionism, and there are some (many?  I don't know) Jews that actively opposed Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so very easy to equate Zionism and Jews, but
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TlNs66HESw&amp;feature=related">
        this
       </a>
       video right here is a great, great example of how I personally feel some (all?) Jewish people
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be.  These right here are Jews that in no uncertain terms let it be known that Zionism goes EXPRESSLY against the true tenets of Judaism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be easy for many to get pretty up in arms about Jews and the very true horrors in Palestine.  However, we should
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       rail against Zionism and anyone - Jew and non Jew - that support the horrors happening in the world at the hands of Zionism.

       you have to be careful supporting the views of NK (Neutra Karta). As much as I (as a Jew) support their anti-Zionist views,as well as their belief that Zionism has destroyed the once ancient religion of Judaism, NK is not humanistic. Notice you seldom see women amongst their ranks. Notice they don't associate with secular Jews, such as myself, even though I share most of their views, they won't be seen with me. Being a proud Jew as well as an anti-Zionist is difficult and lonely enough, but there is no haven amongst them. That is why I love r/conspiracy! :D

       I knew nothing about Neutra Karta prior to your mentioning it here, and simply made the OP because it was a video of Jews actively opposing Zionism - which I thought was great.

       Ive seen a Jews against Israel thing talking to Ahmedenajhad on some Iranian video.  I have no opinion on Zionism.  Neither sides hands are clean.  The jews lied &amp; killed to get their country, just as Muslims are are lieing &amp; killing on every front of the Muslim world.  At least Israel has a somewhat secular democracy &amp; a general desire for peace right now.

       the orthodox parties are taking over. not to mention they are bringing back jim crow. Did you hear that orthodox ministers decided that africans in israel should get their own buses in south tel aviv because they smell? there is a comfortable sheet of racism covering most of israeli society. throwing around derogatory words is common place in israel.

       Most Ashkenazi think being a jew is genetic. Like being a Hindu is genetic. Absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a buddy who, when he thought it through and figured out that Judaism is a religion and is no more genetic than Christianity he didn't know what to do with himself he was so happy. Not because he thinks being Jewish is bad, just that he was raised in a family where such thought wasn't really common. He thought that he was somehow both Jewish AND Catholic because is his last name.

       That would be a condition of being Ashkenazi. Judaism (Jewishness) is a beliefset just like Christianity is a beliefset.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are Ashkenazi then you'll have conditions related to being Ashkenazi. That would be on the genetic level. An example apart from your topic would be that a given black person has a statistically higher chance of having sickle cell anemia (genetic level). But that doesn't mean they like hip hop (beliefset).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short being a Jew is purely mental (like being a Christian) and has no physical manifestations other than behavior, language and thought patterns (like Christianity). Being Ashkenazi is purely a genetic issue and has nothing to do with thoughts, behaviors or language. It's primary manifestation is that you're a touch lighter relative to a lot of other humans. That's about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going all the way back to your question it actually doesn't, in any way, apply to Judaism.

       A Zionist is someone who supports institutionalizing Jewish supremacism, either directly (e.g. Isreal) or indirectly (e.g. Jewish racketeering in the diaspora that, for example, has led to
       <a href="http://www.judeofascism.com/2011/10/neolibs-and-neocons-claim-democratic.html">
        massive Jewish over-representation in the Democratic Party).
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, there are all manner of supremacist components in the Jewish religion that encourage Jewish racketeering and exploitation of non-Jews, and utter contempt for non-Jews (goyim). For example,
       <a href="http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/10/18/2741341/rabbi-yosef-non-jews-exist-to-serve-jews">
        one Israeli rabbi not long ago declared non-Jews are animals who are put on earth to serve Jews
       </a>
       , which is a position backed by much Jewish doctrine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should Judaism be outlawed? No. Should Judaism be recogized by everyone as the highly evolved racketeering and generally racist enterpirse that it is? Yes. Are there racketeering elements to other organized religions? Yes. Those should be recognized, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've found that a lot of even the non-Jews who defend organized Jewry today are themselves psychologically prone to thinking within Jewish supremacist paradigms, whether they're aware of it or not. This can take the form of Judeo-Christian Zionism, or politically correct "Holocaustianity" (the belief that the Jewish people are some kind of "chosen" collective or crucible made supreme by peresecution). And those are just two examples. There are others on both the left and right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, just like the Isaeli Zionist Jews, organized Jewry has brought the vast mamority of its suffering on itself due to its own sense of entitlement and chauvinism. The whole victim shtick is part of its racket. And I'm sure that most Jews who are capable of being honest with themselves will agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, I think that most sophisticated people today can see that so many elements of the Abrahamite religions in this day and age are nothing but a racket.

       Its a sad but true fact that most Modern Orthodox Jews (Not the guys in black hats, more like the religious people who live and work in the modern world. They keep all the Torah commandments, but they're not to the level of say Hasidism, and not secular to the point of someone like me) They support Israel above all. Most will never visit anywhere in the world besides Izrael and Poland for the march of the living, XooHR!.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their entire being for being Jewish is the state of Izrael and Never Again. For them $2billion in aide to Israel is their Jewish identity. American Jews emigrate to Israel freely, speak freely about their views on Izrael without regard to other peoples feelings. Modern Orthodox Jews get drunk and celebrate Purim, yet think nothing of bombing Modern Persia (where more Jewish holy sites exist than in The Levant).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was telling my Kahanist Modern Orthodox family the other day: If Israel is your foundation for being Jewish, and not the 5700 year old religion, you may as well eat a bacon cheeseburger, because you have no idea what being Jewish really is. FYI, its not the NK either

       So what percentage of Jews support Zionist goals? From what I've read, it's a very high percentage, the majority by an easy margin. Most Jews are Zionists. Sure, a few are not, but most are. Why are we to ignore the reality that the vast majority of Jews are Zionist and support Zionist actions and goals?

       Personally, I couldn't say either way. I have no way of knowing for sure if your statement is true or false. There is no statistical information that I know of on the percentage of Zionists in Jewish population or in the general population. So I don't see how your conclusion that "most Jews are Zionists" can not be proven.

       Where on earth did you find hatred? I don't see why understanding that most Jews are Zionists implies any hatred of any kind. It's a recognition of a reality, nothing more. As such, it has consequences that may play a part in understanding political situations that arise.

       I personally don't think it's naive.  I do, however, think that, where Zionism is concerned, the damage and destruction they (Zionists) are causing is so horrible and alarming that the time has come for something to be done about it NOW and

       Me personally?  I - as I said in the OP - only rail against those Jews that support Zionism.  I don't know the percentage.
      </p>
      <p>
       If only 1% or Jews support Zionism, then that percentage of Jews should go down along with Zionism and all its other supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       If 99% of the Jewish population supports Zionism, then 99% of the Jewish population should go down along with every other person that supports Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's strictly a black and white numbers game as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said, and whether it's only 1% or 99%, not
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       single Jew supports Zionism, and it should be acknowledged as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like any other stereotype really.  I imagine it's a stereotype because there's enough truth in it, unfortunately, for people to simply generalize.

       This doesn't seem to be an easy number to pin down. I've just been Googling to find out what percentage of Jews are Zionists. The gut feeling seems to be most of them -- answers range from 50% to 100%. However, I don't see any firm figures backed by studies in the links I've Googled ... which is curious, since I would think this would be an important enough question to be prominently placed in the results. But it isn't. Someone quoted the result of one survey here some while ago. I think the percentage was over 80% in that survey. My own gut feeling is that it is over 90%, probably somewhere around 98%. But you're correct in saying that there is more opinion than fact on this matter, which is odd since it would not seem to be a difficult question to ask Jews. "Do you support the existence of Israel?" for example, since Israel is a Zionist entity.

       It's a difficult question because "zionism" is difficult to define.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you define it as "does Israel have the right to exist as a state?". I'm a zionist. Most jews are, by this definition, zionist.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you define it as "Israel has the right to kill Palestinians like the scum that they are". I'm an anti-zionist. It would be a mistake to suggest that most jews feel this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that when legitimate anti-zionists start making reference to all jews being... then they've generalized their hatred to an entire religious/ethnic/cultural group. This is despicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hating the specific zionists (jew or otherwise) who support evil is perfectly legitimate. Hating all jews is anti-semitic.

       While I agree, kind of, a lot of the time on this subreddit, people add the "Jew" adjective when describing something, because t hey think it's pertinent.

       Your comments are not falling on deaf ears. As a recently added mod here, I'd say this issue is easily amongst the top 3 we discuss and try to address.  I believe there is a vocal and active subset of users who are intent on tarnishing our image with racism and hate. I don't understand their agenda, but we battle their actions pretty much daily.

       There are no anti-semites. They are like terrorists. People who you want to vilify by calling them names.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, Semite use to mean: a member of any of a number of peoples of ancient southwestern Asia including the Akkadians, Phoenicians, Hebrews, and Arabs b: a descendant of these peoples 2: a member of a modern people speaking a Semitic language. Now it means jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionist rely upon people being afraid of being called anti-semetic which implies anti-jew. It is a "red-herring".
      </p>
      <p>
       Your last comment seems to indicate that you have been caught up in the political correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think this is the hangout for anti-jews?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who would
       <em>
        pretend
       </em>
       to be anti-jew if they really were?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the few places where zionism can be criticized. The Hasbara don't like the criticism so they down-vote. They consider it their patriotic duty and their responsibility to prevent another
       <em>
        holocaust
       </em>
       . The zionists are the ones who post the (false flag) extreme anti-jew and anti-Israel stuff so that people will disregard the anti-zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being an anti-zionist is the same as being anti-aparthate or anti-neocon. It is anti-Israel but not anti-Israeli or anti-jew or even anti-semetic.

       There are a number of people in here who, while criticizing zionists, include all jews in that criticism. They are anti-jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also a number of people in here who criticize Israeli policy but don't generalize to all jews. They are not anti-jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racism and hate affects all people. There are certainly zionists who hate and are racists. You've suggested that they are the only ones in here who are being racist and hateful. This slippery logic suggests that any example of anti-semitism in here is false flag anti-semitism. Obviously, this is a ridiculous thing to say. If you didn't mean that, fair enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't give a fuck about political correctness. I just don't like scapegoaters, racists and people who try to suggest that the only evil in the world comes from the people they hate. Its cowardly and ill-informed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that this describes you, but it certainly describes others in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel deserves a shitload of criticism. Almost as much as the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mistake some people make is that they claim that all Israelis are as guilty of war crimes as the Israeli government. This is as foolish as saying that all Americans are responsible for the evil perpetrated by the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is the central question of the entire anti-zionist movement in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Why is Israel and her supporters the subject of so much hate? There are any number of other countries in the world where the elites are greedily killing/marginalizing/enslaving/torturing their people. For christsake look at what the Chinese, Russians, and Americans are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, please feel free to hate the Israeli state but when generalizations are made to all jews, you've lost the support of a great deal of people who would have supported you. If you want to pretend that there isn't any anti-jewish sentiment in here, fine, but that simply isn't true.

       I do not "pretend that there isn't any anti-jewish sentiment in here". Just as I do not pretend that there isn't any anti-Obama sentiment in here. I just don't pay any attention. I certainly don't try to counter that sentiment by claiming that people who think he is a criminal are racist and hateful. Because you know that could lead to disproportionate representation in prison or jim crow laws or (gulp)
       <em>
        slavery

       <em>
        jumped

       to the defense of the indefensible? How is my separating attacks on Israel from attacks on jews a tactic of the JDL, the hasbara, the neocons and the zionists? Presumably, those people would defend themselves rather than criticize. How is what I've said or how I've said it attack mode? Surely calling out bigotry is a legitimate form of free speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why you brought Obama into it but, here goes. There is much to criticize about Obama but when people say that he was destined to fail
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       he is black, they've stopped being legitimate critics and have fallen into racism. Surely you see the parallel. Israeli internal and foreign policy is, occasionally, reprehensible but it is a mistake to claim that all jews are reprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free speech is a great thing but hate speech is disgusting. Criticizing the actions of specific people is a healthy and necessary route to accountability, generalizing the actions of a few specific people to a way larger ethnic/cultural/religious/racial subset of the population is disgusting.

       You have mischaracterized "the anti-zionist movement" in a way that disparages and suggests a link between anti-zionist and so called anti-semitic which is the code word for racist anti-jew. That is what all those groups do. That you did it reflexively and cannot see it even when it is pointed out is one of the reasons that the "anti-zionists" feel compelled to be so startling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I brought up Obama is the absurdity of assuming all criticism is racially motivated and that would parallel the absurdity of assuming anti-zionism is racially motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hate speech" is an invention of the zionists to restrict criticism of zionism. There is no such thing apart from free speech.

       I've said that there are anti-zionists that don't focus their hatred at just zionists but towards all jews. You really need to stop being so defensive of the criticism of factions of your movement. What I've done is expressly stated that some of the actions of the state of Israel are reprehensible but defended jews who don't share the zionist worldview. You are the one who is being dogmatic and defensive.

       You are the one that is suggesting that any criticism of any anti-zionists is a criticism of all anti-zionists. This is the defensive tactics of the JDL, the hasbara, the neocons and the zionists. You are mimicking their tactics and unreasonably refusing to accept legitimate criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, hate speech was not invented by zionists. Hate speech is the verbalization of racism used as weapon. Feel free to support the anti-zionist movement but recognize that by ignoring the racists in your midst you are condoning their actions. If you want your criticism to gain legitimacy, you shouldn't stand for the anti-jewish bigots in your movement.

      <p>
       You keep talking about hatred*.
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep telling you the issue is free speech: criticism of anti-zionists using ant-
       <strong>
        semitism
       </strong>
       is an attack on free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that criticism of zionism is hatred of jews* is the problem I am trying to bring to your attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an anti-AIPAC movement, a BDS movement, a free Palestine movement etc. I am not a part of any group. You are alleging
       <em>
        guilt  by association
       </em>
       "by ignoring the racists in your midst you are condoning".* You are afraid that my freedom to criticize zionism gives cover to racists and ant-jewish bigots. You cannot see the absurdity of this
       <em>
        FEAR
       </em>
       . I tried to point out the parallel absurdity of  giving cover to racists by criticizing Obama. It is irrational.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT suggesting that criticism of any anti-zionist is a criticism of all anti-zionists. You are trying to make this the  the issue.*
      </p>
      <p>
       So called hate speech was not invented by zionists. The
       <strong>
        term
       </strong>
       , the
       <strong>
        phrase
       </strong>
       , and
       <strong>
        the legislation
       </strong>
       is zionist.

       First you suggest that the only racism and hatred in here is from the hasbara and the zionists.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zlth2">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you claim that there is no such thing as anti-semites. That it is a semantic fiction.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zmuhl">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You follow by suggesting that any anti-jew or anti-Israel comments are false flagged by hasbara.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zmuhl">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you change course and admit that there is anti-jewish sentiment in this sub-reddit.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zp8yj">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Followed by a new tactic that even if there are anti-jewish comments in here, the issue really is free speech more than anything else.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zp8yj">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite your admission of the anti-jewish undercurrent in the anti-zionist movement, you accuse me of using the tactics of a hate group calling your attention to the movement you are defending.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zp8yj">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you challenge the audacity of stating that there are anti-jewish factions among the anti-zionists. More evidence that I'm using zionist tactics.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zpnzp">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, hilariously, you suggest that the concept of hate speech was invented by the zionists.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zpnzp">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you continue to assert that any allegation of anti-semitism is merely a tactic of the anti-zionists. Notwithstanding your admission that there are in fact anti-semites in the anti-zionist movement, including in this subreddit.
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qq432/not_all_jews_are_zionists_or_support_zionism_some/c3zq4sn">
        here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you change course and admit that hate speech wasn't invented by the zionists.

      </p>
      <p>
       It's been quite a ride but I think we're coming to the end of our discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we agree that while free speech is very important we should work together to discourage anti-jewish comments from this subreddit because they hurt the legitimate anti-zionist movement? We can continue to support discussion of how awful the zionists are but we can work together to discourage overt racism, prejudice, scapegoating, bigotry and hatred. We both hate those things, right?

       Does this sound reasonable to you?

       If you are unaware that it is illegal in the EU the UK Canada and Australia to engage in "hate speech" then you are not paying attention. The phrase, the definition and the legislation is zionist and only protects zionist interests. One of their interests is "the jews" - their hiding place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hateful speech is repugnant but we should NOT conspire to limit free speech. That you should suggest this as some sort of "agree to disagree" resolution makes it clear that you have not understood anything I have said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are defending jews. They are not being attacked. r/conspiracy is NOT a hangout for anti-jewish bigots nor is it a place of anti-jewish sentiment. That you see it that way may be more a predisposition on your part than anything else. That "we" should try to assuage
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       insecurity by working together to discourage people from offending your over-sensitivity to persecution is again the tactics of the aforementioned groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       That you are so defensive of jews and not Obama and blacks has made me suspicious of your motives and affiliations. Your constant attempt to change the subject to me, my beliefs, or my perceived inconsistencies is not the conscious cogitation of an open mind but rather the tactics of the enemies of free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not defending the world or the jews or the Israelis neither are you standing up for any nobel cause. You are hiding your own personal fear and insecurity behind a facade of defending the jews against anti-jewish comments "racism, prejudice, scapegoating, bigotry and hatred". This is transparent boilerplate and I have engaged you in this conversation to expose you and people like you.

       Free speech includes "hate speech".

       I've never seen blacks attacked here. There are numerous anti-jewish comments in this subreddit however. If blacks were being attacked in the same way, I'd be supporting the blacks. According to you, my dislike of racism in this subreddit is suspicious.

       I'm sorry to say you're the one who has exposed yourself as, not only an enemy of free speech, but a supporter of racism and hate speech. Your double talk, red herrings, misdirection, flip flopping and fear of criticism, all under the guise of supporting free speech is revealing.

      <p>
       If you really thought hateful speech was repugnant you would volunteer to comment on it when you see it and downvote it. Challenging that shit sends a message, not only to the commenter but to everyone who reads it. Your unwillingness to do that is explicit evidence that you, in fact, support it.

       I do my best to disillusion people. You are deluded to think that your attack on free speech is a defense of the jews. You have invented an evil that does not exist and you use that as an excuse to hide your true motives. There is more anti-global-warming-is-a-hoax-ism and apollo-hoax-ism than ant-semitism here.
      </p>

       But the OVERALL POINT here isn't wether or not they are Jewish, it's weather or not they are Zionists. Mulsims=\=terrorists. Religion and race shouldn't even be on the fucking table, there's no need to justify a bias toward one or the other, as it's completely irrelevant. ZIONISM is the enemy, a Zionist by any race, creed, or religion.
