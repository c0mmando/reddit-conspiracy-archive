        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before I start I must say that I am a student of economy. There are few things regarding the modern society that are often on my mind but which are quite debatable and conspiratory in nature. I want to put it all out here at once and get it out of my system. If you disagree with what I say, I am willing to consider flaws in my logic and would like to hear some well explained arguments.</p>

<p>There are few aspects of modern society that keep bothering me. Entertainment industry and working life. Let&#39;s start from the entertainment industry. The more I think about it, the more it seems like a gladiator arena to keep people distracted, satisfied with their governments and their own mechanical boring lives. Everybody seems to think this is the way it is supposed to be and it is bothering me. We already have enough entertainment to last us for a lifetime and yet we keep producing more and more of it in vast amounts. It used to be about educating and inspiring people with new ideas, but now it seems to consist mostly of blunt waste of time stripped out of all significance and meaning. Do not get me wrong, I have nothing against entertainment itself and I think that little entertainment is good for us, but the modern lifestyle reminds me of some dystopian science fiction world similar to which was described by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World. Is that where we are heading – a society in which our only goal is to maintain economy and full fill our own basic needs?</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin we have the working life. It seems that we are conditioned since childhood to the idea that there are 8 hours of work, 8 hours of play and 8 hours of sleep. That&#39;s what supposed to make a schedule of a lifetime of every individual in modern world. Under no circumstances are working hours to be confused with playing hours. Equal amount of both seems to be some sort of unquestionable standard. What is made certain during the working hours is that discipline and obedience of authority is absolute. This is taken as given by nearly everyone, but the more I think about it, the more it seems like a set up only to maintain the current economy and power hierarchy running. Education system seems to be more about obeying authority and performing useless time consuming assignments for periods of many years than it is about learning. This makes people accept everything they hear as facts, beats out all curiosity and strive for knowledge, and prepares for the mechanical work we are meant to do for the rest of our lives. If anyone wants any better, it does not require as much intelligence as it requires nerves, patience and most of all: money.</p>

<p>Many would argue that 8 hours of work is a necessity to maintain the society, but a small research might reveal something interesting which might put this statement into questionable light. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_time#Hunter-gatherer">According to historians, our ancestors, hunter-gatherers, used to work no more than five hours a day six days a week. Boldest estimations stay at two days a week</a>. These was before humanity eve had farming. Now at our disposal we have technology unimaginable to our ancestors and yet we spend more time working than they did. Other important and widely unnoticed fact is that ever since current economy was introduced, the working hours have been driven by competition and the free market. Due to this system, technology had a negative effect on society when a lot of people lost their jobs to first industrial machines. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day">This created high demand for jobs, which made the value of a single working hour drop dramatically, making people willing to work from ten to sixteen hours a day six days a week. That&#39;s when the industrial revolution happened and a standard of 8 hours a day was implemented</a>. Technology is a thing that makes life easier and reduces needed efforts to maintain our society. Now picture this: 8 hour working standard was implemented almost 200 years ago and all this great technology has not reduced the needed working effort by a single minute. Why? I think that it is all because of the conditioning that is done to us since early childhood. We are made to believe that 8 hour of working is an unquestionable standard and that is how much we are ready to work to gain a salary equal to one day&#39;s job. This idea is implemented so well that many of us will feel anxious unless we spend 8 hours a day working. This created a demand for jobs and anyone who is not willing to work 8 hours for an average day of daily work is left unemployed. Employers find themselves in a situation where they are simply trying to maximize their profit and are limited by the market, value of money (of course regulated by the so-called “invisible hand” and, surprise, surprise, THE BANKS) and of course the 8 hour working standard. Supply meets demand as they say. Without the 8 hour standard people would be working 16 or even 20 hours a day to gain the same amount of money they are now gaining for 8 hour working days.</p>

<p>The problem with job market and globalization is that due to outsourcing many jobs move to other countries where people are willing to work longer hours for smaller wage. Our 8 hour fixed working standard cannot compete with their unregulated working hours. For many companies it&#39;s cheaper to pay a bunch of Asian children manufacture stuff than buy machinery to do the work. The inevitable fact we will have to face is that there will be a day when maintaining a machine will be more profitable than housing and paying minimum wage for homeless Asian children. What then? Will all manual labour workers lose their job to machines and will we have another revolution? Will the demand for the technical jobs grow ten fold when compared to supply, resulting in the majority&#39;s unemployment and in a drop of everyone&#39;s salaries? - With current economy it probably would.</p>

<p>For lots of people work and daily life seem so horrible that entertainment is the only escape from all that. Instead of pointing out the flaws and wrongs of modern society, people are accepting it as a part of life and escape into their dreamy worlds of lies and illusions. Suddenly the working conditions do not matter that much as long as there is distracting activity to take the mind off the daily boring routines and horrors of the real world. That&#39;s right: ignorance is bliss. </p>

<p>Many of us prefer to escape reality. The more time we spend watching sports, TV or playing video games, the more distant we become from the real world and things that really matter. To me it seems that entertainment is the new religion with their own gods to worship. Here we can find Reddit; one of the most intelligent online society where hundreds of thousands of intelligent people spending most of their time looking at cat pictures. The ignorance is so great that most of them cannot even see that their subreddits are being censored and that many of their moderators are not what they seem to be. Same things with most other media which seems to show only half of the story.</p>

<p>In the school of economics I had a four hour lecture on how intelligent people are unfit to be employed into businessess due to natural uncontrollability by authority. This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-intellectualism">anti-intellectualism</a> at its finest. Our economy is built on these principles. The modern world is filled with useless jobs for sake of economy itself, unnecessary working tasks and distractions keeping people from being productive in any way. The more I realize this the more cautious I become when it comes to entertainment and complete waste of time lurking at every corner. Whenever I tell to people that I am interested in philosophy, mathematics, physics and sciences, they look at me as if I am a mad man. Nor can most people comprehend why I am not interested in the things which they keep as most important aspects of their daily lives: such as watching reality TV and other brain-dead shows, updating their face book statuses every hour, spending long hours playing video games, buying useless overpriced cheap junk or socializing in a pub about all the same waste of time they have done while getting their heads full of government approved poison just to escape the reality once again. It is sad to know that I, and all people like me, are considered outcasts in modern society just because we do not fit the model of being cattle animals for the system. If they would only understand...that this is the stuff that keeps me awake at nights.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are an economist with a conspiracy theorist mind. Perhaps you&#39;ll understand this.</p>

<p>The laws of supply and demand are (currently) fraudulent. A specific example of this is the automobile/petroleum industries. The (fictitious) claim is that &quot;because people keep buying gasoline powered cars, the demand for oil continues to grow&quot; &lt;-- notice anything odd about that? ... like ... perhaps... there are no alternatives to gasoline powered cars? Look at the lengthy legal battle Ed Begley Jr. fought to <strong>keep</strong> his EV (they wanted to take it away from him and he said &quot;over my dead body&quot;).</p>

<p>The laws of economics are valid, but only when they&#39;re not being manipulated by the unseen hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. As for the zeitgeist (original), I had see most of those youtube clips before Joseph Smith compiled them. The Venus Project was kind of new to me, but my opinion is that it is naive to think that we could just &quot;start doing that&quot; without the hidden hand smacking us down.</p>

<p>There are two different versions of the &quot;cashless society&quot;. One is the NWO/Masonic CHIP, the other is The Venus Project. We&#39;ll get there eventually, one way or another. But both sides (the masses and the masters) will fight to the bitter end to have it in their best interests.</p>

<p>I agree with much of what you wrote.</p>

<p>But my problem with this quote is that it implies &quot;Corporations will do what&#39;s best because the Free Market makes everything right.&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, the ONLY REASON we have 8 hour work days is because <strong>labor unions DIED to reduce our work day from 12-16 hours, and our work week from 7 to 5 days.</strong></p>

<p>Do we think corporations gave us 8 hour work days voluntarily?</p>

<p>Do we think corporations gave us weekends voluntarily?</p>

<p>This &quot;8 hour standard&quot; is not some benign, benevolent consensus that corporations want us to have.</p>

<p>If corporations had their way, we&#39;d be working like the peasants at FoxConn.</p>

<p>If corporations had their way, we&#39;d be completely disposable and expendable.</p>

<p>If corporations had their way, there would be no regulations, and no middle class.</p>

In many ways I am likely the &quot;other&quot; to you in the details of life yet I recognise that you just summed up my thoughts and feelings of the world we live in.

    <div class="md"><p>The real scary part is that even by knowing this shit, everybody still gets up to go to work every day. The System is so sophisticated, that even when you realize its bullshit, you still are forced to be in it.
You can try to avoid mainstream media ( having no television has changed something in my thought processes ), but how can you avoid  being used a cattle, somehow money is needed to buy essential things ( food, rent ).
This really hurts my mind, i feel numb, i would like to wake up everyone, but like you said most people dont even question the current situation, its just so damn sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s a great quote from that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is however a problem in this equation. Right now we have a lot of extremely rich people in the world, and we found ourselves in a situation when the vast majority of people can’t make ends meet any more. I could say – the 99% of human beings on the planet are feeling the pinch of dwindling natural resources, whereas the very affluent 1% of human beings are actively using their assets to change the current system to protect their acquired interests, power, property, sense of prestige, affluence, security, etc. It is a sad thing that the losers in this mechanism are blamed, but that behaviour of “blaming the loser” seems to be a constant in human society. In any era of total diminishing affluence the very affluent are the last to lose theirs since they will be in the best bargaining position, and can buy the political process. That is pretty much what we are seeing. </p>
