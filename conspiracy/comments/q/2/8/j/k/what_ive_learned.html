        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I started reddit&#39;ing around 8 months ago, one of the first things that hit me was &quot;Wow so many different people, ideas, minds, topics and links. I&#39;ve always been a person with broad interests, I get curious and look into something. Heck this last week I downloaded blender watched a few tutorials and have a basic understanding of it now. My most frequented subreddits were askscience, conspiracy, worldnews, canada, star wars and swtor (game I was looking forward to).  I&#39;d always go and explore others while keeping up with current events. </p>

<p>I saw loose change years ago along with other documentaries I could find on youtube, I questioned 9/11, aliens, the occult, and the media, not out of any great discovery, but just being curious. However I kept reading and before NATO even went to Libya, when they were just talking about it in the newspapers, I thought &quot;this is bad&quot; and just followed with my normal curiosity. I wondered &quot;why?&quot; This was when I learned more about the GOD (Gold, OIl, drugs) influence that has kept too many wars going. </p>

<p>Last year I was taking anthropology (grade 11) and the last unit was basically a &quot;media litteracy&quot; class. With a lot of the reading I was doing on reddit and elseware it all sounded familiar, but something hit me. I wasn&#39;t really thinking about it. I started to pull things together. I find ideas can weave together neatly. I was and still am at the point where, every idea, message or point I come across, I have to actively try to understand the what? The why? and the how? </p>

<p>Something that gets thrown around a lot is the idea &quot;There&#39;s no Illuminati, just groups of people with vast amount of power and wealth consolidating that power and wealth&quot; Honestly to me it doesn&#39;t make a difference, I try to move past labels if I can. I can see the deliberate attempts to divide people and it angers me when I see it working.  Things that divide people in horrible ways, the wealthy taking advantage of the poor, victim blaming, and just the value that has been placed in things other than eachother. </p>

<p>My anthropology class (grade 12 this year) summative was to &quot;design a utopia&quot; talking about various levels of government, social institutions, and come up with things like your national symbol, flag ect. </p>

<p>The presentations went as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Religeous people presented the idea that their religeon would keep their people orderly and taken care of. </p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;over-acheivers&quot; had a focus on post-secondary education and class systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of them included a high level of technology and almost no mention of civil liberties.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To be fair, I&#39;m sure these made sense to them, but I wonder about it. Is order overated? The society I came up with, was a primitive direct democracy with the only static institution was a judiciary branch that ensured the &quot;constitution&quot; was upheld. I wanted to be as close to anarchy without sounding crazy.</p>

<p>I remember being told about the &quot;8 degrees of separation&quot; that any person is connected to any other person in at most 8 other people. This gives me an image of humanity being an entity of it&#39;s own, where the whole is greater than the sum of all the parts. I want things to get better, I talk to people I know. Not about X issue or Y problem, but just enough to say &quot;I care about you, you&#39;re human&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m often jaded, and it bothers my family when I am so cynical so young, but honestly nothing is going to change if we don&#39;t talk about problems, I know I&#39;m probably preeching to the choir here at r/conspiracy, but quite frankly I find it a lot easier to bounce ideas here than other subreddits.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong>:I&#39;ve learned alot, Wars are bad, schemes are being used deliberately to dumb down, and separate people. We need eachother, and can help eachother</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> When I was talking about the Illuminati I wasn&#39;t saying they did or did not exist, as I said some things are pretty clear as far as I know, others are..fuzzy, I&#39;m still researching and developing an opinion. I find symbols and the occult interesting, but haven&#39;t found much on either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am over 50 years old now. I have been politically aware since a young age. I have paid attention to politics most of my life. Since the day of 9/11/2001 I have delved deeply into all of this. Spending great amounts of time asking questions and doing my own research. Four years I ago I finally accepted that two entities drive everything.</p>

<p><strong>Number One, the Rothschild&#39;s Banking Dynasty.</strong> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general79/tril.htm">http://www.rense.com/general79/tril.htm</a> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rothschild.com/">http://www.rothschild.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>Number Two, the Zionist Political Movement.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/zionism/whatis.cfm">http://www.jewsagainstzionism.com/zionism/whatis.cfm</a> </p>

<p>Just about everything else revolves around or is driven by these systems and movements. You have to understand the synergistic nature and history of these two powerful entities. The term Illuminati is quite intentionally vague. The leaders at the very top of the Rothschilds Zionist Movement are those people IMO. They are not unknown, but very few are privy to their actual plans. We certainly see this play out before us. They do control banking, media and governments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There absolutely is an Illuminati, it&#39;s just not what people often make it out to be.  It&#39;s not an all encompassing &quot;organization&quot;.  Like Anonymous it&#39;s an idea, but an idea quite the opposite.  The idea that an enlightened few (illuminated) SHOULD control the world.  Many different ideas conspire, more then people conspire.  The NWO is something we are all working to bring about (unless you are 100% happy with the current situation and want nothing to change, then you&#39;re an idiot).  </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve delved very far into the Illuminati myth then I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve come across the occult/Lucifarian/esoteric nature of the myth.  It&#39;s easy to completely ignore this aspect if you&#39;re coming from a non-Christian point of view, but this ignores the reality of belief.  There are circles, often not in direct communication, that work towards the same ends because they have similar belief structures.  The Eye of Horus is the prime example.  No occult symbol (occult = hidden meaning) brings a certain type of like-minded people together like this symbol.  Money, Power, Domination, ilLuminescence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can not provide you authority high enough to believe anything. Nor can anyone else. After all, authority is for those who cannot think for themselves. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/dystopian">Dystopian</a> chose his words very carefully revealing the true nature of these things. If you really must know, then yes, there is a undeniable mutiny against those who rule with irrationality, greed and selfishness. You being here means that you are most likely part of that mutiny. From all that which I have come to appreciate and respect, the ideas of the wise and humble are those which coinside most with my own. Even without a spoken word, I&#39;ve always known that I am not alone. For some of us finding likewise indiduals is a search of a lifetime. Under the symbols and ideas people find one another to share what weights they carry in their hearts and minds. Illuminati is one such symbol among many. How much their ideas and inner worlds coinside with mine I cannot tell, but so far based on authentic historical records and modern writings that I have come by, they are all good in my books.</p>

<p>It only makes sense, right? People in power are naturally going to socialize with ones within their network like anyone else (school, work, profession).

    <div class="md"><p>This is a brilliant post man. Enjoyed every word as I think myself and a growing number of young people (22yrs) are now discovering to a greater degree the built in infrastructure of deception and manipulation that has a grasp on this world. It does sound cynical, your right, but this is not the intension which is important to remember. I am learning each day to be more involved in the world around me, and that has led me to become more involved in ideas like the ones you talk about, such as a sort of &#39;collective consciousness&#39; . I am sure this is not something achieved easily and has to be worked towards. Maybe that is where we are as a species now. I always admired animals in their ability to live in harmony with other species. We as a species don&#39;t seem to even be able to achieve basic level of harmony with ourselves. I am growing more and more weary about where we are headed in the next decade or so. From what I see around me, I can&#39;t be too hopeful, but it is not our job to wear a smile when things are clearly turning to shit at the fault of the greedy and indifferent and at the expense of the weak and unfortunate. I think one of the problems is that the class system has led the poor to feel hopeless, the middle classes to feel apathetic despite their awareness of existing problems and this is a self perpetuating system and is designed to be so. After reading Orwell&#39;s 1984, I began to join the dots. Also Michael Ruppert&#39;s Collapse got me thinking. I believe there is still hope, but its a collective consciousness (arguably the internet) that will help us achieve an equilibrium with the world around us. I also like the &#39;GOD&#39; acronym. Whether your own or not, its very clever! </p>

<p>I used to think like that. It kinda started from me listening to David Icke. That line of thinking is all bad. It&#39;s how the Illuminati want you to think. They place disinfo agents that misdirect anyone that wants to find out out the conspiracy. The &#39;collective consciousness&#39; is all bullshit dude. In Alice Bailey&#39;s Externalization of the Hierarchy, a book by an occultist with ties to the Illuminati, she outlines what the New World religion will be and how they will get there. They plan is to basically fuck  shit up so bad, that we will be guided to form a new religion based on New Age bullshit, so that people will believe that catastrophes (that they caused) will never happen again. The New Age religion is basically Satanism in disguise. <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/externalisation/exte1173.html">Here</a> is an excerpt from The Externalization of the Hierarchy. If you scroll down until you see the numbered points, you can get a feel for what they want decieve people into believing. And if you have the time please watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApNJ153Q5kM">this video</a>. please watch it</p>
