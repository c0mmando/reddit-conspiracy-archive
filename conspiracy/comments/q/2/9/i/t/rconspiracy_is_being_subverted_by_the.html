    <div class="md"><p>Average Jews fall into this category as well, I would imagine.  Most Jews in Israel are Ashke<em>nazi</em> converts anyway, descending from Kazar (although they would likely refute this and call it anti-semetic) with no clue of their Talmudic religion&#39;s Egyptian roots.  As ironic as this is, I would argue that average Jews are also expendable.  The Holocaust should be evidence of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you want us all to be like Alex Jones, and call the wealthy bankers &quot;banksters&quot; and &quot;globalists&quot; instead of Jews, which almost all of them are? Do you want us to criticize the wealthy elite who control the media, without pointing out that they are predominantly Jewish wealthy elite? I don&#39;t see that as honest. The Illuminati are a fiction -- they don&#39;t exist. Jews, on the other hand, do exist. They are at the heart of the New World Order. They own and control the federal government in Washington. They control the media. They control the money supply and the banks and Wall Street. They write the laws and control the courts. Are we supposed to pretend we don&#39;t know this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read, the history of Judeo-Christianity <em>is</em> at the centre of the conspiracy.  By way of Egypt, Rome and Britain, this establishment has concocted its religious fiction from solar monotheism: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNiseVtlXHQ">The Cult of Aton</a>.</p>

<p>The pharaoh <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten">Ahkenaten</a> (Amenhotep IV) pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty and so called &quot;father of monotheism&quot; was likely a descendent of the Hyksos &quot;shepard kings&quot; who were eventually expelled.  Ahmed Osmond, Mustafa Gadalla, Ralph Ellis and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_and_Monotheism">Sigmund Freud</a> wrote about this expulsion and its &quot;coincidental&quot; line up with the Exodus of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>The gnosis of the mystery schools established in Egypt was eventually bastardized, cannibalized and plagiarized by the levitical mythmongerers of their time.  They infiltrated Rome, Britain, etc... and the Americas, while leaving traces of their royal heraldry behind.  The Union Jack for example, I believe is representative of King <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaqub-Har">Yaqub-her</a>, the Biblical Jacob, who dreamt of a ladder to Heaven while sleeping on a stone.  This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_of_Scone">stone of destiny</a> just so happens to sit underneath the coronation chair of the Queen of England by the way.</p>

<p>There are so many overlapping themes and personages of similar gods from a mass variety of ancient indigenous civilizations that worshipped the sun, moon and stars.  Whoever the upper echelon of today&#39;s ruling elite actually are, whether Illuminati, Free Mason, Royalty or Zionist, I believe their allegiance is to the ancient Egyptian solar cult of Aton, which is essentially modern Judeo-Christianity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, no, there isn&#39;t. This is because all this information you hear and read about how biblical concepts are actually metaphors for the sun etc. is all made up and based on incredibly contrived interpretations of things. Same thing with the supposed parallels between Jesus and earlier mythological figures, totally invented, no truth to it at all. There&#39;s all this talk about how supposedly this god resurrected, so and so had 12 disciples, blah blah had a virgin birth etc. but none of it has any basis in reality at all and is a joke to anyone who knows any history. The fact is there&#39;s a lot of this stuff being planted out there to make conspiracy researchers believe it on purpose when the evidence is sketchy as fuck. Discovering this was a real turning point for me in my investigations into this stuff. If you don&#39;t believe me I encourage you to search for things like &quot;Zeitgeist Challenge&quot; because there are a bunch of different people out there offering enormous cash rewards to anyone who can find historical evidence of any of these bullshit claims you&#39;re talking about. If you&#39;re so certain they&#39;re legitimate then go get that money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, yah there is.  We can go back and forth all you want, but there <em>is</em> history connecting solar cult worship to Judeo-Christianity. </p>

<p>Akhenaten fathered Egyptian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten#Akhenaten_and_Judeo-Christian_monotheism">monotheism</a>, imposing his god (Aten/Aton) in the form of a <strong>solar</strong> disk.  Read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hymn_to_the_Aten#Hymn">Hymn To Aten</a>.  Is this not a connection?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>rofl. Why would that be a connection? Because the number of gods is the same? If you look at any of the claims about the link between Judaism and Akhenaten monotheism on that wiki you will see yourself they are unsubstantial. Also what does the disk or the solar connection have to do with anything? Because neither of those elements have any presence in Judaism so that kind of just kills your case. Doesn&#39;t it? I think it does.....?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think again.  The relationship between Akhenaten and the Biblical Moses shows an obvious connection between solar cult monotheism and Judeo-Christianity.</p>

<p>A lot of authors who&#39;ve studied the material more than you or I, including Freud, Ahmed Osman, Ralph Ellis and Moustafa Gadalla would disagree that these claims are &quot;unsubstantial&quot; -but I&#39;m sure you know better, don&#39;t you?  I think you don&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol oooookay buddy. Considering there is no relationship between Akhenaten and Moses, it&#39;s just speculation a few people have made. I&#39;m glad you think the names who looked into this stuff makes it &quot;substantial&quot; while the absence of evidence plays no role whatsoever though, you must hear all kinds of cool things from all kinds of &quot;experts.&quot; The fact is this information is fringe -- a few people have made propositions about it, while no actual data supports it. Even a brief look at the wiki you cited yourself makes this perfectly clear and apparently you just want to ignore it. You&#39;re free to choose to believe anything you like, whatever, but I can&#39;t accept that as a valid argument, sorry.</p>

To say &quot;there is no relationship between Akhenaten and Moses&quot; is up for debate.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right it doesn&#39;t specifically phrase it that way but the article does make it clear the speculations are strictly speculations, the absence of supporting data in the story is visible just from reading it and the propositions are just mentioned as quotes and ideas people came up with rather than facts. I agree it&#39;s debatable there&#39;s no relationship between Akhenaten and Moses, we might never know, it&#39;s true, but the fact that there&#39;s no evidence to support the existence of the relationship, that part really isn&#39;t up for debate. Either way though who the fuck knows, I can&#39;t say I blame you or anyone for forming your own ideas since so much of the mainstream is worthless. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to argue those ideas in the same way you would if they were established facts. Peace!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The CIA/FBI knew about the attack days, weeks before they happened. Why don&#39;t you say that instead of &quot;the Jews?&quot; That&#39;s not ruling out that someone belonging to those inept organizations cared enough to inform at least someone about the impending and preventable attacks. And Jews, as you may be aware, seem drawn to many more scholarly-type professions (for whatever reasons; largely I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s cultural). One of the theories about the Exodus from Egypt goes that they were &quot;wage-slaves&quot; as opposed to Canaanite(absolute)-type slaves, and that the Egyptians wanted them back because they fulfilled many necessary roles in their society. But I digress. Want to become a judge or a doctor or a lawyer or a banker? It&#39;s not easy - just saying.</p>

<p>So whoever was behind 9/11 (and I&#39;m going to go with Islamic terrorists for now, along with USA government agencies&#39; ineptitude), to blame it on the Jews doesn&#39;t really hold water.</p>

<p>And Jews don&#39;t sacrifice the goat to Satan... or they&#39;d be Satanists, not Jews. But I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s what the winky is for, just making sure I have it covered in case you were serious about that part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t just become a doctor with money, it takes a degree of skill and knowledge usually. Unless you buy your degree, which has happened, and with disastrous consequences, but that&#39;s fraud, plain and simple, and isn&#39;t limited to doctors lawyers etc. and in fact is probably more rare as the potential for being caught is greater. But this is getting to be more of a digression than I planned...</p>

<p>2nd part: you can blame it on aliens if you want, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true or likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, &quot;some&quot; Jews probably are Satanists. &quot;Some&quot; humans are Satanists then. Does it then follow that <em>all</em> humans are Satanists? So then what&#39;s your point?</p>

<p>And Satanism usually refers to, yes, <em>devil</em> worship, so I hope you&#39;ll understand my confusion. Moreover, for Jews who subscribe to their religion, worshiping anything besides God would be a heresy, punishable by burning (the worst kind of death penalty) back in the day.</p>

<p>And yes, the sabbath is celebrated on the 7th day of the week, Saturday, but there are tons of other things than the Saturnian cult that you could also correlate with Saturdays. And that &quot;some&quot; Jews do subscribe to this cult, again, doesn&#39;t mean even &quot;most&quot; of them do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just trying to be a smart ass I guess.  Of course there&#39;s confusion.  Could be on purpose, especially if you accept the traditional definition of &quot;Satan&quot; to be some devil in a place called &quot;Hell&quot;.  </p>

<p>Some argue the initiates of the mystery schools, familiar with solar and stellar cult worship (namely Saturn) included the levites of early Talmudism.  The hexagon on the north pole of Saturn is kinda cool and given the hexagram to be an ancient symbol of Hinduism, it might suggest both religions share a connection.  Who the fuck knows?  I&#39;m not even sure Saturnian cult worship is an &quot;evil&quot; thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea about most of this stuff. The Jews do use a lunar calendar in part. But all the same, I just think of it as a rather roundabout way to do analysis of the religion, unless you specifically are looking for connections between various ones, which is actually an interesting question (there are in fact some Jewish/Kabballistic Yoga publications, which are rather neat if you&#39;re into that sort of thing).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh.  I&#39;ll have to look into that, thanks.  Further analysis of the religion and it&#39;s origin might just leave you with more unanswered questions.  The Bible isn&#39;t exactly a reliable account of Jewish history, but reading between the lines, you might pick up on a whole different story altogether.  </p>

<p>Usually does :-D</p>

<p>All the same I find it fascinating, at the least because of the amount of detail that&#39;s contained therein. If it&#39;s all myth, then it&#39;s odd they&#39;d devote so many man-hours to teasing apart the details of such specific religious branchings of laws regarding real-estate, finances, loan liability, etc. etc. And if it&#39;s based on some actual encounter with God Himself then the interest really requires no justification. Either way, it&#39;s an interesting subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scapegoat is the poor goat the precursors to the Jews heaped all their collective sins upon, before leading it out into the wilderness and letting it wander off a cliff, as an offering to an evil spirit of the wilderness similar to the Christian Satan. That&#39;s right, they used misdirection to escape the consequences of their crimes, by making an innocent animal the victim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So glossing over the exact details of the Yom Kippur ritual that would have been observed back when they still routinely offered animal sacrifices:</p>

<p>On Yom Kippur a/the priest of the Jews would have confessed, over the live goat, the sins of Israel, &quot;putting them on the head of the goat,&quot; and the goat would be escorted by someone out to the wilderness, and thereby carry the Jews&#39; transgressions to &quot;an inaccessible region.&quot; The goat would be set free, in the wilderness, carrying off the sins of Israel.</p>

<p>Pretty sure this is where the term originated, but please double-check the etymology.</p>

<p>Edit: Why the fuck would you downvote this? You got an axe to grind with me? Be a man or woman or whatever you are and come out and address the inaccuracies/impertinence of this post. This is pretty much taken straight out of Jewish scripture. Fucking pussy cunt whore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>rofl. Why would that be a connection? Because the number of gods is the same? If you look at any of the claims about the link between Judaism and Akhenaten monotheism on that wiki you will see yourself they are unsubstantial. Also what does the disk or the solar connection have to do with anything? Because neither of those elements have any presence in Judaism so that kind of just kills your case. Doesn&#39;t it? I think it does.....?</p>
