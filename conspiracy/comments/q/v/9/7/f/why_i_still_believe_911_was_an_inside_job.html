        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll try to keep this brief. Despite all the evidence about fire temperatures and melting point of steel - or the lack of wreckage found from United 93 - or Air Force fighters being ordered to fly the wrong way - and why they needed to bring down WTC 7 - the thing that has stuck out for me from the very beginning has been that crappy 2 frames per second clip of the &quot;plane&quot; hitting the pentagon..I mean, in 2001 I could walk down to the local shopping center and see no less than 1-3 cameras watching all the angles of every shop. Now i&#39;m gonna just assume that the Pentagon - the Hub of our complete military and defense forces - has ONE, 2 fps camera pointed at the spot it was hit. Not ONE other camera exists that can clearly show a plane, approaching or hitting from a better angle. Yeah right.....</p>

<p>TL;DR Pentagon must have more than one crappy 2fps camera watching the most important building to our military.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;A better explanation is that the so-called &quot;911 Truth&quot; movement won&#39;t admit that in 2004 Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to force the FBI to release the video tapes related to Flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon, that they won the lawsuit, and that camera footage from the Pentagon security cameras, the CITGO gas station and the Doubletree Hotel were released and <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/cases/judicial-watch-v-federal-bureau-of-investigation-no-06-1135/">posted online</a>....  because it might &quot;confuse&quot; the public.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Which <em>really</em> <strong>really</strong> reads to the average joe scanning the thread as if the tapes <em>were</em> released and show something the truthers <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> want to see when that <strong>is not the case</strong> in the slightest.   Your comment was highly misleading which is why I called you out at all.  But it seems you can&#39;t keep track of the many trolling arguments you are active in under this account by your complete inability to actually read and comprehend all I have typed to you.  So I&#39;ll put my efforts elsewhere.</p>

<p>But first</p>

<p>The Pentagon is one of the most heavily monitored and guarded buildings that is publicly known.  Only a fool would believe that there are only 4 videos in existence that have any hint of action from that day on them.</p>

<p>....by virtue of having a whole lot of trained soldiers in it.  I expext that there were cameras at the entrances.  Indeed, one captured the jet hitting the building.  I expect that <strong>now</strong> there are cameras everywhere.  But before 2001, there wouldn&#39;t have been any motivation to record acres and acres of lawn to VHS tapes.</p>

<p>Suppose in 1995 you were tasked to do what you demand:  Instead of just cameras at the entrances or check points, you&#39;re to record the entire 285 acre site (minus the 30 acres of the Pentagon itself), in case North Korean troops or Islamic militants come charging across the lawn or parking lot.</p>

<p>Or to be more serious, you&#39;re responding to more likely security issues like vandalism, parking lot accidents and protesters.  In which case you&#39;ll need to record faces and license plates.</p>

<p>On a 285 acre site you&#39;re talking about hundreds of cameras at a minimum to be effective, just putting them in a few key places.</p>

<p>But YOU want it all recorded.  So factor in hundreds of VHS tapes being replaced every 8 hours.  (This being a few years before 2001.)</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t bother.  For threats like North Korean troops or Islamic militants or spray-can-wielding protesters charging across the lawn, you rely on your building full of trained soldiers.  Because as you say, &quot;it&#39;s the god damned pentagon.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will grant that it is possible that there are in fact very few recordings of what happened.  But how do you account for the assertions made in this thread that the tapes are obviously doctored in that even with low quality security cameras the plane would be traveling at 33 feet per frame and would be visable for more than the one frame where there is some white spot on the right</p>

<p>A Noble Lie does a damn good job of backing up it&#39;s claims, that being among them.  I don&#39;t have a link on hand but I know the documentation to back this up exists.  Go watch it </p>

<p>&quot;Trentadue said he is seeking more tapes along with a variety of bombing-related documents from the FBI and the CIA. An FOIA request by Trentadue for 26 CIA documents was rejected in June. A letter from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which reviewed the documents, said their release &quot;could cause grave damage to our national security.&quot;</p>

<p>Some tapes have been released, but once again, not <em>all</em> of the tapes, and the rest of the info is being held back</p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m asking for.  Where is the evidence that a plane hit the Pentagon that I&#39;ve apparently already dismissed?  I haven&#39;t seen any thus far.  I&#39;ve read the 9-11 commission report, so if that&#39;s the &quot;evidence&quot; you&#39;re referring to, then of course you&#39;d understand why I don&#39;t see that as evidence but rather as a narrative that the government was pushing.</p>

<p>In terms of evidence, I&#39;m talking about video of a plane hitting the most important military building of the world&#39;s largest military power.  Why should anything less than a video like that be accepted as evidence?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because what you are doing is assuming that this video exists and then hinging everything on that assumption. What is your evidence that it should exist? I doubt you have any except that &quot;it just should because it&#39;s the pentagon&quot;.</p>

<p>What type of camera and in what position are you expecting to see clear footage of a plane going 530 mph into the building? I guess if there was a camera 1 mile away 400 feet in the air pointed at the impact zone you might catch it. Seriously consider what expectations you are setting and then ask yourself if they are reasonable.</p>

<p>Do you dismiss the witnesses who saw the plane fly into the Pentagon?</p>

Get it from your library, read it, check the sources and let me know if you find any discrepancies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your last couple replies to me were jam-packed with a great many long-debunked claims and straw-man arguments.  You use the common troofer tactic of shotgunning people with so many all-accusation-no-evidence claims that few people will take the time to respond to all of them.  Should anyone try, you simply dismiss what they say and shotgun them with a bunch more claims.  You convince people that you&#39;re not worth responding to, and no doubt use the lack of response as &quot;proof&quot; that you&#39;re right.</p>

<p><strong>You</strong> are the one who mindlessly believes what Faux News says.  Along with, obviously, drinking the Alex Jones Kool-Aid and taking the WorldNetDaily lobotomy.  As mentioned above, you use their tactics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What part of the official WTC propaganda lies do you not support? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not so much the lies, as what the questions they refused to answer.</p>

<p>I can give you a long list of - not just warnings, but examples - of known pre-9/11terrorist plots to use hijacked airliners as weapons.</p>

<p>Warnings about Bin Laden are known to have reached the White House.  Some of the title have been released:</p>

<p>&quot;Bin Ladin Public Profile May Presage Attack&quot; (5/3/01)</p>

<p>&quot;Bin Ladin&#39;s Networks&#39; Plans Advancing&quot; (5/26/01)</p>

<p>&quot;Bin Ladin Attacks May Be Imminent&quot; (6/23/01)</p>

<p>&quot;Bin Ladin and Associates Making Near-Term Threats&quot; (6/25/01)</p>

<p>&quot;Bin Ladin Planning High-Profile Attacks&quot; (6/30/01)</p>

<p>&quot;Planning for Bin Ladin Attacks Continues, Despite Delays&quot; (7/02/01)</p>

<ul>
<li>subject lines of Richard Clarke emails to Bush Administration prior to 9/11/01</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;You know, Dick Clarke. Dick Clarke, who was the head of the counterterrorism program in the run-up to 9/11. He obviously missed it.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Dick Cheney, on Richard Clarke</li>
</ul>

<p>Consider that Clinton getting a BJ was declared to be of vital importance to national security by the Republicans. They did everything but demand that he get re-blown on the Senate floor. (&quot;We must know exactly what happened!!!) Everything had to be done in public and under oath, and every word published.</p>

<p>Not so with 9/11, when they investigated what warnings the President received.</p>

<p>The White House wanted to limit any appearance by the president to just one hour spent with two of the commissioners. Bush II did eventually meet with the Commission, but only under stringent conditions: Bush had to have Dick Cheney at his side, testifying at the same time; testimony was given in private and <strong>NOT UNDER OATH;</strong> no press coverage was allowed; and no recordings or transcripts were made of what they said.</p>

<p>Do you believe, even for an instant, that there isn&#39;t some damning piece of evidence they kept unpublished?</p>

<p>When you hear endless claims of hundreds of thousands of people signing &quot;_____ for 9/11 Truth&quot; petitions, <strong>that&#39;s</strong> what they&#39;re signing for.  A better investigation into what warnings the White House ignored, not your hyper-stupid controlled demolition wingnuttery.</p>

<p>But this is where YOU come in.  Any time someone demands a better investigation, Alex Jones sounds the nutbar clarion call and his legion of gullible wankers rises up to smother the issue in wingnuttery.  Anyone who asks legitimate, important questions gets grouped in with them - a chilling effect on speech if ever there was one.</p>

<p>I want you to fully understand your role here.  It goes like this:  Alex Jones is the organ grinder, playing a song called &quot;Milk the conspiracy theorists for money.&quot;  You are the little monkey in a bright red hat hopping up and down and acting silly for our amusement.  Your secondary role is to serve as a warning:  &quot;Ask REAL questions and this is how we&#39;ll make you look.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, you&#39;re right. </p>

<p>Boeing 757&#39;s (supposed Pentagon plane) top speed is about 600mph, cruising speed 540 mph*:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.757.org.uk/757/specifications.html">http://www.757.org.uk/757/specifications.html</a></p>

<p>almost every commercial camera in existence records video at 24fps.  assuming the plane was going at maximum speed, that comes out to 33 feet per frame  for the cruising speed (lower as the camera gets better - and this is the Pentagon we&#39;re talking about, in the year 2001).  that is, of course, assuming that the massive turning procedure that the pilot had just done did not manage to degrade the cruising speed at all.</p>

<p>here&#39;s that video:</p>

<p><a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/pentagon%20impact%20video%20gif/myphotos1960/911-pentagon-official-video.gif">http://media.photobucket.com/image/pentagon%20impact%20video%20gif/myphotos1960/911-pentagon-official-video.gif</a></p>

<p>the Pentagon is 88 feet tall, meaning we easily have 370 feet across the lawn in that picture, going right from the point of impact.</p>

<p>so, to resolve this glaring conflict, apparently, they chose a camera that takes video at <em>one frame per two seconds</em>?  </p>

<p>geez, you&#39;d think they&#39;d have sprung for a Camcorder, and some Hi-8 tapes.  what with the 2.3 trillion dollars that Rumsfeld announced was missing from the military budget <em>the day before</em>:</p>

<p>Two fps camera angles are not going to cut it. If the gov&#39;t actually cared about sharing truth to quell counter cultural conspiracy theorizing, they would provide conclusive data. The data from the pentagon&#39;s cameras at the very least must exist. If the gov&#39;t wanted to capitalize off of society&#39;s relationship with it, it would be obvious to them to be transparent about these critical long standing myths. The bs they stand behind in statement and rhetoric and dismissal is an insult to every damn citizen. Those who ad hominum dismiss &quot;truthers&quot; are not being any more rational than they accuse truthers of not being. </p>

<p>Scientific thinking requires data. Scientific thinking has proved that specific data should exist. Scientific thinking has provided valid questions, such as those listed above. The gov&#39;t is not providing the data, and developing strategies to avoid doing so. How is that not a conspiracy?</p>

The USA has confiscated every video that would show the plane hitting the Pentagon for reasons of National Security or whatever.
The only reason we have access to those 2 frames was because of public interest. In other words they HAD to release something because as you said, it is unlikely that no cameras would have captured the incident.</p>

<p>I once heard somebody say when evidence confirms the official statement they release it, but if not they mark it as conspiracy bullshit or keep it because of some Security issues ect. 
You get the direction i am going.</p>

<p>bottom line.. no plane hit the pentagon.. geometrically the hole created wouldn&#39;t even fit a boeing 757. it was too small.. there was no large pieces of aircraft.. no engines.. no tail pieces.. no nothing! just little pieces that could have been lifted by 1 person.</p>

<p>Considering the US GOV said they could never have imagined such a scenario ever happening, why did they drill for it on that same day?
clearly they did imagine it happening, since it was in the drill.</p>

<p>What purpose does it serve? Scrambling jets, who all thing its a drill.. so they don&#39;t respond as if its real life.. same with the controllers of the war game, they thought it was all a fake war game..so they didn&#39;t respond how they would have been trained to respond.</p>

<p>HAHA WRONG.. only a few floors were on fire, the fire had been well extinguished HOURS before the building collapsed. the rescue workers and firefighters had already been out of the building for 3 hours before silverstein made the &quot;PULL IT&quot; remark.. which by the way is a demolition term.
the building was not in terrible shape and was the 3rd building in HISTORY to ever collapse from fire.. the first two being buildings 1 and 2, which all three defied physics and collapsed perfectly into their own footprint in free fall speed.. something architects and engineers all say is 100% impossible</p>

<p>bush claiming he saw the first plane hit
He was just an idiot and a liar.</p>

<p>are you a pilot? cuz I AM.. and controlling an aircraft and aiming into a building (pentagon) and pulling those maneuvers take an extremely skilled pilot..</p>

<p>Sure flying a small single engine aircraft and hitting a building would be the equivalent to a small car hitting a building.</p>

<p>a 757 is quite difficult to fly and doesn&#39;t turn on a dime. yet the supposed path the plane that hit the pentagon took was an extreme move that even the most skilled military pilots say they couldn&#39;t really pull off. the bottom line, you have no idea what it take to fly a twin engine jet aircraft.. let alone a large airliner. </p>

<p>NOTHING makes sense.. its all lies 
You&#39;re right, lies made up by manipulative assholes to sell conspiracy books to people like you.</p>

<p>yah total lies.. the passport didn&#39;t really magically fly out of the &quot;terrorists&quot; pockets. through a 1000 degree explosion, through an airplane, out of a building and perfectly in tact on the streets below to be found by the FBI in order to identify the terrorist LOL</p>

<p>and were all lying about the buildings collapsing in free fall speed into their own footprint.. being the first 3 buildings in history to ever collapse like that due to fire or structural damage.</p>

<p>and were lying about Rumsfeld telling the US that 2.3 trillion are missing from the pentagon on sept 10, 2001.. and then magically a &quot;plane&quot; flys into the side of the building that those records were held in</p>

<p>and were totally making up the fact that there are no videos of the &quot;terrorist&quot; at the airports boarding the planes.. or videos of the plane hitting the pentagon..</p>

<p>man we just make shit up.. why am i not believing the government.. they are soooo right. their story makes so much sense..</p>

<p>i should ignore the fact that they didn&#39;t put the collapse of building 7 into the  commission report. </p>

<p>I should also pretend 640 million in silver and gold bars didn&#39;t get unloaded from one of the trade center buildings that morning by brinks trucks..</p>

<p>lets pretend silverstein didn&#39;t take out a HUGE insurance policy just months before this happened and specifically included &quot;terrorism&quot;</p>

<p>Lets also pretend george bush&#39;s brother didn&#39;t run the security firm in charge of the trade center up until the day before..
or the fact that they had been cordoning off sections of the buildings in the months prior, and removed all explosive sniffing dogs..</p>

<p>there was no thermite residue was there? nahhh we just made that up</p>

<p>The commission report was about events leading up to 9/11, not about the buildings so it make sense that 7 wasn&#39;t included.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>only a few floors were on fire, the fire had been well extinguished HOURS before the building collapsed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More lies.  Building 7 was reported on fire just 1 hour before it collapsed.  The first was never extinguished and if it was that would have been a dead giveaway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scrambling jets, who all thing its a drill.. so they don&#39;t respond as if its real life</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t even make any sense.  First of all, there were no jets following the plans like you claim.  Second, fighter pilots follow orders in the air, they don&#39;t just make judgement calls so it wouldn&#39;t matter if they thought it was a drill or not, they were trained to follow a mission plan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>something architects and engineers all say is 100% impossible</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean a very very small percentage of architects and engineers?  That&#39;s right, it sounds more reputable if you leave that out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>are you a pilot? cuz I AM</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, you&#39;re barely literate.</p>

<p>So basically what you&#39;re saying is reporters, firefighters, brinks workers, insurance agents, building security, and most of the US government were all in on it?  Must be hard to keep thousands of people quiet about one of the most significant events in modern history.</p>

<p>Well you already said the media was in on it.  The firefighters would have to be in on it because according to you they already put out the fire and watching the building fall down afterwards.

<p>buildings don&#39;t collapse into their own footprint.</p>

<p>Obviously they do, since that&#39;s what happened.  Or are you saying building don&#39;t do that when hit with planes?  Do you have other examples to compare against?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>forget the fact that upon arrival to the first tower, the fire department noted the entire lobby looked as if a bomb had gone off..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another point that makes no sense.  If the buildings were taken down by bombs then how would the building still be standing after the bomb went off?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so tell me genius.. look at this photo.. why didn&#39;t this building collapse into its own footprint?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it&#39;s a different fucking building!  Not all buildings are build the same and can withstand the same amount of damage?</p>

<p>You&#39;re arguments lead me to believe you&#39;re either a massive troll or just massively stupid.  LOL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes i have many examples.. but show me 1 other building besides 1,2 and 7 that have collapsed into their own footprint..</p>

<p>In May 1988 a fire at the Interstate Bank Building in Los Angeles destroyed four floors and damaged a fifth floor of the modern 62-story building. The fire burned for four hours. The building did not collapse. </p>

<p>In February 1991 a fire gutted eight floors of the 38-story One Meridian Plaza building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The fire burned for 18 hours. The building did not collapse. </p>

<p>In October 2004 in Caracas, Venezuela, a fire in a 56-story office tower burned for more 17 hours and spread over 26 floors. Two floors collapsed, but the underlying floors did not, and the building remained standing. </p>

<p>In February 2005 there was another &quot;towering inferno&quot; in Taiwan. The fire burned for about an hour and a half, but the building never came close to collapsing.</p>

<p>in February 2005 the 32-story Windsor Building in Madrid, Spain, caught fire and burned for two days. The building was completely engulfed in flames at one point. Several top floors collapsed onto lower ones, yet the building remained standing.</p>

<p>The still-uncompleted Beijing Television Cultural Center, containing the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, caught fire on 9 February 2009 (due to uncontrolled use of fireworks at Chinese New Year). 140,000 tons of steel was used in its construction. It burned for five hours, but it did not collapse</p>

<p>WTC1 itself survived a serious fire in 1975. It started on the 11th floor and spread to six other floors, burning for three hours</p>

<p>this plane crashed into a building.. the building did not collapse</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-12/07/content_501143.htm">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-12/07/content_501143.htm</a></p>

<p>JULY 28th 1945 - a B25 bomber crashed into the empire state building. it did not collapse.</p>

<p>9/11 2001 a supposed plane crashed into the pentagon... it did not collapse</p>

<p>the planes that crashed into the WTC building, had fuel burn off almost instantly.. the heat of the fires reached 536 degrees... steel loses only
half its strength at 1100 degrees.. so SCIENTIFICALLY speaking.. the heat from the initial blast and concurrent fires could not have melted the steel.. and certainly not melt the steel all the way at the base of the building causing them to collapse.. 1 would have been an extreme scientific anomoly... but 3 buildings? 1 of which wasn&#39;t hit by a plane and had only minor fires which were well extinguished hours before it came crashing down.  </p>

<p>the buildings weren&#39;t taken down by &quot;BOMBS&quot;
explosives yes.. the explosions heard were most likely charges to start the process and weaken the lower structure, to prepare for the collapse.</p>

<p>you must have also forgot about the bombing at the wtc in the 90s.. the building didn&#39;t collapse then.</p>

<p>id like to hear your explanation of how the &quot;terrorists&quot;
 passport flew out of the pocket of a guy who was in a plane that blew up at 560 degrees after blasting through a steal building, then managed to fly out to the city streets below with no damage.</p>

<p>coincidence that the brother of george bush ran the security firm for wtc? and their contract ended 9/11/2001, and his team had been clearing out sections of the buildings in the weeks leading up to 9/11? this company also ran security for united airlines and dulles intl airport.. just a big coincidence..</p>

<p>again.. just a coincidence that norad was conducting exercises on 9/11 in which airplanes were hi-jacked and flown into the wtc and pentagon...</p>

<p>completely coincidence that fema was dispatched to NYC monday sept 10 2001</p>

<p>complete coincidence that SEVEAL key politicians received warnings the night before to cancel flights and not to fly on the morning of sept 11.</p>

<p>complete coincidence that BUSH&#39;s cousin was told not to attend a meeting in the towers thanks to a &quot;schedule change&quot; the night before.</p>

<p>complete coincidence that the fighter squadron who protects the pentagon building and area around DC was flown 180 miles away for a training mission that morning.. leaving DC with no air support.</p>

<p>complete coincidence that survivors in the towers reported hearing what sounded like multiple gunshots, followed by a big explosion, seconds before the building came toppling down into its own footprint
(indicative of ANY controlled demolition charges)</p>

<p>coincidence that fire dept LT william ryan, is on record saying that he and his team were told around 1pm that building 7 would be coming down around 3pm and were told to pull out.. WELLLLLLL before silverstein made the &quot;PULL IT&quot; remark.</p>

<p>pentagon employees reported smelling CORDITE at the crash scene </p>

<p>coincidence that rumsfeld announced trillions mission from pentagon the day before.. and those records happened to be stored in the JUST &quot;renovated&quot; section of the pentagon in which the &quot;plane&quot; hit.. oh and most employees were moved out of that section</p>

<p>9/11 commission reports president bush phone logs don&#39;t exist for 9/11</p>

<p>8 out of the 10 members of the 9/11 commission now say it was a LIE</p>

<p>your right.. your story/government (who has played out countless acts of false flag operations including operation northwoods which is extremely similar to the events of 9/11) is right..

<p>The last two images on <a href="http://educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=17627">this page</a> are proof enough:  The &quot;missile&quot; on your video comes from the wrong direction and hits in the wrong place, on the wrong side of the helipad.</p>

<p>As for the image in the video of a cruise missile with American Airlines stripes painted on it, <a href="http://theintelhub.com/2011/09/04/cruise-missle-hits-pentagon-video-is-at-least-partially-fake/">here it is before and after</a> some troofer photoshopped in the stripes.</p>

<p>The picture represented as the entry hole is actually an exit hole.</p>

<p>The missile claim also doesn&#39;t account for over 100 witnesses who saw an airliner strike the Pentagon.  It doesn&#39;t account for the 757 aircraft debris, or the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/sept01/2001-09-14-pentagon-usat.htm">human remains</a> from the passengers in the aircraft, found on the crash site by first responders?   (Yes, I know the troofer crowd claims the debris and remains weren&#39;t found, despite all evidence to the contrary.)  The video&#39;s missile direction doesn&#39;t account for the light poles knocked down in the other direction - in one instance coming down on a car whose passengers also saw the jetliner that knocked them down.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just waiting for the troofers to claim that the Pentagon doesn&#39;t exist.  It would be a much cleaner theory, without requiring any more denial of overwhelming evidence and eyewitnesses than they already use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that most conspiracy theory lies aren&#39;t based on outright fakery.  Most are wrapped around a kernal of truth.   (Yes, steel beams don&#39;t melt at 800 degrees.  But they DO lose well over half their structural strength.  Yes, the FBI confiscated tapes.  But they have since released them.  And I haven&#39;t seen a valid citation for the 50-80 tapes some claim.)</p>

<p>Others are based on the principle that when you make up a brand new claim, it has the advantage of not having been debunked.  For example the claim that &quot;no other steel framed building has collapsed due to fire alone.&quot;  Setting aside WTC7&#39;s massive structural damage even before the fire, now that &quot;911 truthers&quot; keep parrotting that claim, people have gone and looked.  And they&#39;ve found a growing number of examples of steel-framed structures having collapsed due to fire alone.</p>

<p>(My favorite:  The Delft University of Technology, Architecture School <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2010/06/hey_911_truthers_is_this_a_con.html">collapsed in a pancake reaction to a fire.</a>  &quot;Let me repeat that .... the School Of Architecture. I&#39;m highly doubtful they built a deficient building for themselves. Steel frame high rise building collapses and is utterly destroyed by a fire begun by a shorted out coffee pot.&quot;  <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=ff1_1210707903">Video</a>)</p>

<p>Flash is dying quickly, ever since the non-flash-supporting iPad and various smartphones became popular.  Even Adobe is moving to HTML5.  Which is good in most ways.  Except that programming in HTML5/Javascript really sucks.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  In 1997 three four story buildings at the Kader Toy Factoy in Singapore caught fire. All three collapsed from fire alone in under three hours.</p>

<p>The steel framed McCormick Center was at the time the World&#39;s largest exhibition center. It like the WTC used long steel trusses to create a large open space without columns. In 1976 it collapsed only 30 minutes after the start of a small electrical fire.</p>

<p>In 1997 the Sight and Sound Theater in Strasburg, Pennsylvania collapsed during a fire. It too used a rigid steel-frame construction.</p>

<p>In addition I REMEMBER the fire at the Interstate Bank Building in Los Angeles, long before 9/11. It made the news here in Winnipeg - during the fire - because of fears that it would collapse. They actually had a time limit that the building was rated for - how many minutes it was guarenteed to withstand a fire before the columns weakened to the point of collapse.</p>

<p>(Underwriters Laboratory does testing on <a href="http://www.nuconsteel.com/technical-data/ul-ratings.php">how long steel trusses will last before losing their structural strength</a>.  (<a href="http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=457">One</a> with a remarkable photo of steel beams and girders sagging after a fire.)</p>

<p>The 1991 One Meridian Plaza fire in Philadelphia was the same story. Firefighters evacuated the building when a pancake structural collapse was considered likely.  &quot;All interior firefighting efforts were halted after almost 11 hours of uninterrupted fire in the building. Consultation with a structural engineer and structural damage observed by units operating in the building led to the belief that there was a possibility of a pancake structural collapse of the fire damaged floors.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>steel beams ... DO lose well over half their structural strength [at 800 degrees]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the top ten statements marking 911 propaganda worshipers as morons or trolls. Like everything parroted by CBS NBC George Bush morons it is not even consistent with everyday experience. But it does mark you fools as thoroughly incompetent at every level.</p>

<p>Do this, tell us at what temperature the next halving of strucutral strength occur (I am mocking you here). The reason you can&#39;t is that physical response to changes in intrinsic qualities are exponential (to the level of the intrinsic quality) it is only humans, external observers, who might be tricked into thinking about linear responses, which is completely, stupid, well more ignorant than stupid. However not understanding everyday activities - metal not deforming at half-rate for every halving of the temperature, car and airplane engines maintaining thier physical integrity - that is is stupd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the FBI confiscated tapes. But they have since released them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another lie, one set of tapes has been returned, after legal action - children terrified of the truth. Provide a link to all of the released tapes. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen a valid citation for the&quot; tapes being returned, all of them </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WTC7&#39;s massive structural damage even before the fire</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Massive&quot; ? How did you decide that the proportion of the building that had been damaged was massive? Was it greater than WTC6 ?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Delft University of Technology, Architecture School .... [claim about collapse]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Poe faced lie, of course that is what you trolls do. In both the direct, nutty link - why are all 911 propaganda worshipers so nuts? - and in the page to which it links there is no mention of a pancake collapse, as you have typically lied. The building didn&#39;t even collapse, it was extensively damaged, it was occupied - not over half deserted like the WTC towers, and it had combustable materials as listed in the article - and of course no &quot;pancake collapse&quot;. Are you insane?</p>

<p>So, you trailer park living Dubya acolytes can get together with the internet and easily (and with out lies or insanity) tell us: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>the proportion of WTC7 that had been damaged before the demolition - massive? </p></li>
<li><p>a comparison to the damage with WTC6</p></li>
<li><p>Provide a link to all of the confiscated and now released tapes by the FBI</p></li>
<li><p>at what temperature the next halving of the strucutral strength of steel occurs (after &quot;800 C&quot; - you are insane, right?). Will you halve the difference, in celcius - no farinheit (sp?) or what every you second worlders use - between some insane figure (the maximum combustion temperature of kerosene under full oxygen supply conditions and the (non-insane) real melting point of structural steel?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that all of this, <strong>all of this</strong> you claim to already have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be really honest digital pictures do not degrade just because they are copies of copies . Every picture on the Intenet is a copy of a copy.</p>

<p>I have never seen any artifact that is anything  like this.</p>

<p>For these reasons I still think it&#39;s photoshopped.</p>

<p>The outlines are just that, outlines, unless you can show any other artifact such as this.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Just saving it to our HDs doesn&#39;t degrade an image, BUT if you take an already poor quality JPEG compressed image, do some &#39;processing&#39; on it (which, in the case of many &#39;armchair investigators&#39; means just applying some Photoshop filter) AND THEN saving it again as a compressed JPEG... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qexJZinohSY&amp;amp;feature=related">well, image starts deteriorating and then strange &#39;details&#39; start popping out</a> that the inexpert start to interpret as whatever you imagine.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not vouching for these or other images&#39; authenticity, my point is to be very cautious at taking whatever we see on an image as what we at first imagine to be. A skeptical viewer must consider all possibilities before jumping to conclusions, and when dealing with non-popular opinions, one has to be double cautious. </p>

<p>its all good.. keep believing some &quot;terrorist&quot; who happened to have been trained on US military Bases, and handed passports and papers from the US gov, managed to board planes where no surveillance videos existed, and take the planes with xacto knives, and magically fly them with the skills of washed out private pilot training</p>
