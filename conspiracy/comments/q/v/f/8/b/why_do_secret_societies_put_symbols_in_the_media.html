<p>Heck, that&#39;s why wannabe secret societies adopt them.  The &quot;all-seeing eye&quot; in the triangle - AKA the &quot;Eye of Providence&quot; - was a symbol of the Christian Trinity appearing on churches for a thousand years before the Freemasons started using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because a symbol has become widespread enough to have idiosyncratic meanings doesn&#39;t necessarily imply the kind of &quot;ambiguity&quot; that you&#39;re thinking of. </p>

<p>Different eyes will see different meanings in the same symbol. To some, the all seeing eye represents &quot;illumination&quot; or &quot;enlightenment&quot;, a sign of intellectual and moral superiority. To others, it may represent &quot;hierarchy&quot; or &quot;domination&quot; by some elite society or guiding hand of history. These two are but oversimplifications of complex philosophies/conspiracy theories, and neither is necessarily &quot;true&quot;, or rather, both are equally &quot;true&quot;. </p>

<p>There are many other interpretations out there, and the overall ambiguity in collective interpretations does not equal ambiguity in the eyes of the individual. For those who study this symbol on either side of the coin (from within, or without), one develops his own understanding of what it means. To oversimplify my own interpretation of the all-seeing eye, I believe that it is simply a symbol/meme which generates and perpetuates opposed binaries of categorization (good vs evil, enlightened vs ignorant, empowered/powerless, male/female etc) which is exactly the kind of metasystem that our socially constructed world is built upon. </p>

Sacred geometry and images like this work because they are mathematically pleasing to everyone... just like Bartok and Beethoven sounds good to everyone because they employ the rules of the golden ratio. You can look at the picture for years, but you don&#39;t know anything more about what it means than anyone else, because guess what, it&#39;s all subjective.

    <div class="md"><p>I guess you didn&#39;t actually read my comment, because I don&#39;t see where the disagreement is. Unless your reply is not actually a reply, and you&#39;re just talking for the sake of pedagogy. The unprovoked hostility in the tone of your reply makes me assume that you&#39;re just interpreting my explanation however you wish because you want a straw man to defeat (I think they call that trolling?). But, if you wish to engage in discourse, I&#39;ll humbly share my knowledge. </p>

<p>I agree with what you&#39;re saying, my comment above agrees with what you&#39;re saying. Nowhere did I suggest there is a &quot;nefarious group of conspirators&quot;, but rather, I suggested the complete opposite. I am clearly stating that there is a MULTIPLICITY of interpretations, and while it is AMBIGUOUS in the GENERAL sense, it is DEFINITE in the SPECIFIC mind. </p>

<p>A potent symbol is a potent symbol, and as someone who studies linguistics and semiotics in particular, these things are interesting to me for obvious reasons. It&#39;s not about determining the agenda of some nefarious group (which I don&#39;t believe in, at least, not in the CT sense), but rather, learning about the process of socially constructed perceptions in order to gain insight for real life applications. </p>

<p>Everyone wastes their life however they want, I waste mine studying symbolic networks and production of &quot;meaning&quot;. These are all basic concepts that are foundational to the cultural industries (arts, media and lifestyle marketing/advertising etc), and my interest in these things have nothing to do with wanting to figure out the &quot;nefarious global agenda&quot;... it has EVERYTHING to do with furthering my own agenda and the agenda of those I care about, which often comes down to simply using these concepts to do our job and support ourselves with $$$, doing what we love.</p>

<p>A symbol is a symbol. You could easily take the all seeing eye and swap it with the yin/yang symbol or the nike swoosh and what I&#39;m saying would still be relevant. But I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not operating in the culture industry so you see it as a waste of time. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a complex but fascinating topic and I can elaborate more because I believe in open discourse benefiting all parties, but only if we can carry on with a more respectful tone. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m getting from this is that you are certain that the symbol of eyes is indicative of the involvement of a secret society, despite the fact that nobody can even agree on what it&#39;s supposed to mean?</p>

<p>And what I mean by ambiguous is not the meaning of the symbol, it&#39;s whether it&#39;s a symbol at all. The image of eyes can appear for so many reasons, it&#39;s baffling to me how people can think of it as the mark of a specific society.</p>

<p>And such a profound degree of meaning is the kind of thing you&#39;d expect of an eye symbol in a piece of postmodern art, not a commercial. There is no point.</p>

What symbol on the other side of this dichotomy of the &quot;eye&quot; and how in the world does this do anything to ingrain those &quot;binaries&quot; into our minds?
I think conspiracy theorists tend to grossly overestimate the power of subliminal messaging. <em>Grossly.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And those dichotomies you named... Those are natural. They are inherently opposite, they don&#39;t require brainwashing to manifest in a person&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>Like celebrity deaths, it&#39;s easy to credit naturally existing things to some inexplicably powerful secret society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not about subliminal messages, and I think you misunderstand my point.</p>

<p>My point is that it is about CONSCIOUS interpretations of these symbols. The people who seek them out will come to their own deluded interpretations of what they mean, but then again all people who build grand narratives in their heads are dealing with delusions to begin with... self-consciously or not. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t an opposite-symbol that is necessary for this particular one to have dichotomizing effects. My point is that the symbol itself is inherently dichotomizing depending on frame and conscious interpretation. Hope that clears that up. </p>

<p>Oh, and the &quot;natural&quot;ness of these dichotomies is quite contested in the contemporary theories across all disciplines. In gender studies, in political science, sociology, and even in the scientific disciplines... but this is not the place to discuss that, it could get complicated. </p>

<p>Your last sentence kinda came from out of nowhere... I never implied an inexplicably powerful secret society in anything, I hope that&#39;s not how you&#39;re contextualizing my thoughts.

<p>It is natural for humans to recognize opposites. Female is the opposite of Male, that is 100% natural to recognize. It&#39;s the conflict of superiority between them that is studied.</p>

<p>Good and Evil... I prefer Good and Bad, and that is another opposite that is natural to recognize. What bad/evil are defined as is debated.</p>

<p>Do you mean the theory of conspiracy theories? Because &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and &quot;theory of conspiracy&quot; would mean the same thing, grammatically. If you meant what I think you did, then it is refreshing to see. The theory of conspiracy theories is interesting, much like the theories of why mentally retarded children are entertained by shiny keychains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure we have much to discuss, but your assumptions of intellectual superiority make this pointless. In good discourse, both participants leave having learned something, but your repeated attempts at stating what I &quot;truly mean&quot; indicates that in your paranoid mind I am just a strawman upon which you load all sorts of fictional beliefs. </p>

<p>You ASSUME I hold some belief in omnipotent secret societies just because I&#39;m browsing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, yet you can&#39;t find one statement I have made to support this.</p>

<p>And no, I don&#39;t mean theory of conspiracy theories. What theory of conspiracy concerns itself with is mostly topics related to the agent-structure problem in the study of politics/sociology and international studies. The &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; you are thinking of are conventional conspiracy theories that are a precusor to the modern day phenomenon of decentralized projects of contextualization more accurately termed as &quot;conspirituality&quot; movements that blend together the paranoia of conspiracy theorists with the kind of &quot;spiritual&quot; empowerment and revolutionary aspects of &quot;new age&quot;-y paradigms... ie)The Venus Project, The Zeitgeist Movement etc. But, theory of conspiracy is not a form &quot;conspirituality&quot; itself, though &quot;conspirituality&quot; is its most contemporary and compelling subject of analysis. </p>

<p>Not sure why I&#39;m trying to explain so much to someone who is probably just trolling... but if you can moderate your attitude and treat others (even if they have far-fetched beliefs) with respect, then you may find yourself smarter tomorrow than you are today. </p>

I&#39;m a meta-conspiracist in the sense that I use &quot;conspiracy&quot; as the analogical model to explain political, social and psychological phenomena at all scales and through a wide spectrum of organizational categories.</p>

<p>At the psychological scale, &quot;conspiracy&quot; manifests as a kind of struggle over free will. Control vs controlled, the individual is torn between this feeling of having free will vs the knowledge of his own social conditioning which calls that feeling into doubt. &quot;Conspiracy&quot; at the psychological level therefore, attempts to resolve this problem by projecting the anxiety onto a (semi?)imagined elite group that &quot;CONTROLS&quot; the world. The &quot;CONTROLLED&quot; individual therefore regains his sense of free will, as he thinks his lack of control/power has been taken from him and can be regained through emancipation and rebellion. </p>

<p>That&#39;s an extreme oversimplification, but serves as a good starting point for people who want a more novel take on conspiracy theories. The concept and trend of &quot;conspirituality&quot; movements is really fascinating for me, because I believe it promotes a much healthier and productive state of mind for individuals. The belligerence of conventional conspiracy theories is tempered by &quot;new age&quot; spirituality&#39;s emphasis on self-empowerment... and all that &quot;new age&quot; stuff is made to be more social and much less self-absorbed by the political emphasis of conspiracy theory. A synthesis of extreme political/social pessimism and narcissistic spiritual optimism produces a rather impressive decentralized and reflexive frame. </p>

<p>Shit, just think about how and where these new movements are locating &quot;power&quot; within their paradigms. Rather than targeting shadowy groups concentrated at the top, they conceive of the corruption as being spread THROUGHOUT the entire hierarchy. Evil doesn&#39;t need to be personified when it&#39;s systemic, and it provides a framework through which individuals can immediately begin working at identifying and &quot;fixing&quot; corruption within themselves and within their own sphere of influence. I think that&#39;s much better than chasing Joseph Ko... errr... &quot;straw men&quot; who are symptomatic of a systemic disease. This decentralized and reflexive pattern of (re)contextualizing the world shows a lot of promise, and though I may not agree with many of the various diagnoses of our species&#39; disease, I&#39;m loving the new methods. </p>

<p>Maybe &quot;progress&quot; is a word I can believe in once again.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All disagreement is each person thinking they&#39;re right, and so there will always be an inherent sense of superiority on both sides there. Some are just more rude about it than others, and for that I apologize.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but your repeated attempts at stating what I &quot;truly mean&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When did I do that? All I did was attempt to summarize and condense. If I was wrong about something, then correct me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am just a strawman upon which you load all sorts of fictional beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are defending concepts associated with wacky conspiracy theories. You can&#39;t blame me for assuming when you never attempted to make clear otherwise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You ASSUME I hold some belief in omnipotent secret societies just because I&#39;m browsing <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, yet you can&#39;t find one statement I have made to support this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assumed because you didn&#39;t give any indication that you weren&#39;t a believer, and defended that which I doubt. I&#39;m not psychic, you know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>nd no, I don&#39;t mean theory of conspiracy theories. What theory of conspiracy concerns itself with is mostly topics related to the agent-structure problem in the study of politics/sociology and international studies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reasonable, but grammatically, they do mean the same thing, so you should probably find a different name. It&#39;s like &quot;physics theories&quot; and &quot;theories of physics&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; you are thinking of are conventional conspiracy theories that are a precusor to the modern day phenomenon of decentralized projects of contextualization more accurately termed as &quot;conspirituality&quot; movements that blend together the paranoia of conspiracy theorists with the kind of &quot;spiritual&quot; empowerment and revolutionary aspects of &quot;new age&quot;-y paradigms... ie)The Venus Project, The Zeitgeist Movement etc. But, theory of conspiracy is not a form &quot;conspirituality&quot; itself, though &quot;conspirituality&quot; is its most contemporary and compelling subject of analysis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the spiritual aspect can be found in a branch, but it&#39;s hardly uniform of the genre of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure why I&#39;m trying to explain so much to someone who is probably just trolling...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not. I admit that I didn&#39;t come expecting with the intention to learn much, though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but if you can moderate your attitude and treat others (even if they have far-fetched beliefs) with respect, then you may find yourself smarter tomorrow than you are today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Believe me, I am extremely open minded and will be able to recognize valid information in defense of that which I doubt the instant it appears. I just haven&#39;t seen it yet. I may address points with a rude tone, but I&#39;m still addressing them and there&#39;s no reason to think I can&#39;t be reasoned with.</p>

<p>That &quot;decision&quot; was a conclusion I made based on reasoning.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wasn&#39;t. Gangs actually have more reason to be tagging walls... There&#39;s a lot of use in marking their physical territory and a lot of fun to defy the law. Much like smashing mailboxes.</p>

<p>And you can&#39;t draw a parallel between this and a global society, because this behavior persists with gangs for reasons specific and unique to them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skeptism is universally integral, but being dismissive of others without first presenting sufficient understanding of a subject, isn&#39;t in the nature of a genuine skeptic. This failure to engage in a positive way begins to cross the thin line into troll territory. I&#39;ll withhold the pitchfork. You miss out on an intriguing subject, not me. Additionally, it is you who misunderstands the complexities of hypnosis. Visual repetition plays a powerful role in subconscious marketing and is considered a form of hypnotic suggestion in most contemporary communications courses. I&#39;m playing <strong>devil&#39;s advocate</strong> mainly because of your attitude, but also because symbolism is interesting to discuss in general. To continue with the topic, one could suppose the symbolism in advertising is the application of more advanced techniques, an innovation, for lack of a better term, of the symbolism used by secret societies of the past. There are certainly patterns, but what or why is difficult to ascertain, considering the depth of field that the human race is involved in creatively.</p>

<p>I admit that I&#39;m not here to learn. If someone brings up something valid amd interesting, I promose you I&#39;ll recognize it. But I will be suprised if they do.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m personally reluctant to call that hypnosis, I&#39;d rather call that conditioning and it&#39;s a large step from that to the things proported to be the intentions of secret societies. And I still hold that the power of it is overestimate. You leave me to take your word on what you said about the communications courses, but it conflicts with what I&#39;ve read about hypnosis and subliminal messages.</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is that, with the information at hand, I don&#39;t think that there could be any practical purposes for a secret society to insert symbolism in the media, and so I doubt whether such symbolism exist at all outside of someone&#39;s paranoid perception.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that people find what they look for. If they&#39;re looking for ambiguous symbolism, it isn&#39;t hard to find regardless of whether it&#39;s actually there as intended symbolism.</p>

<p>Too much lies within the vague boundaries of possibility, friend. I maintain the latter.</p>

<p>But I agree with you on the rest. It&#39;s also worth noting that many people crave such drama, ironically from growing up seeing motifs of dissent and revolution in pop media. Think of how many movies there are about big, bad, totalitarian government being overthrown by working class heroes. Think of all the movies about our own government, and all the fictional conspiring. If a secret society was in control of the media, they wouldn&#39;t allow such things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely correct in saying logos and ambiguous symbols might have unintentional effects if their purpose is subliminal manipulation. My talking about images is related to the overall use of quick changes in growing media, such as Tv commercials, different programs one might surf past via remote control, uniformity in franchise appearances, etc. The main function of television is communication,albiet from the producer to the consumer. Advertisers are interested in persuading you to consume their product, as are networks. To watch Tv is to open the persuasion portal. It isn&#39;t sinister by nature, but much influence can be gained with repitition, visual stimulation, auditory cues, etc. It isn&#39;t the image (though the rapid delivery and vast amounts we are subjected to in our daily lives does cause an exhausted mind to relinquish control over what it will percieve objectively) that is important, but the symbolic act of planting oneself in front of a one-way media delivery system which requires no cognitive ability to endulge. Flashing lights (cop lights, quicjk edits) and audio cues can illicit specific responses (physical arrest, fear, relaxation). I do have some hey recent materials (scientific of course) if you&#39;d be interested regarding this. </p>

<p>But see... I don&#39;t think there is any subliminal manipulation occurring in the media. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any basis for that to even be possible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The arguable purpose of anything that can be consumed is profit. I don&#39;t think the intent of television is communication in the way you describe it, though.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, but they do perfectly well employing techniques that aren&#39;t subliminal messaging.</p>

<p>It <em>sounds</em> plausible the way you describe it, but I don&#39;t find it very believable. How is much influence gained with &quot;repitition, visual stimulation, auditory cues, etc.&quot;? You describe how it would work, but not in a way that proves that it works. You describe the tools it employs without explaining the basis you have for believing that they work in such ways in the first place.</p>

<p>Yes, they can, as can colors. Red illicits hunger. But it&#39;s a large step from this to secret society logos, which was the original topic. While it is important to address the legitimacy of subliminal messaging, the topic at hand is whether secret societies are actually employing them in popular media.</p>
