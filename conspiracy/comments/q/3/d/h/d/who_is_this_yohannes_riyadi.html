       Since Lord Blackheath name-dropped him in his latest outcry, touting him as the 'Richest man in the world', I've been trying to turn stones to find as much information about him as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, I've found virtually nothing. A few sharded sources have let me tie together a few facts, but if anyone has anything else relevant, I'd love to hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've found is that :
      </p>
      <p>
       • He's likely descended from the past Indo-China Dynasties, somewhat explaining his supposed vast wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       • His wealth is measured in the Trillions, putting him squarely in the lead for richest man. An exact figure I've not been able to find, as expected, but I've seen anywhere from the low trillions up to 35 - 40 trillion (which is 80 - 90% of the entire world's wealth).

       More I dig, the more I turn up about him being the alias of a Phillipino crime syndicate. And yet, the more I hear about this being bullshit, the more interested I become. Is it truly possible that this 'man' is the head, or one of the heads, of this supposed global plan?
      </p>
      <p>
       With how far disconnected governments are from their people, and the ever-closing possibility of global government, it seems illogical that all this is happening without some independent power pulling the strings. Is this really the tip of that iceberg?

       In the article the author says that he was arrested as Morales and was holding $24 trillion bucks in U.S. bonds?? Didn't some Japanese blokes get caught in Italy with something like that last week?? The above report is dated Jul 14, 2010.

       The fact that NO ONE has ever heard of Riyadi, yet Lord Blackheath's mention of his name was taken routinely and with relative familiarity by the House of Lords, is clear evidence of a "shadow government" that operates over the heads, and out of the eyes of everyone.  Riyadi controls TRILLIONS, not millions or billions, of dollars.  He is worth BILLIONS more than Gates, Buffett,  and Slim
       <em>
        combined
       </em>
       .  The human mind cannot even begin to comprehend the vastness of the number 15 trillion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there are a few more people that operate on Riyadi's level.  People that are worth perhaps more than him, and people whose names do not appear at all on the internet.  The mention of the Rothschilds brings downvotes and ridicule, but perhaps the unearthing of someone like Riyadi will bring more attention to the truth behind the claims of a top-level, global shadow government controlling everything.

       Wealth doesn't have to be purely liquid. 99% of that figure is likely assets. Still, 80% of the world in assets is an interesting concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NY Fed Reserve website calls Riyadi a name used by con artists, but their explanation of his deeds seems to conflict what Blackheath says. The way he says 'richest man in the world' in his speech as well doesn't smack of lies, and seems to me like he thinks that other people know the name, so doesn't dwell on it.

       according to this, his real name is Wilfredo...

      <p>
       also this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One news story -- immediately taken offline -- identified one of the "Japanese" as a notorious con man from the Philippines named Yohannes Riyadi, a.k.a. Wilfredo Saurin, whose associates in international crime are fairly well-known. The other guy may have been his comrade Joseph Daraman. These two men are the right ages, and they both could pass for Japanese. They've been trading in fake documents from the Federal Reserve for years.

       Heh, I appreciate your discontent with our current system, but this whole thing has very little to do with Capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free Market Capitalism, or Anarcho-Capitalism, would destroy the insanely rich by getting rid of their pull over society by getting rid of THE loophole around the market system: government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't know what your political views are, but what you are saying sounds a lot like Communism (which is entirely compatible with my worldview, but doesn't make sense economically... but it's okay because it's supposed to be a voluntary system, so I've nothing against it). You should be aware that both Anarcho-Capitalism and Communism are similar insofar as both "sides" advocate the elimination of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, anyway: No, this is NOT the result of Capitalism. So please learn some economics before passing judgement. The internet can be a very powerful tool, but it can also apparently lead you astray.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, come on human race. I'm not that quick, but I figured this one out.

      <p>
       XD, sorry if I come off as patronizing, I'm just tired of people saying "OH CAPITALISM SUCKS" without the concept of what Capitalism even means.

       I take it that you are referring to subsidies and I agree with you on that point.  However, free market capitalism is as about as useful as any socioeconomic philosophy.  It relies on a near utopian situation to allow it to function properly.  As a nation, we initially did have a free market and then we learned that, sometimes, quite bad things can happen as the invisible hand of the free markets is actually frequently absent (hence it's invisibility).  Some regulation is necessary in order to protect basic human rights.  This is why we have a public school system, public roads, police and fire, and much, much more.  In each instance, the "free market" ended up falling in such a way where injustice was done whether it be children not being able to educate themselves out of impoverished families to poor families watching their houses and belongings burn to the ground due to failure to afford to hire a fire brigade.  No extreme of any socioeconomic system will ever be effective.  As James Madison once said, "If men were angels, no government would be necessary."  Men frequently tend to be greedy little shits with sometimes total disregard for human life.  Does our regulations need to be cleaned up to remove subsidies that shelter giants and other perks?  Hell  yes.  Some of our regulations, including tax regulations and regulatory bodies, have been perverted to all hell. However, free market capitalism is no longer viable.  When every industry in the global market has 5-6 mega-conglomerates with interconnections between the lot of them, then you eradicate two essential requirements for a free market to exist properly--low barriers of entry and perfect competition.
