       I'd like you guys to take a look at what I have so far for the next major update coming to IfEveryoneKnew.com.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd prefer that you guys not share this link, since it's not final and the code isn't production ready yet.  I'd just like to get some input before it goes live... which should be soon.  But here's the link nontheless:
       <a href="http://dev.ifeveryoneknew.com">
        http://dev.ifeveryoneknew.com
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If its not obvious enough, there's a link at the bottom that says "Show more articles".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're on a iPhone/
       <del>
        Android
       </del>
       , it would be a help if you could test that the mobile site works (
       <a href="http://dev.ifeveryoneknew.com/iphone/">
        http://dev.ifeveryoneknew.com/iphone/
       </a>
       ) as I don't have one of those devices to test on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did my best to take all the suggestions that came from the submission here and over in r/Politics about a year ago (more articles, wiki-style referencing, etc.).  In short, the next five articles touch on:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Overthrowing governments for their natural resources
       </li>
       <li>
        The Business Plot
       </li>
       <li>
        Israel (this one I'm no doubt going to catch some heat on, but I did my best!)
       </li>
       <li>
        The Federal Reserve
       </li>
       <li>
        Lobbying
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I don't have a copy of MS Word so if something is wrong grammar-wise or you think I could word something better, I'd encourage you to correct me.  I won't be offended.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what do you think?

       Pretty cool. I was just caution that you make sure the facts are STRAIGHT, because one erroneous claim and the whole site loses credibility and will be be written of as a "conspiracy" even though the other 99.99999r% of information is factually correct.

       In regard to MK Ultra, you say Canadian and US citizens where abducted, yet none of the sources cited back up that statement.

       It's in the
       <a href="http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2010/04/0413mk-ultra-authorized/">
        Wired article
       </a>
       .  Probably that document on AARC too but since its image based its not easily searchable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wiki style referencing was a decent way to keep me honest.  When going back to cite each claim I found that I understated some... like for #1 with the prison phone calls, I originally put it could cost up to $2.50 a minute -- but found a newer Guardian article that used a $5/minute figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/Conspiratard + r/Politics were happy with the accuracy the last time around though.  I hope I can keep it that way. :)

       Thanks, I'll grab a copy of it today.  I used it a long time ago and while it had a spellchecker, I don't think it had a grammar checker.  Maybe I'm wrong though.  Either way, it can't hurt.

       I get a 500 internal server error when I try the mobile link. On android.

       Edit: and I can't click on any links on the page the first link takes me to. Really like the layout though. Nice, simple and clear from what I saw so far.

       Hmm.  I've removed redirection for Android users so it still uses the desktop version instead of the mobile one.  The main site still has CSS for mobile users to format it for their screen... but it won't resemble a app.

       The developer of jQTouch is working on Android support but I guess it's not quite there yet.

       Thanks again for the feedback.  You really only get one chance to make it on r/Politics so I'd like to get everything ironed out before then.

       Thanks.  Is that on your desktop browser?  Which one are you using?  In the past, Opera wasnt recognizing clicks on the articles (since its using HTML5 tags) but Opera has since added support as of ~6mos ago.

       Hmm.  I checked the log and the 500 internal server errors are happening with Spiders (like baidu) and one visitor who has a empty User-agent string.  Is your browser modified or anything?  And does the

       A year ago some people said on r/Politics that jQTouch was interfering with their reddit app but I was hoping it would be resolved by now (either with a updated reddit app or a updated jQTouch).

       Thanks for the feedback though, it really helps.

       np, and that mobile link does work from within my reddit app on my phone. The

        http://dev.ifeveryoneknew.com/iphone/
       </a>
       didn't. And I was using the firefox browser app for my phone, which is running CM7, when I was able to click on the articles from the first link (implying the problem is with Reddit is Fun). Read some of the articles so far. They are concise and have a polished look. Nice work so far man.

       You say, "The Federal Reserve is also, in fact, not a federal agency." This isn't completely accurate. The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are not federal agencies, but the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is
       <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">
        a federal agency
       </a>
       with about 2,000 employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also need to be more specific about which board you are talking about. A couple of times you say "the Federal Reserve’s board" or "the Federal Reserve’s board of directors". There are
       <em>
        12
       </em>
       boards of directors, one for each of the 12 banks. Each board has 9 members, 3 of whom are bankers. Those directors are supposed to represent the interests of the banking industry. There are also another 3 members who are allowed to own bank stock, although they aren't allowed to be bankers. And there are 3 members who are appointed by the BOG, and they are not allowed to even own bank stock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't just say "the Federal Reserve’s board", because that would normally refer to the Board of Governors, who are not allowed to be bankers.

       Sounds familiar.  Somewhat.  My site is howmanyknow.com  :)
I like your topics.  The prison system definitely something that needs to be touched upon, especially with CIA and others drugs fueling it through a war on "drugs."

       Dupont is a family that definitely needs to be touched upon.  They play a big role in all American's everyday lives, and not just with cars (GM).
