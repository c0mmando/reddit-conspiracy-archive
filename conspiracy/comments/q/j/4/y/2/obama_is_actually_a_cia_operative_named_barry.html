      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The evidence shows that DARPA's 1971 time travel probe was able to pre-identify an African American man named "Barack H. Obama II" taking the oath of office on Jan 20, 2009. In 1971, no person named "Barack H. Obama II" legally existed. In 1971 the person who is now in the Oval office was named Barry Soetoro and was an Indonesian citizen, which the person in the Oval office still is, legally. CIA "manufactured" a social identity called "Barack H. Obama II" - with the knowing participation of a Kenyan civil servant named Barack H. Obama, who is not Barry Soetoro's biological father - to fulfill what their time travel probe has seen in 1971, and groomed their life-long 3rd generation CIA agent, Barry Soetoro, to assume that false identity. In Light, Alfred ;-)

       EDIT:
I meant no harm... I just thought
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would be a good place to share information like this... I don't know what to make of it; like Vanillapudding said, this is like an 11/10 on the 'out-there' scale and I had to share it because it is so compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea what is really going on with the U.S. government and secretive groups attempting to play with power. This post comes from a guy who I respect and so I shared it with Reddit
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       folks.
I didn't mean to devalue my post by describing it as 'stirring up the mud'; I realize that I carelessly described it that way. I truly want to contribute whatever information might be helpful, provocative and legitimate. This seemed interesting, provocative, and imaginable.

       I was lucky enough to find myself in Belgrade in the summer of 2002, standing in front of a brass orb that supposedly held Tesla's ashes; it was in a museum honoring him and his works.

       One thing I learned while watching this is that the birth cerficiate for Obama that was put up on the whitehouse.gov website had layers in it if you opened it up in an Adobe Editer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox News released a story where a graphics expert stated that this happend because of a scanner's OCR.

         An English-language translation of Emerich de Vattel's 1758 treatise The Law of Nations (original French title: Le Droit du gens), stating that "The natives, or natural-born citizens, are those born in the country of parents who are citizens," was quoted in 1857 by Supreme Court justice Peter Vivian Daniel in a concurring opinion in Dred Scott v. Sandford,[22] as well as by Chief Justice Melville Fuller in 1898 in his dissenting opinion in United States v. Wong Kim Ark.[23]

      <p>
       Although eligibility for the Presidency was not an issue in any 19th century litigation, there have been a few cases that shed light on "natural-born citizen". The leading case is Lynch v. Clarke,[28] which dealt with a New York law (similar to laws of other states at that time) that only a U.S. citizen could inherit real estate. The plaintiff, Julia Lynch, had been born in New York while her parents, both British, were briefly visiting the U.S., and shortly thereafter all three left for Britain and never returned to the U.S. The New York Chancery Court determined that, under common law and prevailing statutes, she was a U.S. citizen by birth and nothing had deprived her of that citizenship, notwithstanding that both her parents were not U.S. citizens or that British law might also claim her through her parents' nationality. In the course of the decision, the court cited the Constitutional provision and said:
      </p>
      <p>
       Suppose a person should be elected president who was native born, but of alien parents; could there be any reasonable doubt that he was eligible under the Constitution? I think not. The position would be decisive in his favor, that by the rule of the common law, in force when the Constitution was adopted, he is a citizen.[29]
      </p>
      <p>
       And further:
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon principle, therefore, I can entertain no doubt, but that by the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. It is surprising that there has been no judicial decision upon this question.[30]
      </p>
      <p>
       The decision in Lynch v. Clarke was cited as persuasive or authoritative precedent in numerous subsequent cases, including In re Look Tin Sing,[31] on the issue of whether the child, born in the U.S., to two Chinese parents (who were prevented by federal law from becoming U.S. citizens) was a U.S. citizen, notwithstanding the nationality of his parents or the fact that he had traveled to China with them and not returned to the U.S. for many years. The federal court held in a decision written by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen J. Field) that he was a citizen by birth, and remained such despite his long stay in China, cited the decision in Lynch v. Clarke and described that case:
      </p>
      <p>
       After an exhaustive examination of the law, the Vice-Chancellor said that he entertained no doubt that every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever the situation of his parents, was a natural-born citizen, and added that this was the general understanding of the legal profession, and the universal impression of the public mind.[32]
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lynch case was also cited as a leading precedent in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which similarly held that the child born here of two Chinese parents was a birthright US citizen, and that decision also used the phrase "natural born".[33]

        Congressional Research Service

      </ol>
      <p>
       A memorandum to Congress dated April 3, 2009, written by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), states:
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the history of the constitutional qualifications provision, the common use and meaning of the phrase "natural-born subject" in England and in the Colonies in the 1700s, the clause's apparent intent, the subsequent action of the first Congress in enacting the Naturalization Act of 1790 (expressly defining the term "natural born citizen" to include a person born abroad to parents who are United States citizens), as well as subsequent Supreme Court dicta, it appears that the most logical inferences would indicate that the phrase "natural born Citizen" would mean a person who is entitled to U.S. citizenship "at birth" or "by birth."[34]
      </p>
      <p>
       According to an April 2000 report by the CRS, most constitutional scholars interpret the natural born citizen clause as to include citizens born outside the United States to parents who are U.S. citizens. This same CRS report also asserts that citizens born in the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are legally defined as "natural born" citizens and are, therefore, also eligible to be elected President.[35] Gabriel J. Chin, Professor of Law at the University of Arizona, however, believes under the current law not all persons born outside of the United States to U.S. citizen parents are eligible to serve under the natural born citizen clause.[36][37]
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Academic opinions
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In a 2008 article published by the Michigan Law Review Lawrence Solum, Professor of Law at the University of Illinois, stated that "there is general agreement on the core of [the] meaning [of the Presidential Eligibility Clause]. Anyone born on American soil whose parents are citizens of the United States is a 'natural born citizen'".[38] In April 2010, Solum republished the same article as an online draft, in which he clarified his original statement so that it would not be misunderstood as excluding the children of one citizen parent. In a footnote he explained that "based on my reading of the historical sources, there is no credible case that a person born on American soil with one American parent was clearly not a 'natural born citizen'." He further extended natural born citizenship to all cases of jus soli as the "conventional view".[39] Although Professor Solum stated elsewhere that the two-citizen-parents arguments "weren't crazy", he believes "the much stronger argument suggests that if you were born on American soil that you would be considered a natural born citizen."[40]
      </p>
      <p>
       Ronald Rotunda, Professor of Law at Chapman University, stated, "There's some people who say that both parents need to be citizens. That's never been the law."[41] Polly Price, Professor of Law at Emory University, added, "It's a little confusing, but most scholars think it's a pretty unusual position for anyone to think the natural born citizen clause would exclude someone born in the [United States]."[40] Professor Chin concurred with that assessment, stating, "there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment."[42] Similarly, Eugene Volokh, Professor of Law at UCLA, found "quite persuasive" the reasoning employed by the Indiana Court of Appeals, which had ruled "that persons born within the borders of the United States are 'natural born Citizens' for Article II, Section 1 purposes, regardless of the citizenship of their parents."[43][44] Daniel Takaji, Professor of Law at Ohio State University, agrees the citizenship status of a U.S.-born candidate's parents is irrelevant.[45] G. Edward White, Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, states the term refers to anyone born on U.S. soil or anyone born on foreign soil to American citizen parents.[46]

       It is possible to travel faster through time then normal by travelling at a greater speed then normal. This has been proven by astronauts and pilots a few times now. However it is not possible to ever go backwards in time.

       No. A person traveled at the speed of light for 1 light year. Then turned around and traveled back (at light speed) to his starting position.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the traveller time would have only advanced 2 years. To an observer at the starting location it would have been more then 2 year

       You just described EXACTLY what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say the person traveling at the speed of light would only have passed through two years. Then you say the observer would have passed through more than two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means the traveler moved slower through time because less time elapsed than the amount of time the observer experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this does not make sense after both you and I have explained it the exact same way then you just might be an idiot.

       Actually, this is not quite accurate. If you're at all familiar with astrophysics you would know that time travel is possible via black holes but only one direction and it is only theoretically possible as we obviously haven't sent anyone to test it out. Yet.

       These claims are wild. On a scale of 1 to 10 they register an 11...  but it's fun.  Any more info on the program?  If these things were seen as events that were to come (either by remote viewing or timetravel) then why did they have to manufacture the vision/reality that was observed?

       "Stirring up the mud" is often a very counterproductive thing to do - especially in a forum already having its hands full with being able to effectively decipher the truth (that many of us are actually trying to get at) from disinformation b.s.

       would be a good place to share information like this... I don't know what to make of it; like Vanillapudding said, this is like an 11/10 on the 'out-there' scale and I had to share it because it is so compelling.

       Fair enough.  It wouldn't have been a bad idea for you to have preambled your post with the information you just gave here, however.  Otherwise, it does come across as a cry wolf kind of scenario where you post something inflammatory without any qualifiers, and then when someone calls you out on it or reacts to it, you say "Ha!  I was just kidding!  I thought it was funny, and put it up there for the lols."  That's not so much compelling as it's simply not cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, fair enough that you meant no harm.  Just keep this in mind for future reference, as some of us really ARE trying to understand what's really going on in this fucked up world and planet we live in.  Thanks.

       I have no idea what is really going on with the U.S. government and secretive groups attempting to play with power.  This post comes from a guy who I respect and so I shared it with Reddit

       I didn't mean to devalue my post by describing it as 'stirring up the mud'; I realize that I carelessly described it that way.  I truly want to contribute whatever information might be helpful, provocative and legitimate.  This seemed interesting, provocative, and imaginable.

       And btw, it doesn't matter if something seems like "an 11/10" on the out there scale.  Heck, it doesn't matter if it's a TWENTY out of ten.  This planet is a
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       fucked up one, okay?  There are people/energies/beings controlling things that do NOT have the best interest of the human inhabitants in mind at all.  Part of what they bank on in getting away with what they get away with
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       this idea that if it's
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       far "out there", then people will simply discard the possibility as a reality - so they keep getting away with horrible shit because people simply don't think that they'd
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       something like that or that something as nefarious as what's going on would really be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newsflash:  It IS possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moral here is to discard your preconceived notions of what should and should not be, and simply go where the evidence points you regardless of how "out there" it might seem or actually be.

       A common disinfo technique is to drop ludicrous conspiracy theories into the fray to muddy the waters, discrediting legitimate conspiracy information.
      </p>
      <p>
       A common disinfo sub-technique is the "modified limited hangout", in which part of the information is true, with a built-in "closure/resolution" mechanism, to limit further investigation -- or, in this case, a built-in "poison pill" of absurdity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Legitimate efforts have already been made, by Australian writer John Pilger, to examine the possibility of Barack Obama's recruitment by the CIA and early employment by the CIA front company Business International.

       This type of information being disseminated here only serves as a poison pill.  Enjoy your discrediting of any and all further discussion of Barack Obama as CIA.  Fools.

       You just described EXACTLY what I said.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say the person traveling at the speed of light would only have passed through two years. Then you say the observer would have passed through more than two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means the traveler moved slower through time because less time elapsed than the amount of time the observer experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this does not make sense after both you and I have explained it the exact same way then you just might be an idiot.
