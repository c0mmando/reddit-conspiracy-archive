        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I haven&#39;t decided what I&#39;m going to do next. I may or may not delete this account. But, while most of you know who I am, I figured you&#39;d want to know about your moderators and how this subreddit is being run. Especially considering all of the subreddit drama we&#39;ve had here and in other subs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all good... and I&#39;m quite comfortable in my mind that these people can be (for the most part) trusted not to try to secretly censor anything. They aren&#39;t &quot;running&quot; the subreddit. They&#39;re just doing minimal maintenance and damage control.</p>

<p>So, here they are... your moderators...</p>

<hr/>

<p>illuminatedwax - owns the subreddit, never mods. in all the time I was a moderator, I never saw him participate in moderator activities. He&#39;s very &quot;hands off&quot; with this subreddit. You should be thankful for that.</p>

<p>donbueno - MIA</p>

<p>soccer - mildly biased, but the most dutiful worker I&#39;ve seen. he addresses the modqueue (things that must be addressed by a moderator such as reports and spamfilter captures) in almost realtime -- it&#39;s why you&#39;ll see his name most frequently in the mod logs (when they finally make those available). And remember... the modqueue MUST be addressed or it gets overloaded and useless. It was soccer (and 9000sins) who cleaned that shit up when the new mods were elected.</p>

<p>biomassive - mostly silent, doesn&#39;t speak up unless the issue is &quot;hot&quot; (i.e., potentially damaging/dysfunctional to the community). While being less &quot;active&quot; than the rest, this kind of last minute &quot;don&#39;t shoot yourselves in the foot, guys&quot; type of moderation is powerfully useful.</p>

<p>9000sins - this guy&#39;s all over the place. he&#39;s got good heart, I&#39;m just not sure how focused it is. he&#39;s capable, friendly, involved. but, shouldn&#39;t be allow to run the place alone. he needs people around him to help moderate his own reckless potential. he&#39;s probably elbow deep in stuff he doesn&#39;t fully understand most of the time. I get the impression he&#39;s a 24x7 &quot;morning without coffee&quot; - well-intended, but unable to shake off the haze. (EDIT: See our discussions below. I&#39;m just too old for this shit. Nothing personal to 9000sins. He&#39;s actually an active moderator who doesn&#39;t meddle too much. A rare prize. I didn&#39;t mean to dis him.)</p>

<p>MrDong - one of two &quot;new edge&quot; types (that&#39;s a combination of &quot;edgy&quot; and &quot;new age&quot;) in your mod staff. I like this guy. I can&#39;t say exactly why. He thinks outside the box, and he&#39;s very community focused in a sort of flowery peace, love, and 1960&#39;s sort of way. He doesn&#39;t like the violence/hostility (on earth or in our subreddit).</p>

<p>Sarah_Connor - quiet, learning. along with MrDong, one of the least &quot;experienced/knowledgeable&quot; moderators we have. Good healthy perspective. Level-headed. You can&#39;t go wrong keeping this person as a sounding board.</p>

<p>sunshine-x - the other &quot;new edge&quot; type... different from MrDong, though. not quite as &quot;flowery peace and love&quot; and more wholesome domesticated type (regular job, family man, etc.) IT-minded. Other than that, probably the most balanced and valuable moderator on the staff (in my humble opinion).</p>

<p>sakebomb69 - a comical mystery. he plays the &quot;devout Jewish Zionist&quot; role comically well. otherwise quite professional about his involvement as a moderator. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d feel leaving the sub in his hands alone, but ... as part of the team, he&#39;s been a very positive contribution.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Peace,</p>

<p>HomegrownTerran</p>

<p>aka Username_Tokin (former moderator)</p>

<p>aka contheory_spiracist (aka all those other deleted usernames, too)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Over the course of the last few months we have devoloped a pretty close friendship here. So I don&#39;t take what you have said here to heart. But I do want to know what you mean by a few of the things you said here. You say I lack focus, which at times is very tue, but please be more specific. Also you describe it as a 24x7 thing, like im always in some kind of stupor. I am always looking to learn more about myself and how to improve as a person. I am a little concerned about your comment that I should not be allowed to run the place by myself. No one mod should ever be able to take over the sub and run it solo. I have absolutely no desire to do so, and I feel that your comment portrays me as someone who wants that power. </p>

<p>Based on what you have said I get the impression that you have somehow lost faith in me. I am disappointed token. You had so much positive stuff to say about the others but you painted me as kind of ditz and a megalomaniac. </p>

<p>Edit: please also describe my &quot;wreckless potential&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many? There are currently 2 users with icon flair. Those are me and HomegrownTerran. I did give imjulianassange a Mr. Burns icon but he reapectfully declined that as his user flair and I am now reworking his flair. I&#39;m sorry if you do not like the idea of users having a piece of icon flair here. I want to be able to work something out with the mods about awarding icon flair to the biggest contributors here. I thought a lot about how to implement this. I decided to give it a test run and see how everyone reacted. Some seemed interested, others did not. No one really seemed to mind that I have had it for about 2 months now. </p>

<p>As far as the posts go, I don&#39;t control what gets submitted, nor do the moderators here like to pull content unless it&#39;s obvious spam or hate propaganda. So we let the users decide what is good and what is not. That is the way it should be. If we do too much, we get blamed for pulling things even if it isn&#39;t relevant. People get really defensive about moderators deliberately removing their posts, even if it is just a stupid meme picture. </p>

The default reddit icon is alway translucent compared to every other icon. &lt;-- this bothers me the most (the lack of emphasis - it&#39;s like reddit is hiding self-posts).</p>

<p>It needs downsized to the correct size for a submission icon. I found that 40% of this size is about right, in my tests with MS Paint. However, I know that GIMP or Photoshop will give a cleaner, crisper result... so I&#39;m just linking to the image... will let you tinker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;wreckless potential&quot; - having a great idea (and I mean a <strong>great</strong> idea), but no clear path to accomplishing/implementing it. </p>

<p>In a realtime environment (like a 50k member subreddit), trial and error isn&#39;t the best approach. From time to time, you tend to brush up against this dilemma without actually crossing any lines of objection, which causes me &quot;butterflies in my stomach&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a thrill a minute. Great for you younger folk, but this old geezer can&#39;t keep up with that... it upsets my sensitive digestion.</p>

<p>We discussed the flair icons when I was a mod. You wanted them. I didn&#39;t object to having them, but I wanted a clear plan... a clear purpose. I wanted to see that they&#39;d be meaningful and desirable to the community before implementing them (rather than being &quot;just decoration&quot; ... or worse... &quot;moderators putting labels on people&quot;).</p>

<p>brushing up against it...</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know where we&#39;re at on this issue, but I see we&#39;ve started to get the flair icons. Are they &quot;just decoration&quot;? Do they have &quot;symbolic meaning&quot;? (I&#39;m scratching my head in bewilderment.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sent you a PM to clarify some of it. But I&#39;ll throw a few more points in here...</p>

<p>You are extremely active... in many aspects of this subredddit&#39;s managment. This has pros and cons. See my comment about illuminatedwax for contrast.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean to insult you. I like you and I think you&#39;re doing a good job in trying to push things forward. You have powerful passion (a definite plus), but not always a clear objective (leaving me scratching my head in bewilderment, sometimes).</p>

<p>I have no complaints about you, you&#39;re one of the more trusted members of this community... I just figured I&#39;d let the others know what it&#39;s like trying to stay out of your way when you get active. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still do not understand what you mean? I always accept input from the other mods about any decision I make here. Sometimes after I toss an idea out there to the mods and get no input one way or another I will just do things and see the reactions. So far no one has objected to any of the changes I have made or things I have done. Yes, I do play with the CSS, but not in the same manner as ambiversive. Mostly just for flair and to tag websites with images instead of the generic picture not found icon. I have personally made quite a few thumbnails in photoshop for sites that show with blank thumbs or with ads. I do it because it looks better than the reddit alien with a camera and a question mark. </p>

<p>Long story short, there are so many mods here that we sometimes feel like we have to beat around the bush on certain things and they never get done. I am the guy who will actually take those ideas and try to make it a reality, and I guess that would be a reason for you to think that you guys need to stay out of my way. But in fact I crave input from the other mods. It&#39;s just kind of tough to get that sometimes when you don&#39;t have a working concept to show them. </p>

<p>This. It&#39;s the only thing I regret about my resignation. You kind of needed me (<strong>man</strong> I&#39;m a long-winded, chatty, talkative type. I love the discussions we had - I just felt like I was always dominating them, though.).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant every word I&#39;ve said here (the praises and the criticisms). </p>

<p>I believe that you <strong>are</strong> the defacto leader and I believe you&#39;re doing a great job. </p>

<p>And if you really take time to think about it you&#39;ll see I was trying to help you.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to be as active as you are, you&#39;re going to run into people who object to what you do and they&#39;ll be far less kind than I have been. As a moderator, you have bull&#39;s eyes painted on your back, your chest, and your forehead. Please take my mild criticism as a test run... for future potential criticisms (some of which won&#39;t be even remotely friendly). </p>

<p>You&#39;re not &quot;crazy&quot; and you&#39;re not &quot;shitting in our waters&quot; (the kinds of accusations I&#39;ve withstood for 3 years).</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t want to sound arrogant or dismissive or whatever, you still need to hear this as one of this community&#39;s leaders: If constructive criticism from a friend and ally has you feeling uncertain about your work, just think how it will be if someone comes at you with a rope and a mob carrying torches and pitchforks. </p>

<p>You&#39;re nowhere near this, but as a moderator... it&#39;s always a potential. And if it ever happened, you know who&#39;d be standing next to you, shouting &quot;I&#39;m Spartacus!&quot; at the top of their lungs, right? It&#39;d be me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of that episode of the Simpsons where homer has a guy name Karl come into his life and helped him succeed. Almost like a guardian angel. This is how I&#39;ve come to see you even before this conversation. I not only respect you, I look up to you. I hope to be as wise as you someday. You have helped me more than you know, and I am forever in your debt. Most people are never lucky enough to actually get a gift from Santa. Do you believe in fate, Token? I believe in convergence, which is that fate is real in the sense that for any given multiversal outcome there are several convergence points at which all possible outcomes for any given decision are the same. I have felt this inside for many years. I have also felt... Something. A sense of euphoria when I am following my fate and a disphoria when I run from it. Some people would call this simple reward pathways that are being activated/ignored, but it&#39;s more than that. I can tell by the feelings in my gut (literally) if I am following my true path or if I am just guessing. I have always been a skeptic about ESP and the like, but the more I nurse the idea in my mind the more I realize that we may all be psychic creatures, we just do not how to listen. Or I might just be experiencing the prodrome phase of schizophrenia. Lol. </p>

<p>And this is why you need to stay.</p>

<p>Powertripping at such a trivial level is the perfect place to learn to self-regulate. At least you&#39;re not banning people left and right (another &quot;power&quot; you have, but <strong>aren&#39;t</strong> &quot;diseased&quot; by &lt;-- THINK ABOUT THIS). </p>

<p>Stay.</p>

<p>You&#39;re on the path. The right path, in fact.</p>

<p>When I resigned, I did so trusting that you&#39;d emerge as the leader... with my full backing. The only thing you&#39;re actually struggling with is how to go about doing that.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m going to tell you now.</p>

<p>Lay a piece of string on the table in front of you. Make it pretty straight.</p>

<p>Using only one hand, grab one end of the string and try to PUSH it across table. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll quickly realize that doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>But, if you pull it instead... so that it follows you... suddenly, you&#39;re leading.</p>

<p>Peace, bro.</p>

<p>And best wishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that 9000sins is getting most critique here just because he&#39;s more active and attending than other mods. It&#39;s always easier to nitpick on those who stand out. When most moderators either prefer to stay in the shadows or would select their words very carefully, 9000sins often charges in head on. While by some this can be seen as a negative thing, it is in many ways an open minded and contributing quality, which in my opinion benefits community of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> greatly. It closes that gap between mods and subscribers and offers us content to work on together. Many of you could learn from that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I wasn&#39;t really sure how to characterize 9000sins. I didn&#39;t want to paint him as a cowboy gunslinger, but ... he does &quot;shoot from the hip&quot;. It&#39;s a needed and valuable quality, but a quality that needs to be exercised in moderation (or moderated by community input). I like the guy. I was just unsure how to convey his moderation style to the public. It definitely is a style... assertive, experimental... and will definitely draw in the community. </p>

<p>My &quot;nitpicking&quot; is a verbal description of those &quot;Nope.&quot; photos that frequent r/pics (you know... the ones where a guy is hanging from the side of a cliff with no safety harness). I may just be too timid about implementing new things and he isn&#39;t. He&#39;s gung-ho, that&#39;s for sure. And he deserves props for that. But... me... I&#39;m over here clinging to a rock and covering my eyes, saying &quot;Nope. Ain&#39;t happenin&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m certain he&#39;s currently the defacto &quot;leader&quot; of the group, and doing a damn fine job of that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Truth time.</p>

<p>When I came to reddit, 3 years ago, and started lurking, I was looking for a place to expose some people who had wronged me (yes, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/h9vxn/i_google/">Google</a> was involved, but so were a couple people I thought were my friends).</p>

<p>I strived, on a daily basis, to build my credibility here by getting involved in the community and such.</p>

<p>In the process, I managed to catch myself a stalker (the crackiswhack saga)... but I had to improvise a solution to actually expose them <em>as a stalker</em>. Because I&#39;d already deleted a few usernames, it was easy enough to just do that again and circle around from behind and catch that scumbag in the act. Which I did.... as part of the r/conspiracy moderator team.</p>

<p>While I was a moderator, I explained my circumstances (far more thoroughly than in this brief comment). I explained that I came here with a hidden agenda (one of spiteful vengeance). But... really... once I was on the mod team, all I really wanted was to make sure YOU GUYS weren&#39;t getting shafted by the new selections. I no longer had the urge to seek vengeance on my former friend(s)... or Google (since they have now officially abandoned the thing that was irksome to me).</p>

<p>But, I also found myself being forced to consider making a new username... because I&#39;m such a fucking ass sometimes. I&#39;ll gut and field dress a troll and eat it&#39;s entrails for breakfast, heart still beating, right in front of everyone... sometimes ruining an otherwise perfectly good post by someone else.</p>

<p>And, since I didn&#39;t want to maintain multiple usernames (I&#39;ve established myself as an independent being, separate from that superficiality), I figured the thing to do was to be thankful for what I was allowed to see, and to use what little reputation I had left to let you people know who your mods are.</p>

<p>Providence (and this community) was kind to me when Autocoprophage surfaced last week trying to drag my name through the mud. I was stupified by the amount of support I got from the community during that thread. Really... It reminded me of that scene from A Beautiful Mind, where all those people put their pens on the table... or when all the kids stood on their desks in Dead Poets Society.</p>

<p>Anyway... I figure I do my best work in the ethers.</p>

<p>If the community ever wants or needs me back as a moderator, I&#39;d be happy to try again (perhaps a generic &quot;conspiracymoderator&quot; username)... but ... I&#39;m not really needed as a mod (at least it didn&#39;t seem like it while I was there); the ones you have are doing a great job, all I was doing was spamming their inboxes with long-winded garbage (only once, out of the 10 or so times I questioned soccer&#39;s deletions, was I ever right... he just moves very fast. I can&#39;t keep up).</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m still part of the mod team in a way... I&#39;m pretty sure that if I ever pointed out something bad going on, they&#39;d be on it in a heartbeat. Likewise, I&#39;m comfortable that I&#39;ve earned a place of respect here in this community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting to read an (ex)mods view. For what its worth, you were a top mod and an asset to this subreddit, one of the more balanced mods i thought. I like the way things run around here <em>most of the time.</em> Often we, the 50,000+ subscribed readers, end up reading through a fair bit of mod-squabble in the comments. Sometimes its relevant, other times you should consider private messages, just my 1:50000th of an opinion. I check out r/conspiracy pretty much daily, like i said, i personally like the way this place is run, most of the time. Thanks for all the links to all the interesting shit i never knew existed, please don&#39;t mod to heavily......we&#39;ll downvote the trash and foolish BS between ourselves, thats what reddit was designed for, the good &#39;ol upvote/downvote. <em>Peas.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant every word I&#39;ve said here (the praises and the criticisms). </p>

<p>I believe that you <strong>are</strong> the defacto leader and I believe you&#39;re doing a great job. </p>

<p>And if you really take time to think about it you&#39;ll see I was trying to help you.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to be as active as you are, you&#39;re going to run into people who object to what you do and they&#39;ll be far less kind than I have been. As a moderator, you have bull&#39;s eyes painted on your back, your chest, and your forehead. Please take my mild criticism as a test run... for future potential criticisms (some of which won&#39;t be even remotely friendly). </p>

<p>You&#39;re not &quot;crazy&quot; and you&#39;re not &quot;shitting in our waters&quot; (the kinds of accusations I&#39;ve withstood for 3 years).</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t want to sound arrogant or dismissive or whatever, you still need to hear this as one of this community&#39;s leaders: If constructive criticism from a friend and ally has you feeling uncertain about your work, just think how it will be if someone comes at you with a rope and a mob carrying torches and pitchforks. </p>

<p>You&#39;re nowhere near this, but as a moderator... it&#39;s always a potential. And if it ever happened, you know who&#39;d be standing next to you, shouting &quot;I&#39;m Spartacus!&quot; at the top of their lungs, right? It&#39;d be me.</p>
