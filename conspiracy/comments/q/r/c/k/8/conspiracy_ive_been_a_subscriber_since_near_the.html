       We've been invaded by Stormfront and other explicitely racist groups.  They openly posted about doing it 2-3 years ago; how easy it is for an organized group to game Reddit.  Now half the posts are just "Teh Joos did it!".  I in no way support the policies of Israel, but generalizing that to a specific subset of humanity is baseless.
  Skepticism is great, but when its based on no information or on bigotry, especially when its obviously compelled by a force with ultirior motives, isn't skeptical at all!
  /conspiracy used to be a place with interesting people and interesting conversation (and the occasional agent).  Now its mostly assholes, people who paranoidly accuse others of being government agents, and racists venting.

       Good point, but I don't regularly look at /conspiracy alone.  I'm looking at what shows up on my first dozen or so pages which include /conspiracy, using whatever sorting algoriithm they use (which really doesn't suck as much as people say).

       Long time listener, first time caller? Welcome to the party! This is an issue for all of the moderators here as well. We constantly struggle with the balance between censorship and freedom of speech. We eventually landed on the decision that while we would not allow hate speech or racial slurs, we don't pull anything unless it borders on the obscene. Filtering posts on r/conspiracy can be a dangerous game. If you want your users to actually like you that is.

       That's what I mean. There is a certain point at which there is no question, but some of regulars here have pushed their limits to find out where the boundaries are. obviously racial slurs are hate speech and can not be tolerated, but beyond that the subject gets muddy. Our stance is to just ignore it if they aren't using racial slurs.

       I can't say that I see evidence of your concern. I'll tell you my take on this subreddit. It is one of the few in which someone can post criticism of Zionists or Israel without immediately getting snowed under by vile personal insults. Perhaps for that reason, there are regular posts here critical of Zionism and Israel. What I don't see here very often is personal attacks against other posters by those who criticize Israel, or aggressively insulting racial slurs. What you interpret as Stormfront, I interpret as valid criticism of topics often presumed to be taboo in most social media sites -- critical examination of issues related to Jews. The view seems to be on most sites that Jewish matters are absolutely forbidden and untouchable. This is not the attitude on r/conspiracy. We talk about the Zionist control of the media, the influence of AIPAC on Congress, and the waste of money that is "aid" to Israel. To me, that's a good thing, since there are so few venues that permit a free discussion on these taboo topics. And ask yourself, just who made these topics taboo, anyway, and why are they taboo?

       My point has been that while the discussion of the evils of Israel, AIPAC and Israel is reasonable, blaming everything on "Jews" is unreasonable and generalizes a bad trait to many who don't deserve it.  I am a white American, and I don't even have ancestors who owned slaves, let alone have anything to do with that system myself; yet people have tried to say I am somehow guilty for that.  That's as much BS as is associating Israeli manipulations and bigotry with half my high school friends, my grandfather and any number of decent Jews in the world with manipulation of government.

       None of us are guilty to the least degree of anything our forefathers did, or have been accused of doing. If one of my ancestors was Jack the Ripper (which isn't impossible) it has nothing to do with me, and I feel no guilt for the murders Red Jack committed. Similarly, Germans need feel no guilt of any kind for anything their forefathers may have done, or been accused of doing, during WW2. And today's Jews don't need to feel guilty because their forefathers precipitated the depression and hyperinflation in Germany during the 1920s that cost so many Germans their lives.

       That's not entirely untrue, but it kind of illustrates my point.  That was more a combination of some Jewish interests along with Junkers, a long existing caste of German society as well as other (mostly German) groups.  It's not that Jews played no part in it, it's that that's an oversimplification which too often leads to or is born from bigotry.

       Couldn't agree more.  Sam Jackson said something relevant recently on the Colbert Report (not that I trust Viacom or their shows for one second).  He said, "I'm not black, I'm not white, I'm a movie star.  I try to pretend it's not a big deal, but it's a pretty big deal."  Wealth and power, not race.

       I will admit I am not sure if you're kidding...  That's how bad it's gotten.  I'm not trying to say that criticism of Israel or AIPAC or Zionism is bigotry, just that bigots planned to invade reddit and succeeded primarily in this subreddit and to a much lesser extent in others.

       Edit: how many things do you see wrong with the statement "Jews run the world"?  I see many.  Jews are more prominent in many fields.  Hollywood (for sure), medicine, banking, etc., so why is it surprising that they are more prominent in the most important of world affairs?  It's not "Jews", which I can guarantee you means almost nothing when discussing the average "Jew", given their historical and ethnic dissimillarities.  I was raised Epispicopalian and I went to many Channukkah parties.  You know what what we did?  We played dradle, ate latkas, played pin the tail on the Donkey and did the Hokey Pokey.

       I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but i'll tell you why many conspiracy theorists drift towards anti-semitism. The first conspiracy theories involved Jews. "Jews poisoning wells to spread the plague!" "Jews trying to take over Europe after Khazaria was conquered!" "Jews are to blame for slavery!" (this one is designed to absolve "pure" white people from the horrible crime of slavery by tossing the blame onto the Jews) "Judeo-Bolshevism is out to take over the world!" "Jews are to blame for the depression!".
      </p>
      <p>
       White supremacist movements have always been notorious for their belief in conspiracy theories. The worst of them, the Nazi movement, based their entire ideology on conspiracies against the white race. The sad truth is that most conspiracy theories are outcroppings of right wing reaction.

       Or, to go one step further back, it's the basic fear of the "other" that has been used for political and personal purposes since time immemorial.  It's just well represented by the case of Jews because they have, in Western societies been perceived as and often been wealthy.  That and the current influence of Israeli policy over Western policy.  Also, banking (it's rampantly powerful), which is perceived as predominantly Jewish, which stems from a time in Europe when Christians were forbidden from loaning to other Christians at interests, which gave Jews, as a minority, a large usury income.

       One thing that reverberates through my mind is that we're not even on any radar. We're so ancillary that, at most, some computer bank in NSA has a blanket file on this whole website with all of our personal information - that has never been touched by human hands or seen by human eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even that doesn't really matter. We outnumber the self-appointed rulers a few million to one. They only have as much power as WE DECIDE they have. We've already won. It's just up to us to catch on. They certainly have; hence the clamp-down. This is a time to come together. Not split apart.

       When you say you've been here since the beginning, or there abouts, is that two months ago, or do you kill accounts like I do? Stormfront is entirely racist. They don't just hate Jews, and as much anti-israel content as I see here, I see very little actual anti-semetic content. There was a Protocols of the Elders post that a certain old fucker from the Simpsons put up last night, which I found weird, but it is topical and it was posted w/o any editorial opinion. Just a video. There are more important things to worry about, and more damaging presences than the Stormfront type. They are neither subtle, nor patient, and will out themselves quick enough.

       The key to conspiracy is to censor nothing, consume all, cross check, cross check again, bake at 350, wait for resonance and truth will prevail.  No doubt there are biased opinions here but remember, anyone who tries to hide truth requires more investigation.  Truth will always stand on its own.

       For someone who has been on here since it's inception. Be it racist, or any other rhetoric diatribe you should have grown thick skin by now. There are 50k subscribers now. Evolution has replaced you as the dominant prima donna species on the subreddit.  There is an unsubscribe button. Hit it and become your own subreddit and mod. Instead of whining to open minded mods who understand  the concept of free speech in relation to conspiracy.

       Couldn't agree more.  Sam Jackson said something relevant recently on the Colbert Report (not that I trust Viacom or their shows for one second).  He said, "I'm not black, I'm not white, I'm a movie star.  I try to pretend it's not a big deal, but it's a pretty big deal."  Wealth and power, not race.

       "their forefathers precipitated the depression and hyperinflation in Germany during the 1920s that cost so many Germans their lives."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not entirely untrue, but it kind of illustrates my point.  That was more a combination of some Jewish interests along with Junkers, a long existing caste of German society as well as other (mostly German) groups.  It's not that Jews played no part in it, it's that that's an oversimplification which too often leads to or is born from bigotry.
