<p>And then there&#39;s the problem of people just using zionist as a catch-all term for all jews, which is just plain insulting to all the innocent jewish people out there.</p>

<p>Are you calling anyone who criticizes Israel&#39;s actions an anti-semite? </p>

<p>Absolutely not.  In fact, my big issue with the anti-semites is that they tarnish legitimate criticism of Israel and make it nearly impossible to have an adult conversation about the subject.  That&#39;s why I suspect they&#39;re actually being paid by Israel, because drowning out intelligent criticism with crazy is much more effective than actually debating whether the State of Israel should be allowed to do all these illegal, warmongering activities.</p>

<p>Exactly. I am consistently disgusted with Israel&#39;s actions towars the Palestinians and saber-rattling with Iran but I come to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I&#39;m equally disgusted with all of the &quot;Jews are running the world&quot; crap. </p>

<p>I&#39;m consistently accused of being an Israeli shill (which I find hilarious because of my aforementioned disgust) all because I object to the thinly veiled anti-semitism that propagates the myth that we&#39;re all slaves of the zionist overlords. </p>

<p>The typically ignored reality is that while the 1% has jews in it white anglo-saxon protestant men control the script. Because most of the people in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are WASPs it makes much more sense to hate the jews than it does to hate ourselves. </p>

<p>The anti-semitism in here is an exercise in cognitive dissonance and scapegoating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously.</p>

<p>My point is that the so-called &quot;zionist&quot; masters of the universe who are running things behind the scenes to their benefit and your loss, don&#39;t give a shit about religion.</p>

<p>Either they have fooled you or you have fooled yourself into thinking that Jews/Zionists are the problem when in fact, old greedy rich guys are the problem and are made up only partly of people under a religious banner.</p>

<p>In other words, if you stop focussing on &quot;Jews/Zionists&quot; as the enemy and focus your anger on the 1% or even better the .1% then you will still be going after the same people but you won&#39;t be using the anti-semitic, xenophobic, and scapegoating language and making yourselves the bad guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I often find is that Anti-semites who hide behind the &#39;no-I&#39;m-anti-Zionist&#39; banner are very easy to spot... Just check their message history.  Look at the language they use. </p>

<p>And yes there are quite a few of them in r/conspiracy. </p>

<p>To OP&#39;s original question: yes. It&#39;s so much easier to discount the entirety of a group when the loudest of them are clearly batshit insane.  The question is and should always be &#39;who benefits&#39;? </p>

<p>In this case, &#39;who benefits from having a bunch of rabid anti-semites (what the average viewer would call an anti-semite) shouting - often belligerently - about how Jews are secretly running the world?&#39;</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly not r/conspiracy.  </p>

<p>Speaking of my own personal experience, when I first started coming here I was so turned off by the simmering (and sometimes blatant) hatred that I almost gave up on this place entirely. Luckily I stuck it out and learned some very interesting things.  Though I do wonder sometimes how many didn&#39;t and chose to leave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An anti-Semite, as the term is commonly used, is (among other things) someone who blames <em>all</em> Jews for the things Israel does. If you blame Jews for the things Israel does, you are blaming the right people, because, in case you haven&#39;t noticed, Israel is populated and run by Jews. It is Jews doing the crimes.

    <div class="md"><p>If you blame &quot;Jews&quot; for things Israel does you are technically correct but you are nonetheless correlating the actions of ALL Jews with the actions of Israel. </p>

<p>Whether or not this is intentional the result is the same.

<p>Not to say that this particular issue has any more weight than any other prejudice or hatred spread that divides the people, but it is a part of an overall xenophobic tendency of the masses which will ultimately be our demise.</p>

<p>Aside from that, wouldn&#39;t an anti-Semite be so for the same reasons that a person would be considered anti-black (or any other hate group)? In my mind, an anti-Semite would be someone who advocates violence or social disparity against Semites (in this context, Jews).</p>

Wikipedia says  semites are basically people from the fertile crescent &amp; levant (including Arabs and some groups of people further east).</p>

<p>So if an Arab says something anti-semitic, is he anti-himself?  Or is anti-semitic specifically only &quot;anti-Jewish&quot; and if so why is it not just called &quot;anti-Jewish&quot;?</p>

<p>For the longest time I thought Semite is another word for Jew until I looked it up.</p>

<p>Pride is a sin. I detest all pride.</p>

<p>I totally understand the double standard of black pride or gay pride being ok by society&#39;s standards and not ok when white people do it. Also, if people talk about black this or hispanic that or Jew this or what have you, replace their group with &quot;white&quot; and see if that is still ok to the public. Usually isn&#39;t. I&#39;m with you on that part.</p>

<p>But, typically, when people are making the argument (not saying you are) about white pride being ok, they&#39;re just racists. A quick look at their Reddit history proves it.</p>

<p>Totally agree. Really sick of this silly idea that Israel&#39;s interests = US&#39;s interests. And screw AIPAC.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>While I detest the wars, Israel is being used as a scapegoat for American imperialism. The US, through the UN, <em>created</em> Israel as a foothold in the region and to use as a scapegoat in the future. They are our pawns, not the other way around. And no, that&#39;s not ok.</p>

<p>Well, hey, I can&#39;t really see any of what you just said as strictly racist or antisemitic, albeit controversial to those unaware of the New World Order. I&#39;m just telling you to realize that they&#39;re a piece of a puzzle only. The picture is bigger and you&#39;ve got blinders on. We&#39;re both anti-Zionist and we both don&#39;t like the influence that groups like AIPAC have on our government and culture, but I&#39;m telling you that it&#39;s a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself. If we&#39;re using Israel as a stronghold in the middle east and as a scapegoat, they need to have the media push these ideas to let their plans happen.</p>

<p>He loves his people, and he doesn&#39;t want them to live in debt slavery and moral depravity.  He doesn&#39;t want his people to believe lies that lead to wars and mass murder of innocent people.  His fight is rooted in justice and truth.</p>

<p>at a conference about the Holocaust with a bunch of rabbis.  as you can see, they&#39;re applauding him for something.  keep in mind that 75 million people live in Iran, and that economic sanctions are being imposed against the entire country due to the supposed threat posed by this man.  oh, and the reports of possible construction of nuclear weapons appears to be in complete contradiction with reports by agencies of the U.S. government:</p>

I have to imagine the numbers of right-wing extremists have sunk in the last decade, and the amount of US neo-nazis outside of white power organizations in prisons has probably lowered a bit as well, but I still read a lot about neo-nazis in Europe, and especially in the baltic countries. Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia and Russia all have trouble with (actual, not the variety you use as an insult on the internet) fascist and neo-nazi movements. I imagine this probably has more to do with a lack of education, poverty and xenophobia than undercover agents, though I&#39;m sure you have those as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t bothered in over a year to try to post to a mainstream site like Yahoo News, but every time I tried my comments were moderated and never seen by the public. For example around the time that the Detroit underwear bomber incident took place there were several stories that involved companies related to ICTS (on Yahoo News). I attempted to make a few well sourced arguments (referencing sources outside of conspiracy oriented websites)  explaining that all of these incidents have a common thread of ICTS companies being in control of security. My comments were left in limbo and never approved. At the same time on the same articles I saw rather base and vulgar anti-semetic arguments posted and publicly diss-assembled. Yahoo News is one of the worst, but this can be seen everywhere. </p>

<p>Now that most news sites allow FaceBook login, and disallow anon type login, I wonder how long until most comments on news sites are tied to a real ID.</p>

<p>TLDR: &#39;JEWS ARE SATAN 911 THE ANTICHRIST&#39; comments are always allowed and publicly visible, while comments that lucidly expose Jewish organized crime and corporate abuse are filtered.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been labeled an &quot;anti-semite&quot; on several occasions. If having an extreme dislike for a large group of people claiming to be &quot;Gods chosen people&quot; makes me one, than so be it. There is simply no such thing as &quot;Gods chosen people&quot;. Besides, Palestinians have more Jewish blood than the people who call themselves Jews these days. Judaism is a religion, not a race, does that mean I too can be one of Gods &quot;chosen people&quot; if I become a Jew?</p>

<p>Jews are dangerous because of the importance they place on acquiring money. That technically makes them the most dangerous people on earth...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest problem concerning anti-semitism on this sub reddit is <strong>A.)</strong> some of you don&#39;t understand that there are a lot of Jews who could really give a fuck about Israel, hell they don&#39;t even care about the religion of it at all either, furthermore some of the biggest supporters of the zionist movement that pushes the protections of Israel are in fact actually Christians. <strong>B.)</strong> I think quite a few on here like mumblingbumbling are actually racists and when you hate blacks, hispanics, asians etc. the jews always get lumped in.</p>

<p>Do I think they&#39;re shills, no not at all, some of the biggest conspiracy minded folk are also the most racist by nature they suspect others and psychologically it is easier to dislike/suspect a person more if they don&#39;t share traits with you so for them it&#39;s natural to suspect anyone that does not look like them, talk like them, or act like them. Could a few of them be slanted like that, sure why not lets ratchet the paranoia up another level, but I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re just garden variety ignorant racists.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not get it misunderstood at all if Adolf Hitler lived in the modern era and browsed reddit he would love r/conspiracy because him and his cronies were all conspiracy theorists of their era look at what they were fascinated by, all of the occult and ancient supermen, weapons of ancient power, all of that stuff, and of course he hated the jews. If you dig further back the conspiracy theory of witchcraft had the Jews casting black majicks on people, or the Jews were responsible for the black plague. The gentile people have long been the single most persecuted people on the planet, that most can name off the top of their head, there is always a new theory or an old stereotype brought back on them, do they deserve it, no idea, I&#39;ll say this, look at wall street I&#39;m sure the greediest people there aren&#39;t all Jews. </p>

<p>My only real problem is Hasidic Jews, in NY these motherfuckers are untouchable, children are going missing in the 5 burroughs and the NYPD can&#39;t do shit because the Hasidic community are stonewalling them to protect someone, and that&#39;s if the case didn&#39;t have the diamond industries money thrown at it to cover it up already, I always have a problem when people are allowed to be above the law, including the cops themselves, someone needs to fix it and knock them down a peg and get these cases solved.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong> No pretty sure they&#39;re just racists and it&#39;s a basic trait from a good portion of conspiracy minded people because they are naturally suspicious of people and it is usually natural to be more suspicious of people different from themselves.</p>
