    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you exactly what I&#39;m doing, without angst, hate, or illusions;</p>

<p>I am preparing.
I am informing myself and others of the forthcoming potential crisis.
I am sharing my abilities with my neighbors, church organizations, and friends.
I am standing up for those who cannot stand up for themselves.
I am becoming more active in my community.
I am waking up and opening my eyes.
I am encouraging everyone to do the same.</p>

<p>Prepare a &quot;bug out bag&quot;, have on hand a decent amount of non-perishable food stuffs, and water.  Talk to your friends and neighbors, encourage them to have a family plan in place in case of a time of crisis.  Spend more time with your loved ones, and less time in front of a screen.  Think of things you may need to maintain a level of comfort in the event of a black out.  Be positive.  Be creative.  Be strong.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that things are going to get worse before they get better, but I am ready, are you?</p>

<p>This song was posted a week or so ago here, and it has had an immense impact on me.  I don&#39;t think the creators would mind if I shared it with you now.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>While I generally agree with this, there are indeed a few people that <em>do</em> see the error of their ways and are developed enough to acknowledge that they were wrong, and be appreciative of the help and correction.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t misinterpret, however.  Don&#39;t think I advocate some sort of methodology wherein you try to help others at any and every cost.</p>

<p>Ultimately, my stance is sometimes this:  Fuck others.  Help yourself.  If there are others that you can also help in the process, then absolutely DO so.  Help everyone you possibly can.  However, make sure that YOUR ship is in order, cuz you won&#39;t be much help to anyone if it&#39;s not.  Make sure you&#39;re things are in order, and if you can help others after, then do so.  If in the process of trying to help others, they shun you . . . then <em>fuck&#39;em</em>.  Let&#39;em dig their own fucking grave then.</p>

<p>However, I tend to have the &quot;Fuck&#39;em&quot; attitude only <em>after</em> I give a good effort to try to help them first.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s not the most horrible thing to do, but I personally would more than just throw out a casual comment or two.  I&#39;d directly challenge the knowledge that some of these people think they have.  That&#39;s just me though. :)</p>

<p>Absolutely.  Agreed.  Trying to talk to some people whose minds are closed is certainly easier said than done, but - again - you might be able to get through to some of them if you&#39;re ever up to it. :)</p>

<p>I think in the end it&#39;s going to come down to a choice. I don&#39;t know exactly what that choice will be though. But it will be a choice that will divide the world. There will be those that will say, &quot;Well, it&#39;s my government and I have to do as they tell me.&quot; And there will be those, like myself, that will say, &quot;Fuck that shit. I don&#39;t care who these people are. No way in hell will I do that.&quot; Again, I don&#39;t know what that choice will be. But that is where it will all begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with everything you said except the restoration of fear aspect.  If fear occurs, it should not be a direct result of what the 99% try to do.  What we should try to do is simply restore justice and fairness.  Fear invalidates and imbalances those things.</p>

<p>Get the manipulators out.  Absolutely.  Fight them if we have to.  But don&#39;t do it with the <em>intention</em> of instilling fear in them.  If they end up with fear, then whatever.  Fine.  That&#39;s on them.  However, our time and energy is much more wisely spent working toward the evolution of our being, our consciousness, our world, and each other.  Fear is the antithesis of that and we should work against it.</p>
