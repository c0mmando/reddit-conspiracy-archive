    <div class="md"><p>I read conspiracy for the things that are actually likely to be conspiracies, not for batshit-insane quasi-religious nonsense.</p>

<p>Examples of reasonably likely (hypothetical) conspiracies:</p>

<p>-Google, Microsoft, LG price-fixing scheme</p>

<p>-USA and media conglomerates use shady tactics to secure economic IP dominance and profits profits profits</p>

<p>-China working with USA firms to discredit whoever through whatever means, or securing technologies they wouldn&#39;t otherwise have</p>

<p>-Foreign agents from whatever country provoking unrest in unstable country</p>

<p>These are similar to things that have turned out to be true, and have potential benefits for the conspirators.</p>

<p>Things that are probably the same doomsday/NWO nonsense that is so kooky that it&#39;s a must-read throughout the centuries:</p>

<p>-Civilization X predicted end of world in year XXXX, conspiracy to keep it a secret/suppress those who know</p>

<p>-Secret free-energy technology, that is secret, but exists</p>

<p>-Aliens anything</p>

<p>-Clockwork gnomes</p>

<p>-Jesus still alive</p>

<p>-Elvis still alive</p>

<p>Obviously neither list is complete, and not 100% representative of anything.</p>

<p>But just saying, conspiracy just means a sub-rosa accord between several interested parties, not necessarily completely insane things that are going to transform the laws of physics or whatever.</p>

<p>And free-energy is both not scientifically possible, nor would it benefit anyone to keep it a secret. You could use free-energy to make more free-energy machines and just make more people or whatever, you might as well just use the word &quot;magic&quot; in place of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know. There is an energy cost of nickel transmuting into copper and releasing gamma radiation to produce excess heat without nuclear waste. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also talking about so called &quot;free energy devices&quot; such as <a href="http://www.callowayengines.com/msg3.htm">this:</a>
are also not possible. Assuming that the conservation of energy has to be preserved here (energy can&#39;t be created or destroyed) - which is correct. Where does this machine get the energy from to move 
around?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you a clue. They are only labeled &quot;free energy devices/perpetual motion machines&quot; if science can&#39;t explain where the extra energy is coming from.  </p>

<p>e.g. rocks billions of years old, are made up of atoms and the atoms have electrons that have been spinning around the nucleus for the same amount of time. At which point will scientists agree that the electrons are in perpetual motion?  But more importantly, where does the energy come from to support this motion for all this time? you just can&#39;t explain that...</p>

<p>Some finite amount of time is rather different from perpetuity. Nigh-wondrous efficiency is a great thing, but not something from nothing. So call it nit-picking if you will, but I get pissed when I see people still trying to &quot;square the circle&quot; of perpetual motion, though I do applaud <em>greater efficiency</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if something can run in a self sustaining mode while harnessing the energy from the environment, i.e. windmill, water mill etc then this is conventional free energy and not reliable or efficient.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, Exotic free energy refers to the artifacts of physics being utilised to harness energy from the &quot;ether&quot; or the zero point energy field. </p>

<p>Alow me to explain this zero point thing. When you look at an atom and dig deeper than electrons, neutrons and nucleus, you can observe random particles popping in and out of existence. This is known to conventional science as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam">quantum foam</a>. half of these particles have a positive charge and the other half of them have a negative charge. if you could somehow invent a machine or even identify a way to suppress the pos or neg particles then you have a limitless supply of energy.  </p>

<p>This natural energy form can be gathered directly from the environment (mistakenly called &quot;static&quot; electricity) or extracted from ordinary electricity by the method called fractionation. Radiant energy can perform the same wonders as ordinary electricity, at less than 1% of the cost. It does not behave exactly like electricity, however, which has contributed to the scientific community&#39;s misunderstanding of it. </p>

<p>if you have got this far then you probably want to know more about this energy, so read <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/freeenergy">this</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I can&#39;t emphasize this enough, but: 2nd law of thermodynamics.</p>

<p>That&#39;s out of the way? Good. Now the rest of this post.</p>

<p>Wind/water power <em>are</em> more &quot;conventionally&quot; efficient than other power sources, <em>in some situations</em>. You still have to build them, and <em>maintain</em> them. But even that&#39;s a paltry cost, compared to mining etc. There are however, other costs associated with them (I&#39;ll focus on hydroelectric, but the principles apply to the others as well). Hydroelectric dams have <em>huge</em> environmental costs, which eventually turn into dollars/rubles/yen/what-have-you. China&#39;s larger dams are increasingly convincingly being associated with the increased seismic activity around them. Because of the disbalance of water weight that occurs due to the required reservoir. Then there&#39;s the cost of the environmental effects of the diverted/altered water flow, and the downstream ecological effects. NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH.</p>

<p>Conventional, sound science critique done? Check.</p>

<p>Paragraphs 3-5: Not science. While I could leave it at this and let other redditors explain or not explain why this is so, I&#39;ll go the extra step. Yes, it actually is possible to isolate one to <em>a few</em> particles from this &quot;foam.&quot; What kind of energy <em>input</em> does it take to do this? <em>More than makes it economical to *</em>extract** energy from this &quot;source.&quot;* Same as with current techniques of hot fusion. Yes it&#39;s done, no it&#39;s not usable as a <em>source</em> of net energy at the moment.</p>

<p>Please, please at least read an introductory physics-electrical text, or the wikipedia article or something. Because while it is true that &quot;static&quot; electricity is a misnomer of sorts, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s some magical force that yields energy out of nothing. It&#39;s a misnomer - it refers to an accumulation of static <em>charge</em>, as opposed to a <em>flow</em> of that charge, in the form of electrons (usually).</p>

<p>And before you go indicting the &quot;scientific community&quot; in regards to their misunderstanding of bogus dilettante musings on the abundance of usable electrical energy, please do at least familiarize yourself with the actual theories that they expound, as many of them, most I dare say, are quite sound and have yielded just about all useful modern technology.</p>

<p>And I can&#39;t emphasize this enough: 2nd law of thermodynamics.</p>
