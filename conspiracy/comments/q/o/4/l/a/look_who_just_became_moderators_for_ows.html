<p>It won&#39;t be long now till that subreddit becomes a complete joke. </p>

<p>EDIT: I just got banned from <a href="/r/occupywallstreet">/r/occupywallstreet</a> for pointing this out! LOL!!
They are already censoring people. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/43zVK.jpg">Link</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Looks like the hate spewers are trying to fight back on their mock subreddit of conspiracy called <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and game some downvotes over here. Check it out!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/qogpb/rconspiracy_tries_to_convince_rsubredditdrama/">Link</a></p>

<p>Now look at who moderates that subreddit, anyone seeing a pattern here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw your conversation with Nebula. I&#39;m familiar with NYCGA. I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve been led astray. You can&#39;t make such a blanket statement about Occupy. I live in Brooklyn and have attended/participated in GA meetings, marches, and other direct actions. My girlfriend is a member of several working groups and regularly attends both GA&#39;s and Spokes councils. </p>

<p>Membership of Occupy is more varied than a freaking Benetton ad. It&#39;s a freaking sociocultural rainbow. Are socialists anarchists? Are unemployed bankers anarchists? Are schoolteachers anarchists? Are musicians anarchists? Are hackers anarchists? Are web developers and graphic designers anarchists? Are hippies anarchists? Are lesbian punk rockers anarchists? Are hairstylists anarchists? Are communists anarchists? You might say yes to some of those, and you would be right sometimes. There certainly ARE anarchists involved in Occupy. Even the term anarchist is pretty blanket -- not all anarchists have the same ideologies or preferred tactics. The whole point of the concept of the 99% is that it includes virtually everyone. So you can never say that Occupy is comprised of any one group. Except the 99%.</p>

<p>I and my girlfriend are not anti-anarchists, but to say that &quot;The Occupy movement is ran [sic] by anarchists...&quot; as you did in your earlier comment is a gross generalization. Why don&#39;t you attend some GA&#39;s for yourself rather than take Nebula42&#39;s word for it? I mean, who the fuck is Nebula42, and why would I or anyone take their word as gospel? Go somewhere in the real world, take a look for yourself, and make your own decision. The internet does not have all of the information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that there is much internal dissension at the moment, and one of the major points of contention is the use of black bloc tactics, which <em>some</em> anarchists condone, and which some Occupiers are staunchly opposed to. That still doesn&#39;t make the movement &quot;run&quot; by anarchists.</p>

<p>Even if some people are naturally more influential due to being charismatic or being generally knowledgeable and experienced, the process of decision-making within OWS is still fundamentally democratic; it may not be perfect, but at least they are trying to create a more effective model for how humans make decisions as a society. The point is to address injustice. We are setting our sights high. If that&#39;s idealistic, then that is by design.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really wish to be condescending, as I have no idea of your background. However, your ignorance of OWS is apparent by the way in which you speak about it, using phrases like &quot;high up connections&quot; and other things which imply a hierarchy. It would behoove you to not make sweeping generalizations about things about which you know nothing.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/o9gl0/what_has_the_occupy_movement_done_more_than_you/">where to start</a> with your last sentence.</p>

<p>Dismantling the power structure? Um, then why are they against Paul if he&#39;s the only one running trying to dismantle that very power they&#39;re trying to take down. =/</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and they make fun of Ron Paul. Because he&#39;s too patriotic for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s because their ego is so up their asses they can&#39;t even see the bullshit coming out of their own mouths. Real change will only happen when the masses educate themselves instead of falling short on ideology&#39;s like nebula. ~_~</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for the info bro. This only confirms what I have been finding about people like nebula.</p>

<p>I know our government pays people to astroturf, I&#39;ve seen the requests for bids for their persona software, but I just don&#39;t know. These people are so hateful, I just have a hard time believing that would be the government&#39;s approach, but who knows, I guess.</p>

<p>Either way, until I see some evidence of it, I&#39;m just going to continue to assume they&#39;re just fanatical. These fanatics do exist, and I just feel like professionals would be smarter / better at it. I could never match their intensity of their coverage (I don&#39;t have that kind of time) - but they pretty much get their asses beat in 1 on 1 conflict constantly. Instantly resorting to name calling and baseless personal attacks. (Like calling me an anti-semite, which if you knew me, you&#39;d understand why it&#39;s so hilarious)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The belief of the people who&#39;ve watched these guys for many years is that they are not directly employed by the government but rather are fanatic sociopaths who have been neocon-funded. On Digg they were active all during the workday - for 6-7 years continuously. At one point we calculated the labor required for all their posting - their activity requires spending large time reading many threads - and realized no one with a day job could be doing it (even in &#39;spare&#39; time) unless it WAS their day job. Not when it went on continuously for 7 years 7 days a week. Plus, they did and do serious amounts of side-channel communications, which takes a lot of time given the amount of it they do. All points to dedicated work team with an agenda to fulfill. They used to spend huge amounts of time daily harassing anyone questioning 9/11, and did it for years on end. So much of it that everyone found it obvious how much major time they spent on it, and questioned why anyone would spend many years on it. They were banned from Digg when they were found to be using tools to game the system to bury those with dissenting political views.</p>

<p>Their intent in name-calling is to wear down opposition and get opponents to waste time combating that rather than in productive effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m glad somebody&#39;s calling them out on their bullshit, but I don&#39;t really care about them or what they do.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a shame that they&#39;re so skilled at getting good-intentioned people to argue with them endlessly over nonsense, but that&#39;s normally about the extent of their accomplishments. They are trying to disrupt communication. By focusing all this attention on them, they&#39;re winning. That&#39;s how it is to be a troll.</p>

<p>I normally wouldn&#39;t give a shit at all, the only reason I said anything today was because I at least sort of give a shit about occupywallstreet and I think this deserves to be a bit of scandal. </p>

<p>Giving occupywallstreet to these pro-war pro-authoritarian psychopaths is like giving r/trees to the DEA, or r/linux to microsoft.  I think if the readers understood they would be pissed off and freak out. </p>

<p>While I&#39;ve seen these guys work on many many forums over the last several years, none of it has really mattered. Trying to troll 4chan, gaming votes on digg, these things just don&#39;t fucking matter at all. Genuinely destroying r/occupywallstreet is far and away the most significant thing I&#39;ve seen them accomplish. </p>

<p>OK, you&#39;re a petty, juvenile asshole who handles criticism and dissent by banning and who gets his jollies by making fun of a girl killed by an Israeli military bulldozer and by mocking children with Down Syndrome. </p>

<p>You are undoubtedly <em>the least</em> psychologically qualified mod I have ever run across and the only reason you <em>are one</em> is you and your asshole buddies started some reactionary hate-subreddits aimed at attacking other groups. You get off on abusing your petty power because you have severe psychological problems stemming from your bizarre family history. You love to scream &quot;Nazi&quot; and &quot;anti-semite&quot; and then ban people when you get your childish ass kicked in an argument. Someone once told you those words are magical and will save you from having to argue rationally. </p>

<p>When you encounter critics you always x-post to your hate-subreddits so your obedient vote-mob will come and quash any opposition. You cry about insults and ban people &quot;because they were using insults&quot; but you and your buddies are quick to resort to insults when you wish.</p>

<p><strong>Even now, as your <em>very first acts on your very first day</em> as a mod on <a href="/r/occupywallstreet">/r/occupywallstreet</a>, you&#39;ve banned multiple people.</strong>  There&#39;s the tangible proof you&#39;re a juvenile, petty, power-hungry, hypocritical asswipe.

We were having our second Tea Party protest during the first banker bailout when instead of the 20 to 30 we normally got, 5000 people all showed up.
I asked around and it turned out Glenn Beck had told all his viewers to show up and protest at the events around the country. We got swamped by a bigger group calling themselves the same and having different ideals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This raises the issue, just how active is cointelpro. It seems like no coincidence that these mods just so happen to disallow free speech while reddit as a whole lets these moderators set up free speech zones by censoring topics in the largest subreddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is not free speech.  Reddit is not democratic.  Reddit is an authoritarian control system that allows mods to act with no accountability.</p>

<p>This is built into reddit from the ground-up.  Every aspect of reddit is designed to allow moderators unchecked power over their subreddits, and administrators (and spam algorithms) the ability to censor and ban in such a way that the user is not informed nor has any ability to petition for redress.</p>

<p>Even the karma scores for submissions is bogus.  They manipulate the vote results to &quot;confuse spammers&quot;.  They admit this publicly.  </p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s not a government affecting the election results.  It&#39;s not bound by the constitution.  It&#39;s just a link site.  I know that, but I&#39;m just pointing out that reddit is not democratic in any way.  Any pretense of democracy on reddit is a fucking joke, and dangerous and distracting to legitimate discussions on the subject.  </p>

<p>If reddit were democratic it would not mask the name of the user who banned or moderated your submissions.  They would not allow ghost bans or ghost deletions of submissions.  They would force moderators to give a reason and provide notification, and a means of challenging, any moderation or ban.  There are a lot of things that would be required. </p>

<p>Reddit is not a place for free speech, and it is not a democratic system.  It is just an authoritarian power structure allowing moderators and administrators unchecked authority over their subreddits and the site as a whole respectively.  To pretend it is otherwise causes the confusion we are in now.  If we treat it like an authoritarian system then we can take actions appropriate for contests of power in such a system.</p>

<p>Reddit is a microcosm of our culture.  An authoritarian system masquerading as a free society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>jcm267, or Josh, was a strange child with no friends who mostly stayed in the house with his mom. He was removed from public school in the first grade after he was repeatedly caught licking the urinals and, as a result, he was home-schooled the rest of the way.  </p>

<p>He got straight A&#39;s in floor-mopping, dish-washing, laundry-sorting and ambidextrous masturbation which made him very popular with his two creepy twin uncles. Unfortunately, in spite of these high grades, he did not get accepted into college and so Josh spent most of the next five years posting on Digg and having sex with &quot;Pepper&quot; the family terrier, until it finally died in his bed, of a severe anal infection. </p>

<p>When Josh turned 27 his parents were so worried about his weird behavior, lack of friends and terrifying body odor that they sold all their beanie babies and bought him a mail-order bride from the Philippines. They bought the cheapest bride available in the catalog-$49.95 plus shipping-because they knew Josh really preferred anal canine sex since it was the only kind he had ever enjoyed and because they had not gotten much money for the beanie babies, which were heavily stained with Josh&#39;s saliva and feces.</p>

<p>To Josh&#39;s delight, the Philippine mail-order bride turned out to be a hairy 37-year-old lady-boy with a far bigger penis than Josh had. That was when Josh eagerly began to learn a few words in the Philippine language and how to deep-throat. He got straight A&#39;s in that too.  </p>

<p>to be continued...</p>

<p>But since they <em>are</em> moderating in subs they have no business in and they, presumably, KNOW this, would they really <em>give</em> a fuck that they get called out on it?  I mean they might just play the &quot;who me??&quot; card and turn the tables with &quot;you&#39;re just hating on us!&quot; guilt trip, you know?</p>

<p>Yes.  This.  This is exactly what should happen, and HOW it should happen.  Thank you, 9000Sins, for pointing this out.  It is a very, very valid manner to address this situation.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>EDIT:  But wait a minute.  Much as I agree with you . . . I still have to ask . . . How is it that THESE people ever got to be moderators at the OWS thread?  How?  Can <em>anybody</em> just be a moderator?</p>

<p>In a way. See how the mods are listed from top to bottom in a sub? If mod &quot;A&quot; is above mod &quot;B&quot; on the list then mod &quot;A&quot; can remove mod &quot;B&quot; (but not the other way around). Think of it as a pecking order. Mods at the top can remove anyone while a mod at the bottom cannot remove other mods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with Occupy is that it is politically correct left-wing, which means it won&#39;t touch the Jewish Zionist question, only the Zionist question, and only so long as it is pointed out that &quot;Christians are Zionists, too.&quot; </p>

<p>For certain factions of the left, Jews Marx, Trotsky and Chomsky are like Abraham, Isaac and Jacob for the fanatical Israeli Zionist Jews and Judeo-Christian Zionists...the Jewish patriarchs of their entire ideology. </p>

<p>Additionally, Occupy won&#39;t ever touch the Zionist-9/11 inside job for the same reason...too many Jewish connections there.</p>

<p>They also won&#39;t touch 9/11 because they are government worshippers who don&#39;t want Big Government completely discredited, but only their Big Government &quot;conservative&quot; opposition.</p>

<p>If Occupy ever won out, nutty, crypto-Zionist Jewish Commissars (easily as murderous as the full-blown Jewish Zionists) would be in the seats of power, just the same as they were in the early Soviet Union before the falling out with Stalin, and the purges.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Occupy is worse than the current neocon/neolib status-quo, but they are NOT free thinkers or advocates of Western civlization, true justice and liberty, and freedom of speech in any way, shape or form.</p>

<p>But like other factions of the far-left, they make a good temporary alliance to help erode the hoplessly corrupt and evil two party establishment.</p>

<p>Where did I say that? I&#39;m describing my opinion of its essence, and why its leadership refuses to touch the Jewish Zionist question or the 9/11 inside job question.</p>

<p>Some will say, &quot;it has no leadership.&quot; But what leadership does exist doesn not speak of Jewish Zionists (only and occasionally &quot;Zionists&quot; which ignores the neo-fascist Jewish racial angle) and shuns the obvious, which is that 9/11 was the inside job casus belli that has made all of these fascist ripoffs of the American people from Wall Street to Homeland Security and other Big Government crony capitalist and crony socialist scams possible. </p>

What it was was harassment that was trying to annoy people by telling them were banned from subs they would then get abused in via comments, and the subs had links for abusers to use inviting them to go harass the target.

<p>I think it&#39;s a shame that they&#39;re so skilled at getting good-intentioned people to argue with them endlessly over nonsense, but that&#39;s normally about the extent of their accomplishments. They are trying to disrupt communication. By focusing all this attention on them, they&#39;re winning. That&#39;s how it is to be a troll.</p>

<p>I normally wouldn&#39;t give a shit at all, the only reason I said anything today was because I at least sort of give a shit about occupywallstreet and I think this deserves to be a bit of scandal. </p>

<p>Giving occupywallstreet to these pro-war pro-authoritarian psychopaths is like giving r/trees to the DEA, or r/linux to microsoft.  I think if the readers understood they would be pissed off and freak out. </p>

<p>While I&#39;ve seen these guys work on many many forums over the last several years, none of it has really mattered.

    <div class="md"><p>I was there when it happened. I had been doing activism with a few groups including End The Fed,  Ron Paul Revolution and a couple other groups at the time. We were having our second Tea Party protest during the first banker bailout when instead of the 20 to 30 we normally got, 5000 people all showed up.
I asked around and it turned out Glenn Beck had told all his viewers to show up and protest at the events around the country. We got swamped by a bigger group calling themselves the same and having different ideals.</p>
