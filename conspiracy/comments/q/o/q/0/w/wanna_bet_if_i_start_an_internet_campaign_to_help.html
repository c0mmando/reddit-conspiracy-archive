       this whole kony thing is so suspicious and im not buying it one bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       so i would LOVE to help my country ( iraq ) because our government is crap and stealing all the money from the people and letting all the gangs do whatever the hell they want in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       stealing houses, yes houses not stealing things inside the house. they come to you and force you out of your house, if you dont leave, they will shoot you on the spot in front of your family, and then maybe shoot your family or rape them.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are NO LAWS in iraq and you can basically do whatever you want with no one to stop you.
      </p>
      <p>
       i would love to help the country but if i start anything i will be either categorized as an iraqi terrorist against the government and i will be wanted internationally, and probably deported from the country i live in right now, or the thing will not become viral or will get censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       who else agrees with me that the media will only let what they want happen ?
      </p>
      <p>
       you cant do anything at all if the "boss" doesnt want it to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       egypt revolution ? id love to think that the people actually succeeded cause they wanted to, if the boss didnt want it to happen they would have covered it up in a way and killed the revolution slowly. same thing with other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       who else agrees with me ?
      </p>
      <p>
       share your opinions and discuss please.

       thanks a lot

       I know it's touchy, but did Saddam at least maintain order when he was in power? How bad was his reign vs now which apparently allows people to steal houses and rape people with impunity?

       I really empathize with you on your passion toward your country. I feel the same with mine (USA) with it's corruption. Yeah you will probably be categorized as a terrorist  if not already ( I hope not) for being honest on your insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I'm afraid you will wind up with another dictator to establish control. Sort of what France went through with it's revolution, and Napoleon rising up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA was just fortunate they had an honest man in George Washington (and a few other fore-fathers) that refused to be a monarchy, and set precedents of the Presidency, and other government offices before they even became law. Even though at times he did have to use military action to suppress rebellion in some areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       However don't think we are not a few dollars shy of rioting here in the USA either if we ever slide into hyper-inflation. The system since Andrew Jackson has declined and become rife with corruption. Just like ancient Rome with Caesar waiting in the wings. Pray that it never happens because if you think we are agressive now. Caesars are more aggresive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your going to have to organize your own gang with weapons for now to cover your ass. Like the old west here. We have a saying "Those that have the guns make the rules". It's sad, but majority  of times very true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sad to say your not going to have peace for a long time IMO. I knew this would happen when we pulled out. You (not yourself,  but seems most of your fellow country men) have a democracy, but lack the ideals of a Republic with a Constitution. For an idea read about Greece, and it's democracy. Eventually always little gangs (city states) that warred with each other such as Sparta and Athens. Even when the Persians were defeated. They lost their common threat, and Spartan kings (dictators) ruled almost all of Greece through conquest eventually defeated by their own system of warring culture. Not much of a democracy was it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your country has some growing pains, and some are going to have to step up and be martyrs for the cause of righteousness of a properous revolution. Good luck with your endeavor and how you say. "May Allah be with you". Aloha oe'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I realize that you may not be in Iraq per say, but I think you get my direction implied.

       its a sad world we live in and the people who try to do right will be compared to much worse people and will have a very miserable like.
      </p>
      <p>
       kind of like how they blame a big portion of the USA's problems on "terrorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       i am now living outside of iraq, and i dont think i ever want to go back there, as much as i love my country it is not a place to live anymore, its a place for fighting and whos got the biggest "gang".

       piece in the middle east is not even probable anymore. 
we are living as servants and ass kissers to our governments

       Well I'm going to say a little bit more before hitting the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically A Constitutional democracy requires a certain amount of education for the general public. The USA had a hard time trying to get the Constitution established until a series of papers called "The Federalist Papers" were printed in and around local newspapers in the early colonial days of the USA. It was written to argue for the Constitution. After that local people had a better grasp of what a Constitutional democracy would be. Perhaps you should search and read up. it might provide you with some ideas on reaching your fellow country men. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay ( eventual first Supreme Court Justice) were instrumental in writing these 85 articles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't give up just because you left the country. Maybe they just need more education. I mean your country spent so long under the thumb of men like Saddam, and education wise lacked such freedom to pursue such other notions. That they are left uneducated on such democratic principles. It's like children who lost an oppressive father, and are left alone. They go off opposite end that they become just as destructive with their new found freedom. They need a better set of fathers to teach them and the USA was not a father, but just another oppressor at the time of it's occupation. We should have instructed. and educated better when the allies were there, and we failed that end. We were only concerned on profiting the war Military industrial Complex.

       Are you good at claymation? I would build some claymation robots and dinosaurs and make a movie about how Iraq is now overrun by them and no one is helping and the media does not want the public to know. Focus on a small child named Abdul who was lives off dino eggs and has to fend off raptor attacks after being orphaned when his Mom and Dad were androidized. Maybe have an interview with the Mom and Dad who now resemble microwaves.

       "My country is f3ck3d up. Help!" Is too broad, and well, everyone thinks their country is f3cked up in one way or another. So there is no shock value there. Alas, everyone already know that Iraq screwed up, so is hardly new to anyone. You need to generate a new conversation that the media can get behind, they like new stories. That is unfortunately how it works.
