        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>(Copy and pasted so the alignment may be a little off)</p>

<p>In 1898 a man named Morgan Robertson penned a book titled &quot;Wreck of the Titan&quot; about a luxury liner deemed unsinkable that was going too fast in the North Atlantic in April and hit and iceberg killing most everyone on board due to lack of lifeboats.</p>

<p>14 years later this fictional book would play out in real life exactly down to the name, with the wreck of the Titanic; but this time it would have major political implications. Some of the wealthiest men in the world were on that ship and some were opposed to the Federal Reserve and central banks.</p>

<p>FACT: JP Morgan funded/built the Titanic
FACT: JP Morgan was booked on the voyage but canceled at the last second.
FACT: Friend of JP Morgan, Milton Hersey, also canceled at the last moment and survived to build the Hersey food empire.
FACT: There were no red flares on board to signal to any boats for rescue. Only white flares that signal a party and that everything is okay.
FACT: It was the first ship of its kind with the ability to seal decks electromagnetically which could also seal people below deck.
FACT: The Captain Edward Smith was one of the most decorated Captains of his time and would have been totally out of character by avoiding precautions.
FACT: The author of the book was poisoned to death a couple years after the Titanic sank.
FACT: The Federal Reserve was formed the very next year.
FACT: The Astor Family was one of the richest families in the world and John Astor III opposed the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>Did JP Morgan get the idea of how to kill off the opposition to the Federal Reserve from a book written 14 years prior? This was a book titled &quot;The Titan&quot; published 14 years before the Titanic sank and look at the similarities.</p>

<p>Did they hatch a plan at Jekyll Island to build a ship to eliminate the competition? </p>

<p>Similarities to the Titanic</p>

<p>Although the novel was written before the Olympic-class Titanic had even been designed, there are some remarkable similarities between the fictional and real-life counterparts. Like the Titanic, the fictional ship sank in April in the North Atlantic, and there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers. There are also similarities between the size (800 ft long for Titan versus 882 ft 9 in long for the Titanic), speed (25 knots for Titan, 21 knots for Titanic) and life-saving equipment.</p>

<p>Beyond the name, the similarities between the Titanic and the fictional Titan include:</p>

<p>Described as &quot;unsinkable&quot; 
The Titanic was the world&#39;s largest luxury liner (882 feet, displacing 63,000 long tons), and was once described as being practically &quot;unsinkable&quot;.
The Titan was the largest craft afloat and the greatest of the works of men (800 feet, displacing 75,000 tons), and was considered &quot;unsinkable&quot;.</p>

<p>Shortage of lifeboats 
The Titanic carried only 16 lifeboats, plus 4 Engelhardt folding lifeboats,less than half the number required for her passenger capacity of 3000.
The Titan carried &quot;as few as the law allowed&quot;, 24 lifeboats, less than half needed for her 3000 capacity.</p>

<p>Struck an iceberg
Moving too fast at 22½ knots,the Titanic struck an iceberg on the starboard side on the night of April 14, 1912 in the North Atlantic 400 miles away from Newfoundland.
Also on an April night, in the North Atlantic 400 miles from Newfoundland (Terranova), the Titan hit an iceberg while traveling at 25 knots, also on the starboard side.</p>

<p>Sinking 
The unsinkable Titanic sank, and more than half of her 2200 passengers died.
The indestructible Titan also sank, more than half of her 2500 passengers drowning.
Went down bow first, the Titan actually capsizing before it sank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want to check out a much more interesting (in my opinion) conspiracy theory about Titanic, check out the switch theory between her and her sister ship, Olympic. </p>

<p>This has been disproven a number of times by historians of the ship (especially those in the technical realm, like Bruce Beveridge and Steve Hall, who wrote a great and extremely detailed book on the subject), but offers a fascinating read, none the less. </p>

<p>The idea goes that Olympic, after sustaining some major damage during her collision with HMS Hawke in 1911, cost the company several thousand dollars due to repairs and cancelled crossings. So the idea was that the newly completed Titanic would be switched to appear as Olympic and the actual Olympic would be sunk in the Atlantic, on purpose, for the insurance money on her maiden voyage. </p>

<p>According to the theory, the sinking happened sooner than they wanted, so the ships that were supposed to be nearby to save everyone weren&#39;t and it resulted in a massive loss of life. </p>

<p>There&#39;s another one about aliens, too. ಠ_ಠ</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I think the Olympic/Titanic swap is another important aspect of the story.</p>

<p>However, I think that only a few at the very top knew they were actually going to kill people. Sure, a bunch of underlings might have known that they were planning on sinking it, but most likely they believed the people would all be rescued.</p>

<p>However, JP Morgan and his cohorts likely took advantage of the situation, and made <em>absolutely</em> sure John Astor, Ben Guggenheim, and Ida Strauss didn&#39;t make it off (3 of the wealthiest philanthropists alive at the time, and likely the top 3 individuals in the way of a corrupt central bank).</p>

<p>In fact, they probably were murdered before the ship sank (I believe one witness reported seeing Astor&#39;s mangled body).</p>

<p>Oh and OP forgot to mention that Captain Smith was a Jesuit tempore co-adjator, which means he wasn&#39;t exactly a Jesuit priest but he sure as hell was in bed with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are SEVERAL eyewitness accounts from both crew members, ordinary passengers and even relatives of the deceased in some instances (like Astor&#39;s) that states both Astor and Isador and Ida Strauss voluntarily stayed aboard so that others could have their seats in the lifeboats. Someone even offered Isador a spot, so he could leave with his wife and he refused. If I&#39;m not mistaken, same for Mr. Astor. </p>

<p>Benjamin Guggenheim was also seen by several to be with his manservant, dressed in his best formal attire, to voluntarily go down with the ship. Morgan and others had absolutely zero knowledge it would play out like that. </p>

<p>Astor&#39;s body was mangled when recovered, but know one knows to what extent. He was also last seen in the grand staircase, which was hit the hardest when the ship took its final plunge. So I would expect his body to be at least somewhat mangled. </p>

<p>As for Smith&#39;s religious practices; I don&#39;t know much about them, so I won&#39;t comment on them. I will say that I highly doubt it points to a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Smith was not on the bridge at the time of the impact and had just as little knowledge as William Murdoch or Charles Lightoller on watch before the first officer who sighted the berg. No one could have known it would play out exactly like that. It was an extremely unusual calm that night, in which there were hardly any warning signs of a threat in the ship&#39;s path until it was too late. </p>

<p>The iceberg was just too close and the ship didn&#39;t turn far enough in time. Even the long held myth about the rudder being too small is rubbish and even if Murdoch ordered a full-astern, the engine room wouldn&#39;t have had it carried out in the estimated 37 seconds between the sighting and the impact. There&#39;s even a decent amount of evidence to say it was less than 37 seconds, which made it even more impossible. </p>

<p>To have the ship strike a berg, or anything, in such a matter as it did and on purpose would be like trying to replicate a hole in one on a golf course. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed, anyone who reads the Wikipedia articles on these individuals can find out about these &quot;eyewitness&quot; accounts.</p>

<p>However, I believe nothing about what happened that night (even these conspiracy theories). I&#39;m extremely curious about the event, as it dramatically altered human history and severely affected the psyches of the civilized world at the time...setting the stage for the infinitely more devastating events surrounding WWI.</p>

<p>But in response to the eyewitness accounts, if these folks went through the trouble of pulling off such a ludicrous conspiracy, wouldn&#39;t it make sense for them to pay a few people to say certain versions of the story, <em>especially</em> the families of the victims, who certainly would respond from threats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good point, but in this case, we&#39;re talking about four days after the sinking itself and less than 24 hours after Carpathia arrived in New York with the survivors. This is an awful short amount of time to get several hundred people to commit to the same story. </p>

<p>I prefer not use Wikipedia for the &quot;eyewitness&quot; stuff, as you said, but would like to provide transcripts of the US and British inquiries into the disaster. Fascinating, albeit confusing, and outstanding for piecing together an idea of what went on that night. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re thinking of slag and there was no different amount in that, than in any other ship coming out of Belfast at the time. It was more than acceptable by 1911 standards and doesn&#39;t mean anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An interesting article, but unfortunately, a few things need to be kept in mind here. </p>

<p>1.) Morgan owned the International Mercantile Marine, of which the White Star Line was owned by. This is because he was attempting to buy up as many Atlantic shipping companies as possible, because he wanted a monopoly on shipping. He had also tried to do this with US rail. </p>

<p>2.) Morgan routinely made last minute decisions concerning his traveling, and when you own the shipping company why not, right? On 31 December, 1911, he showed up at the last minute for RMS Olympic&#39;s departure to England (Titanic&#39;s sister) and delayed the departure itself. </p>

<p>3.) This was the only way to cross the Atlantic at the time, last minute cancellations were not uncommon. Just something to keep in mind. </p>

<p>4.) Again, this was the only way to cross, leaving without red flares, binoculars, with coal smoldering in the bunkers, etc. (all issues with Titanic&#39;s maiden voyage), for years up to that point. Regulations weren&#39;t that strict then either, so red wasn&#39;t the uniform distress code. </p>

<p>5.) Watertight doors had been placed on ships for several years up to this point, including several pictures illustrating those in Lusitania and Mauretania in 1906, during their construction. The sealing people below decks bit is just rubbish. </p>

<p>6.) Smith was the &quot;commodore&quot; of the White Star Line and arguably the most popular captain with the celebrity first class passengers on his crossings. That aside, no one could have anticipated the unusually calm conditions that happened that night. Not to mention that he left orders on the bridge to slow down and notify him immediately of any additional problems. Had the last two ice warnings been sent to the bridge, the ship would have slowed down. </p>

<p>7.) Don&#39;t know much about the author, sorry. </p>

<p>8.) True, but I wouldn&#39;t have any idea of how it played along with the Titanic disaster. </p>

<p>9.) Again, this was the only way to cross back then and it was the first crossing. Astor being aboard is more than likely related to that issue. Besides, there was no way to force him onto the boat and into that position. </p>

<p>Anyway, just a few thoughts. It is interesting, but in the end, seems a little far-fetched. </p>

<p>EDIT: Almost forgot; as for the &quot;unsinkable&quot; claims, they came about AFTER the ship had sunk. Only one or two sources had ever been documented up to that point as saying the ship was unsinkable and even then, it was listed as practically, as noted in the OP&#39;s post. It was afterwards, that the idea of everyone saying the ship couldn&#39;t be stopped that added drama to the entire tragedy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and if JP Morgan really wanted to kill a few wealthy individuals I&#39;m sure he could have thought of a better idea than spending millions on building a ship, just to try and kill a few wealthy individuals. There are a ton of other ways to kill people and they don&#39;t involve spending nearly as much money as it cost to build the Titanic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would refer you simply to Titanic&#39;s B-deck versus Olympic&#39;s to debunk that myth. </p>

<p>When Olympic first set sail, she was 45,000 gross tons. Titanic was upped from this, to 46,329 because of several revisions and enhancements from her sister&#39;s design, based on Olympic&#39;s first months in service. </p>

<p>This was most noticeable on B-deck, where an enclosed promenade was located on Olympic and the area was filled in with suites and a couple restaurants on Titanic. The argument could be made that since both ships started out with the same exact layout, Titanic was switched over and the area was just given that illusion on Olympic (posing as Titanic), but it wouldn&#39;t be accurate because there were passengers in those rooms and photographs exist of the private promenade suites (like that pictured in James Cameron&#39;s movie) on Titanic before the rumored switch would have happened. </p>

<p>There was also the matter of interiors. Every single piece of the ship&#39;s beautiful interior (this includes furniture) was stenciled with the ship&#39;s name and hull number on the back. In the past 77 years since Olympic was scrapped and her fittings sent to auction, every single piece has said &quot;SS OLYMPIC NO. 400&quot; on the back (this was painted on, by the way). Not a single one has said Titanic or her hull number of 401. All of these would have needed to be swapped out in the short amount of time allotted during Olympics visit to Belfast in March of 1912. </p>

<p>Lastly, there&#39;s also the bow and stern nameplates. These were etched with the names of each ship and would have been a massive undertaking to switch out, taking much longer (along with all the other work) than the few days Olympic was in Belfast for a thrown propellor blade. </p>

<p>One more for extra credit: the bridge wing cabs were flush with the superstructure on Olympic and extended out for better visibility on Titanic. Switching these would also have taken a day or two. All while so much other work was going on. </p>

<p>Also keep in mind that Olympic and Titanic were the two largest objects in the world at the time and both of them being together in Belfast at the same time (and side by side, I might add) was a huge story and photographed by several throughout the time they were together at Harland &amp; Wolf. It&#39;s also well documented that Olympic struck the ground while being pulled out of the Thompson dry dock and had to be put back in and checked over before finally leaving Belfast. With so many workers around and so much attention on these two leviathans, I&#39;m sure at least someone would have noticed something as huge as switching all of that stuff around. </p>

<p>As I mentioned in another post, Bruce Beveridge and Scott Hall have written a great book on this subject and puts this one to rest. If you want an EXTREMELY detailed account of all the technical things required to switch the two ships, I would highly recommend it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True that. BUT I do think the tides changing, ultra-wealthy corporations are beings called out and more and more people are realizing how badly they were lied to. There will always be those that are &quot;too busy to care&quot; about whats going on around them, but more and more are waking up now. Reddit is a big example of that to me, sure there are those who think theyre high and mighty for wanting Obama around (even though they don&#39;t realize hes controlled by the same puppet master as the rest), but there are also the front page posts calling out corps like monsanto. Our freedom to the internet is a huge tool for us to spread the truth, and its very clear that its terrifying to the elites. Just gotta keep the truth spreading, my friend.</p>

<p>&quot;Rumsfeld promised change but the next day – Sept. 11-- the world changed and in the rush to fund the war on terrorism, the war on waste seems to have been forgotten.&quot;</p>

During his voyage on the Titanic, Browne was befriended by an American millionaire couple who were seated at his table in the liner&#39;s first-class dining saloon. They offered to pay his way to New York and back in return for Browne spending the voyage to New York in their company. Browne telegraphed his superior requesting permission, but the reply was an unambiguous &quot;GET OFF THAT SHIP - PROVINCIAL&quot;. By a quirk of fate, the denial probably saved his life; as few men in first class survived the sinking.</p>

<p>The Astor Family was one of the richest families in the world and John Astor III opposed the Federal Reserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Astor couldn&#39;t have opposed the Federal Reserve since it had not even been proposed by April 1912. Maybe he opposed the Aldrich (National Reserve) Plan. Is there any evidence that he did?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The author of the book was poisoned to death a couple years after the Titanic sank. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the source given (the New York Times), &quot;Morgan Robertson of New York, the writer of sea stories, was found dead this afternoon in his room in a hotel here. He was standing when found, leaning against a bureau, on the top of which his head rested. On the bureau was a bottle containing paraldehyde, which Mr. Robertson had been using to induce sleep, and it was at first thought that death had resulted from an overdose.&quot;</p>

<p>Are you saying there&#39;s something suspicious about that? What would be the point of killing him? The book was reprinted in 1912, after the Titanic sank, to take advantage of the publicity.</p>

He went on to say some more ritualistic stuff how Whitney was murdered (found in a bathtub, death by water) and Davy Jones (monkey singer, Davy jones locker, death by water)....was all apart of some big fancy ritual. Also that the Concordia was torpedo&#39;d at the same spot the titanic was hit, by an iranian sub, given locations of every ship in the Mediterranean by an officer in nova scotia, who relayed the info to the Russians, to Iran. The officer is on trail now for foreign espionage. Crazy stuff! I tried to sum up what I heard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s get down to it.</p>

<p>It is clear, the Global Elites are celebrating the sinking of the moon goddess ship because It was a success for them. Because the Titanic sunk, The Federal Reserve was born the following year in 1913, along with the IRS, which was used to take over the entire world through the FIAT CURRENCY of the FEDERAL RESERVE. The IRS celebrates the sinking the sinking of the TITANIC every year, by accepting your TAX dollars that are due the same day the Titanic sunk. Coincidence? Think again !!!</p>

<p>Yes, on April 15th, your TITANIC income TAXES become deadline due. If you don&#39;t pay, you will face the strong arm of the IRS. So if you don&#39;t celebrate the sinking of the Titanic by paying your slave labor taxes, you can lose your house to the same organization that intentionally sunk the Titanic, the International Bankers ruled by the Catholic (Universal) military of Jesuits, Templar Knights, and Knights of Malta, fronting themselves under the guise of FREEMASONRY.</p>

<p>I shouldn&#39;t have to say this, because it is obvious unless you are still asleep, but if you have to pay TAXES ON YOUR LABOR, YOU ARE A SLAVE, NEGRO!</p>
