<p>There are people who claim that explosives were planted, the plane passengers did not exist, there were no planes etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see. I don&#39;t know about all the scenarios, but I do see how it could be pulled off with less than 100 operatives. (19) hijackers, (and this is assuming they are all in on the real plan), 2-3 teams of say 10 members each (30) planting explosives, for a total of 50. Leaves us with 50 to perform other loose end tie-ups. </p>

<p>I have heard that it has been possible to over-ride command control of commercial airliners remotely for some time, supposedly so something like the 9-11 attacks could not occur, but I don&#39;t know if that is a fact. If it is then I&#39;m guessing the total number of hacker/controllers to be no more than like 10. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can think of one explanation. 
One company was contracted to make a metal primer with a specific formula. Company 2 applies that primer. Company 3 makes a paint that goes over that primer. Company 4 applies that paint.
Company 5 installs cat 5 cable which is normally run in channels close to the metal columns of buildings. Company 6 installs fire retardant foam that was formulated by company 7 that covers the metal columns, primer, paint, and cat 5 cable. Company 8 installs the new computers that were made by company 9, Company 10 is given instructions on how the computer network is to be connected and laid out. Some guy in a room in front of a networked computer runs a command at a particular time that causes the network cards in the other computers to send a particular amount of current through the network cables, That causes just the right wavelength to be transmitted to just the right junctions in the network, that are just close enough to the columns of the building, that are coated with just the right materials, to catch fire and burn at just the right temprature.... But I am an extremely gifted writer, with a wild imagination. Or I am one of the very few people that knew what all ten different companies were really putting together for me...     </p>

The Manhattan Project also serves as an excellent example of thousands of people (130,000+)silently working on a covert operation. Only a handful of people involved were completely aware of the mission of the Manhattan Project.

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. The Manhattan Project was the largest ever undertaking in the history of the US at that point in time. They constructed the biggest industrial park the world had ever seen and, as said above, was populated with 130,000 + workers. At its zenith approx 25 people new its true purpose and final aim. With all the easily available evidence online and just a Google search away anyone who has any reservations about whether 9/11 was an inside job or if it was &#39;allowed&#39; to proceed is bringing their own bias into the debate. It is glaringly obvious to anyone who isn&#39;t blinded by patriotism that an awful lot of the facts are in fact not facts. The Iran/Contra affair was a huge scandal and that took years to get the actual truth out into the open and even then I personally do not believe that we know all of the facts in that case as well. Independent scientists have found traces of Thermite and Nano-Thermite in debris from the two towers and WTC 7 and I wonder why the Gov didn&#39;t even try to examine the wreckage? &quot;The bigger the lie, the easier they will believe it.&quot; Adolf Hitler. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many also don&#39;t grasp the continuum of &quot;Imagine, Think, Believe, Know&quot;. Any conspiracy theorist who claims they &quot;Know&quot; how something happened <em>must</em> have conclusive evidence and first-hand sources of information. Saying one imagines that something could happen some specific way is not a conclusive statement, it is in no way an evidence-based theory. Denouncing the &quot;I can imagine a scenario&quot; statement is intellectually dishonest. It is essentially the same as discrediting one who asks a simple question, because to imagine that something <em>could</em> happen a certain way is akin to a non-conclusive question, not explicitly theorizing(claiming knowledge of) exact events. </p>

<p>Applying the Trivium of classical liberal arts here, we would look at what one could possibly <em>know</em> about 9/11; what is conclusive and provable... The official story is merely an example of the appeal to authority logical fallacy, and is in no way conclusive, based on the entirety of knowledge about the subject of physics. With that said, there are also known physical properties of steel and documented, photographic evidence showing molten steel in the rubble of the towers. Piecing together such known facts with understandings of historical evidence about the US government conducting false-flag operations, psychological operations for reactionary propaganda, and then posing a fallacious solution (hegelian dialectic), one could very logically posit a statement of their imagination about 9/11. One could certainly ask questions based upon these facts, drawing from their imagination (limited knowledge set) and maintain intellectual validity. So go on and attempt to trivialize the questions asked, or the potential imagined scenarios about the official story of 9/11 because these people never claim to <em>know exactly how it all happened</em>. Ultimately, you are supporting an Argumentum ad Verecundiam, which is intellectually dishonest, and therefore makes you appear foolish. Carry-on, ass-wipe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, your OP has Fail written all over it.  Regardless of what can or cannot be explained, the fact of the matter is that THE OFFICIAL STORY <strong>CANNOT</strong> HAVE HAPPENED.  It&#39;s literally impossible according to the laws of Physics for the story the administration gave to be true.</p>

<p>That <em>alone</em> is enough to cause <em>any</em> sane, thinking individual to understand that something very, very heinous is being hidden.  Does this mean that everybody <em>does</em> know exactly what did happen?  No.  Not likely.  However, that no one seems to have an <em>exact</em> story perfectly clear still does not in any way invalidate the fact that the administrations story is SO entirely inaccurate that it shows and proves that something extremely manipulative (and murderous) took place.</p>

<p>911 was literally just another in a <em>long</em> string of premeditated false flag attacks that have occurred for over a century in this country alone.  Here.  I&#39;ve posted this already on various occasions on here, but it obviously bears repeating:</p>

<p>U.S. CONTRIVED/FALSE FLAGS:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>1898 Spanish American War</strong>
The USS Maine - a US ship anchored near Cuba - was sunk and blamed by the US on the Spanish, who denied it.  US went to war w/Spain in order to control the Carribean area.  A century later, America acknowledged that the Spanish never sunk the USS Main.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1915 WWI</strong>
The USS Lusitania was sunk by a German sub as a result of the US covertly leaking information to the Germans that the USS Lusitania was carrying war time weapons and was a threat to them.  Wash and repeat the problem, reaction, solution cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1941 WWII</strong>
Pearl Harbor - the US instigated Japan for two years and did nothing when the US received information that Japan was finally going to attack in retaliation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1965 Vietnam War</strong>
Started because of the Gulf of Tonken incident:  North Vietnamese boats were accused of attacking the US boat Maddox.  Secretary of Defense Robert Macnamara later openly confessed that the attack on the Maddox itself actually NEVER took place.  &quot;Events afterward showed that our judgement that we had been attacked that day was wrong.  It didn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1990 1st Gulf War</strong>
US secretly tells Sadaam that they have no problem with him attacking Kuwait.  Sadaam (Iraq) therefore invades Kuwait.  US (Dick Chaney) tells Saudi Arabia (Kuwait) that 200,000 Iraqi soldiers are amassing behind their border.  Saudi Arabia, in fear, grants the US permission to establish military bases in Kuwait to defend them against attack.  America covertly sells Saadam chemical weapons and allows him to use them against his own people.  His atrocities get shown in the US news, the public buys it, and now allows US to go to war w/Iraq.  Later American intel reveals that there were, in fact, no Iraqi troops at the Kuwaiti border.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2001  September 11th Attacks</strong>
World Trade Center attacks erroneously blamed on Al Queda - an organization the U.S. actually created and funded - allowing the U.S. to go to war in the middle east.  Evidence later reveals flaws in the government&#39;s own account of the attacks, proving that &quot;The Official Story&quot; on the administration&#39;s part was literally physically impossible.</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a neighbor who worked remotely whose offices and computer systems were located in the WTC.   2-3 weeks prior to 9/11, he lost all access to machines located in the WTC for hours due to &#39;power problems&#39;.  The computer systems have generators, battery backups, etc.  It was a highly redundant environment designed for 5 9&#39;s reliability, and it went down.  This was the only time they had downtime of this sort in the 8 years he had worked there.  I didn&#39;t get the significance of that when he first told it to me, and I&#39;ve since moved away (so I can&#39;t ask him to do an AMA).   I heard this from him the day after 9/11, before I&#39;d heard anything about it possibly being an inside job.    I&#39;ve since read other accounts of power outages throughout the WTC in the weeks prior to the attack, but the unsolicited information I received from him definitely corroborates the validity of the information I read.  I&#39;m convinced that a person exists or existed at one point in time that did cut off the power in parts of the WTC for some period of time in the weeks leading up to 9/11.  It would be great if that person would share the details of their experience, even if they believed their actions were unrelated to the eventual events of 9/11.</p>

<p>I agree with other posters that it wouldn&#39;t take thousands of people with knowledge of the event to pull it of. Especially since the official version of the story didn&#39;t take thousands.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen video of people who have supposedly attempted to speak out but have been harrassed into staying quiet.   Additionally, if anyone was involved, what incentive would they possibly have for sharing what they know?  They are guaranteed to be treated poorly at best.   People are treated poorly for even questioning the very basics about 9/11, the life of a whistleblower with real information would be much more difficult.</p>

<p>This is video of at least one person who appears to have spoken out related to events pre 9/11, although I have not done any follow up to verify any details:

    <div class="md"><p>So far, acntech, you&#39;ve sounded like your average rubber band skeptic. Instead of looking for your own evidence and making your own assumptions based on it, you&#39;re just attacking other people&#39;s viewpoints as if they are wrong purely because you don&#39;t believe them. The fact that you&#39;re unaware that people have spoken out in their masses about 9/11 (this isn&#39;t even hard to find), and that you have no idea about compartmentalisation (see: NASA), tells me that you&#39;re not really ready for a debate about the subject.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve actually taken the time to delve beyond than &quot;conspiracies are stupid&quot;, then you can be taken a bit more seriously.</p>
