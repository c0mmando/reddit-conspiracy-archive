<p>Is incorrect.</p>

<p>Seriously, nothing in there is incorrect.</p>

<p>Also, what makes you think he wasn&#39;t caught two months ago and has been blabbing since? You just assume that since he&#39;s worked with the FBI he was in it from the beginning and this was their ultimate goal. More likely his arse fell out once he got caught and ratted the others out in exchange for less punishment.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what happened, but it didn&#39;t happen two months ago. It happened in June. From this you can assume that the FBI knew about each LULZSEC operation since and at least chose not to stop it. At the worst, &quot;collaborating&quot; could have been inciting illegal behavior the FBI wanted to occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. It&#39;s cool op turned out to be partially right I suppose but by all accounts Sabu was caught and went belly up for the feds to curb his punishment. His cohorts who are being charged because of his compliance with the feds would certainly lead one to believe lulzsec as a whole wasn&#39;t a federal guise. </p>

<p>Besides from what I gather most of the influential hackers from lulzsec and anonymous were smart enough to cut ties with Sabu after his week or so disappearance.</p>

<p>Not only is it an obvious honeypot, with easily placed &quot;leaks&quot; filled with misdirection &amp; disinfo; not only is it a siren call for authentic leaks that can thus be filtered &amp; authentic whistleblowers flushed into the open for neutralization.</p>

<p>In fact, Assange himself has the strangest background, with a mother connected to an actual Australian MIND CONTROL CULT tied to the CIA.  How strange and curious that this fact is so little known and so little reported:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s well known and well reported. He mentions the problems he and his mother had and how he had to move a lot to avoid them. He also talks about how he feels the police or someone within a government institution worked with the cult to locate his mother.</p>

<p>He was also in trouble for sedition in Australia, operated one of the first public access chat and internet bbs&#39;s called Suburbia, was well known in the hacker circles and was a free speech advocate back when I first met him online some time in the late 80&#39;s.</p>

<p>I am not saying he may not have changed, but back then the circles he was moving in were legitimately counter culture and his actions within wikileaks are inline with the personality I had ascribed to him in our brief minglings online.</p>

<p>In September 1991, Mendax was discovered in the act of h**** into the Melbourne master terminal of Nortel, the Canadian telecommunications company.[2] In response the Australian Federal Police tapped Assanges&#39; phoneline and subsequently raided his Melbourne home in 1991**************** He pleaded guilty to 25 charges of h***** , after six charges were dropped, and was released on bond for good conduct with a fine of A$2,100.[2][54] The judge said &quot;there is just no evidence that there was anything other than sort of intelligent inquisitiveness and the pleasure of being able to—what&#39;s the expression—surf through these various computers&quot;[2] and stated that <strong>Assange would have gone to jail for up to 10 years if he had not had such a disrupted childhood.</strong></p>

<p>The logs also reveal that the group began a campaign of disinformation around LulzSec.
