       Well done for keeping a note of that but I'm not sure how relevant this is. If you watched the film and payed attention they said that Kony had since moved out of Uganda. Their push is not to militarise the region, but to send advisors to help and possibly train the military for whichever country he's hiding in and get him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I'm all for being guarded and skeptical about things that catch fire so quickly, but this entire movement has the potential to really spark something far more important than capturing one criminal. It will highlight the ridiculous selfish nature of the American governments foreign policy, it will expose that for these people to be heard, they had to put themselves at great risk, spend lots of their money and EIGHT years of their lives to get them to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a potential watershed moment. Immediately sticking your skeptic hat on and assuming the worst isn't always the best option. This is people acting OUTSIDE the government, outside the UN, getting this shit done themselves. The real reason why this spread so quickly is because what these people have actually achieved is nothing short of amazing.

       The Charity's goal is to raise awareness and get this guy captured through official means. This has meant that they needed to play by the official rules. As we all know, politicians only care about what gets them payed or keeps them elected. With this in mind, Invisible Children have to make this an issue that people are passionate about. The best way to do that is to do what they did.

       Where else do you propose they throw that money? Into arming local militia? That is seriously dodgy territory. I do admit that that number sounds large, where did you get that statistic from?

       There is such a thing as just military action. If America truly wants to get it's head out of it's ass, leading by example is a far better use of resources. The america that the media and government would like you to think was in charge, would fight for a nobel cause.
Instead they are the bullies of the world, so when a country asks for help, and there's nothing they can get out of it in return, they do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they're not asking for troops on the ground either, just the training and advise of the US military. This is not simply suggesting a military presence, just military aid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and your point about Uganda's oil is moot as Kony isn't in Uganda any more.

       I would post this reply somewhere out there, but I am sure my words would go unheeded, so as always, I'll have my say here. I watched the video yesterday. For a moment I was thinking of sharing it, but I figured that there were few odd things in it. After some consideration I decided to wait and analyse the thing more through-fully before doing or saying anything on the matter. Good to know I wasn't the only one being sceptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first thing that struck me as odd was the way video seemed to promote Obama and how the U.S. military was involved in Uganda's affairs. I also noticed that the video was aimed specifically towards Americans, despite that this movement was supposed to be global. Although something like that shouldn't be a reason by itself not to help people.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I would like to support the abused nations such as this, I realize perfectly well that the best way to help them is by helping ourselves first. Under current economy industrial countries profit from developing countries and have ended up in slave-master relationships. As tragic as it is, providing knowledge, information and means of protecting themselves would be unprofitable to industrial countries and even dangerous to status quo from the militant perspective. There's no one but ourselves and our system to blame for the atrocities and poverty that goes on in this world. In my opinion simply the most overlooked fact in the world is that the right course of action is most often not to fight the problem itself, but to stop that which is causing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all the commercialism and money revolving around the Kony -movement, I am sure that these people mean well. I agree that people such as Joseph Kony need to be removed from position of power, however, making that an agenda for U.S. Military would be just another Saddam Hussein or Muafar Gaddafi chase. America is intervening too much into affairs of other countries as it is. If we wouldn't see everything as a competition, we would be helping these people to establish their own working governments with the power to protect their own citizens. What I think happened with the whole Kony movement is that originally it was a well intended, but that at some point U.S. military decided to rush in and use it for their own goals. It's plausible that the organization saw it as a helping hand, unaware of participation into another war game.
      </p>
      <p>
       People often want simple answers to complex problems. While it's easy to point fingers at the 'bad guys', the true enemy is always faceless. I am sure that Kony -movement has done a lot of good as well, so please don't lose all hope in the charity. Remain sceptical and questioning, but don't let it prevent you from helping people and trying to make the world a better place to live in.

       THIS. While watching I also noticed this and thought it funny it went viral during Super Tuesday. I wouldn't be surprised if Obama 'stepped up' and did something about this to make his numbers go up. Hmmmm...

       The US government is smart, it knows if it just suddenly invaded people would freak. The US doesnt normally do that, but by appealing to the masses as a 3rd party. (college students with bad acting) they seem to have gotten everybodys long hard dick for justice, and oprah etc going, and now the people will beg them for an invasion they already planned, to acquire oil. diamonds etc

       I still think the purpose and cause is in the right place.. Kony is a brutal murderer and we need to stop him. The video tells you straight up that Uganda is relatively safe now, and Kony has moved on.. But he still needs to be stopped. They also say there are a shit ton of bad cats around the world, "But we have to start somewhere".
