       That's a lot of work man. Maybe when I get home I can do this, but you are asking a lot. I am all about being open and transparent, but that requires me clicking on every single link that was removed, copying the address, and pasting the address into the comments in [this](format, with one more character at the end. I had to post this in 4 different segments already because it exceed the 10000 character limit. This would require me to shorten and revise all of these posts and split this list into 6-10 parts. Do you see why this is a lot to ask?

       I think you misunderstood. My point was that I would prefer that links not be deleted at all and just leave it up to the subscribers here to decide whether they are  worthwhile reading. One of the most important conspiracies regularly discussed here is how government and MSM control what information is disseminated to the public. IMHO, by engaging in any form of censorship, the mods here are emulating what governments and the MSM do. It's a slippery slope that always ends badly.

       Well there are one or 2 that I removed because of malware threats. That qualifies as an exception. We also have a set of rules here in the sidebar. If people follow the rules than they most likely will not have their posts pulled. Then there are the shadow banned accounts. All of their posts show in that list too. There is more to this than meets the eye sometimes. I try not to remove posts based on quality because I let the users decide. But when cleaning the spam filters is pretty pretty much the only time I remove any post. I don't pull posts randomly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that a hands off approach is best. I love r/conspiracy and I would hate to see tons of censorship here. The current team is doing a great job IMHO. Some of us are more active than others. Soccer is our spam filter cleaner so he may appear to be removing more than the rest, but he is on the up and up.

       Thanks for letting us know. In light of recent happenings on other reddits, it's nice to have some transparency. Some of these I agree with getting pulled (the fake Alex Jones AMA for example) and others not so much. I understand there's more than one mod for this subreddit so all in all I think you've done a good job of being consistent and letting the sub run itself for the most part.

       We are trying really hard. It honestly hurts my feelings a little bit when people suggest that we are being devious or deceptive. I understand the skepticism, but this is like the third or fourth time we have had posts like this since I became a moderator. If anyone needs help with anything you can always pm me and I will try to help any way I can. I took this position to prevent this sub from becoming corrupt, not to censor anyone's voice.

        /r/conspiracy

       , haven't been getting any traction at all lately. The mods? Or a cabal hanging out here to vote down info the plutocracy doesn't want known (this is

       That's how it works. You can see the submission, anyone with a url to your sub can see it, but no one clicking on r/conspiracy or reddit.com will see it.

       We've talked about open access to the mod log, not sure what the final reason was for not opening to all, might have been a technical limitation or maybe the admins won't allow it (it could be used by spammers to their advantage).

       Please do bring it up, it has never been an issue in this sub in the past but one of the mods pulled an active post a month ago with no explanation. To my knowledge that had never happened before, and also it's been about a month or two since you guys got in why not air out what's been going on? I thought the point of all the new moderators was for more community interaction.

       And a Reddit admin pulled one of my posts and would not reply to a mod who asked about it. Not only that, the admin shadow banned me.  It was peculiar to the mod and to me at the time. The post had not been egregious, either, it just noted that a well-known troll was probably mentally ill.

       It goes back to early Jan 2012.  I've gone through the mod logs manually looking for the missing post you describe in other comments in this thread, but that's taking too long. So.. I exported the list of all removed posts.

       thanks.  Here's the code.

      <pre><code>sed 's/&amp;lt;\/tr&gt;/&amp;lt;\/tr&gt;\n/g' ./foo.txt | perl -ne '/time title="(.*?)".*?mod=.*?&gt;(.*?)&amp;lt;\/a&gt;.*?(&amp;lt;a title.*?&amp;lt;\/a&gt;)/ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; print "$1 $3&amp;lt;p&gt;\n";'

       Just visit the mod log, view the source, copy the last line with all the content into a text file, and repeat for as far back in the mod log as you wish to go.  Then, run this against the text file and poof.  Paste into an HTML-compatible pastbin and share.

       Please keep in mind that if the OP deletes their own post, the moderators cannot retrieve it. The only way to retrieve a post deleted by the OP is for someone who actually commented on it to provide the link from their account overview to their comment[s] on the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this instance, it is claimed that there was some discussion... so,
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       out there has a link in their comment history. And, if the OP deleted the post, only those people who commented will be able to provide access to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just keep that in mind (i.e., it's not always the moderators being fascist censors).

       While I'm confident in your abilities, feel free to let me know if you need help scouring through deleted posts. I know the admins have been working on the search filters and that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of them actually work in the moderation log... so, you
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be able to filter the moderation log with the "removed posts" option to narrow things down a LOT. After that, it'll be tedium of reading headlines for 20 minutes or so (depending on your "display X number of posts per page" setting in your preferences). One thing which might be advantageous would be to scan for deleted posts which actually have comments (e.g., 3 or more).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, let me know if you need help.

       Anno Domini, where do you think the word domination comes from?  Adonis = Lord. If one were to take the time to research the origins of words he would encounter many strange things.
      </p>
      <p>
       More fun: Deus(Zeus) = God, many Greek/Latin/English words seem to be tied together somehow :), many alphabets(another curious word) are associated with the bible and missionaries. The Armenian alphabet was created by a saint,but curiously the English/Latin ALPHABET does not have a similar story.

       I knew the origins of some of those words. Just always thought AD meant after death because that time started after jesus died.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does BC mean? Because I always thought Before Christ.

       BC does mean Before Christ, but not the way you think! It does not mean before in the sense of proceeding, it means more like standing before or kneeling before as if Christ were king. You should also look at old dates and you would quickly realize they are dated in the year of Incarnation (I565), the first digit is not a 1 it's an I :) Go search google books (for anything) between the year 1000 and 1799 and look at the dates printed on the books that come up.

       It all depends on the content of the post. There is no list, however there are rules and FAQ for readers to go through. The moderators try to be fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also encourage readers to report anything inappropriate, or message the moderators if they feel a post was removed unfairly. Nothing is set in stone and we have nothing to hide.

       There is no pre-defined list, posts are removed all of the time, on all subreddits. If a moderator feels the post is inappropriate, or if material has been posted multiple times it is removed. As you will notice from the log, most of these posts were removed by soccer.

       And the OP got one. I was trying to explain to you that we do not have a list of topics that are removed because we have decided they are inappropriate before they are submitted. In other words we do not have a list of censored subjects.

       Please do bring it up, it has never been an issue in this sub in the past but one of the mods pulled an active post a month ago with no explanation. To my knowledge that had never happened before, and also it's been about a month or two since you guys got in why not air out what's been going on? I thought the point of all the new moderators was for more community interaction.
