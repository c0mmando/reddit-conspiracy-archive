    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a lot of work man. Maybe when I get home I can do this, but you are asking a lot. I am all about being open and transparent, but that requires me clicking on every single link that was removed, copying the address, and pasting the address into the comments in [this](format, with one more character at the end. I had to post this in 4 different segments already because it exceed the 10000 character limit. This would require me to shorten and revise all of these posts and split this list into 6-10 parts. Do you see why this is a lot to ask?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstood. My point was that I would prefer that links not be deleted at all and just leave it up to the subscribers here to decide whether they are  worthwhile reading. One of the most important conspiracies regularly discussed here is how government and MSM control what information is disseminated to the public. IMHO, by engaging in any form of censorship, the mods here are emulating what governments and the MSM do. It&#39;s a slippery slope that always ends badly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well there are one or 2 that I removed because of malware threats. That qualifies as an exception. We also have a set of rules here in the sidebar. If people follow the rules than they most likely will not have their posts pulled. Then there are the shadow banned accounts. All of their posts show in that list too. There is more to this than meets the eye sometimes. I try not to remove posts based on quality because I let the users decide. But when cleaning the spam filters is pretty pretty much the only time I remove any post. I don&#39;t pull posts randomly. </p>

<p>I agree that a hands off approach is best. I love r/conspiracy and I would hate to see tons of censorship here. The current team is doing a great job IMHO. Some of us are more active than others. Soccer is our spam filter cleaner so he may appear to be removing more than the rest, but he is on the up and up. </p>

Some of these I agree with getting pulled (the fake Alex Jones AMA for example) and others not so much.

    <div class="md"><p>Please do bring it up, it has never been an issue in this sub in the past but one of the mods pulled an active post a month ago with no explanation. To my knowledge that had never happened before, and also it&#39;s been about a month or two since you guys got in why not air out what&#39;s been going on? I thought the point of all the new moderators was for more community interaction.</p>

<p>Just visit the mod log, view the source, copy the last line with all the content into a text file, and repeat for as far back in the mod log as you wish to go.  Then, run this against the text file and poof.  Paste into an HTML-compatible pastbin and share.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m confident in your abilities, feel free to let me know if you need help scouring through deleted posts. I know the admins have been working on the search filters and that <em>some</em> of them actually work in the moderation log... so, you <em>should</em> be able to filter the moderation log with the &quot;removed posts&quot; option to narrow things down a LOT. After that, it&#39;ll be tedium of reading headlines for 20 minutes or so (depending on your &quot;display X number of posts per page&quot; setting in your preferences). One thing which might be advantageous would be to scan for deleted posts which actually have comments (e.g., 3 or more).</p>

<p>Anyway, let me know if you need help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BC does mean Before Christ, but not the way you think! It does not mean before in the sense of proceeding, it means more like standing before or kneeling before as if Christ were king. You should also look at old dates and you would quickly realize they are dated in the year of Incarnation (I565), the first digit is not a 1 it&#39;s an I :) Go search google books (for anything) between the year 1000 and 1799 and look at the dates printed on the books that come up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please do bring it up, it has never been an issue in this sub in the past but one of the mods pulled an active post a month ago with no explanation. To my knowledge that had never happened before, and also it&#39;s been about a month or two since you guys got in why not air out what&#39;s been going on? I thought the point of all the new moderators was for more community interaction.</p>
