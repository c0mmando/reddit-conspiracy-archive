        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The numbers have spoken! A new leader has been chosen! We thank you all for it was an intense race, but alas a victor has been crowned leader of America! And now without further ado, I present your new leader.</p>

<p>Yes thank you, thank you. I am so happy to be able to bring you all to the next stage of this country. We all know that as of late we have been suffering greatly as a nation. The state of the government has become corrupted. It was no longer about being For the people, by the people. The corporations grew too powerful, and they were allowed to hijack the nation. Our elections became a rigged joke. Only serving as a distraction for the people, giving us all a false sense of control. But when the elections are rigged and our choices in leadership controlled to the point of having the same results regardless. Corrupt, greedy men making decisions about our future. So we collaborated, as a people to brainstorm what could be done. The decision was evident! We needed to change the system. Far too long has this outdated system of government controlled us and at last we are free.</p>

<p>As your new leader I declare that you are all free. Not one man or woman is above another. No longer will victimless crimes be punishable by prison. Only a few basic laws will remain in tact. Laws against murder will be the worst crimes, and crimes of violence will be second and they will be the only ones worthy of a prison sentence.</p>

<p>Our corporations will be allowed to remain. There will be punishment if they commit crimes themselves though. We, as a nation, must be more aware of the corporations we support. I encourage you all to educate yourselves on what crimes the corporation you support may be committing. We must support our planet above anything else. This planet is our gift of life and we must have the proper respect for it.</p>

<p>I am happy to finally give you all the freedom you deserve and I&#39;ll remind you to please ignore the struggles of our previous dying system. They will attempt to survive and keep control of you. To this I say, realize the illusion they have been oppressing you with, and realize your true potential and the freedom that we are all able to enjoy.</p>

<p>Yes, people, Freedom is, in fact, Free!</p>

<p>Thank You!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post. The very fact that you are <em>&#39;happy to finally give you all the freedom you deserve&#39;</em> unfortunately leaves me feeling bitter though my liege.....i believe i was born free, my point of enslavement was the moment my parents were duped into signing my &#39;birth certificate&#39;. I agree with your policies, what you have written and i enjoyed the way it has been presented, i did read it in the voice of Tropicos El Presidente though! :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honored that you have read my post as the voice of El Presidente. It is a shame to let such a fancy little piece of paper, such as a birth certificate&#39; give you the illusion of enslavement. I say freedom is here, now. We just need to realize our potential as free people and take control of our lives once again. We are indeed born free, and we never lose that. We just simply forget about it in order to conform to what we&#39;ve been told we need to be like.</p>

<p>can you &quot;prove&quot; that you &quot;own&quot; the birth certificate?</p>
