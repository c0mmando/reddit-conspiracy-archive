        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A while back there were some posts about transparency of moderator actions.  In response to this, the moderation log was copied to pastebin and shared with the community.  While this served the purpose, it was manual work that would need to be done on a regular basis.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve taken your request for greater transparency seriously, and I&#39;ve written a utility that downloads and parses the content of the moderation log automagically.  Given interest and access, I suppose it could do this for any subreddit.</p>

<p>I need your feedback and advice for the next part - sharing the result with you.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking for ideas.  My thoughts so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new subreddit where the removed posts get re-posted, in real time</li>
<li>A daily self-post detailing the actions taken that day in the text, with links to the removed posts</li>
<li>A daily self post with one comment for each deleted post, updated in real time</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m a little cautious about re-posting removed content to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, since it was removed for a reason after all, so I&#39;m leaning towards a new subreddit just for this purpose.  Also, it would keep the clutter off the primary <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subreddit.</p>

<p>What do you think? I&#39;d love to hear your feedback, ideas, concerns, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/">http://www.reddit.com/r/uncensorship/</a></p>

<p>This one can be open to all subreddits.</p>

<p>Rules:</p>

<p>Self-posts only. Post your logs/filters any way you want, as often as you want, but only one dump per post. I recommend the daily dump in a self-post, <strong>not</strong> the &quot;one per comment&quot;.</p>

<p>Cool?</p>

<p>EDIT: My thoughts (if it&#39;s not clear)...</p>

<p>I think we should be trying to set an example for other subs... thus... the example we set should be one that doesn&#39;t require reinventing the wheel. Thus... one subreddit for all the dumps. Plus, if you like the idea, <strong>but</strong> you don&#39;t like <strong>me</strong>, I&#39;d be happy to transfer ownership to someone else. I figure there shouldn&#39;t be any real need to moderate this subreddit, once a methodology has been worked out (other than adding the necessary approved submitter[s]).</p>

<p>I like what they do, but am not fond of <em>how</em> they do it.  They&#39;re querying reddit over and over and watching for things that disappear.  I&#39;d rather just read the mod logs.  Both work, my approach requires cooperative mods, their approach beats on reddit and misses things.  Neither is perfect.</p>

<p>If several subreddits are using the same uncensorship subreddit (see below), this could become cumbersome quickly. This is where I find the &quot;one post per day, with one <strong>comment</strong> per removed post&quot; idea more fitting. That is: Each day, the bot submits a new <em>post</em> to start that day... then, it posts all of that day&#39;s modlog &amp; filter activity as <em>comments under that post</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both of these (the single post per day, vs single post per submission) seem workable, but ModerationLog shows that trying to monitor a bunch of sub-reddits can get very busy.  I think if your going to do a full dump from the moderation log of multiple sub-reddits the post per sub-reddit/day approach is probably the most workable, and you can assign a comment thread per post to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Your likely going to have even more submission traffic from the bots than ML if it&#39;s also going to report spam removals (ML doesn&#39;t find as much spam due to the nature of how it finds post)</p>

<p>Your also going to likely be reporting approvals that ML wouldn&#39;t, i.e. a story that gets approved from the spam filter (before ML notices the post was in the spam filter)  Currently, no report has been made but it has been suggested that I could have ML report posts that have been &quot;reclaimed&quot; from the spam filter by looking for posts that show up being &gt;10-20 minutes old.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of open sourcing the code.  The only reason I haven&#39;t open sourced mine is because I feel it could be used to aid spammers, or in general harassment (it also detects, but doesn&#39;t report deleted posts), and could lead to a crack down on the bot in general.</p>

<p>My hope is that mods will see fuller, more detailed data the public moderation log (or your bot) can provide to be a preferable alternative than the incomplete removal documentation that my bot is able to gather; and to serve as a tool for subscriber driven transparency in cases where moderators prefer to hide their actions against the will of their readership.</p>

<p>We should establish (if possible) a social contract about filtered items.

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I&#39;ve tried envisioning as much of this as I can, and I&#39;ve got a few more thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li>The realtime one per comment idea. I assume it starts a new selfpost at the beginning of each day? If so, this sounds interesting. Perhaps the selfpost, itself can be used to summarize the previous day&#39;s activity, or such?</li>
</ul>

<p>and...</p>

<ul>
<li>I realized that I&#39;m compelled to comment on this due to my interest in it, more than I am about my confidence in my answers. Without actually seeing these and having their potentials available for me to explore in a hands-on way, my answers are totally unsupported by anything other than &quot;that seems quick and easy&quot;.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>yea it can be hard to imagine how well something like we&#39;re describing would work, but I don&#39;t want to code something just to say &quot;see?&quot;.  Maybe a manual demo would work.. but that sounds almost as labour intensive as just coding it lol.</p>

<p>The advantage to a self post with one comment per deleted post would be that it consolidates a days activities, without giving people who deliberately submit rule-breaking content the satisfaction of seeing it at the top of a subreddit (for example).  It would be within the self-post as a mere comment.. damn.  I could see this going so many different ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea it can be hard to imagine how well something like we&#39;re describing would work, but I don&#39;t want to code something just to say &quot;see?&quot;.  Maybe a manual demo would work.. but that sounds almost as labour intensive as just coding it lol.</p>

<p>The advantage to a self post with one comment per deleted post would be that it consolidates a days activities, without giving people who deliberately submit rule-breaking content the satisfaction of seeing it at the top of a subreddit (for example).  It would be within the self-post as a mere comment.. damn.  I could see this going so many different ways.</p>
