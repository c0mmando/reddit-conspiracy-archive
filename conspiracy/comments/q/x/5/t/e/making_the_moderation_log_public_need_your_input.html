       A while back there were some posts about transparency of moderator actions.  In response to this, the moderation log was copied to pastebin and shared with the community.  While this served the purpose, it was manual work that would need to be done on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've taken your request for greater transparency seriously, and I've written a utility that downloads and parses the content of the moderation log automagically.  Given interest and access, I suppose it could do this for any subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I need your feedback and advice for the next part - sharing the result with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm looking for ideas.  My thoughts so far:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A new subreddit where the removed posts get re-posted, in real time
       </li>
       <li>
        A daily self-post detailing the actions taken that day in the text, with links to the removed posts
       </li>
       <li>
        A daily self post with one comment for each deleted post, updated in real time
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm a little cautious about re-posting removed content to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , since it was removed for a reason after all, so I'm leaning towards a new subreddit just for this purpose.  Also, it would keep the clutter off the primary
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think? I'd love to hear your feedback, ideas, concerns, etc.

       This one can be open to all subreddits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rules:
      </p>
      <p>
       Self-posts only. Post your logs/filters any way you want, as often as you want, but only one dump per post. I recommend the daily dump in a self-post,
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       the "one per comment".
      </p>
      <p>
       Cool?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: My thoughts (if it's not clear)...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we should be trying to set an example for other subs... thus... the example we set should be one that doesn't require reinventing the wheel. Thus... one subreddit for all the dumps. Plus, if you like the idea,
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       you don't like
       <strong>
        me
       </strong>
       , I'd be happy to transfer ownership to someone else. I figure there shouldn't be any real need to moderate this subreddit, once a methodology has been worked out (other than adding the necessary approved submitter[s]).

       Open Source? Can one of their trusted mods run the bot themselves? r/uncensorship can add authorized submitters. You may find a couple people who mod multiple subreddits willing to run a bot for those, and so on and so forth... perks of open source.

       Yes, mods of other subreddits who are proficient enough to make small changes to and execute a perl script would be fine, though they'll need to install some additional cpan packages.
      </p>

       I don't think I'll open the project up until I'm a bit further along, but I'm definitely considering that.

       yes, I'm familiar with their work.

       I like what they do, but am not fond of
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they do it.  They're querying reddit over and over and watching for things that disappear.  I'd rather just read the mod logs.  Both work, my approach requires cooperative mods, their approach beats on reddit and misses things.  Neither is perfect.

       The code to download and parse the mod log actions is done, and I'm ready to code the part that posts the results. I've been busy with family/work, but anticipate having time to wrap it up soon.   I'm leaning towards one post per removed post to an alternate subreddit, at least initially, since thats simpler to code.  I like your censored subreddit idea, and I'm thinking that open-sourcing the code would increase the likelihood of having mods from other subreddits participate. Would you mind adding accounts to that subreddit such that each participating subreddit would get one mod account to use to post with?  The code would enforce a standardized post format, and I think it will be manageable considering the success of

       If several subreddits are using the same uncensorship subreddit (see below), this could become cumbersome quickly. This is where I find the "one post per day, with one
       <strong>
        comment
       </strong>
       per removed post" idea more fitting. That is: Each day, the bot submits a new
       <em>
        post
       </em>
       to start that day... then, it posts all of that day's modlog &amp; filter activity as
       <em>
        comments under that post
       </em>
       .

       Both of these (the single post per day, vs single post per submission) seem workable, but ModerationLog shows that trying to monitor a bunch of sub-reddits can get very busy.  I think if your going to do a full dump from the moderation log of multiple sub-reddits the post per sub-reddit/day approach is probably the most workable, and you can assign a comment thread per post to do the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your likely going to have even more submission traffic from the bots than ML if it's also going to report spam removals (ML doesn't find as much spam due to the nature of how it finds post)
      </p>
      <p>
       Your also going to likely be reporting approvals that ML wouldn't, i.e. a story that gets approved from the spam filter (before ML notices the post was in the spam filter)  Currently, no report has been made but it has been suggested that I could have ML report posts that have been "reclaimed" from the spam filter by looking for posts that show up being &gt;10-20 minutes old.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really like the idea of open sourcing the code.  The only reason I haven't open sourced mine is because I feel it could be used to aid spammers, or in general harassment (it also detects, but doesn't report deleted posts), and could lead to a crack down on the bot in general.

       I want to encourage you to interact with sunshine-x. I'm more of a "pep squad" in this conversation than anything else. I appreciate your interest, but your input is going to be more useful to sunshine-x than to me, since he's writing the bot.

       Also, I'm expecting there to be a little bit of trial and error in the beginning, to see what works and what doesn't and such. I'm just glad to see people working on this kind of thing... fighting censorship, promoting transparency, etc.

       I'm not all that fond of how it works either, but it's all that is possible in the face of uncooperative moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hope is that mods will see fuller, more detailed data the public moderation log (or your bot) can provide to be a preferable alternative than the incomplete removal documentation that my bot is able to gather; and to serve as a tool for subscriber driven transparency in cases where moderators prefer to hide their actions against the will of their readership.

       I like his option of making the moderators names anonymous. (That is, I like having that as an option - some subreddits will be more likely to embrace opening the logs if this option is available - and the objective is to get the logs opened.)

       How about a link or a few links in the sidebar?  Perhaps have the logs uploaded offsite or in something like
       <a href="/r/conspiracyuncensored">

       Definitely a separate subreddit and one titled to show it is after all, for items found not suited for the moderated one. This will free the 'parent' from spam and ease the reading burden there, yet allow some voices to be heard, and users to make their own decision about whether and what to read.
Thanks, appreciating your efforts.

       Is it possible to modify the CSS so that the main page has a "filter" tab, too? And then have that link display the current filter? And then separate moderator activity into a subreddit/self-post format?

       I just had a brief glimpse of this idea before my cat decided to meddle in my shit, but I'm going to try to spill this idea out here, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how we end up displaying the info, ....
      </p>
      <p>
       We should establish (if possible) a social contract about filtered items. For example, if you vote (up
       <strong>
        or
       </strong>
       down) you must comment, at minimum explaining your vote.
       <strong>
        AND
       </strong>
       , if you comment, you must also vote and include an explanation for your vote in your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: this is filter
       <em>
        management

       , not filter
       <em>
        bitching

       Sounds like a good idea, but it could be difficult to get people to actually follow this instruction.  I suppose if even 20% did, at least that's something.

       If the mods and a handful of dedicated users lead by example for a few weeks, it should be able to establish itself as a conventional behavior for that data subset... maybe. ;)

       EDIT: just want to add, also: this will be a karma goldmine for anyone who wants to spend a few minutes a day digging youtube videos out of linkjack blogspam sites (shelf3d and the like) and resubmit appropriately. (we should include this as part of our "marketing strategy" to get people involved in the filters.)

       Okay, I've tried envisioning as much of this as I can, and I've got a few more thoughts.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The realtime one per comment idea. I assume it starts a new selfpost at the beginning of each day? If so, this sounds interesting. Perhaps the selfpost, itself can be used to summarize the previous day's activity, or such?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       and...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I realized that I'm compelled to comment on this due to my interest in it, more than I am about my confidence in my answers. Without actually seeing these and having their potentials available for me to explore in a hands-on way, my answers are totally unsupported by anything other than "that seems quick and easy".
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       tl;dr: it might be better if you give us a sample. show us what you got?

       yea it can be hard to imagine how well something like we're describing would work, but I don't want to code something just to say "see?".  Maybe a manual demo would work.. but that sounds almost as labour intensive as just coding it lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       The advantage to a self post with one comment per deleted post would be that it consolidates a days activities, without giving people who deliberately submit rule-breaking content the satisfaction of seeing it at the top of a subreddit (for example).  It would be within the self-post as a mere comment.. damn.  I could see this going so many different ways.
