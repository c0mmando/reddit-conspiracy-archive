       I mean seriously, your guys' responses to my link to the short appearance I made on RT truly means a lot to me and I can't say that enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to take a moment to express my gratitude to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and my faith in this community to actually have a larger impact on the world, even if it is just "waking up" a single redditor who might not otherwise think about the topics we cover here.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way the offer is still open to anyone who wants to come on my radio show and plug their own personal projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know if you think of any other way I can help out this community other than plugging it on my radio show.
      </p>
      <p>
       You people are awesome. We have a great thing going here even with the occasional pointless arguments, trolls, and detractors I enjoy coming here and seeing what you guys have to say each and every day.

       Nearly 50 thousand now that question the Main Stream Media Bullshit that has been spoon fed to US for decades. I think many of us now believe that true investigative journalism by the MSM is dead and the media pundits have become propagandists and script readers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real truth IMO has to come from alternative media now.

       R/conspiracy is healthier now than it's ever been. Fifty thousand subscribers is a lot of eyes. We're not as big as r/politics, but then, we don't censor posts the way they do, either. Most of the bigfoot and flying saucer posts are gone. I don't mind them, myself, but the main focus of this subreddit has become government and corporate conspiracy, plots by the elite against the people. That's a worthy topic, and given the political climate, we won't be running out of material any time soon.

       Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following conspiracy, for me, has always been about removing the veil from the face of power. Sure, I like to think about those other things, but the conspiracy of reality is the most important issue of this world. People are trapped in an architected reality that turns them into a slave.
      </p>
      <p>
       The matrix was the best allegory ever written. It is an allegory of our current reality; you are turned into a battery - one which provides power to the system. Trapped in the jail of consumption/production of materialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agents being a thought process, which can manifest in anyone to keep you in line. Through deep indoctrination the slaves fight to protect the system of control.

       rules, and I dig your work. This is a cool place and I think a lot of people like that you speak your mind. Really, that's what this forum is: A lot of people who believe we should speak our minds.

       This made me chuckle. Seriously though, I don't understand why someone would delete all of my articles across all of their many sites just because I asked them to give me credit. I've never quite been able to rationalize that one.

       I read many of your articles during the bush years and found them enlightening and enraging. I was glad there was someone else seeing what I saw but at the same time depressed that so many chose to put blinders  on.  I saw the movie collapse and was upset about the ending. Now I am glad to see you active again. You were the only reason I read Alex jones. You gave him credibility.
