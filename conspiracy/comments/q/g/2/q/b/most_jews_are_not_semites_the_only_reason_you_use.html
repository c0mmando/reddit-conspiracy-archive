<p>Who could you be possible be talking to?!</p>

<p>Not a single person here, not one, has expressed any religious views at all.  I have spoken out against the obsessive anti-Zionists here as much as anyone else - I&#39;ve been an unbeliever my entire life.</p>

<p>The only possible point of a post that starts </p>

<p>is to prevent actual rational discourse.</p>

<p>Frankly, the most likely reason you&#39;d be doing this is that you&#39;re a paid shill of Israel.  If you were serious, you&#39;d be working with the rest of us to prepare indisputable evidence of the systematic breaking of international law by Israel and the US, in a form that can be presented to people in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to break international law when there is no international governing body. Even worse is the supposition that there is actually international law that is applied to the entire world, and the countries therein and the continual application of false diction to people battered every minute of every day with the deception that anything they do politically has any bearing on their every day life.</p>

<p>&quot;You NEED us. We keep you SAFE. Them TERRORISTS!&quot;</p>

<p>The ONLY international law there is applies to MAN, not COUNTRY, NATION, or STATE, and that is to do no harm.</p>

<p>What is more likely: a paid shill from Israel or a paid shill from the US?</p>

<p>Exactly. I am getting tired of all the random anti-jew stuff not because I am concerned with incitement but because it is counter productive, derails serious conversation and is simply incorrect.  Example: 81% of Israelis OPPOSE a unilateral strike against Iran. Most jews are just as much under the thumb of TPTB as the rest of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. The reality is, Jews don&#39;t want anyone criticizing any Jew for any reason, because they are afraid some of that criticism will spill on over to them. They try to quell criticism of any kind by playing the victim, and using the &quot;anti-Semite&quot; label (as if it had any meaning). The wealthiest and most advantaged group in American society, pretending to be the victims! It&#39;s laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the reality is, if you criticize Jews, Zionists, or Israel, and you have any prominence at all, you are savagely attacked by well-funded Zionist groups and their agents who do their best to destroy you life and deprive you of your job.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m rebutting the idea that every group of people will unanimously avoid criticism of other members. A dentist that mutilates someone will get the wrath of other dentists, likewise a Zionist is not immune from criticism from other Zionists. I&#39;m aware of attacks on so called antisemites, but you have to be a prominent person for that to happen. 99% of people can say whatever they want because no one is listening.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a baseless claim.  Back it up.</p>

<p>We certainly do.  The MSM poisonings the well by attacking us unfairly to prevent rational discussion and debate about things like 9/11, extraterrestrial life, you name it.   Giving them one more &quot;poison pill&quot; to toss in the well certainly isn&#39;t going to help things.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not the case.  I strongly support criticizing people for <em>their</em> actions, for <em>their</em> beliefs, and for the actions of the government they elect.   For example, I blame the american public for the ongoing wars.  You elected your leaders and allowed them to take place.  I blame the Israeli people for the actions of their state.  I criticize Jews and other religious people for believing in a pretend sky god, and for creating laws that have no place applying to someone who doesn&#39;t share their belief.  I could go on, but you get the idea.  I don&#39;t blame Jews for the actions of the Israeli government.  I don&#39;t blame men for the actions of the skull and bones, I blame the bonesmen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-semite is a phrase without direct meaning. The Palestinians are semites. Saying someone is ant-semitic is a way of saying they have a prejudice against jews. The problem is most jews are not semites (except perhaps linguistically).</p>

<p>The MSM is history. They have all the ammunition of the corporate state. They invent ammunition. They do not monitor our conversations so they can find our weaknesses. They twist (spin) the truth so that TV watchers can have an easily communicated soundbite to reiterate. They do not poison our well. Once you see what the MSM is and how it works you can decipher what they are saying and figure out what is going on while others around you are mesmerized.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we have an argument about criticizing others. I was making the point that certain words create a reflex defense of particular ideologies. I was also making the point that anyone can believe whatever they want and should be allowed to express those beliefs anyway they want so long as it does not infringe on the rights of others. Criticism of others is free speech and should have the same protection. </p>
