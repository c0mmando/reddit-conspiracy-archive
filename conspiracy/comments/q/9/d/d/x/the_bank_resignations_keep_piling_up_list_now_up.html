    <div class="md"><p>slash awesome.</p>

<p>These are very good things. They are flushing out the system for a far better, more fair system moving forward. The biggest lie sold to us today is that there is a lack of money. Fiat currencies were designed for this exact reason; so there would always be more money and then there wouldn&#39;t have to be wars. We&#39;ve just allowed the central banks to take control of that money supply and make it finite (except to themselves).</p>

<p>If we can get these bastards out, we have a chance at actually building a sustainable world. We can have 7 billion people co-exist if we engineered the planet properly. I think we will do that very soon. Hold onto your hats; 2012 is gonna be a wild ride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>or the opposite.</p>

<p>Since 2008, the game has been up. BRICS has stopped taking the Fed&#39;s newly printed money and now they&#39;re just waiting for everything to fall down. If this was to clear out opposition to Rothschild control, Zoellick wouldn&#39;t be stepping down. Neither Hildebrand or possibly the CEO of Goldman Sachs. These are positions that need to be consolidated; something seems to be on the move. Add in the pressures coming from BRICS on new appointments and I think we are seeing the power scales being evened out more than anything imo...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. The problem is that even the &#39;physical&#39; markets are controlled by them. The retail gold market, for example, is in no way an actual representation of the amount of gold we hold in the world. It is a finite market that can be controlled on strings. All of these types of markets/paradigms will go away. Don&#39;t worry; the new system will hopefully be built on meritocratic values. In other words, as long as you are interested in doing something <strong>useful</strong> and actually produce something with your time, you will be fairly rewarded. </p>

<p>To get at the heart of your question tho in terms of &quot;what this means&quot;, I would say be prepared for a day or two of confusion should shit really hit the fan, but ultimately, enjoy the moment. Now is not the time to be gathering your chestnuts in the tree; the tree is going to burn to the ground no matter how much you try to save. Instead, be ready to accept a new situation and roll with it. A key component to us actually doing this properly will be the re-establishment of communities and our ability to work with one another. Focus more on this than on anything fearful. Just my 2 cents; It could play out different. I&#39;m just sharing my own slice of life here :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meritocracy it&#39;s another form of slavery. Who defines merit. Meritocracy is a way for middle class people to justify earning twice or three times what a hard working  cleaner earns.</p>

<p>We need a society that is not a competition on any rules whether privilege, genes or education but as a form of collective endeavor building communities that are healthy places to be human and raise kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an ideal, absolutely - and I think we will eventually get there.</p>

<p>However, a meritocracy would be a stepping stone in removing all the parasitic industries from the economy. If you create nothing with your work other than invoices and fees, you will not do well in a meritocratic society. You have to do something of value or create something of value. Once we start producing for ourselves again, the whole &quot;Us vs Them&quot; mentality will start to break down. At the heart of a meritocratic society is self-sufficiency (if done correctly) which leads to greater creativity as long as the hampering effects are mitigated.</p>

<p>Now, if we can leapfrog that somehow and move towards a society based around community and actually moves away from the concept of money altogether, that would be even better. I think it will take baby steps tho; people are not that hip to it just yet imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your coming from a very similar place to me, however I think you&#39;re wrong about meritocracy. It starts with the assumption of a hierarchy and an elite. It is embraced by the left under the idea that it is a &#39;fairer&#39; system. Subconsciously it is simply the middle classes thinking they get the positions of privilege held by the upper class.</p>

<p>Most people want to work and do what they are good at. Only in a system that deliberately creates mass unemployment is there an idea of a mass of people who wont work. Yes there will always be lazy people, greedy people, con artists.. not enough to design your whole system around the reward and punishment of honest people. That thinking is what allowed us to get where we are. The meritocracy idea is insidious because it attempts to maintain winners and losers and a competition for resources at the heart of a new system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a meritocracy can work if it is paired with prosperity. I agree it would not work within our current system. Again, I would see it as a step forward, but I do agree that it has many traps and pitfalls. Who knows? Maybe by the end of this year, you and my ideal world may emerge...

    <div class="md"><p>Prosperity is over. Surplus is over. What&#39;s left is &#39;enough&#39; driven by an obsession with efficiency and sustainability. The political question is not do people like to own petrol cars but what is the most efficient and sustainable (cheap in real terms this year and the next and the next) way to get people to where they have to be (not want) for people to get fed, housed, kept warm and for society to function.</p>

<p>That means no artificial subsidies, which means owning a big car, or flying, or eating meat or fish every day will be the preserve of the rich.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not against informal meritocracies. The open source software movement is full of that. What&#39;s crucial is that unlike say science where reputations take years to establish and are then hard to challenge - the focus is not on status but a communal product - if some genius 12 year old supplies a patch that works it is accepted. He will receive some kudos but that is not the focus. There is no (or very little) defined hierarchy outside a core team working on a project.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue you are bringing too much of the past forward with you.</p>

<p>Prosperity is not over; it has just begun. Whether our controllers want to give it to us is another issue; the truth is that it is there and it is available, but not in our current paradigm.</p>

<p>We need the world to change. That means we can&#39;t sit here and postulate on all the ways that things won&#39;t work; it&#39;s wasted time. The game WILL change at some point; it&#39;s up to us to grab the new rules and run with them.</p>

<p>Prosperity will be part of the new rules. Stewardship of the environment will be part of the new rules. Technologically driven sustainable infrastructures will be given to the masses. The point is not to make everyone rich; the point is to make being rich pointless.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need prosperity I need simple healthy food, good work balance, an environment that supports me, not one that assaults me. Collective responsibility for homes, health and raising kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, we&#39;re going in the same direction for sure. I understand your hesitancy with the use of the word &#39;prosperity&#39;, and you are right in that I am viewing it not as excess but rather freedom. </p>

<p>The very first thing we need to do is revalue our priorities. We have to put the planet and people above money in the hierarchy of things. From there, all the things you want are possible because they make sense. As long as money holds a greater position in society than people and the planet, we will be stuck in this spiral downward. I think we&#39;re almost done with the ride myself; I think the rest of this year is going to be very interesting and a very positive thing.</p>
