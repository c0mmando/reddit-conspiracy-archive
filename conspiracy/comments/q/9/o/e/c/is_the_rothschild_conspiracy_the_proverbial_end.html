    <div class="md"><p>Christ. I posted this to get people to pool some information on the subject; I obviously haven&#39;t &quot;consumed every bit of available knowledge about the Rothschilds.&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m actually more focused on the religious/environmental detriments of our civilization. Part of that scope is the fact that because stored wealth is inherent to civilization, inequality is also inherent. I&#39;ve rather neglected the methods which the elites employ to control people within a civilization, save for religion. I.E. Religion is used to convince people to continue to exploit marginal resources through the promise of a better future even though their basic reasoning tells people that their practices are unsustainable.  </p>

<p>The intricacies of the secret banking societies kind of turned me off due to all the hyperbolic rhetoric surrounding it. I&#39;m sorry if you&#39;re not used to people interested the subject approaching it skeptically, but really, how can you not? 
I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that banking and currency is a tangent on religious control. In fact, I&#39;d be hard pressed not to think i was performing magic myself if I was pulling off such a successful con on such a large number of people. 
Please point myself and other readers here to sites that provide verifiable, preferably scholarly information concerning, in the least, historical accounts of the actions of the banking elite. Let&#39;s be constructive, not accusatory. Save that for people who deserve it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure many of the relevant and incriminating facts have been documented to sufficient scholarly standards. However, you&#39;re probably not going to find it in any &quot;peer-reviewed journals&quot; (published by Rothschild presses) or whatever.</p>

<p>What kind of scholarly references would you like for:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Federal Reserve, The Second Bank of the US, The First Bank of the US.</p></li>
<li><p>Or, the history of funding of governments (with emphasis on military funding) by financial institutions in general, let alone Rothschlid controlled banks.</p></li>
<li><p>Or, the sheer number countries with Rothschild controlled central banks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In aggregate, the available pubilc information about these issues is more than just incriminating, it&#39;s outright damning... .. .  It&#39;s just not a highly funded academic research topic.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t advocate any one specific site or other. Many sites contain relevant information and I will not get caught up in having it become a straw man issue. </p>

<p>That having been said, <a href="http://www.iamthewitness.com/DarylBradfordSmith_Rothschild.htm">here&#39;s a document</a> which, as yet, has not been refuted for its historical accuracy (despite the distinct possibility that the author&#39;s name is a pseudonym, which should be irrelevant - anonymity does not reflect for/against validity).

<p><em>During most of ancient Egypt&#39;s pharaonic history, there was no money as such, at least in the form of coinage (and paper bills were far in the future). Not until the middle of the first millennium BC were any coins used in Egypt, and at first, they were usually of foreign mint. In fact, most of the information related to wages, pricing and payments are more related to weights and measures.</em></p>

<p><em>It all began when Emperor Tiberius enforced a ceiling on interest rates, which caused a severe credit crunch, Tacitus relates in The Annals (book VI, 16-17). &quot;Hence followed a scarcity of money, a great shock being given to all credit, the current coin too.&quot; This was of course followed by deflation of the sort we are seeing now in housing -- &quot;a fall of prices, and the deeper a man was in debt, the more reluctantly did he part with his property, and many were utterly ruined.&quot; This is what business nowadays terms &quot;distressed sales.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Tulip mania or tulipomania (Dutch names include: tulpenmanie, tulpomanie, tulpenwoede, tulpengekte and bollengekte) was a period in the Dutch Golden Age during which contract prices for bulbs of the recently introduced tulip reached extraordinarily high levels and then suddenly collapsed.[2] At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or economic bubble)</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you..you are right. It is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_money">old money</a> </p>

<p>Rothschilds are just one family. They are now more in the spot lite mostly because they are pretty successful bankers and there have been long and interesting list of clients. Including oldest &quot;money&quot; in the world <a href="http://engforum.pravda.ru/index.php?/topic/163411-vatican-connection-to-rothschilds-british-crown-pic/">vatican</a></p>

<p>Every bankster is a con artist running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick">Confidence trick</a> </p>

<p>Religion is strong part of &quot;the con&quot; because you have to believe (trust) con artist for him to succeed</p>

<p><em>&quot;A confidence trick is an attempt to defraud a person or group by gaining their confidence.&quot;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://trustedadvisor.com/trustmatters/anatomy-of-a-con-artist-how-madoff-played-the-trust-equation">http://trustedadvisor.com/trustmatters/anatomy-of-a-con-artist-how-madoff-played-the-trust-equation</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pro-truth.net/62-con-artist-tricks.html">http://www.pro-truth.net/62-con-artist-tricks.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://martiecoetser.hubpages.com/hub/Con-artists-sociopaths-troubled-with-Narcissistic-Personality-Disorder">http://martiecoetser.hubpages.com/hub/Con-artists-sociopaths-troubled-with-Narcissistic-Personality-Disorder</a></p>

<p>Problem with confidence trick is that target (victim) has to be unaware of the principles of the swindle. If you know how the con works you are not going to trust person who is trying to con you. This is the reason why &quot;banking&quot; has always new words, expressions and services. To make it less understandable. </p>

<p>As a result I think that most of the banksters just now released that they have perpetrated biggest con in the history of the world. hence, the resignations...</p>

<p>Rothschilds are just newest con artist in the long line of con artist thru history. And in this particular type of con they where the best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>piracy is no crime.  you make a work of art, and it&#39;s automatically in the &quot;creative commons&quot;.  nobody is saying that artists should starve or go homeless - some people, myself included, think that their needs should be met regardless of their ability to sell records.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course piracy is a crime.</p>

<p>If a group of people have spent years, and millions of dollars/pounds/potatoes/whatever worth of money to create a product (ie a chair, or a TV, or a video game), then they are allowed to charge people to use that product. And if people use that product without paying then it&#39;s illegal.</p>

<p>Your logic on the matter is incredibly naive. You could extend that way of thinking to include anyone who creates anything shouldn&#39;t be allowed to enforce charges on using that thing.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole concept of a free market economy, you create something and you sell it to make money. Just because your product is digital doesn&#39;t make it any less real than a carpenter making a chair for example. </p>

<p>If everybody thought the way pirates do then we wouldn&#39;t have video games or any digital media, because nobody would pay for it and it wouldn&#39;t be viable.</p>

<p>It really grips my shit when Pirates try to justify their actions with some kind of retarded, childlike morality. People pirate because they want the best of both worlds, high quality merchandise without having to pay a penny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem to be understanding what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just &quot;Information&quot; as you seem to think. A video game is at its heart, a massive bunch of computer code. Some guy has sat for months (maybe years) and spent a lot of money to write that code, in the same way that a carpenter has sat for days (maybe weeks) to make a piece of furniture. Just because a video game is digital, it doesn&#39;t make it any less of a product.</p>

<p>You would consider it morally apprehensible to take a carpenters table from his shop without paying for it, so why do you consider it Ok to take a game developers game without paying for it? The game developer is fortunate because, due to the digital nature of video games, he has back up copies, it&#39;s still the same principle though.</p>

<p>Anyway that is besides the point, I agree with you. I think any form of internet censorship to be a massive step backwards in progress. I completely disagree with laws such as SOPA and PIPA. I&#39;m just being objective enough to see why such laws are being proposed. Due to the unchecked actions of Pirates in the last 10 years or so.</p>

<p>information is infinitely reproducible.  supply is practically infinite, while demand is finite.  that means the price, at market equilibrium, is zero, unless the supply is artificially shrunk by government action.  it&#39;s the same kind of logic that says that you have to pay somebody for bottling air and giving it to you.  you can just breathe air anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I can breathe air anyway for free, and if somebody tried to sell me bottled air then that would be a stupid idea (although people buy bottled water).</p>

<p>However, if somebody created air that tasted like chocolate, they could sell that because they created something new. It&#39;s still just air, but they&#39;ve created a new product using free components. </p>

<p>Digital media is the same. All a video game is, is one&#39;s and zero&#39;s. However the game developer has arranged those one&#39;s and zero&#39;s in such a way as to create a first person shooter with awesome graphics, 300+ hours of gameplay, hundreds of hours of dialogue, and the most realistic gaming experience ever created. Can YOU do that? Can everybody do that?</p>

<p>No, that developer has created a product using a skill set that he has mastered, in the same way as a carpenter making a table.</p>

<p>What he has created is no different to any other product, other than it is digital, and as such it should be treated the same as any other product. Which is why piracy is illegal.</p>

<p>YES! They&#39;re called laws! They&#39;ve been around for centuries, taking something for that is sale without paying for it has, and always will be theft.</p>

<p>What? So &quot;artists&quot; (I wouldn&#39;t call a computer science degree who programs games an artist but I&#39;ll use the term for now) should sit and churn out high quality products, knowing that people will be able to take it all for free and do whatever they want with it? They&#39;ll have no protection for it at all?</p>

<p>How do you suppose we pay these &quot;artists&quot; for their years of hard work then? Government subsidies? Some kind of &quot;creative arts&quot; fund that we all pay into and it gets divided between them?</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why &quot;Capitalist Trade Economies&quot; are so powerful, they work. Reaping monetary rewards for your produce is a good system, it works. </p>

<p>imposing restrictions on people with government is the opposite of capitalism.  you seem to have your terms confused.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thank you..you are right. It is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_money">old money</a> </p>

<p>Rothschilds are just one family. They are now more in the spot lite mostly because they are pretty successful bankers and there have been long and interesting list of clients. Including oldest &quot;money&quot; in the world <a href="http://engforum.pravda.ru/index.php?/topic/163411-vatican-connection-to-rothschilds-british-crown-pic/">vatican</a></p>

<p>Every bankster is a con artist running <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick">Confidence trick</a> </p>

<p>Religion is strong part of &quot;the con&quot; because you have to believe (trust) con artist for him to succeed</p>

<p><em>&quot;A confidence trick is an attempt to defraud a person or group by gaining their confidence.&quot;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://trustedadvisor.com/trustmatters/anatomy-of-a-con-artist-how-madoff-played-the-trust-equation">http://trustedadvisor.com/trustmatters/anatomy-of-a-con-artist-how-madoff-played-the-trust-equation</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.pro-truth.net/62-con-artist-tricks.html">http://www.pro-truth.net/62-con-artist-tricks.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://martiecoetser.hubpages.com/hub/Con-artists-sociopaths-troubled-with-Narcissistic-Personality-Disorder">http://martiecoetser.hubpages.com/hub/Con-artists-sociopaths-troubled-with-Narcissistic-Personality-Disorder</a></p>

<p>Problem with confidence trick is that target (victim) has to be unaware of the principles of the swindle. If you know how the con works you are not going to trust person who is trying to con you. This is the reason why &quot;banking&quot; has always new words, expressions and services. To make it less understandable. </p>

<p>As a result I think that most of the banksters just now released that they have perpetrated biggest con in the history of the world. hence, the resignations...</p>

<p>Rothschilds are just newest con artist in the long line of con artist thru history. And in this particular type of con they where the best. </p>
