    <div class="md"><p>TLDR: ADHD-PI/ sluggish cognitive tempo is passed down the male line. We can hyperfocus on a task based on emotions. If there is such a thing as the force in Star Wars, this condition is it. I&#39;m basically lethargic most of the time, but when emotionally inclined, I can work non-stop almost beyond what is normally human. I wrote the bulk of this book in a month, lost 10 pounds and barely noticed. This condition is blue blood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I take it to mean this, though I&#39;m not sure if I entirely agree with his &quot;diagnosis&quot;: He is claiming that if you are emotionally inclined or driven to accomplish a particular task, you will be able to hyperfocus on that task and accomplish it easier and/or quicker than if you were not being driven by emotions. </p>

<p>Example: You are assigned to do a paper by a 80 year old professor on the most boring thing in the world for you. You may not be emotionally inclined to do this paper, so it might take longer or not be up to your standards. Now if you were assigned to do a paper on cancer, which your mother had previous passed away to, you would  be emotionally driven to write a paper on cancer, and would invest more time and energy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if my interpretation is correct, and I&#39;m almost certain my examples are rubbish, but maybe it will help you. I&#39;m still not sure how this relates to the mental condition of the global elite, but maybe I should read his book first, lol.</p>

<p>(&quot;Hyperfocus is an intense form of mental concentration or visualization that focuses consciousness on a narrow subject, separate from objective reality and onto subjective mental planes, daydreams, concepts, fiction, the imagination, and other objects of the mind.[citation needed] Hyperfocus may also be regarded as a psychiatric diagnosis, as a distraction from reality, when it is considered as a symptom of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorder.[1]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations on writing your book. I, however, must disagree with your ADHD-pi hypothesis. Emotion is a primitive instinct present in all animals. Human, as an intelligent being, has an ability to control and harness own emotions. Most of us have interests we feel passionate about and many of us, even subconsciously, postpone scheduled tasks until last minutes to get an emotional boost. It&#39;s a common fact that those who do not learn to control their emotions end up doing foolish deeds on impulse.  A good leader is nearly always a person who can withstand a lot of pressure and has the ability to motivate himself and other people to work. This is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence">Emotional Intelligence</a>. From a biological point of view this has a lot to do with general intelligence and hormone balance. Aggressive people usually have high testosterone levels, which at teenage slows down brain development and generally in life prevents clear thinking. However, despite all this good emotional control by no means guarantees any kind of &#39;success&#39; in modern life. </p>

<p>The global elites inherit their positions among wealthy and influential from their parents – physical attributes have little to do with that. If you would have been born in the Republic of Niger, would you still be as &#39;successful&#39; as you are today solely due to your genetic attributes? Would you ever be able to afford Yale? And if you could, would you even want to go to Yale after that kind of life? The world of global elites is one big circlejerk. It also creates them the illusions of being &#39;superior&#39; to everyone else. Whenever someone outside their private circles manages to become rich and successful, it&#39;s usually a result of determination, luck and at least some sort of intelligence. In contradiction to that, those with unusually high intelligence often prefer to stay away from positions of power and instead prefer to live a peaceful and fulfilling lives dedicated to philosophy, art, science and making the world a better place. Human society owes everything to those who build, not those who rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not being too hard on Yale. Either the entry standards and graduation requirements are lax enough to let an idiot like him succeed, or his degree was purchased outright. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the latter, and I&#39;m sure such things are routine. Perhaps the highly esteemed, entirely over valued, Ivy League degree is partially responsible for the level of incompetence so prevalent in America&#39;s executives. A bunch of idiots who&#39;s daddies bought them a seat at the table.</p>
