       In his last book -
       <em>
        Kingdom of Fear,
       </em>
       Hunter S. Thompson stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "Didn't i tell you that the end of the world (as we know it) will happen in the summer of 2012. This it what my people tell me to believe, and i have no reason to doubt it."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Hunter privy to insider knowledge of some kind? He was a little crazy at the best of times but also highly intelligent with many good journalistic sources. When i first read this in his last book, several years ago it knocked me off my (imaginary) stool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone shed light into why he made this statement?

       I couldn't work it out either. I have read all of his books, yet this statement came completely out of the blue, almost matter of factly. I'm not suggesting this is why he died BTW. He was supposedly working on new material surrounding the gay prostitution ring in the Whitehouse, as i'm sure you are aware.
      </p>
      <p>
       But his statement about summer 2012 always stayed with me, it bothered me.

       You don't really need to look farther than the war drums re Iran.

       Iran is about 5X larger than Iraq. If we go to war, it will be the end of America, for sure, and maybe the start of WWIII.

       Hunter S Thompson was one of the very early dissenters for 9/11. I sometimes wonder if he took that shotgun to himself because he saw what was really going on in the world and was powerless to do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that being said, he was on a lot of drugs throughout his life. Long term hallucinogenic use can cause permanent instability in your brain, especially as much as he did.
      </p>

       I personally don't care for any of these "world is going to end" predictions.

       Long term psychedelic use is not harmful when done responsibly. Certainly helped me in waking up.

       Possibly it was the man's own personal cocktail of guns, alcohol, drugs (the whole lot - and then some), violence
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       insanity that did it.

       The problem with hallucinogenic use is once you've begun to experiment with these compounds it becomes harder and harder for your brain to except fabrications as truth. 2 plus 2 will always equal 4 on LSD.

       A common thread with "entity encounters" is the 2012 message of either apocalypse and/or ascension. No matter what you believe about the quality of these experiences themselves, we DO know that hallucinogens and substances like DMT are proven to bring on these encounters. Just saying...

       I see this got downvoted which is fine. I just wanted to clarify that I am not saying he is nuts, or having encounters, it's just an interesting coincidence and another angle to look at when wondering. Hell, his enjoyment of such things may even just give him a better ability to look and interpret the big picture and make fairly accurate or interesting predictions. I am also aware that he in fact did have some pretty interesting contacts and could be in the know on something from a more mundane but no less interesting and/or scary standpoint.

       Nope. You don't know. LSD doesn't make you have "entity encounters." You should try some and find out what it does.

       Of course the US will destroy the Iraninan conventional military quickly. And then there will be a 5X as big clusterfuck of an occupation, with 5X as many IEDs, that is 5X as costly as Iraq.That will comprehensively break America financially.

       Read Ginsburg's published letters between the two of them when Thompson was living in North Africa enjoying smack and young men, that stuff is absolutely true and not very flattering.  As for the conspiracy stuff, start with google and dig to your heart's content.

       I've read all that stuff and it just seems so far fetched yet the Bohemian grove is sketchy as fuck. Bob Weir from the grateful dead is also a member there. I wouldn't doubt Hunter S Thompson to get caught up in some sketchy shit just out of curiosity and his never ending search for weirdness. It seems to me that it could be true, but you have to consider the source of the information. I don't know, for me it doesn't change the fact that he was an amazing literary figure and will be a permanent one. His work is unparalleled and though often imitated, never duplicated. I loved his thirst for life and experiences and sometimes, as I know, that can take you into situations you don't want any part of but have no choice so you buckle up and white knuckle through it.

       Hunter S ran with a certain crowd. He didn't suffer fools easily or take convention seriously. Which is also a working definition of elite types. Put two and two together and you have to understand that while you can't easily picture him mingling with suit-and-tie types from the TV he was probably a very attractive asset to the real elite of the world for his attitude to life and his raw perception.
       <strong>
        He also said they were going to make it look like a suicide
       </strong>
       over the phone, the night before he died.
I ain't trying to sell you a definite narrative, but this site has some dope brainfood on the matter:

       Thompson liked to fuck with people. This is just a lick of his dark humor. If he had "inside info" on anything he wouldn't hide it - he was among the last of the real journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as his "suicide" goes - it's more properly referred to as euthanasia. He knew he was dying and decided to take the easy(?) way out.

       Im reading this book again right now. Hunter was a goddamn maverick and had wisdom on par with other great people of history. His writting style and use of language always blows me away.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the reference to the end of the world, i think he was just pointing to the fact that the world is getting more and more fucked up in various ways and people want to believe in the end of the world. He saw the madness around him and just admitted that it seems more amd more likely these days. I've never been one for 'prophecies' or 'predictions' cause i subscribe to the philosophy that life and reality isnt written until you've lived it. But i do know that the fragile and finite world we live on is very very susceptible to an unimaginable amount of world destroying dilemmas and scenarios. Thats my rant, im done.

       Don't get too exited! All of his books were great reading and he was an amazing human being. This question is based on one small excerpt from the book, he states it towards the end of the writing (page 328). it  struck me because when i read it, i was already familiar with the long count calendar end date and the works of Terence Mckenna and timewave. I couldn't fathom why Hunter stated this, he never went into detail.

       You're welcome!  Ya when i was looking that paticular one up, I stumbled acrossed a few different people posting the full interview in like 10 part segments. Very much worth checking out. Just hit up youtube. What's cool is even without basing his ideas on the long count or the iching, Art Bell had pretty much the same theory that he called the quickening so It's super cool to hear the two of them talk things out.

       Here is what will happen, mark my words: During the London olympics the powers that be will stage an alien invasion and introduce more security into our lives. The alien invasion was rehearsed during the '84 LA olympics and the public was buying it until told it was an act. It won't be an act this time and the public will again fall for it.

       A comforting thought there, this is why i asked the question. His statement was surprising, i want to know if there are any clues or articles offering a suggestion why he said this, why he named this year. I never got the impression he was into long count calendars or new age think regarding 2012. (As we know it) is important here i think.

       He said why he said it - because someone told him so. Not an uncommon phenomenon. Those someones probably were into the stuff. That's always been hip shit. Unless you're a conquistador. Then you hate natives. Or a rhinoceros. Then you charge.

       Doesn't it strike you as odd, that he would bother to mention it in his book if he didn't feel it was important?

       IDK much about the guy. I know many consider him a hero and stuff and maybe he is... it does take a certain something to try that many drugs :D
      </p>
      <p>
       But all the same even if it's important, it doesn't mean that he had some secret knowledge of the end of the world. Add to that the "telephone game" factor and you've got "cuils" aplenty.

       Oh he loved his drugs, maybe he was just fooling around when he said it. I always respected Hunter's opinion, he was sharp as a knife and when i read his statement on 2012 it surprised me and got the better of my curiosity. Anyway only a few more months to wait!

       I'm going to suggest this: he was involved with the media. The medium is the message. 
Whoever the powers that be are are packing up their shit and heading on out. 
Our illusions of what transpired the last century or beyond is pretty much a fabrication.

       A comforting thought there, this is why i asked the question. His statement was surprising, i want to know if there are any clues or articles offering a suggestion why he said this, why he named this year. I never got the impression he was into long count calendars or new age think regarding 2012. (As we know it) is important here i think.

       Possibly it was the man's own personal cocktail of guns, alcohol, drugs (the whole lot - and then some), violence

       insanity that did it.

       A common thread with "entity encounters" is the 2012 message of either apocalypse and/or ascension. No matter what you believe about the quality of these experiences themselves, we DO know that hallucinogens and substances like DMT are proven to bring on these encounters. Just saying...
