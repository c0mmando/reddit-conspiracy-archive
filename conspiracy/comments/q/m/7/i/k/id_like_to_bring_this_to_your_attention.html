    <div class="md"><p>Am I the only one here who realizes how funny this thread is&gt;? For real this is some comedy gold. I normally just lurk but I just had to say something. Has anyone actualy clicked through these links? So many funny little details, I&#39;m dying cracking up.</p>

<p>I decided I should give a play-by-play</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He straight up just tells him &quot;I&#39;m the person who has been following you around and harassing you with many usernames for no reason.&quot; No explanation or anything either. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0RVfB.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/0RVfB.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>The way this guy flips his shit when the admin doesnt&#39; care is hysterical. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/0Inri.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/0Inri.jpg</a> &quot;You might want to consult your attourneys before you respond to me any further&quot; WTF??? And he really does equate Mr. AutoPoo with a rapist and a killer. I imagine Mr. Spiracist pulling out his hair in real life at this juncture.</p></li>
<li><p>Spiracist is on the warpath, he starts accusing everyone of being Auto and can&#39;t keep his shit together. Looks like that matter-of-fact confession just cut too deep. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/mcdr1/illuminatirothschild_conspiracy_theorists/c2zy8ug?context=10">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/mcdr1/illuminatirothschild_conspiracy_theorists/c2zy8ug?context=10</a></p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m still laughing at #1</p></li>
<li><p>I like the part where Mr. Spiracist says it&#39;s impossible for <em>anyone</em> to have <em>any idea</em> about his character <a href="http://i.imgur.com/GDSVq.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/GDSVq.jpg</a> and then 2secs later gets called out for being IMPerfection <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3D0sJ.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/3D0sJ.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>The last paragraph of the post is just a big and comical &quot;Fuck you&quot; completely shameless,, reminds me of when the antagonist gets his shit torn up at the end of the movie. Can&#39;t stop laughing at the words &quot;before he hurts himself&quot; &quot;You hear that asshole?&quot; Sounds like a grade schooler giving a beat down.</p></li>
<li><p>All in all I can&#39;t tell if this posts ia troll or not or what it means. But damn is it funny.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really want the humor, you have to understand this...</p>

<p>That whole thing ^ all of it ^ happened in about 36 hours. The account &quot;IamDavidIcke&quot; (the one linked in the imgur captures, which you refer to as &quot;Mr. Spiracist&quot;) only existed for three days.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s apparent (in the aftermath of all of this) that there are some creepy stalker people on reddit, deliberately stalking and harassing people (see &quot;I tried to crucify him just like I tried to crucify you&quot; in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qn4ha/are_we_really_going_to_let_this_slide_so/c3ywmee">this comment</a>).</p>

<p>While I won&#39;t comment on each individual numbered item in your comment, above,  I&#39;ll just say (for the record)... patience is a virtue.</p>

<p>Unless one of you wants to pick up the stalker baton and continue this marathon, I&#39;d like to put this behind me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off. Calm down. Start a new account. The karma means nothing. I have been on reddit for 5 years. I start a new account every other month or so. You don&#39;t get to spend your karma, and there is no reason why you should be held responsible for anything but your latest statement or submission. Why anyone would want years worth of comments about the government and politics held in an account somewhere is beyond me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty calm, I&#39;m not worried about karma, not even worried about the account really, if I lost it it&#39;s no big deal at the end of the day. I just wanted to address this jackass going around trying to say I&#39;m unstable and likely to go around committing murders, and also bring this issue to light for the public, because people should really be aware of this information when they talk to this guy and try to understand his actions, or worse, possibly believe anything he says. Also I thought the material was entertaining enough to share with the class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did find it entertaining, I only commented because you seemed to actually be worried about this person, and you shouldn&#39;t be. We are surrounded by people who are paid to be here. People who spy on us, people who post mis-info, or outright bullshit. Most of these people are organized, they track users looking for any personal info you post in comments and then use that to intimidate and curb open discussion. Be careful what you post on here. If you are going to engage in political discussion it is best to do so with an account in which you never post anything personal. Not the city you live in, not the job you perform or even your hobbies. I wish that wasn&#39;t the world we live in, but it is. Knowing this keeps you safe.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol. I&#39;m going to take a guess and say this is just you joking around trying to make my claims sound more ridiculous than they are. But don&#39;t blow a gasket there little buddy, I didn&#39;t hack your mind for this information, I&#39;m only guessing. Besides, if I can &quot;claim&quot; I&#39;m stalking you without really doing it, it&#39;s only fair to give you that same privilege when you make silly claims about extra accounts. I think it would be pretty funny if your claim was true just for the record, but if it was it&#39;s kind of disappointing because you wasted the opportunity before doing any serious damage.</p>

<p>edit: ok maybe it&#39;s just true? I don&#39;t even know the Username_Tokin story so who cares, but good job, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you acknowledge the screen captures, but you don&#39;t acknowledge that the URL was one of the links I sent you when I was IamDavidIcke? Awww... I think you&#39;re being deceptive, not only to yourself, but to your readership.</p>

<p>I am exactly as I say I am. I have not lied. And while I find your description of my IamDavidIcke impersonation flattering, it&#39;s also somewhat self-delusional (one comment I used &quot;alien reptilians&quot; and this guy thinks I&#39;m impersonating Icke in a believable way).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also nice to know that you haven&#39;t given up your obsession with me. A little creepy, but what the heck. I&#39;ve never had a groupie stalker before, so it may take me a while to fully appreciate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh, yeah, you&#39;re right, you did send me this URL in a PM. I forgot about it I guess. But it still doesn&#39;t really mean anything to me, obviously I already know you and &quot;contheory_spiracist&quot; as well as &quot;IamDavidIcke&quot; are all the same guy, hence the entire fucking message of this post. So I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re getting at, it makes no sense.</p>

<p>Speaking of deception though, you definitely claimed to be David Icke and answered questions in threads posing as David Icke, and at least one of these answers mentioned you were planning to do an AMA and went into details. Am I dumb for considering you might actually be David Icke, probably. But who cares, my message to you was partially just me testing the waters anyway. If I believed every dumb thing people said on the internet, I&#39;d be you.</p>

<p>P.S. I&#39;m not sure if you understand this part or not, but I&#39;m not stalking you and never did. I&#39;ve lurked here and had different accounts, so I have personal experience with your other usernames and know some things about them, like the ways they sounded in posts. You sounded the same in our PM exchange: schizophrenic, believing things had meanings they didn&#39;t actually have, believing your drivel was significant somehow. You have a clear signature. When I saw this I made the educated guess that you were &quot;IMPerfection&quot; and obviously I was right. I then claimed I was &quot;the guy&quot; who stalks you (who I doubt even exists) and you believed me. Now this is part of your delusional beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s cool, I didn&#39;t know that because I only made a cursory glance over the google results. This also doesn&#39;t tell me what a &quot;Hasbara operative&quot; actually is (though I did learn it was basically Israeli PR when I googled it)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, pay the fuck attention, will you? Me knowing the exact definition of a Hasbara operative has no bearing on anything. This is because I don&#39;t use the term, the term plays no role in my life, I don&#39;t talk about it. What I do talk about is ill-tempered, irate people like you and Ijob911 who get in disagreements with people (like me for example) and automatically accuse them of being Hasbara operatives because of the disagreements. I don&#39;t need to know the definition of a Hasbara operative to say this, I&#39;m just stating facts, I make an observation and then I transmit that information, I don&#39;t need to be a fucking Israeli Zionism expert, I&#39;m just a witness. By the way I googled Hasbara after your last post, so now I know what it is, and I still stand behind everything I said because it&#39;s totally irrelevant. But of course I&#39;m just wasting my time typing this because you&#39;re irate, so who cares.</p>

<p>P.S. on the subject of your Dunning-Kruger you may be interested to know you are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection">projecting</a>, there&#39;s another fun wiki article to go with your first year psychology terminology since you apparently have a thing for them.

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. You are an idiot! Shut the fuck up! I never made ANY claims about Zionism or Hasbara. None. Not a single one. I never dismissed anything, I never made any accusations about Hasbara, I did nothing like this whatsoever. You just keep going on and on about it for no fucking reason, probably because you&#39;re Zionism crazy, and an asshole. Which turns out to be the only thing I said about you in the first place! Meaning I was right. So I&#39;m NOT clueless.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I am suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect and my insight into these subjects is meaningless!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol. I&#39;m going to take a guess and say this is just you joking around trying to make my claims sound more ridiculous than they are. But don&#39;t blow a gasket there little buddy, I didn&#39;t hack your mind for this information, I&#39;m only guessing. Besides, if I can &quot;claim&quot; I&#39;m stalking you without really doing it, it&#39;s only fair to give you that same privilege when you make silly claims about extra accounts. I think it would be pretty funny if your claim was true just for the record, but if it was it&#39;s kind of disappointing because you wasted the opportunity before doing any serious damage.</p>

<p>edit: ok maybe it&#39;s just true? I don&#39;t even know the Username_Tokin story so who cares, but good job, I guess.</p>
