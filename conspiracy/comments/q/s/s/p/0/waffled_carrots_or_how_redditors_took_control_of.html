        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>A couple years back, reddit was part of instigating &quot;The Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear&quot;. While half of reddit was gone to the rally, some wisecracker came up with a practical joke to play on them when they returned. It was meaningless, there was no &quot;source&quot; for this joke (other than this &quot;idea&quot;). The joke is basically: Any time someone says the word &quot;waffle&quot;, everyone (who didn&#39;t go to the rally) would respond &quot;waffle? don&#39;t you mean carrot? Hahahaha!&quot; (or waffle<strong>s</strong>/carrot<strong>s</strong>)</p>

<p>For the first day or two after the rally, it was a riot watching the rallygoers try to figure out what the hell was going on. It was stupid, but in a <strong>glorious</strong> way. Almost like spontaneous, uncoordinated, impromptu Anonymous DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>So, my suggestion for how to take back control of reddit is:</p>

<p>Waffled Carrots</p>

<p>It can take any form you want, but here&#39;s an example.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve caught <strong>both</strong> davidreiss666 <strong>and</strong> maxwellhill (mods of large mainstream reddits) posting stuff here - stuff they could <strong>easily post and approve</strong> to their own reddits. The only purpose I can see for posting those things here would be to simultaneously karmawhore and bury (i.e., characterize as &quot;wacky conspiracy theory&quot;) the post.</p>

<p>So, any time we see those scumbags doing this. Just make a comment &quot;Waffled Carrots&quot;.</p>

<p>And then anytime we see a &quot;Waffled Carrots&quot; comment, we assess the situation (to confirm our own individual behavior - i.e., don&#39;t get suckered into someone trying to game our plan), and if it is truly part of media censorship, then we downvote the shit out of those posts, burying them in the negative thousands, and destroying the karma of those whores.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you have a better plan than this, let me know. But we (the readers) have to start doing <strong>something</strong> to take reddit away from those scumbags who are censoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problems I see here are:</p>

<p>1) Not everyone is going to read this post, remember it, or give a fuck about it. So while you may influence some people to do it, not everyone will know about it and the &quot;Waffled Carrots&quot; will probably be downvoted by people that think it is random - or even by people that don&#39;t agree with it. This won&#39;t hold long at all, sorry to say. Good idea, but won&#39;t happen IMO.</p>

<p>2) People are stupid and hive-minded.  It is almost too easy to sucker in somebody, trolling or not.  Granted, those that read this subreddit are a little more open-minded... but we have all seen the reddit hivemind bring out the full-retard users. Not everyone can even recognize to check their own feelings and emotions to determine if something is &#39;media censorship&#39;. People interpret posts in many different ways, even some ways that sound ridiculous to another user.  When bad interpretations catch onto the hivemind... well we all know what happens and it just makes Reddit look like the ugly beast the media calls us.  Unfortunately there is almost nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>3) People have different opinions.  While you may think a certain post is &#39;media censorship&#39; - another may not.  You may have seen a story already or heard a different version, and thus may think that the new post (or re-post) is just more media censorship.... while another person could be hearing it for the first time and think it is legit conspiracy news (not that it is actually &#39;legit&#39; or &#39;news&#39; in many cases.... people just think it is).</p>

<p>I like the idea, I just don&#39;t think it will catch on.  People need to be thinking about these kind of things when they read anything on Reddit (or other media outlets for that matter).  But they don&#39;t-  probably either because they don&#39;t care, they are blinded by outside influences, or they are blinded by their own personal influences.  I don&#39;t think an obscure reference posted in comments (and probably downvoted) is going to make them think any harder about media censorship.</p>

<p><em>edit</em> wouldn&#39;t just posting a comment calling out the person for media censorship be more effective?  I mean, if you say &quot;You are just posting this to censor [X] post. The reasons I believe this to be true are........&quot; and then give actual reasons for why you think this is media censorship.  At least people will have some objective information, rather than the obscure &quot;Waffled Carrots&quot; which most people don&#39;t understand, remember, or give a fuck about.  I feel like posting &quot;Waffled Carrots&quot; you are just making the thinking even harder for people to do.  Post the reasons why you think a post is media censorship, and if Reddit agrees with you.... it will be upvoted (in theory).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/qh2xk/free_the_climate_scientists_the_fossil_fuel/c3xk095?context=3">Did that to maxwellhill</a>. Got 2 instant downvotes. Then, when I started getting upvotes, maxwellhill deleted his post.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that I didn&#39;t think the post wasn&#39;t important. It was the tactic which infuriated me: maxwellhill, a moderator of several larger subreddits who could have easily brought the post to the attention of 1 million users (you know they have clout and can do that if they want), posted it over here where a few thousand people (worldwide) <strong>might</strong> see it... and then when he got called out, he slithered away like a snake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I understand.  But let&#39;s say instead of you posting what you did (and eventually got some upvotes) - you had simply posted &quot;Waffled Carrots&quot;.  I&#39;m willing to bet a large amount of money that you would have been downvoted more or at least got less upvotes because people didn&#39;t understand what you were getting at.</p>

<p>Now, if we could have a big advertisement on the side that explained what &quot;Waffled Carrots&quot; meant (so that more users were aware of such a practice)..... it might work a little better.  But then again, that might undermine the whole thing.... since everyone will know about it.</p>

<p>you just outed yourself, all by yourself, troll.
