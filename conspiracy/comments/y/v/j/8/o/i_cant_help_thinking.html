    <div class="md"><p>Considering there was a giant upheaval BETWEEN 9000sins and HomegrownTerrain/ImJulianAssange, I don&#39;t think the issue was sockpuppet accounts related to all of them.  HGT did have alternate accounts, but he was pretty upfront about them and you could point them out easily enough.  I don&#39;t believe 9000sins or ImJulianAssange had any, but who knows.  Either way, the problem was MUCH bigger than those three accounts (not saying those accounts were a problem).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The origin of the problem was actually not that huge. It sprang from a project containing 6 or so team members. That project went south and a disgruntled team &quot;leader&quot; went on a public rampage exhibiting little grace and with a desire for revenge. 9000sins was a victim for trying to advance the project voluntarily and then having time-line concerns. ImJulianAssange was a victim by association to the drama creator. Follow the actors if you can, you&#39;ll know which are which. Notice which accounts were deleted and why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then, there&#39;s the other side of the story which was that 9000sins begged to join that group earlier than HGT wanted, even though HGT already had a job planned for him in the future. And, that you and supercede badgered HGT into allowing him in early. 9000sins, then refused to follow HGT&#39;s instructions for getting caught up, confessed this, and immediately started telling HGT how to run his subreddit, while you were simultaneously badgering HGT with questions in PM.</p>

<p>But, that&#39;s all irrelevant. Right?</p>

<p>And, of course, there&#39;s the fact that 9000sins threw his public tantrum here in r/conspiracy. HGT simply responded to the (cowardly deleted) statement that it was due to him &quot;turning his back&quot; on 9000sins.</p>

<p>But, yeah, let&#39;s ignore that, too.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, FCD. As of 8am tomorrow, this will all be resolved. There either will, or won&#39;t, be a subreddit for the project in question. So, relax. I&#39;ll stop exposing 9000sins for the infantile tyrant he is at that time.</p>

<p>I just had some asshole on youtube get into a heated debate with me and I cornered him because he said the oil companies were behind the anti-agenda 21 movement and then I went to exxon, bp, and chevron&#39;s websites showing how they were all promoting sustainability.
