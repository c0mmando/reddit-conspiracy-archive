    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the conspiracy theorists, actually. They can spend hours talking about how the Illuminati and the Masons are going to attack the Olympics to bring about the NWO, they can show you all of these &quot;connections&quot; ad coincidences and marginal similarities between logos, and then when NOTHING happens, they just claim that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; realized they had been found out, and decided not to do it. In fact, I&#39;ve had the exact same conversation, about a false flag operation on the Olympics, on this very subreddit! And when I pointed out that the level of &quot;evidence&quot; they were accepting could also be used to predict any number of simultaneous conspiracies, they told me that this was only because when they uncovered a conspiracy, the perpetrators just moved on to the next one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d consider myself a conspiracy enthusiast, but I don&#39;t buy into predictions like that.  In fact, I would argue that most of us here have pretty good heads on our shoulders for calling out bullshit.   For example, Most Alex Jones stories are immediately downvoted because this community doesn&#39;t consider him a reliable source.  Alex Jones is famous for making wild predictions like the one you just described.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re going to criticize unfulfilled predictions, why not bring up the biggest conspiracy of all?   Religion.   It never fails.   Ever year there&#39;s some lunatic out there saying that God will return, but it never happens.  Isn&#39;t it strange that criticizing religion is such a taboo subject, but the moment you have too many questions about a real life modern incident, you&#39;re labeled a nutjob?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about asking too many questions. It&#39;s about refusing to accept any answers that don&#39;t involve something nefarious. People have to be able to accept the null hypothesis until the evidence is there to disprove it, but conspiracy theorists instead extend the definition of &quot;logical connection&quot; and lower the bar for accepting evidence until its embedded 6 feet into the ground. </p>

<p>I think that both conspiracy theories and religious fanaticism are outlets for existential anxiety. People see an unjust, unhappy world and either retreat into a fantasy involving magical deities looking out for them, or they become obsessed with the idea that all of the problems are caused by a single, shadowy entity that can be defeated, and desperately search for evidence to corroborate this view. The idea that the world is chaotic and violent is scary to a lot of people, and they would rather pretend that <em>someone</em> is in charge, even if they&#39;re evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By that definition, I can&#39;t call myself a conspiracy theorist.   How about a &quot;skeptical enthusiast&quot;?</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re almost in full agreement, but I would still argue that asking too many questions is frowned upon by mainstream society - especially if the question strikes a nerve.   Certain subreddits such as <a href="/r/Christianity">/r/Christianity</a> , <a href="/r/Military/">/r/Military/</a> and now <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are so heavily censored that controversial thoughts are discouraged.  That&#39;s why I like this subreddit so much.   Very little is censored and there&#39;s lot&#39;s of interesting ideas to read about.   I definitely don&#39;t agree with everything here, but it&#39;s still fun to toss new ideas at each other and to read &amp; research about all sorts of new topics while trying to debate and debunk the people we don&#39;t agree with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I&#39;ve never read it. I came to this conclusion after watching a very long video explaining why the Olympics were going to be a false-flag attack, and when I asked people here what they were going to say when nothing actually happened. They told me, in advance, that if nothing happened it was because the conspiracy had realized they had been found out and had to postpone their plans. That&#39;s when I realized that the &quot;evidence gathering&quot; and the &quot;theories&quot; were not serious attempts to uncover information, but rituals designed to decrease anxiety and give people a sense of control over the world.</p>

<p>Religious people and conspiracy theorists are similar in that their beliefs give them the illusion of great importance in a world that usually doesn&#39;t think much of individuals. Theists believe that the great, omnipotent deity that created the world takes a personal interest in seeing them be good people and succeed, and will change the world using his powers if they pray to him. Similarly, conspiracy theorists believe that the group/groups who control the world&#39;s affairs take a personal interest in them, and alter their plans and schemes if they are &quot;uncovered&quot; by enough theorists. Conspiracy theories are not theories; they can&#39;t be tested or disproven by normal facts. Instead, they are forms of prayer, to a maltheistic god who schemes to destroy the world as we know it unless we uncover his schemes and take away their power. And like theists, their god is a nebulous, mostly undefined figure whose existence cannot be proven or disproven, but still exerts enormous power to shape human lives.</p>

<p>With what evidence? The highest voted stuff in this subreddit is usually stupid, baseless shit that gets upvoted based on a reactionary title. Rational discussion and evidence is constantly downvoted for going against people&#39;s preconceived notions. Some people aren&#39;t &quot;enthusiasts&quot;, they just think anything that sounds good to them must be true.</p>

<p>Reread my comment.   I was referring to the security industry over exaggerating the terrorist threat.  It&#39;s common knowledge that you&#39;re <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2011/09/06/how-scared-of-terrorism-should">four times more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by a terrorist.</a>   Only a right wing extremist would claim that the terrorist threat is understated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>tl;dr: Sorcha Faal, LOL</p>

<p>The truth is that plenty of research has been done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just being dismissed by the likes of you.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes is an expert (possibly the leading expert) in tracking financial fraud via software. The fact that his software is <em>currently being used</em> to track credit card fraud is irrelevant. He <strong>is</strong> an expert, possibly THE expert. Otherwise, he probably wouldn&#39;t be working for FICO. Ya know?</p>

<p>The fact that there isn&#39;t <em>yet</em> a hearing scheduled is irrelevant.</p>

<p>The fact that his name isn&#39;t published on a list of <em>potential</em> witnesses <em>yet</em> is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes is the guy who can crucify the international bankster frauds. Anyone with any common sense knows this.</p>

<p>The fact that this was pointed out by Sorcha Faal (a garbage blogger who mixes some facts with much fiction) is irrelevant. Robert Holmes&#39; expertise in this subject matter is <strong>fact</strong>.</p>

<p>You vermin who crawl out of the woodwork every time this gets mentioned are now transparent to many of us.</p>

<p>Signed,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of sounding too loony. <strong>Theory time:</strong> I think the abundant amount of clues before/during Olympics were a sign to anyone paying attention. It was the proverbial &quot;wink of the eye&quot; (pardon the pun) at all of us. Stating that yes there is an Illuminati, and yes they are running the show. A simple way to discredit us, not only discredit us but, to rub in our faces that we are right but have no hope of convincing the masses to wake up before it is too late. I&#39;m sorry, in this theory we are all too late already. Why else would they poke fun, unless they were on the home stretch? The worlds predictions of 2012 are only setting the stage for what I believe to be the end game for anyone who has expectations of living a truly free life in the physical form on Earth. I, in my own conclusions, have decided to stay informed but most importantly find the good in all of this. I believe there is more to come afterwards, maybe in the form of another dimension, some religious kingdom, or just a bio chemical reaction in our brains that will ensure an eternity of life after physical death. I cannot dwell on the doom and gloom, but only think of how this is helping me on my way to become what I am supposed to become. And I do not mean to sound as if I am awaiting certain death by these &quot;Illuminati&quot; I will still fight the good fight to expose them, for the rest of my time.</p>

<p>&quot;Clues?&quot; No, you did not find &quot;clues.&quot; You found coincidences and incidental similarities between unrelated individuals and organizations, some fictional. You took them and extrapolated an enormous amount of unfounded information, including that this &quot;conspiracy&quot; was actually trying to &quot;rub it in your face.&quot; The standard of evidence you accept as &quot;proof&quot; of a conspiracy can be used to prove any number of mutually contradictory theories.</p>

<p>How important you people must think yourselves to be! The cabal that controls all of the world&#39;s finances, starts all the wars and controls the media takes such a strong interest in you that they will actually put their own conspiracies in jeopardy in order to &quot;rub it in your face.&quot; That&#39;s on top of the fact that you guys, and only you, can see the &quot;abundant&quot; and obvious evidence for the cabal that all of the most intelligent people in the world don&#39;t see in front of their faces! Even though nobody takes you seriously, the cabal will stop their massive, insanely well-planned and expensive plans, simply because some guy on Reddit managed to uncover the &quot;truth.&quot; As though after the NWO takes over, some guy saying &quot;I told you so!&quot; is really going to matter.</p>

<p>Can I prove this? Yes. The highest average age of death in the world is in Japan with an age of 82.6 years old. No where near eternal. Not even close. </p>

<p>The body has a plethora of ways to die that don&#39;t include the brain dying. You know, cancer (not brain), heart disease, heart attacks, clogged arteries, organ failure (not brain) and poor diet, just to name a small few. </p>

<p>None of those include the brain dying, at all. Yes the brain can fail or get cancer, but even if you exclude that, the &#39;natural&#39; ways to die are still astounding. </p>

<p>Also, my mind is open a bit. I know a lot about the medical field, the human body, how it works, and how it can fail. After all, it is my area of study. But to say that this new world order revolt/uprising would cause a magical religious awakening, or a chemical shift in our brains to make us live forever, is fucking stupid. Like you escaped from a hospital stupid. </p>

<p>Also, Theory: If I shit on my toilet, spin around 4 times, on one foot, with a finger on my nose, while jerking off with the other hand, while singing YMCA, I will become Iron Man. </p>

<p>&quot;or just a bio chemical reaction in our brains that will ensure an eternity of life <strong>after physical death</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say anything about living forever.Nor did I say the Illuminati had anything to do with any of my after death scenarios, I did not say they would institute these scenarios.  I said I am content in the fact that the physical life here is fucked, due mostly to morons like yourself who care more about what some stranger on reddit thinks about life, than they do about their own life. Again open your mind and see there could be more to this life here, and there definitely could be an after life that lasts an eternity. I dont mean to offend you if you cannot think outside of the box by yourself. It&#39;s fine, some people just aren&#39;t meant to see these things, they are not equipped with the mental capacity, they just take what their &quot;trustworthy&quot; sources give them and dont investigate it whatsoever, and then claim it as fact.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a part of natural selection, there is no room for your ignorance and ego in the place I am going. You can continue to think what you want and so will I.   You will die a meaningless death and be forgotten by many. And I am satisfied by that. Good day to you fuck face.</p>

<p>So pray tell, oh unfathomable Einsteinian genius, 1. how magic wonder powder does this, 2. how many planes full of magic wonder powder would be necessary to have an effect, 3. how this would go unnoticed to everyone who&#39;d find themselves in the shade of hundreds of airplanes, 4. how hundreds of personnel shut up about it, and last but not least: 5.

<p>The US government has been overthrown for some time sleepy head...they operate in the shadows to get an initiative to be completed. All it takes is a few hundred men that are brainwashed with weapons in their hands to threaten scientists, police officers, politicians, and medical personnel. They get away with because...no one believes the government would do such a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not exactly sure as to what hurricane you guys are arguing over, but i would just like to connect some dots for you since the other guy is attacking you. </p>

<p>BEFORE I get down to business, I am not saying that what I am proposing is fact, but it may be possible. </p>

<p>Cloud seeding/chem trailing or what have you, does exist.  It&#39;s purpose is for weather manipulation. They try to increase rain fall for high drought stricken areas. Such as US, China. </p>

<p>Now are you familiar with high and low pressure systems? High pressure systems cause stable weather, low pressure causes precipitation. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s say for the sake of it (because I&#39;m not sure which hurricane you&#39;re talking about) there is a hurricane coming from the bahamas and its apparent route will be to go clip the bottom of Florida but continue into the gulf of Mexico, then towards new Orleans.  Now let&#39;s say they were cloud seeding (idk I&#39;m not a meteorologist nor do I know Florida weather index) 100 miles inland in Florida because of a drought. Now let&#39;s say this cloud seeding is causing or accelerating a LPS sitting 100 miles inland. Next lets say there is a HPS on the opposite side of the cloud seeding area, that covers the rest of Florida, (idk 50 miles) off the coast into the GOM and ends at new Orleans. We know that hurricanes cannot travel into HPS systems, they act as boundaries for them. This is partly how we can predict there paths. </p>

<p>Now, the hurricane clips Florida, but instead of bumping along the bottom of the HPS in the gulf and heading to NO, it catches that LPS created or accelerated enough by cloud seeding to impact the hurricane. Te hurricane now travels up into Florida because if the man made or man strengthen path the hurricane has now taken. </p>

<p>Again, im NOT a meteorologist. This may have occurred, it may have not. If it did, was it intentional? Was it a mistake? All in saying is that it seems there is potential for man to alter the course of a hurricane. </p>

<p>Silver-iodide is not the only chemical used..there is a wide variety. Our atmosphere is much easier to harness than people give credit for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the conspiracy theorists, actually. They can spend hours talking about how the Illuminati and the Masons are going to attack the Olympics to bring about the NWO, they can show you all of these &quot;connections&quot; ad coincidences and marginal similarities between logos, and then when NOTHING happens, they just claim that the &quot;conspiracy&quot; realized they had been found out, and decided not to do it. In fact, I&#39;ve had the exact same conversation, about a false flag operation on the Olympics, on this very subreddit! And when I pointed out that the level of &quot;evidence&quot; they were accepting could also be used to predict any number of simultaneous conspiracies, they told me that this was only because when they uncovered a conspiracy, the perpetrators just moved on to the next one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not exactly sure as to what hurricane you guys are arguing over, but i would just like to connect some dots for you since the other guy is attacking you. </p>

<p>BEFORE I get down to business, I am not saying that what I am proposing is fact, but it may be possible. </p>

<p>Cloud seeding/chem trailing or what have you, does exist.  It&#39;s purpose is for weather manipulation. They try to increase rain fall for high drought stricken areas. Such as US, China. </p>

<p>Now are you familiar with high and low pressure systems? High pressure systems cause stable weather, low pressure causes precipitation. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s say for the sake of it (because I&#39;m not sure which hurricane you&#39;re talking about) there is a hurricane coming from the bahamas and its apparent route will be to go clip the bottom of Florida but continue into the gulf of Mexico, then towards new Orleans.  Now let&#39;s say they were cloud seeding (idk I&#39;m not a meteorologist nor do I know Florida weather index) 100 miles inland in Florida because of a drought. Now let&#39;s say this cloud seeding is causing or accelerating a LPS sitting 100 miles inland. Next lets say there is a HPS on the opposite side of the cloud seeding area, that covers the rest of Florida, (idk 50 miles) off the coast into the GOM and ends at new Orleans. We know that hurricanes cannot travel into HPS systems, they act as boundaries for them. This is partly how we can predict there paths. </p>

<p>Now, the hurricane clips Florida, but instead of bumping along the bottom of the HPS in the gulf and heading to NO, it catches that LPS created or accelerated enough by cloud seeding to impact the hurricane. Te hurricane now travels up into Florida because if the man made or man strengthen path the hurricane has now taken. </p>

<p>Again, im NOT a meteorologist. This may have occurred, it may have not. If it did, was it intentional? Was it a mistake? All in saying is that it seems there is potential for man to alter the course of a hurricane. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Since when are you so sure that there is no eternal life? Did someone tell you? can you prove this? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can I prove this? Yes. The highest average age of death in the world is in Japan with an age of 82.6 years old. No where near eternal. Not even close. </p>

<p>The body has a plethora of ways to die that don&#39;t include the brain dying. You know, cancer (not brain), heart disease, heart attacks, clogged arteries, organ failure (not brain) and poor diet, just to name a small few. </p>

<p>None of those include the brain dying, at all. Yes the brain can fail or get cancer, but even if you exclude that, the &#39;natural&#39; ways to die are still astounding. </p>

<p>Also, my mind is open a bit. I know a lot about the medical field, the human body, how it works, and how it can fail. After all, it is my area of study. But to say that this new world order revolt/uprising would cause a magical religious awakening, or a chemical shift in our brains to make us live forever, is fucking stupid. Like you escaped from a hospital stupid. </p>

<p>Also, Theory: If I shit on my toilet, spin around 4 times, on one foot, with a finger on my nose, while jerking off with the other hand, while singing YMCA, I will become Iron Man. </p>

<p>But, alas, your name holds true, mister, &#39;SeriouslyMental&#39;</p>
