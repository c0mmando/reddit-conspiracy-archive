<p>These videos are short, please watch the videos and read the wiki article BEFORE commenting.</p>

<p>Lesson 1.
Vibration, sound, and frequency directly correspond to geometric patterns/shapes.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtiSCBXbHAg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtiSCBXbHAg</a></p>

<p>Lesson 2.
When a shape is tuned to a certain frequency it can take on energy from an energy source of the same frequency.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHOqMOJTH4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHOqMOJTH4</a></p>

<p>Lesson 3.
SIGIL MAGIC= The use of symbols for magical or cultic purposes has been widespread since at least the Neolithic era. In medieval ceremonial magic, the term sigil was commonly used to refer to occult signs which represented various angels and demons which the magician might summon.
This whole wikipedia is a must read.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28magic%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28magic%29</a> </p>

<p>EDIT: If you research farther into sigil magic, people actually use it as a form of self subliminal programming.</p>

<p>&quot;Sign, sign, everywhere a sign
Blockin&#39; out the scenery, breakin&#39; my mind
Do this, don&#39;t do that, can&#39;t you read the sign?&quot;</p>

<p>ADDING ON: 
Now take the concept from Lessons 1 and 2. 
What if the interactions in the universe put off source energies at different frequencies that can be tuned into?
And then making a resonance chamber out of that tuned shape/pattern to receive and amplify said frequency energy. Pyramids, monuments, cathedrals... ?????  </p>

<p>Documentary expanding on this concept submitted by &quot;dieyoung&quot; in the comments. Thanks for your contribution.

    <div class="md"><p>Most wizards went to work in marketing these days.  Some of us still use our powers for good though.  Every group has it&#39;s bastards, so don&#39;t fall into the trend I see on r/conspiracy in which every occultist is some evil baby eating devil worshipper with Real Black Magic PowerTM.  The last thing we need now is another god damn witch hunt.</p>

<p>I recommend you give sigils a try and maybe use it for the betterment of mankind instead of selfish reasons, or worse, really evil reasons.  Don&#39;t be afraid, just actually get to it.  Try it tonight and see for yourself.  Can it be proven with empirical double blind studies?  Maybe, maybe not, but that misses the point.  Experience is reality.</p>

<p>Now, usually what happens is, you do your thing and you just have a dream about the result.  So if you did some magic or a sigil to &quot;FLY&quot;, you would just dream about it because flying by yourself in waking life is not the easiest thing to do.  Magic seems to be lazy and takes the easiest way to manifestation.</p>

<p>But our thoughts, our minds, our dreams, are <em>equally</em> as real as anything else we experience here.  For some reason unknown to me, western people somehow tried to cut these parts of our lives out, labelling them as aberrations.  Our feelings and subjective experiences are just bullshit that need to be cut through.  Well, that is not the case. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that &quot;symbolic&quot; is the only language we speak.  The words and sounds and letters and grammar of our mother tongues are all just symbols for ideas.  If you subscribe to Plato, then you could assume that almost everything we experience is a symbol, or shadow.  There is indeed an ocean of power behind symbols then.</p>

<p>Once you play with this idea for a while, you can feel the seething destruction yellow being cast off by the McDonalds arches, pulling people in like moths to fire.  You can feel the sleazy blue con-artist, who&#39;s unholy name is WALMART, tempting people out of their fortunes by selling imitations of quality at ALWAYS LOW PRICES.</p>

<p>You suddenly see mantras and spells instead of slogans and mottos.  Insidious incantations, quick, direct, piercing into your being like a hook that you drag around.  ITS MY MONEY AND I WANT IT NOW.  Taste the Rainbow.Finger-lickinâ€™ goodThink outside the bun.Have it your wayHave it your wayHave it your wayHave it your way..The Power to be your best.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t help but notice the similarities between medieval spirit registers, like the Goetia, and modern Pharmaceuticals.  Can you see the similarities between things like the spirit LUNESTA, who appears as a glowing green butterfly and causes you to have good sleep and brings dreams; and CIMERIES who appears as warrior on a black horse who gives you courage and power in your battles.</p>

<p>Not to mention, you have to make a deal with spirits and these drugs alike.  You usually have an offering, money in the case of drugs.  You get what you want, but damn it if there isn&#39;t always some side effect you have to watch out for.  Effective and powerful, but a little dicey.  Of course, knowing how to properly summon and work with these...entities...helps.</p>

<p>So, yes, there are bastard magicians out there who are literally trying to control you.  But there are good ones out there as well, who are trying to help you see, who are trying to be Promethean and give some of the fire to you.</p>

<p>I recommend joining up.  There is a war on, a subtle one, and the Rebel American Wizard Society, fighting against the forces of the Marketing Magicians and Propaganda Priests need you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t think of things in terms of GOOD and BAD then.  And anyway, GOOD AND BAD relative to whom?  If someone were to seek the destruction of a parasitic banking system, for example, and succeed then you have your GOOD reaction (got what you want) and the BAD that you are hung up on, happened to the Target(the bank system).</p>

<p>So sure, &quot;good and bad&quot; are tied up, just like every other manifestation of the Yin and Yang.  It&#39;s all about where and to what those things happen.  It&#39;s all just forces, bumping around and into each other, at the end of the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, i see the connection you&#39;re going for, but there&#39;s still the gap between the patterns and the sigals.  Then there&#39;s the fact that Chaos Magic is a little like Wicca, big claims, not much proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the gap between the patterns and sigils has to do with the physics perception that everything in the universe can be quantified between shapes/patterns, frequencies, and numbers.  And that all matter is a vibration. Therefore your brain in it&#39;s basic true form just interprets frequencies (which can be represented by shapes) . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If colors are just vibrational frequencies and sound is just vibrational frequencies, synesthetics are probably able to see the vibrational harmonics between color and light, which is why so many people see similar colors and sounds.  Like a color is just a super high frequency octave of a certain note, it has to be.  They may just be sensitive to those harmonic associations.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of as far as i made it in understanding. But their is a perception that because of the universe&#39;s motions and interactions their are many source energy frequencies that can be tuned into that come from the universe. And being different in frequency, they have different attributes. Some being good and some being bad.  Hinduism is really into certain sound tones and making shapes with your body (yoga)</p>
