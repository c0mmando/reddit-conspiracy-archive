       r/conspiracy is often dominated by news of the next big act of state oppression- wiretapping, trapwire, TSA procedures, NDAA, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'd like to brainstorm some legal and effective countermeasures that we can all take to actually beat the bastards, instead of just trying to be the last one standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       to that end here are a few examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       demanding to fly without an ID- inconveniences you only slightly, but if done en masse can shut down the whole regime.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.lookingglassnews.org/printerfriendly.php?storyid=7040/">
        www.lookingglassnews.org/printerfriendly.php?storyid=7040/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       a similar idea is us all demanding private patdowns with a supervisor present.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/1116/TSA-screenings-at-airports-too-invasive-Opt-Out-protest-planned">
        http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/1116/TSA-screenings-at-airports-too-invasive-Opt-Out-protest-planned
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       lest you think that my only concern is the TSA, the above are just examples of using subversive yet legal methods to cause the oppressive institutions to crumble under their own weight. in the workplace this is called work-to-rule, or a "white strike".
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       i couldn't find the interview, but julian assange said that leaks cause a secretive institution to require burdensome defensive tactics like having a million passwords, and not sharing necessary info quickly. eventually the institution can't function effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       so what are things we can do ourselves, and tell others to do, that will legally (or at least non-violently) move things in the right direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       let's try something fun: don't start shooting down ideas (and arguing about how shooting down bad ideas IS constructive) until after say, 50 comments. just brainstorming for 50 comments. can we do it?

       I liked the idea of protesting by cleaning up parks and handing out fliers/talking to people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's hard to hate on people who clean parks to make a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, burning powerful documentaries on dvd, and making them draw peoples attention, like writing 'clue #3' on them.

       the diggers set up free... everything in the sixties. free stores, free housing, basically just subverting capitalism and consumerism by giving people what they want (in your case a clean park) without being motivated by pure greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       here's another idea: pooling money in a community to buy a 3D printer and start pumping out parts at cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       or for that matter, how about pooling our money as a city to get some decent broadband internet outside the telecom monopoly?

       The most important thing about this is, spreading information, not trying to cram it down people's throats.
      </p>

       The most annoying thing about any extremist conspiracy theorist is when they just yell at you and berate you with information and don't even give you a chance to reply.

       I'm sorry maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I'll give it at a shot, let me know if I'm totally off-base with your question. It's pretty late here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love your idea, organizing 'protesting' by helping out. Cleaning up parks, maybe wearing t-shirts or handing out fliers that describe the issues they would like to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only gripe was/is that typically when you encounter that person who isn't afraid to speak out about what the government is doing, and what we need to do as people to come out of that hole, you're met by screaming and someone just piling infinite amounts of information on you. Sort of the, Alex Jones-effect? Where they're just stomping their feet and clapping their hands, instead of just slowing down and really breaking down what the issues at hand are?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the best action is spreading awareness, and making it as factual as possible. We have the ability to change, help, and grow, but we need to do as humans. A small group of people can start a pretty massive change, but it needs to remain productive... People need to become educated about what's going on around them, and then move forward from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually typed another sentence in my original post but when I post from my phone things get really messy, really quick. I also included that I really enjoyed your take on it (or, the Diggers and yours)
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to come together as people and as communities, which is the most important part. Yelling at people that "They have no idea what's going on" or just beating people with information isn't logical to me, but maybe I'm just not angry enough yet.

       ok, so i know there already are tons of people out there who can create great infographics and so forth.

      <p>
       are there any resources that you think would be easy to perhaps print out on quarter-flyers or a banner?

       how about good methods to distribute that information in creative ways? postcards? hidden in consumer goods at the store?

       i'm trying to just brainstorm actions that we can take to fight against all these oppressive invasions of privacy, curtailing rights, and systemic resource theft to the top.

       so what actions do you think would make life harder for the bad guys? (in addition to raising awareness, of course)

       Get a permit and snowball off of your idea. Clean up, take care of the parks, etc. Hand out flyers (not really sure of an efficient way to do this in regards to the methods you want to stay away from) Make it entertaining for those around. Perhaps make it a thing, have some form of musical entertainment there, maybe set up a booth where people can go to ask questions or get any answers that they might be looking for, etc.

       ok, so then the question becomes how to coordinate a boycott sufficient in scale to make a difference to people who can just divest from one company and still have a gazillion dollars? that's the problem we run into with a general strike too.

       "The White House was opened to all for a post-inaugural reception, and was filled by the public even before Jackson arrived on horseback.[1] Soon afterward, Jackson left by a window[1][4] or a side entrance,[5] and proceeded to Gadsby's Hotel in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. The crowd continued to descend into a drunken mob, only dispersed when bowls of liquor and punch were placed on the front lawn of the White House.[4] "I never saw such a mixture," said Joseph Story, then a justice on the Supreme Court: "The reign of King Mob seemed triumphant."[1] The White House was left a mess, including several thousand dollars worth of broken china.[5]"

       what do you think about the "throwing money-like informational flyers in public"?
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe we can turn peoples' love of money against them? (well, not really against the individuals themselves, but their shortsighted value set)
      </p>
      <p>
       even as a tactic of disruption for events like black friday or fundraising galas, it could be useful.

       what are other things people actually care about that we could use for our purposes in a creative way?

       to me that conjures up ideas of alternative currencies/economies, debt/tax resistance, or using some sort of fake sweepstakes or something to get people to show up to an event, a la the simpsons win a free boat. just spitballing here.

       I heard from a reliable, former-military officer and R/C Helicopter enthusiast that when drone testing or surveillance is being performed, the officials involved call for no R/C flight in the area or, at least, warn those flying that there may be interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know exactly how to leverage this information. Although, if it was possible to scan the surrounding area at these times and report confirmation to local media and/or an internet database, it would keep these invasive measures in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it would even be beneficial to increase the number of designated R/C flight zones, allowing us to set up a grid of interference-alert locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       More extreme measures:
       <br/>
       I'm not sure of the legality of countermeasures against domestic drones. I am certain that they've been successfully hacked and fed false GPS signals transferring controls over to the hackers. Rather than taking control, it might be possible to simply override or jam the controls leaving the drone frozen in its current location.
      </p>
      <p>
       If such acts are clearly prohibited by local or federal legislation, I advise against taking them. On the other hand, if automatic drone-jamming devices could be designed, it would be interesting to see what kind of legislation prohibits their usage and how the FCC feels about the whole mess. I consider these technologies in the same vein as police radar jammers and detectors (legal to make, sell and possess; "illegal to use" in certain states).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm just brainstorming.

       nice, you just invented dronewatching! now can anyone make a smartphone app to tell people where the drones are?
      </p>
      <p>
       jamming is out of my area of expertise, but i certainly want an answer to your question before they start arming the drones!
      </p>
      <p>
       so what about balloons or battery-powered propellers on strings? i don't know if it's legal, but if not at least the chance of getting caught isn't very high. i just don't know the operating altitude to hit.

       it takes 10 minutes out of your day, there is probably even a police station on your way home from work. video yourself asking for a complaint form, and upload that shit!

       if we ALL do it, it (a) takes time that they would otherwise be using murdering minorities, and (b) lets them know that there is accountability whether they like it or not.

       to me some good internet advocacy journalism is an important piece for the idea of jury nullification. if there were a couple high-profile cases of people getting off on victimless crimes it could be a really powerful tool to use in our favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       in addition to raising awareness and nullifying juries if we're ever called (i've never been), what are some things we could go out and do that would protect our privacy, disrupt business as usual, create alternative institutions, etc?

       what benefits would be reaped from buying a container over say occupying an abandoned building?

       another thing that seems effective is juxtaposition. like the yes men, mic checking, or when the Motherfuckers "Dumped uncollected refuse from the Lower East Side into the fountain at Lincoln Center on the opening night of a gala "bourgeois cultural event" during a NYC garbage strike (an event documented in the 1968 Newsreel film Garbage).[6]"

       In the break room at work we usually have 2-3 newspapers for employees to read during their meager 15 minute break. I usually take the articles that i know are ridiculously miss-leading and write the real facts around the boarder. I hear secret agent man theme music in my head when i hear people talking about it later in the week.
