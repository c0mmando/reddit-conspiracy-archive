       The Truth by Brandon J Raub on Friday, November 11, 2011 at 10:00am
      </p>
      <p>
       America has lost itself. We have lost who we truly are. This is the land of the free and the home of the brave. This is the land of Thomas Jefferson. This is the land of Benjamin Franklin. This is the land of Fredrick Douglas. This is the land of Smedley Butler. This is the land John F. Kennedy. This is the land of Martin Luther King. This is the land where the cowboy wins. This is the land where you can start from the bottom and get to the top. This is the land where regardless of you race and ethnicity you can suceed and build a better life for you and your family. This is the land where every race coexists peacefully. This is the land where justice wins. This is the land where liberty dwells. This is the land where freedom reigns. This is the land where we help the poor, and people help eachother. This is land where people beat racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The federal reserve is wrong. They have designed a system based off of gread and fear. They designed a system to crush the middle class between taxes and inflation. This is wrong, and it is unjust. It is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have allowed ourselves to be devieced and seduced by the powers of the printing press. It is not a good system. It discourages saving: the foundation for all stable economic activity. The federal reserve is artificially manipulating interests rates and creating phony economic data. This thing has decieved our entire nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       They created it 1913. They also created the income tax in 1913. They encouraged the growth of debt so they can tax you on it. There is interest on the debt. Your government is in bed with these people. They want to enslave you to the government so that they can control every aspect of your lives. It is an empire based on lies. They operate of greed and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a better way. It's called freedom. Freedom is called a lot of things. But there is a true meaning. It means very simply that you have the right to do whatever you want as long as you are not infringing on the feedoms of other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I firmly believe that God set America apart from the other nations of the world. He saved a place where people could come to to escape bad systems of goverment. This system we have created works. It really works.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is evil going on all around the world. The United States was meant to lead the charge against injustice, but through our example not our force. People do not respond to having liberty and freedom forced on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men and Women follow courage. They follow leadership, and courage. Our example has paved the way for people all around the world to change their forms of goverment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force is not the way because liberty is a powerful concept. The idea that men can govern themselves is the basis for every just form of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can govern ourselves. We do not need to be governed by men who want to install a one world banking system. These men have machine hearts. Machine and unnatural hearts. They have blocked out the possibility of a better world. They fear human progress. They have monopolies on everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       This life can be free and beautiful. There are enough resources on this earth to support the world's population. There are enough resources on this earth to feed everyone. There is enough land for everyone to own their own land and farm, and produce their own energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have been hiding technology. There are ways to create power easily. There is technology that can provide free cheap power for everyone. There are farming techniques that can feed the entire world.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are controlling your media. They have dumbed you down through your school systems. They have systematically dismantled the constitution. It is in rags.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bill of rights is being systematically dismantled. Men have spilled their blood for those rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sons and daughters, your brothers and sisters, and Americas best young men and women are loosing their limbs. They are loosing their lives. They are loosing the hearts. They do not know why they are fighting. They are killing. And they do not know why.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have done some extroadinary acts. Their deeds go before them. But these wars are lies. They are lies. They decieved our entire nation with terrorism. They have gotten us to hand them our rights. Our Rights! Men died for those rights!
      </p>
      <p>
       September Eleventh was an inside job. They blew up a third building in broad daylight. Building 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your leaders betrayed you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You elected an aristocracy. They are beholden to special interests. They were brainwashed through the Council on Foreign Relations. Your leaders are planning to merge the United States into a one world banking system. They want to put computer chips in you.
      </p>
      <p>
       These men have evil hearts. They have tricked you into supporting corporate facism. We gave them the keys to our country. We were not vigilant with our republic.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is hope. BUT WE MUST TAKE OUR REPUBLIC BACK.

       Goes to show that 11 years after 9-11 we no longer witch hunt Arabs. Now the government is hitting those who we have been trained for a decade to fear......domestic terrorists...aka...patriots.

       Shit is anyone else here old enough to remember randy Weaver? That was a test of the American public. They wanted to see how we would deal with the murder of regular Americans (Waco too). Turns out a lot of people had a problem with Randy's wife and child being murdered. This let them know that they needed to prepare the public more...ie Oklahoma city and 911.

       I will agree that i wish this hadn't been included, because aside that, this is incredible. I feel this, in this one instance, may be allowed to be overlooked. He's clearly intelligent enough to realize what's going on, and stand up for his beliefs. And he speaks in a way that you hear what he's saying and can in no way be insulted. The point cannot be lost because of these 2 sentences. Replace it, in your head, with the symbolism he's representing with it instead. The point to what that means. That this is supposed to be a very special, incredibly amazing country. A cultivation of the rest of the world, to lead,
       <strong>
        by example
       </strong>
       , the rest of the world.

       Ok, but it's worth pointing out that the Baconian forefathers of this country believed quote similarly. In fact, the entire esoteric society population in the colonies believed that this was to be the new Atlantis, a land apart from the catholic church power base where divinity and the material world interacted.

       I just don't respect your suggestion to de-god the man's own words so that it would better fit the more appealing secularized concept you believe embedded within it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, I also agree that his god words shouldn't be the focus, and with the analysis of your cultivation comment. I just would emphasize that these ideas came down to those who would institutionalize them here through the belief systems of esoteric religious orders. My point being that his statement, while not currently in vogue with current e-atheism, continues in this tradition, although in Raub's case by derivation rather than initiation, I'm assuming.

       Keep in mind that although this kind of rhetoric does not resonate with the intellectual crowd, a very large portion of the population especially those involved in the military align with this kind of speech regarding their expression of patriotism. To all your r/atheism readers, don't immediately dismiss everyone or thing that includes the word God, it does not mean they are wrong about everything.

       I'm pretty much agnostic, but when it comes to constitutional unalienable  God-given rights (as opposed  to decided by whatever crooks are running the place at any time), I'm suddenly a theist.

       As an athiest, I would say all those unalienable, "god-given" rights are actually natural rights. The rights of the individual. I believe that by using the term god in modern society, particularly in reference to law, we marginalize the actual issue.

       That should let you know something right there. Cowboys helped settle the wild west at the expense of the natives. We robbed their entire culture land and resources and gave them casinos. In my parents lifetime it was still socially acceptable to kill black people and hang their bodies in a town square in Mississippi. As far as am I'm concerned you can miss me with that land of the free bullshit. We as a country are all about fucking over the lil guy in order to make a select few happy.

       Its always been that way. This country was founded on the blood of others, expanded on the blood of others and now in its death throws will die on the blood of us all. The America that has been presented was a great idea but it was never to be how can it be when the men who wrote it has slaves, subjegated women in the beginning and manipulate the poor now. It has been a lie where people blinded by the lie forgive their own countries blatent mistreatment of everything non male and non white. A country forgiven for an idea. Now this man was arrested for words...words....when will they come for us. There is no free anything .....never was if you were on the wrong side of being a white male. This country has been a lie.

       I'm not saying to cling to it or anything like that. In fact I'm all for status quo. Personally I believe there are many progressive and forward thinking individuals in our country however for the most part "people" are stupid. I'm just pointing out mere facts. Simply the way I can tell you the entire events of September 11th from my perspective and how it shaped how I viewed my country the same can be said for my parents when in Birmingham the KKK bombed a church and killed a bunch of sunday school children. I was in middle school during the "terrorist" attacks and that term I use loosely as well. At 12 living in NY and being minutes from ground zero I knew I could never accept anything at face value again. For my generation that is probably one of the most singularly defining moments of my lifetime because it changed our collective global view. So it would be safe to assume that during my parents childhood hearing reports of CHILDREN that look like themselves are being bombed and lynched that it woukd shape their views. Furthermore I'm not even advocating to take a particular view or stance I'm merely stating that we should all be cognizant that injustices happen everywhere all the time even on our own soil. My grandmother was close to middle aged before she was legally able to vote a few decades after the woman's suffrage movement. Native peoples still suffer from long term reprecussions that go back to the founding of our country. Have you ever been past a casino parking lot on a reservation? Its as of you're walking thru a third world nation. (I myself am talking about reservations in the southwest) Again to reiterate I am all about status quo. Put in the same position I would lie cheat and steal from millions for personal gains. I am no angel and although I wouldn't sacrifice human lives if in the same position I would manufacture a reason to start two wars for TRILLIONS of dollars for me and my compatriots. So in essence FTFY

       So are you done feeling sorry for yourself? Your grandmother? The natives?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know why evil whites moved to America? Most of them were either escaping persecution of the church or debt slaves.  Most of them had felt underprivileged and wanted to risk it in the wilds of a new land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just about every person in this world regardless of the color of their skin descends directly from a slave. The world has known as many flavors of slavery as you can find ice cream at a baskin robins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets be quick to forget how many white Americans gave up their lives to award black Americans the same freedoms they themselves had won less than 100 years prior.  Have you forgotten yet?  Good! Now that you have forgotten you can be free to dishonor people who were actually willing to DO SOMETHING to make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats how it works, each generation is capable, if willing, to make personal sacrifices to help shape the world their children will inherit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a generation of idiots who all feel so sorry for themselves that they refuse to do anything but complain about times they weren't even alive to suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look upon my distant great grandfather who was literally burned after being nailed to a tree with great admiration.  He accidentally told the queen that she was a scoundrel for getting in bed with the catholic church.  She had the power to take his life without question or trial, and she did.
      </p>
      <p>
       People later fought for a government that didn't have such powers. That couldn't just take a man's life without anyone asking why.  We sacrificed much to get here and the only thing slowing us down from the next logical phase of a more perfect government, are a bunch of cowards who would rather get something for free now than sacrifice for something much greater.

       I'm not going to go any further but tell me how debt slavery and serfdom in Europe was even in the least bit comparable to chattle slavery?
      </p>
      <p>
       People from my grandmother genertion literally gave their lives to vote something that supposed to be a right for all citizens. My parents generation would be thrown in jails across the country for the right to sit a lunch counter. And my generation is systematically being dumbed down by the media to not give a fuck nor question these injustices. I am not saying ooohhh woe is the fate of minorities in this country but even look at the rhetoric flying around concerning latinos in the southwest. Land of the free? Then tell me why in Arizona police have the power to stop and detain people of Mexican descent on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant who like your family came to this country for a better way of life. And I'm not talking because the government was catholic and they were protestants. They left to escape the carnage of a drug war that is so widespread that the cartels brought off the last election.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my own city the policy of stop and frisk unproportionaly targets minorities and gives officers an incentive (overtime) to do so. I could go on and on how there are systems are in place not only to keep minorities at a disadvantage but to make the populous feel indifferent. I honestly have no intention to sacrifice my life for ideals that the ruling oligarchy doesn't believe in themselves.

       I never said that no white people ever sacrificed for the betterment of the country. Its bigger than White vs. Black or anything like that. If you took the time to actually read what I'm typing instead of trying to rqce bait you would see that I'm saying the ruling class has it out for everyone. The civil war was not fought to free slaves it was fought to keep the union together and uphold institutions. Where there white people marching with Dr. King of course. They were getting their asses beat hosed and dogs sicced on them like all the other blacks out there. But it was the establishment in that case the government and ruling party of Alabama that wanted keep institutions in place to oppress what was actually the majority of their populous. Look at the occupy movement its the will of the 1% being forced on the 99%

       I never said that no white people ever sacrificed for the betterment of the country. Its bigger than White vs. Black or anything like that. If you took the time to actually read what I'm typing instead of trying to rqce bait you would see that I'm saying the ruling class has it out for everyone. The civil war was not fought to free slaves it was fought to keep the union together and uphold institutions. Where there white people marching with Dr. King of course. They were getting their asses beat hosed and dogs sicced on them like all the other blacks out there. But it was the establishment in that case the government and ruling party of Alabama that wanted keep institutions in place to oppress what was actually the majority of their populous. Look at the occupy movement its the will of the 1% being forced on the 99%
