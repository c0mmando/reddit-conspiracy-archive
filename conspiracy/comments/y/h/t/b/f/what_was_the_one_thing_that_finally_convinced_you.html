That is up until I was about 20 years old and I heard the testimony of Susan Lindauer. However  I was already some what suspicious by this point though because of WTC 7, Barry Jennings, etc. It is interesting remembering my mentality though before I &#39;woke up&#39; per se, as it helps me understand why 90% of redditors immediatley dismiss any topic having to do with 9/11, though it is still very frustrating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>trying to use 3,000 deaths to justify hundreds of thousands more.  how could it possibly be truthful, if they were doing that?</p>

<p>all other kinds of lies came out after that.  WTC7, Silverstein, the lack of wreckage in Shanksville, the evidence of explosives which the government refused to investigate (what with their, what was it, 12 million dollar investigation budget) - and the guy from the 9/11 Commission saying that the entire commission was a coverup...Bush and Cheney refusing to be under oath for their interviews with the commission, or have them publicly released...it was just one thing after another.</p>

<p>i grew up being taught that there were better ways for society to work than by the rule of force.  if that idea even existed (and it is <em>obviously</em> right), how was it possible that the people in power were ignoring it?</p>

<p>and yet they did - and a lot of people died because of it.</p>

<p>knowing that Cheney was the ex-CEO of Halliburton, and watching them get all the contracts in Iraq, was just the icing on the cake - not to mention Bush&#39;s connections with the Carlyle Group, the military contractor investment firm.  Bush and Cheney were both sucking money out of the death that was happening there.  there was just no way in hell they weren&#39;t complicit.  everything they did showed them to be textbook traitors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Analytical chemist here. </p>

<p>The research done by the people at Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth shed a lot of light on something I had been uneasy with since the beginning. </p>

<p>How could a huge steel structure like WTC7 pancake into a neat pile on the ground? How does the failure of one group of steel members collapse the entire building in a symmetrical fashion? How can office furniture fires create the amount of heat necessary to create molten steel? I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m no architect. So I believed the Bush administration&#39;s explanation, it was convenient at the time. I didn&#39;t think about it for 10 years after the attacks.</p>

<p>Until I read about the samples of WTC dust that were recovered.</p>

<p>Run a magnet over a sample, and <a href="http://www2.ae911truth.org/images/infoitems/sphere.jpg">this</a> is what you find. Tiny spheres of iron ranging from one <em>micron</em> to 1.5mm in size. I had never heard about this, and reading it was very alarming. There&#39;s only one force that would produce perfect spheres of iron: surface tension. There is no way that these weren&#39;t produced from iron that was originally in a molten state. The position of NIST maintained that there was no molten iron, contradicting many eyewitness accounts and photos.</p>

<p>Where could the energy required for such a change in temperature come from? I always thought that if there were explosives used in the WTC towers that they would have for sure found traces of them. Turns out they didn&#39;t even bother to check. </p>

<p>Turns out some researchers published an <a href="http://www.bentham-open.org/pages/content.php?TOCPJ/2009/00000002/00000001/7TOCPJ.SGM">interesting report</a> about the content of several <a href="http://www2.ae911truth.org/images/infoitems/pyro2.jpg">red-gray chips</a> discovered in samples of WTC dust sent in by several sources.</p>

<p>Quite honestly, reading the report and looking at the microscope samples blew my mind. Pieces of material that contain aluminum and iron oxide mixed together at almost a nano-scale. In high school you might learn about thermite reactions as an example of a classic redox reaction. Seeing such a mixture was alarming enough but the spike on the calorimeter just confirms it: These aren&#39;t paint chips.</p>

<p>As if I needed more convincing after that, they show that indeed, as a result of the reaction there are <em>iron-rich spheres</em> produced. It comes full circle. </p>

<p>I had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach as I read through more evidence. I felt remorse for dismissing the people who called for a new investigation as kool-aid drinkers that watched loose change one too many times. As a man of science, I have no choice but to follow the evidence - wherever it may lead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it was photos/videos of the Pentagon &quot;crash&quot; that made me start to really think. The video footage from a local gas station clearly showing a missile and NOT a plane, the lack of any burning fuel on the landscape around the Pentagon, no structural damage airplane wings would have caused on impact, etc. As years have gone by I also noticed the ONE flight no one EVER talks about is the supposed flight associated with the Pentagon. At 9/11 memorials no names are ever posted, I&#39;ve never seen or heard of any family members of supposed passengers talking about it, or heard names read off. Zero, zilch, nada. Then I learned about (as I&#39;m sure every member of this sub is familiar with) the 40yr old CIA plans to crash commercial planes and blame it on Cuba. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before the attack, I was aware that we were building up in preparation for war.  I was aware of a conscious demonization of the Taliban in the media.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards, it was glaringly obvious that there were too many video cameras that just happened to capture the attacks on camera, live.  Almost every response of the US government made absolutely no sense, from blaming Iraq and failing to take Bin Laden&#39;s grievances seriously, to the PATRIOT Act and the incompetent changes made to airport security, to the secrecy surrounding the Pentagon attack and the insistence upon immediate clean-up of the Twin Towers site and the bizarre decision to ship the steel off to be forged into a warship.  The motive for oil wars in Iraq and Afghanistan became far too great to ignore the possibility of an inside job.</p>

<p>But, ultimately, the one piece of evidence that sealed it, in my view, is the video of the absolute, unequivocal <strong>demolition</strong> of WTC building 7, and the mind-boggling videos of the media reports <strong>foretelling</strong> its collapse.</p>

<p>Since then, it has basically been one damning fact after another, from Bush administration insiders resigning and eventually coming forward with their stories, to odd coincidences that are too numerous to mention, to people (and even television shows) having predicted the attacks beforehand, and people like John McLaughlin having predicted the Iraq war <em>ten years</em> beforehand, to odd incriminating statements by Cheney and Rumsfeld, and of course the PNAC plans drafted by the pack of fascistic, Zionist traitors who probably perpetrated the entire thing in furtherance of their delusional political goals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The technology revolution has transformed organizations across the private sector, but not ours, not fully, not yet. We are, as they say, tangled in our anchor chain. Our financial systems are decades old. According to some estimates, <strong>we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We cannot share information from floor to floor in this building because it&#39;s stored on dozens of technological systems that are inaccessible or incompatible.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>(My bolding for emphasis)</p>

<p>Cannot <em>track</em>, not &quot;the money is missing&quot;.</p>

<p>Also, February 12th 2001</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The inspector general of the Pentagon said there are 2.3 trillion dollars in items that they can&#39;t quite account for. That&#39;s not billion. That&#39;s trillion dollars. $2.3 trillion -- and the General Accounting Office said there are about $27 billion in inventory items that they can&#39;t find.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The day was really weird for me. I was 14 and very angry at the time but on that day I woke up oddly early and was often known to sleep in and be late for school. But that day I woke up really early and was extremely happy. I couldn&#39;t explain it. I woke up around the time the first plane hit and then started to make breakfast. I turned the TV on and saw the second plane hit live. I don&#39;t know why I was up or why I was happy but I defiantly felt a disturbance in the force. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hearing a radio netherlands interview with the ISI general, who later disappeared.  </p>

<p>&quot;Lt. Gen. Mahmood Ahmed, Director of Pakistan&#39;s secret service, the ISI, is quite possibly the most taboo suspect of all 9/11 suspects. It was reported in early October 2001 that Mahmood ordered Saeed Sheikh to send $100,000 to hijacker Mohamed Atta. Since then hardly a word has been said about this stunning report, and in fact this once very powerful man appears to have completely disappeared from view.</p>

<p>In December 2002, Senator Bob Graham, head of the Congressional 9/11 inquiry and thus privy to much information still not publicly released, said he was &quot;surprised at the evidence that there were foreign governments involved in facilitating the activities of at least some of the [9/11] terrorists in the United States. ... It will become public at some point when it&#39;s turned over to the archives, but that&#39;s 20 or 30 years from now.&quot; [PBS Newshour, 12/11/02] Is he referring to Pakistan and the role of Mahmood, a man Graham just happened to be discussing bin Laden with in Washington DC as the 9/11 attacks were happening?</p>

<p>If Mahmood had a role in 9/11, this would not only strongly suggest that the rest of the Pakistani government had foreknowledge, but it would also raise curious questions about who else knew, in the US, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere. Mahmood seems to be involved in a number of important but obscure meetings before, during and after 9/11.&quot;</p>

This plus Cheney &quot;the plan still stands&quot; and dozens of other circumstantial details.   There really isn&#39;t &quot;one&quot; thing.

<p>My brother was at ground zero.  He worked in the city and had an apartment nearby.  He volunteered for several weeks after.  He said there were soldiers &quot;protecting&quot; the rubble for days after the event.  He said there were too many anomalies.</p>

<p>For me, it was the fact that no airplane crashed where Flight 93 was supposed to have crashed, and the fact that clearly a missile hit the Pentagon as there was no evidence/debris of a passenger jet</p>

<p>But it&#39;s <em>implausible</em> that anyone would ever do anything in retaliation?</p>

<p>Terrorism was basically the only viable retaliatory tactic to use against an entity that large and militaristic. If a <em>country</em> had attacked the US and carried out 9/11 there would be nothing left of it by now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the fuck are you talking about dude?</p>

<p>No one believes just because the event happened that it MUST have been an inside job. The event happened, the people have examined it, and the evidence points toward an inside job. If you truly do not think this is true, then you haven&#39;t actually examined the evidence.</p>

<p>So you truly believe a small group of extremists are the only people behind the event? </p>

<p>Why the fuck didn&#39;t they strike again using the same tactics? Before you write more apologist rhetoric suggesting that increased &quot;security&quot; measures prevented any further attack, you should probably remember that the TSA wasn&#39;t established until two months after the event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exactly sure how it&#39;s relevant, but the mural was likely painted between some time after June 22, 2001, as this is the date that &#39;Urban Moving Systems Incorporated&#39; was awarded a $500000 loan from the federal government.</p>
