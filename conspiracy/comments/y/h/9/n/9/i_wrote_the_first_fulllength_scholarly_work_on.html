       Hi r/conspiracy,
      </p>
      <p>
       Incoming wall of text.
      </p>
      <p>
       This May, I completed what turned out to be the first full-length scholarly work on the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">
        Business Plot
       </a>
       for the senior thesis of my history major. I mentioned this in
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/y2h4u/a_gangster_for_capitalism_and_a_hero_for_america/c5rsk85">
        a thread last week
       </a>
       , and some of you showed interest in learning more about it. I'd love to share what I know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping to edit the paper and submit it for actual publication, so I'm going to hold off on posting the whole thing online, but I'll answer any questions you have and post relevant citations and quotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Some questions you had last week:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Prescott Bush was involved, right?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In my research at the Library of Congress and the Natl Archives, I found no mention of Prescott Bush. Believe me, I looked. He was, at that time, a partner at Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co., a Philadelphia banking and securities firm, which was founded in 1931, two/three years before the events of the Business Plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible that he, as the head of a large financial organization was involved in putting together the pot of money, but he was never directly implicated. I'm really not sure where
       <em>
        The Corporation
       </em>
       got this idea... Most of what else that documentary says about the incident is correct. I went to look if they had a works cited page, but their website was (and still is) non-responsive.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who were the main players? Motivation/end goal? Ideology?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The goal of the Plot was to set up a veterans' organization based mostly on the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croix-de-Feu">
        Croix-de-Feu
       </a>
       , a French fascist/nationalist organization which claimed 5 million WW1 veteran members. There is evidence (letters, receipts, postcards) that Gerald MacGuire, the main intermediary between the "plotters" and General Butler traveled to France on J.P. Morgan's dime to meet with the leaders of the Croix-de-Feu. He actually stayed in a mansion in Paris owned by the Morgans while he was there. He had similar accommodations in Rome, Amsterdam, Munich, and Berlin.
      </p>
      <p>
       MacGuire told Butler at a meeting in Philadelphia, when he returned to the U.S. that an Italian or German-style group would never be “attractive” to Americans, but an adaptation of the French organization could work perfectly in the U.S. The Croix-de-Feu was a paramilitary “super-organization” of, purportedly, five million World War veterans, which was structurally and ideologically different from Italian fascism and the Nazi Party; a uniquely “French” fascism.  He told Butler that the concept could easily be morphed into a “uniquely American” fascist group, with the right leader and enough resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to MacGuire, the Croix-de-Feu had played a “key” role in maintaining peace on the streets during a crisis regarding wage controls that February. This group would have 50,000 core members, each responsible for 100 others (the numbers might vary for the U.S.). The group would be used to intimidate the government (the U.S. military at this time was much, much smaller, and the reserves were all the disaffected WW1 veterans that would be joining this group…). MacGuire told Butler that he and his “backers” intended to build an American version of the Croix-de-Feu – A “uniquely American” fascist  organization – to “support” President Roosevelt and the Constitution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their end goal was to force President Roosevelt to stop attempting to regulate Wall Street. If Roosevelt could not be reasoned with, he would be replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is important: Ideologically, they were not Nazis or Fascists. They were corporatists. All they wanted was power and money. They had no desire to conquer the world or exterminate minorities. They just wanted to keep their power and wealth.

       That's very cool. There's not a lot of fresh ground in US history. And it's very relevant to contemporary events like the Koch bothers' manipulation of the Tea Party.

       <strong>
        More Questions from Last Week:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who were the conspirators?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I’ll just quote directly from my paper for this one:
      </p>
      <p>
       News of MacGuire’s super-organization came quickly. On August 23, 1934, the New York Times ran an article about the formation of a group called the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Liberty_League">
        American Liberty League
       </a>
       .  The stated intent of the organization, just as MacGuire had said it would be, was to “protect property rights and protect the Constitution.” The Times listed 156 financial sponsors. On the list Butler saw the familiar names Grayson M.-P. Murphy, Robert Sterling Clark, and John W. Davis. He also saw Al Smith, another former presidential candidate, and the names Morgan, du Pont, Sloan, and Pew. The Liberty League blamed Roosevelt for “fermenting class hatred” by using terms like “unscrupulous money-changers,” “economic royalists,” and “privileged princes of these new economic dynasties.” At this point, General Butler testified, he realized that the plot was “no crackpot’s fantasy.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Liberty League was a coalition of conservative Democrats and Republicans who attempted to oppose the early New Deal. They received funding from the du Ponts, but following Roosevelt’s landslide re-election in 1936, they mostly ceased to operate. Many of its supporters continued to oppose Roosevelt through other right-wing groups such as America First, the Sentinels of the Republic, and the Crusaders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Legion was also heavily involved as the center from which veterans were to be recruited. MacGuire was the Legion commander of Connecticut at the time of his first meetings with Butler. 
.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What evidence exists that the Business Plot was as true and as dangerous as people in here seem to think?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       General Butler’s testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee on Nov 20, 1934 an his writings later are the most substantive evidence we have, but there is some actual physical evidence. There are travel receipts from MacGuire’s trip to Europe, showing that he was allowed to live in Morgan and duPont owned homes in many European cities and that he met with leaders of fascist organizations there. There is evidence that MacGuire (an otherwise normal middle manager for a NYC brokerage firm) had access to hundreds of thousands of dollars, put into his accounts anonymously for “expenses.”
      </p>
      <p>
       General Butler was proven to have advanced knowledge of the founding of the American Liberty League (MacGuire told him that it would be founded and who the members would be). The most blockbuster evidence though, is that Butler had in his possession a speech written by Al Smith that he was supposed to deliver to an American Legion convention. Al Smith, of course, the Democrat who lost to FDR in the 1932 Primary, was accused by Butler of being the “replacement” that the plotters had in line if FDR refused to cooperate.

       The idea that Prescott Bush was involved came from a promotional blurb for the
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/document/document_20070723.shtml">
        BBC radio program
        <em>
         Document
        </em>
       </a>
       . It said “The coup was aimed at toppling President Franklin D Roosevelt with the help of half-a-million war veterans. The plotters, who were alleged to involve some of the most famous families in America, (owners of Heinz, Birds Eye, Goodtea, Maxwell Hse &amp; George Bush’s Grandfather, Prescott) believed that their country should adopt the policies of Hitler and Mussolini to beat the great depression.“
      </p>
      <p>
       But the actual radio program said something entirely different, and made
no claim about Bush being involved with the plot. What it says is that Bush was a director of the Hamburg-America line, and that this company was investigated for Nazi ties by the same committee that investigated the Business Plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is everything that was said about Bush in that program:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Later in the McCormack-Dickstein report, a shipping company called Hamburg-America Line was accused of providing free passage to Germany to American journalists willing to write favorable copy on Hitler's rise to power. The company is also alleged to have brought Nazi spies and pro-fascist sympathizers into America. John Buchanan has studied this latest section of the report and has discovered that one of the company's managers came from a very famous family. "The thing that surprised me most was to discover in the documents of this company that Hamburg-America Lines had, in fact, been managed on the U. S. side at the executive level by Prescott Bush as part of a web of Nazi business interests that were all seized in late 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act by the U. S. Congress and Prescott Bush is the grandfather of the sitting President of the United States." [John Buchanan]
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, at the time it was perfectly legal to have dealings with Hitler's Germany. Prescott Bush was not called to account for this until America entered the war.

       Is there any indication why MacGuire thought they could get Butler on board?  It has always seemed absurd, given their supposed first encounter.

      <p>
       This is one of the big "wtf?" questions about Butler's story.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best explanation is that the "plotters" knew he would do what he thought was best for the common veterans. So they tried to convince him that what they wanted was best for them. When they first approached him, it was to speak at the American Legion Convention in support of remaining on the Gold Standard. They told him that even if he got the Bonus for the Bonus Army, it would be paid in "worthless paper currency." Butler declined because he couldn't see the connection between monetary policy and the veterans' Bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was heavily involved with the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army">
        Bonus Army
       </a>
       . In July 1931, the day before they were violently expelled from Washington, Butler spoke before their camp in Anacostia. He urged non-violence only to have the men kicked out by the Army. The U.S. army used poison gas, fixed bayonets, and even an early tank on peaceful veteran protesters in the Capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       After this happened, Butler's political views changed radically. This is where
       <em>
        War is a Racket
       </em>
       comes from. He decided that he could no longer support the military that would follow orders to attack peaceful protesters or the President that would give those orders. Butler, a lifelong Republican, campaigned for Franklin Roosevelt in the 1932 elections as a member of what he called the “Republicans for Hoover for Ex-President League” because Hoover had ordered the uses of “gas and bayonets on unarmed human beings.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that his support for FDR in 1932 was not political, but personal against Hoover (who he had served with in China - they had some sort of personal conflict even before the Bonus Army incident).
      </p>
      <p>
       As in Europe, those who joined fascist movements were often thoroughly dissatisfied with both left- and right-wing political ideologies and sought fascism as a middle ground.  A group like the one MacGuire wanted to build was tailor-made for the men of the Bonus Army, who sought only leaders who cared about them and recognized their sacrifice, and the means to survive. After betrayal at the hands of both American political parties (neither gave them their bonus, both threatened force) it was not so outlandish to think that they would support someone else.

       I see your point and you're probably right.  By that time, the power base, had enough experience to understand how people will seek out a better solution when the "solutions" they've been given don't work.  Why change the playbook if the other team still has no idea what's in it, I suppose.

       A follow up question, do you see the similarities between the current American political climate and the climate leading Butler into his more radical political views?   To me it seems like there are political movements trying to jump on the "gold standard" bandwagon just like MacGuire did, while convincing people it's for their benefit.  It just makes me wonder what is really going on behind the scenes of, not only the two primary political parties, but also of some of the independent parties.

        This means that his support for FDR in 1932 was not political, but personal against Hoover (who he had served with in China - they had some sort of personal conflict even before the Bonus Army incident).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There was a book, by George Seldes, mentioning that Butler and Hoover met in China during the Boxer Rebellion and Hoover allegedly tried to flee. Did you find documents that mentioned the incident specifically or anything that could verify that this actually happened?
