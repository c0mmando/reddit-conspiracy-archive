        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I live in the central mass area. A friend was canoeing on a pond in N. Brookfield, and he noticed a drone flying overhead multiple times. It has apparently been making low passes over his town for days now, and only then was it low enough for him to recognize it for what it was.</p>

<p>I know many drones were released to stateside police forces on their return from Afghanistan. I know I shouldn&#39;t be surprised that he saw it. I know the Patriot Act made this perfectly legal.</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t know is anything else. Is there anyone else in that area who has seen this? What the hell does this tiny town in the woods have that warrants a drone?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just starting to &quot;wake up,&quot; and I&#39;m frightened and looking for answers. I would have normally brushed this off, but after seeing Homeland Security perform a downtown lockdown drill in my home city of Worcester, and having a friend tell me about a new bunker being built in Springfield complete with an automated defense network, I just couldn&#39;t remain ignorant any longer.</p>

<p>So yeah, to reiterate, what the hell am I witness to? What the hell do I do?</p>

<p>TL;DR Drones over my friend&#39;s place, and Homeland Sec. locked down my city. Anyone got info? WTF?</p>

<p>EDIT: UPDATE 8-24-12 7:00 pm percisely.</p>

<p>The UAV is flying overhead as I type. It&#39;s approximately 15 feet long, altitude of appx. 500 feet. It&#39;s a canard wing powered by a single prop. It&#39;s been doing East-West runs for an hour or so.</p>

<p>Also, I wanted to add this: <a href="http://www.telegram.com/article/20120802/NEWS/120809847/1116">http://www.telegram.com/article/20120802/NEWS/120809847/1116</a></p>

<p>News article on Homeland Sec&#39;s &quot;drill.&quot;</p>

<p>Also learned from a friend today that DHS recently closed down a 2 mile stretch of I-290, landed several large cargo planes on the highway, and then left. All lights along the highway were turned off instantly. The State Police who were given a one hour notice to close down the highway were told &quot;Stay in your vehicles. You didn&#39;t see anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Things are getting weirder.</p>

<p>The Georgia Guidstones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The idea of exterminating us has been around <em>forever</em> (biblical) but it has an important purpose.  It keeps humanity on it&#39;s toes <em>constantly</em>.  The guidestones reflect this message, but keep in mind those stones will sit <em>forever</em> and cast a shadow of fear into the minds of every reader.  Remember that fear is the lifeblood of the ruling families.</p>

Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hands of the almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly</p>

These songs of freedom
&#39;cause they all I ever had
Redemption songs, redemption songs</p>

<p>Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
&#39;cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it&#39;s just a part of it
We&#39;ve got to fulfill the book</p>

These songs of freedom

    <div class="md"><p>Peaceful revolution is possible.  Do not condone violence the good people will end up killing each other.  The true power is in the massive consciousness shift. A part of this shift should be the laying down of arms and ending violence.  The more that die, the less powerful the oppressed become and the more likely the whole cycle will have to replay, costing double heartache. </p>

<p>Liberate through freedom not conquering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was 18, I lived in a homeless shelter.  My first day the other guys showed me the library and I checked out 2 books.  Fire on the Mountain, a bob marley biography and Jack Kerouac book.  I read the first page of each and was overcome with emotion of a magnitude I had never imagined.  Which path do I take?  It is so meta and so young naive over important that while it stuck with me and always seemed more important that is should, I think today, many years later, I kind of grasp the significance and why the magnitude was so great. </p>

<p>I never finished either book, but I got like 80 pages into Fire on the Mountain before checking into rehab.  It made me compliant to establishment and helped me understand some of society a little better, I think it created some confusion that would not be present if I just rastafari my way through it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot possibly say that with any real idea of world history.   You are reading the history of the conquerors and indoctrination.  Even they lay down arms once they have conquered indigenous people who have lived like that for much longer.  </p>

<p>As long as you create the divide between your own self and the &quot;hippies&quot; you will be angry, upset and convinced of your malicious intent as righteousness.  When you can lay down your barriers and withhold attacking people you just might realize how your own mind has been conquered to keep you from the truth. </p>

<p>You support an establishment that has completely enslaved your entire reality. You defend them and beg to be kept captive. </p>

<p>You should research the words you choose.  Ignorant would require ignoring the information that is available to everyone.  </p>

<p>Seek and you will find.  It is entirely your personal choice and your life and existence will reflect the choices you make and the words you use to get through the choices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one here seems to be helping you. When you first realize you&#39;re a prisoner to a military-industrial-debt system your world changes. It&#39;s important to understand that the situation is much worse in one way and much better in another way. I recommend that you start watching some documentaries to see how far the rabbit hole goes. Thrive is a good starting point and available online. There are a few good ones after that. Once you understand the diagnosis, giving the right medicine is much easier. But giving you the medicine right now won&#39;t make sense. The world is waking up right now, there is hope. And it will be okay if you are informed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black trucks were doing what they called a &quot;drill&quot; downtown in Worcester. Shut down the whole of City Square. From what people tell me (I was on the Leicester end of the city when it happened) they just cordoned off the area, and it looked like they were training to defend the government buildings against rioting citizens.</p>

<p>As for what I saw personally? Five Blackhawks flying formation about 300 feet altitude. Sketchy as hell already, especially over Worcester, as the nearest airbase is Springfield. I also saw a few of those black trucks (armored bank truck type as well as what looked like a military vehicle I have never seen before) on roving patrol in the west end of the city.</p>

<p>Overall, it looked way too out of place. When I pair that with other stories of government urban warfare training in cities across the country, it looks mighty heavily like they&#39;re planning to secure all the major urban areas, and monitor things out in the woods with drones. Kind of like the spoke and hub system the airports use, except with surveillance (and dispatching &quot;peacekeepers&quot;).</p>

<p>The pieces are all there if you&#39;re willing to see them for what they are.</p>

Just think it&#39;s weird that something that big I haven&#39;t heard about (I get weekly updates on all the non-crazy and crazy things) but maybe that&#39;s the point of the &#39;operation.&#39;</p>

<p>Can you at least name what your source does, anything? How powerful of a position are they in to know something like that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool. Yeah, I&#39;ll be here until they drop the &#39;net on us. (Get it? Lol!)</p>

<p>I just discovered this sub, I&#39;ve been on r/guns for a month or two now, and a friend put me onto this. Of course, since then things have started getting weirder around here. Just don&#39;t wait too long, lest we meet up in the future at a resistance meeting in some basement somewhere as we plot to liberate Springfield. That awkward &quot;oh, hey, you&#39;re THAT guy!&quot; moment.</p>
