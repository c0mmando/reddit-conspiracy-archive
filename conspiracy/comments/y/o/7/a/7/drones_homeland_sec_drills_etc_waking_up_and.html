       I live in the central mass area. A friend was canoeing on a pond in N. Brookfield, and he noticed a drone flying overhead multiple times. It has apparently been making low passes over his town for days now, and only then was it low enough for him to recognize it for what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know many drones were released to stateside police forces on their return from Afghanistan. I know I shouldn't be surprised that he saw it. I know the Patriot Act made this perfectly legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't know is anything else. Is there anyone else in that area who has seen this? What the hell does this tiny town in the woods have that warrants a drone?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just starting to "wake up," and I'm frightened and looking for answers. I would have normally brushed this off, but after seeing Homeland Security perform a downtown lockdown drill in my home city of Worcester, and having a friend tell me about a new bunker being built in Springfield complete with an automated defense network, I just couldn't remain ignorant any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, to reiterate, what the hell am I witness to? What the hell do I do?
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Drones over my friend's place, and Homeland Sec. locked down my city. Anyone got info? WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: UPDATE 8-24-12 7:00 pm percisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UAV is flying overhead as I type. It's approximately 15 feet long, altitude of appx. 500 feet. It's a canard wing powered by a single prop. It's been doing East-West runs for an hour or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I wanted to add this:
       <a href="http://www.telegram.com/article/20120802/NEWS/120809847/1116">
        http://www.telegram.com/article/20120802/NEWS/120809847/1116
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       News article on Homeland Sec's "drill."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also learned from a friend today that DHS recently closed down a 2 mile stretch of I-290, landed several large cargo planes on the highway, and then left. All lights along the highway were turned off instantly. The State Police who were given a one hour notice to close down the highway were told "Stay in your vehicles. You didn't see anything."
      </p>
      <p>
       Things are getting weirder.

       Old pirates, yes they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hands of the almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

These songs of freedom

       Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

       Peaceful revolution is possible.  Do not condone violence the good people will end up killing each other.  The true power is in the massive consciousness shift. A part of this shift should be the laying down of arms and ending violence.  The more that die, the less powerful the oppressed become and the more likely the whole cycle will have to replay, costing double heartache.

       When I was 18, I lived in a homeless shelter.  My first day the other guys showed me the library and I checked out 2 books.  Fire on the Mountain, a bob marley biography and Jack Kerouac book.  I read the first page of each and was overcome with emotion of a magnitude I had never imagined.  Which path do I take?  It is so meta and so young naive over important that while it stuck with me and always seemed more important that is should, I think today, many years later, I kind of grasp the significance and why the magnitude was so great.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never finished either book, but I got like 80 pages into Fire on the Mountain before checking into rehab.  It made me compliant to establishment and helped me understand some of society a little better, I think it created some confusion that would not be present if I just rastafari my way through it.

       You cannot possibly say that with any real idea of world history.   You are reading the history of the conquerors and indoctrination.  Even they lay down arms once they have conquered indigenous people who have lived like that for much longer.

       Go into the woods and see the nonviolence, the anarchy and the chaos we call nature.

       As long as you create the divide between your own self and the "hippies" you will be angry, upset and convinced of your malicious intent as righteousness.  When you can lay down your barriers and withhold attacking people you just might realize how your own mind has been conquered to keep you from the truth.

       You should research the words you choose.  Ignorant would require ignoring the information that is available to everyone.

       No one here seems to be helping you. When you first realize you're a prisoner to a military-industrial-debt system your world changes. It's important to understand that the situation is much worse in one way and much better in another way. I recommend that you start watching some documentaries to see how far the rabbit hole goes. Thrive is a good starting point and available online. There are a few good ones after that. Once you understand the diagnosis, giving the right medicine is much easier. But giving you the medicine right now won't make sense. The world is waking up right now, there is hope. And it will be okay if you are informed.

       Research Agenda 21 and how it is being implemented in your local area under the guise of "sustainability initiatives" once you find out that almost every city in the country is implementing "sustainability initiatives" you see the pattern and need to start waking other people up to it.  Agenda 21 is the basis for the police state build up, the drones, the economic collapse, etc.  over at
       <a href="/r/agenda21">

       Black trucks were doing what they called a "drill" downtown in Worcester. Shut down the whole of City Square. From what people tell me (I was on the Leicester end of the city when it happened) they just cordoned off the area, and it looked like they were training to defend the government buildings against rioting citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for what I saw personally? Five Blackhawks flying formation about 300 feet altitude. Sketchy as hell already, especially over Worcester, as the nearest airbase is Springfield. I also saw a few of those black trucks (armored bank truck type as well as what looked like a military vehicle I have never seen before) on roving patrol in the west end of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, it looked way too out of place. When I pair that with other stories of government urban warfare training in cities across the country, it looks mighty heavily like they're planning to secure all the major urban areas, and monitor things out in the woods with drones. Kind of like the spoke and hub system the airports use, except with surveillance (and dispatching "peacekeepers").
      </p>
      <p>
       The pieces are all there if you're willing to see them for what they are.

       yes,I agree with you a hundred percent.I haven't been on reddit very long,but I subscribed to this subreddit not long ago and your story sounds familiar.I,too,have seen military movement.Last spring I saw about a hundred army trucks go up one of the rural roads here.I have never seen anything like it...I've seen other stuff since then,too..including just this past weekend three black helicopters just down the road hovering.There's military movement all over the U.S.keep us updated.I think they are preparing for unrest.I don't know why everyone doesn't see it,anyway,let us know if you see anything else.

       Honestly, nothing would even save the shithole that is downtown Springfield, we had metal detectors in our school but not even the cops had the nuts to patrol some of those streets.

       Just find it weird is all, most of my family is still there and I haven't heard a word about that. My close friend currently heads a building in downtown Springfield that does leads the VoIP work for almost the entire city, and I hear a lot about the city, haven't heard that.

       Look at the face recognition system they put up in NYC. They hired guys from Indiana who only knew that they had been contracted by Consolidated Edison (I think that's what they call the utility guys). Doubt you'd hear much.

       I'm extremely curious what your source is then.. I have an extremely close friend in the DoD, and as I said, a small group of friends basically controls all the VoIP services in Springfield, with one of them actually being the lead of all of it. I hear about
       <strong>
        a lot
       </strong>
       of shit that happens in my home town, to have something that big not even be mentioned, your source must be pretty perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to not doubt you, but hearsay is hearsay, and nothing you (nor I) can say without any piece of proof is just hard to believe, especially given the nature of what you're talking about.

       Do you still live in the area? I'm not burning my source, end of story. If you live east of springfield and really want to know, I'm not using electronic or postal means. I could tell you, but that's it. I'm sorry, I want you to believe me, but I'm not going to betray sources.

       I do not. You seem pretty confident, so maybe you'll end up right in the end anyway. Just think it's weird that something that big I haven't heard about (I get weekly updates on all the non-crazy and crazy things) but maybe that's the point of the 'operation.'

       Can you at least name what your source does, anything? How powerful of a position are they in to know something like that?

       I just discovered this sub, I've been on r/guns for a month or two now, and a friend put me onto this. Of course, since then things have started getting weirder around here. Just don't wait too long, lest we meet up in the future at a resistance meeting in some basement somewhere as we plot to liberate Springfield. That awkward "oh, hey, you're THAT guy!" moment.
