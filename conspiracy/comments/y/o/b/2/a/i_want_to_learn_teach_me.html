    <div class="md"><p>First off, although zeitgeist has useful information, some of it is blatant lies, and many use this problem as a means to attempt to discredit us here at r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>To understand the state of the world now, I would recommend becoming mentally prepared to accept that basically everything in the world is the opposite that it should be. Education destroys minds, doctors destroy health, food destroys health, politicians work for the bankers and the money, not the people, and those that supposedly run the &quot;free world&quot; are merely part of a massive behemoth banking empire that the Rothschilds run. The owners of the world are the bankers, not the people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to a private school, and the result was the same...a serious lack in INTEREST in education from myself and other students. The modern primary school system whether its public or private destroys interest in education and it is by design....the owners decided way back in the beginning of the 20th century that they wanted obedient workers rather than people capable of critical thinking. The result is constant repetition that breeds boredom and lack of interest in learning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strange, my group of friends went to a private school in a different town than the one we grew up in (only had one High School in the town) and the difference was absolutely staggering. Happened every year, test scores, graduation numbers, attendance numbers, drop out rates, it was huge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t the differences between public and private that are in debate.  That is well known, proven and frankly completely logical.  When you compare a class size of 36 students per teacher, to a class with 14 students per teacher, guess which class will perform better?  When all the students have &quot;rich&quot; parents to pay for private school, these children are  expected to do well, and they do!</p>

<p>The problem is the relevance of said test scores, and graduation requirements, as well as the way these topics are addressed.  Students spend all day long memorizing things.  Learning is no longer about discovery, and inspiring awe it has been transformed into deadlines and test scores. </p>

<p>Take science class for example.  Science at it&#39;s heart is about exploring the world around us.  Learning how to identify, and classify different processes present in the world around us.  Instead it has been turned into memorizing words and facts and equations.  All the fun has been taken out of science.</p>

<p>Standardized testing is bad for everyone but the people in charge of the schools and the people in charge of the tests.  We memorize things for the test and dump the information, very little real learning takes place in the modern school system.</p>

<p>Maybe I just went to a weird school? Our normal state testing was pretty idiotic, and is described perfectly by what you say, but outside of that, things are pretty different.</p>

<p>Our environmental science type class involved walking down to the park by the school every day and just putting the change we noticed in our journal and being taught what that means based off of what we saw. </p>

<p>My AP Government teacher taught us all about the factual conspiracies, including not only the information but his thoughts on things like MKULTRA, Tuskegee Experiment, even common theories about the JFK Assassination.</p>

<p>In my Biology class, we learned about creationism vs evolution and had a five-day debate about the idea of evolution vs creationism and in the end my teacher just let out a chuckle and said that every year they do the same thing, and every year creationism just gives up and can&#39;t win in the end.</p>

<p>I really only had one class, intro to Trig, that was really about nose in the books, memorize equations and eyes forward. Everything else was pretty exploratory learning - we had to learn all the information that was going to be <em>on</em> the standardized test, but it wasn&#39;t some monotonous drone-esque repetitious process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Learning is no longer about discovery, and inspiring awe it has been transformed into deadlines and test scores. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ve been way too far away from school for too long, but I have siblings who went to the same school that I did, did similar projects in the same classes and had all the same teachers.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was one of the lucky ones? But the way people describe it sounds so foreign to me, and I did attend secondary in the U.S.</p>

<p>I only named a handful of classes just to not go through all the courses I took every single year, but nearly all of my classes were pretty damn similar in terms of experiences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, private school is a much higher quality &quot;education&quot; insofar as SAT scores and college prep goes, but as far as actually producing critical thinking individuals they fall short as well because they all have to adhere to the same standards in order to be an accredited school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s disinfo. The end messages are too empowering of the people. The head of the pyramid is stated to be the rothschilds which we know is most likely true so I find that hard to accept as disinfo.</p>

<p>Thrive was the starting point for my journey. Really great at planting the right seeds and covering a majority of topics while ending on a note of how to change. Overall I recommend it above all else, and I&#39;ve watched hundreds of hours of docos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My advice is, to develop a healthy skepticism towards everything you watch, hear and read. My impression is, that both mainstream and alterntive history and news are distorted. In the end you can only trust yourself. So try to verify everything.</p>

<p>A good source which might help in the beginning and has lots of reliable resources is the website <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/">wanttoknow.info.</a>. This website has tips that help against becoming overwhelmed by the information and it has also tips how you can conduct your own research.</p>

<p>Another good resource might be the <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/podcasts/">Corbettreport</a>. I believe James Corbett is someone who is genuinely interested in the truth and has intellectual integrity. He is also a jack of all trades,  who is presenting all kinds of conspiracy related material. So he sometimes might lack the necessary knowledge to separate truth from myths. But he always provides the sources from which he got his information and interpretation from.</p>

<p>Here is a good basic <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-050-the-c-word/">podcast</a> about conspiracies which might give you an impression about the challenges the word conspiracy theory brings with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elected governments are false fronts coordinated by a global shadow government:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>National governments pretend independent motives while enacting a scripted version of world events</p></li>
<li><p>To consolidate this power, world events are scripted toward creating conditions that rationalize the increasing removal of freedom and independence from nations and individuals. Wars, civil wars, and revolutions provide this catalyst. In the future, earth cataclysms will likely be used toward these ends.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is no American government:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Our elected government is a sham. Elections are manipulated to put key puppets into office, and polls are rigged to sway mass opinion. Politicans are blackmailed or bribed into serving the New World Order. Blackmail comes via past activities they may have been tempted into partaking, or else such politicans have been bribed with luxuries and promises of further power, privilege, and survival in times to come.</p></li>
<li><p>Tricks used by world manipulators include hegelian dialectics and false dichotomies. Hegelian dialectics is better known as problem-reaction-solution, whereby a problem is created to push people into accepting a rigged solution. Incidents such as the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine massacre, Aurora massacre, and 9/11 attacks were engineered by the shadow government to justify the further removal of freedoms from the populace to “keep them safe.” Ultimately, liberty traded for security leads to slavery.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Media and public education brainwash citizens into acquiescing to corrupted authority:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Public education is behavior modification designed to create worker drones instead of capable individuals.This is done through systems of reward and punishment, compartmentalization of the mind, preoccupation with meaningless work, political correctness, and distortions of facts and principles in textbooks.</p></li>
<li><p>The media has no obligation to report truth, only to make money and obey orders from the government. Thus they either appeal to the lowest common denominator in mass consciousness and thus help lower mass consciousness further, or else they report stories that propagate an agenda. News is designed to emotionally shock and hypnotize the public into giving up their self-determination and discernment.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The economy is heavily manipulated:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stock markets are rigged to provide funding for the shadow government. What appear as random fluctuations in the market are instead planned in advance, allowing the elite to retract their investments before a planned downturn or crash. This pumping mechanism happens on a greater economic scale as well, allowing the elite to periodically harvest wealth from ignorant citizens who buy into the illusion of a free economy.</p></li>
<li><p>The shadow government uses the Federal Reserve and the IRS as further sources of funding. The Federal Reserve prints millions of dollars in cash every year but pays only for the manufacturing cost. This fiat money is then injected into the economy where people assume it has real worth and thus do real work and create real products in exchange for these worthless reserve notes. Normally this would cause inflation, but what the Federal Reserve prints the IRS later takes out through income tax. Because what goes in as fake cash is then taken out as real wealth, citizens are shafted and the parasites of humanity grow fatter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>etc etc etc.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Long and strange.</p>

<p>One thing Michael Tsarion (yes, yes, I know he&#39;s a bit misguided) said that really jived with me was that we learn this info in cycles. You read some doom and gloom illuminati stuff... then, all of a sudden, you are studying everything you can find about extraterrestrial life... next you&#39;re digging deep into religious texts and history... then geopolitics... etc... until you find yourself back at the Bilderburgs.</p>

<p>A key, for me, is learning how to analyze the motives of the presenter of the information; the &quot;who&quot; and the &quot;why&quot;. This will help you discern which parts of the &quot;what&quot; are useful and which are propaganda, spin, or disinfo. It gets easier as you go. Studying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivium_%28education%29">Trivium</a> helps. <a href="http://www.redicecreations.com/radio/2011/08/RIR-110818.php">This guy elaborates.</a> </p>

<p>Note: While there is a wealth of information at Red Ice, I would get a grasp on truth discernment before listening to too much of it for anything besides entertainment. Palmgren entertains all of his guests&#39; viewpoints and leaves the judgement up to the listener.</p>

<p>Basically, you end up soaking everything up through your senses (open mind), filtering it out with your understanding of the Trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and apply only that which withstands your tests to your memory/philosophy/reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would get some background on the root evil of many of the woes of the world, that being private central banking systems with their enabling of deficit-spending and therefore militarism to establish banana republic style hedgemonies. A good watch for this would be The Money Masters and/or Monopoly Men: Federal Reserve Fraud. A good follow up might be Why 
We Fight or Iraq for Sale, which shows who really profits from war.</p>

<p>You need to understand the mechanisms through which our minds become shackled, check out The Century of the Self for a broad look and then Psywar for a more specific updated account of the implementation of propaganda and it&#39;s effectiveness.</p>

<p>History is rife with the use of false flag operations and terror, unfortunately it&#39;s all too prevalent in modern times and needs to be understood. There are many docs on this, check out <a href="http://www.topdocumentary.com">www.topdocumentary.com</a> to learn more. </p>

<p>I could go on and on but keep in mind some of this shit will really get to you once you start to see the man behind the curtain, pace yourself if need be. Hell, none of the things mentioned are even really conspiracy&#39;s by common usage of the word today, they&#39;ll just make it easier to see the big picture.</p>

<p>Listen to all, follow none. Know that it&#39;s important to be able to entertain a notion without endorsing it, be your own devils advocate. Realize so called experts don&#39;t have a monopoly on truth. Stay informed of unfolding conspiracy&#39;s such as Fast and Furious and Libor as people that scoff at that word usually shut up when confronted with clear modern day examples of such. I&#39;m rambling, good luck truth-seeker.</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot, Edward Griffin speeches and his book Creature from Jekyll Island are fantastic. Freedom to Fascism is a good introduction, as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence is key here. I suggest the first thing you research is government websites. Look up Operation Northwoods, Gulf of Tonkin, and MK-Ultra and you can find documented proof that our government has always been working for their own personal gains. Regardless how many innocent people are hurt or killed. If you know it&#39;s possible to conduct that behavior, it opens your eyes to all of the other lies they feed us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t fall into the trap.  I only came across this subreddit and began to actually look at the threads to see if the people here are actually serious, and they are.  You won&#39;t find any information of value here.  Stop demanding evidence because you won&#39;t be getting any.  Members of this subreddit and those like them will tell you anything so long as it is more interesting than reality or fits into their &quot;the government and rich people are out to get you&quot; narrative.  If you want to know what&#39;s &quot;going on&quot; and keep abreast of the world&#39;s happenings, follow trustworthy news outlets like the BBC or AJE.  </p>

<p>The people here, however good their intentions may or may not be, will dissuade you from believing in reality.  Everyone knows politicians aren&#39;t all good and that rich people are mostly greedy and entitled.  These people will have you believe that they&#39;re all colluding to get you and your family under their absolute rule and to take over the human race.  They will use fabricated evidence and stretched truths (often contradicting each other) to get you on their side.  Are they crazy?  Immature? Do they have ulterior motives?  I don&#39;t know.  All I know is that if you want information, this is the worst place to get it.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to apologize in advance here OP. I don&#39;t want to sound rude but it will come across as rude.</p>

<p>You come here and &quot;demand&quot; the evidence? Shall somebody serve that to you on a plate of silver perhaps? Or would you prefer gold?</p>

<p>I can see you want to learn, but you cannot demand a damn thing and think you are learning. It does not work that way, you alone are responsible for the Truth and you alone can uncover the evidence. To ask someone to provide it is to give up your knowledge, your learning and instead believe what may be another lie...</p>

<p>You alone are responsible for what the truth really is, don&#39;t ask to be shown, find it yourself.</p>

<p>Learn some real history, read what you can, research what you can and maybe someday you will have your evidence.</p>

<p>We here are over-run with shills and yes, some ideas here are crazy, then again some of those crazies are right. You decide and you bring your evidence here and lets see what you have.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t demand something you are not willing to research yourself. That&#39;s not really how it works. The real Truth is a hard road. You and you alone can find it.</p>
