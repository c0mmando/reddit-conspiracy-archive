       This line is trotted out frequently, but it is not a compelling argument.

       Why WOULD the Russians have known, considering nobody else did? They may have suspected something was amiss, but going public on that suspicion could have backfired and made them look foolish.

       the moon (256,000 miles from the earth) was occupied by humans 7 times in 3 years, during one of the most expensive and devastating wars in united states history, with technology that now exists in consumer cellphones and televisions. american morale shot through the roof, much needed for the americans, who supported a brutal attack on a sovereign country that wasn't executed as well as it was planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       quite conveniently, these landings took place just as the public learned of the illegal b-52 bombing of cambodia, the cia's operation phoenix program (and the 3 simultaneous press conferences in ny, sf, and rome by 3 vietnam vets attempting to publicize it), the lie of withdrawing the troops (only 25,000 of more than half a million are actually sent home), the incineration of grissom, white, and chaffee (astronauts who were public critics of NASA and the apollo rockets), the pentagon papers, thomas baron's highly critical 1500 page testimony to congress (baron was a safety inspector for NASA who was killed a week later), and of course more illegal bombings in vietnam after the breakdown of all peace talks.
      </p>
      <p>
       since 1972, the farthest man has traveled into space is 400 miles. there are no proposed future manned moon landings by the united states of america's NASA, but
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       because it's just too expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       today, there exists certain troubling 'conspiracy theorists' who believe that the flag of The Greatest Country On Earth does not stand on the moon. these people are to be chastised and academic discussion of the legitimacy of the moon landings is to be barred. anyone that asks why
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the united states is the only country in the world to land a man on the moon in the midst of an expensive, morale-draining fraud of a war, and a space race they were losing to the soviets
       </li>
       <li>
        the united states chose a former
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">
         nazi
        </a>
        as director of their space flight program
       </li>
       <li>
        that nazi's team journeyed to antarctica (where moonrocks from lunar metorites commonly land and are well preserved due to the conditions) in 1967 during the aforementioned space race
       </li>
       <li>
        a majority of the moon rocks given to foreign countries are now

       so whats going on with LRO images.... specifically the part where we are capturing images of footpaths...  from a satellite... orbiting the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, missing moon rocks really isn't that surprising... they are probably one of the rarest, most priceless artifacts known to man... hence the statement in your cited article
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "There is no doubt in my mind that many moon rocks are lost or stolen and now sitting in private collections,"

       This was very well said! I like your efforts of satirizing the questioning of the official story, while placing facts to some of the lesser known actions the federal government took which make the official story seem suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through your dialogue in this thread, you have very eloquently shown facts of the niche topic at hand, and without claiming explicit knowledge of what actually happened- theorizing what happened- and admitting your degree of speculation in the true events, you have made a logically sound and correctly-epistemic argument.

       We dont know half of whats really happening, I find what you said very logical. They have the power to control all our media and educational system, they have the power to make us believe anything. Maybe this was a distraction for the people during those times.

       Wow, I'll certainly be reading more of this now. Since you seem to well informed on the subject, do you think this ties in at all with your theories that the moon landings never happened? Did they cover something up by doing this, or was it to clear an area where something was supposed to be?

       that i do not know. did they actually do this? that article is from 2009. of course there is a possibility of a cover up, but i don't know why or for what reason. maybe i need to do some more reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for my knowledge on the subject, i'm just relaying facts. it's up to you whether you want to conclude that we landed on the moon or not.

       hm...yeah, i can't quite think of an alternative motive in bombing the moon (i can't quite grasp what justifies their official motive in bombing it either). the only alternative possibility to me would be an alien civilization, but that is an extreme belief without any circumstantial evidence.

       i recommend the link that sinominous posted on the apollo landings. dave mcgowan is an excellent 'conspiracy' writer in that he relies on facts and not conjecture, there are no outrageous claims, he simply lays out facts for you to connect the dots.

       they didn't bomb it... they impacted it... bomb implies explosives... they impacted it to throw a plume of dust up into the air... which gives them the ability to take spectrographs of the light reflected from that dust and determine what is deep below the surface (as thats what is ejected up into the sky from an impact).  from spectrographs, that is the specific wavelengths of light reflected back, they can determine with pretty decent accuracy what kind of materials are deep below the surface... in this case they were looking for water.

       you know guys, theres really not a conspiracy here...  there is a pretty reasonable, scientifically accurate, justification for these missions... just because you don't understand what's going on initially doesn't mean there is some sinister purpose.

       Here is an interview I did with a US Army Vet who was other than honorably discharged in 1980 for refusing to participate in a program which loaded anti-gravitic craft with freeze dried food, seeds, and other material intended to offer a way of survival to the world elites in an anticipated global catastrophic event in 2012.  These craft, according to this source which is corroborated by others in the black budget military - were supposed to be delivering the goods to the back side of the moon where there are numerous reptilian bases.  This interview was used by Bill Ryan of Project Camelot to formulate what he calls his "Ultimate hypothesis."  He uses other whistleblowers to corroborate what Dutch states in this interview.  That link is at the bottom of this post.

       I guess your sarcasm detector isn't working. I wasn't expecting a source, and even if he provided one, it's bull. We landed on the moon. I believe our government is evil. I believe 9/11 was an inside job. But I definitely do not believe in humanoid reptiles or that the moon landing was faked. If we can get a rover on mars, we can land a man on the moon.

       I shut my sarcasm detector off because it tends to read false positives on extra wacky conspiracy theories. Usually I'm able to tell internet sarcasm (even if it's just one word) by facial expressions and tone of type but I guess this one slipped by. (Sarcasm on the internet is less obvious than in real life)

My grandfather personally designed the navigation controls for the space capsule, I have held the blueprints in my hand.

       that is all conjecture and opinion. here is some reality: if men were able to be launched to the moon and back (a 512,000 mile round trip) in

       , then common sense tells us that more than 40 years later, there should be no problem in at least doing a fly-by of the moon in

       "It is commonly believed that man will fly directly from the earth to the moon, but to do this, we would require a vehicle of such gigantic proportions that it would prove an economic impossibility. It would have to develop sufficient speed to penetrate the atmosphere and overcome the earth’s gravity and, having traveled all the way to the moon, it must still have enough fuel to land safely and make the return trip to earth. Furthermore, in order to give the expedition a margin of safety, we would not use one ship alone, but a minimum of three … each rocket ship would be taller than New York’s Empire State Building [almost ¼ mile high] and weigh about ten times the tonnage of the Queen Mary, or some 800,000 tons." -Von Braun, in his book 'conquest of the moon'

       What scientific purpose is gained from going to the moon again for the hulluva it?  If something scientific was to be achieved, something useful, then yes we would do this... but really theres not all that much to be gained from doing it in terms of the risk and cost.  the novelty is gone now, as is much of the unknown. the rest we can do with substantially cheaper and less risky robots.

       Also, we have a satellite orbiting it... taking photos of its surface... including where we landed... its called LRO.

       if exploring the moon is a novelty then why are other countries still attempting manned moon missions? surely the americans have learned everything there is to learn about the moon and it's a moot point now. why is it risky or costly? it was done in '69 perfectly the first time, during an expensive cold war and 'hot' war in se asia.

       If by common sense you mean "utterly ignoring the difference between two entirely different spacecraft", then yes.

       The space shuttle is designed specifically to carry enough fuel to enter Earth orbit, maneuver, and a de-orbit burn.
By similar rationale, a 1980s moped should be a good replacement for a 1960s moving van to transport a living-room furniture set cross-country. [edit: Shuttle payload capacity to low Earth orbit: 53,600 lbs. 
Saturn V payload to low Earth orbit: 260,000 lbs ]

       Citing Von Braun, while interesting only shows how far they've come. His quote comes from a book from 1953. Back then, they were still struggling to break the sound barrier. Scientific rockets were still based on the WWII V-2 rocket (See "V-2 Bumper"), barely experimenting with two-stage designs. Oh, and while you're quote-mining, be sure to include that he
       <em>
        still thought it was technically feasible
       </em>
       , even without the future knowledge of more efficient engine designs and improved staging mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, it's hardly a surprise he made an assumption based on the technology of the day. It's excusable. But next time you try to disprove technology based on highly dated quotes, here's some to consider:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible.” — Lord Kelvin, British mathematician and physicist, president of the British Royal Society, 1895.
      </p>
      <p>
       “There will never be a bigger plane built.” — A Boeing engineer, after the first flight of the 247, a twin engine plane that holds ten people
      </p>
      <p>
       “This is the biggest fool thing we have ever done. The bomb will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives.” — Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy during World War II, advising President Truman on the atomic bomb, 1945.[6] Leahy admitted the error five years later in his memoirs
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are we to go by the past quotes of
       <em>
        every

       incorrect expert in history?

       why haven't we gone back to the moon with more efficient spacecraft? if experts denied the feasibility of airplanes and improvement of technology, can not the same thing be said for spacecraft? why is it impractical to send men back to the moon, and why can we not come close to something built over 40 years ago?

       Simple question gets a simple answer: Money.
NASA would love to have a budget that could get them to the Moon (and Mars, which is what they keep asking for). However, since NASA only gets 0.5% of the federal budget, they can't exactly afford it. Correcting for inflation, that's half the available funding than what they had in 1966.
      </p>
      <p>
       The space shuttle, aside from its scientific uses, also served practical uses (launching satellites, repairing them, and moving them to different orbits).
There's a prevailing impression with the public that NASA gets a big chunk of the tax dollars. Despite this not being the case, it was much easier to justify the costs of a shuttle program to politicians than exploratory missions.

       Yes, we have the ability to build much better and more efficient technology than back then. But cutting-edge technology still costs cutting-edge prices. Right now, the US Government isn't willing to give NASA enough money to undertake something as expensive as a manned mission.

       Well, if they flew that rocket all the way to the moon, landed the LEM, then played back fake recordings... why not put people inside? Never mind that the LEM has to be removed from its housing and docked manually.

       Can't you just use a high powered telescope and see the tire tracks on the moon? I'm pretty sure this is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, watch the movie "For All Mankind". The footage in that movie cannot be faked. I know this because I have done some film work and trust me, you can't fake some of those shots, not even now (for example there is a shot in that movie that is a fixed shot from the porthole of the orbiting craft showing a complete orbit of the moon, complete with light from the sun shining into the porthole, illuminating dust on the porthole, then the sun goes behind the moon and the light changes naturally I.E. very slow, very nature like. These things are hard to fake).

       You would need a telescope with roughly a 300ft diameter mirror to see details that small.  You're asking if we can see something 10" across that's 200,000+ miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that when viewing google maps the details you're seeing when fully zoomed are coming from a lens much smaller than the Hubble (7'10") at ~50 miles up.  Now just multiply that distance by 40,000.

       So they did go to the moon. The conspiracy is that they found large semitransparent structures constructed of glass on the lunar surface, visible in some Apollo photography when the images are digitally filtered.   e.g.
       <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_moonanomalies.htm">
        http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_moonanomalies.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a cover up. Aldrin and Armstrong underwent nlp so that anytime anyone ever brought up "the moon" they would come over all grumpy. This led to Aldrin physically attacking
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/20/buzz-aldrin-punches-moon_n_241664.html">
        at least one person
       </a>
       Armstrong simply went into recluse mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Hoagland who was CBS Science correspondent during the lunar landings specifically remembers that a dark figure (not part of the press core but familiar with the project leadership) planted flyers on the press briefing room chairs directly after the landing stating "the moon landing was a complete and utter f***ing Hoax".
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the 'seed' of the well known conspiracy that 'we never went to the moon' but it was deliberately planted/designed to be the prevailing conspiracy to stifle talk of  the existence of structures on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       so now, whenever people talk about the moon conspiracy they automatically think of  we never went there  and all discussion is centered on that.

       Yes, Armstrong went into recluse but Aldrin came outspoken, later he had to "rephrase" his position regarding the "black rectangular structures following us" as parts of their spacecraft. But like any badass he's still outspoken maybe not on our Luna but on another planet's moon: Phobos

       You really expected col. Aldrin to jump out of his chair on c-span screaming "Aliens, they're Aliens" !! He's  trying to call attention to the lack of NASA funding and how much there is out there unexplored, and what we can ultimately find.
      </p>
      <p>
       His approach to whatever is there was succinct as only a scientist of his degree and experience can be. But it's peculiar enough to be called attention to., it's no "face on mars", it's something concrete, yet little spoken of.
      </p>

       BTW why did Russia's Phobos-grunt failed ! many Russian conspiracists blamed the failure on HAARP ?!

       I know that there is not much to find there, but I am surprised we have never gone back.  If we could do it in the 60's then we can surely make it work today.  Yea, we can collect data without sending in human beings, but I think it would be so freaking cool to see some more footage in higher quality than before.

       Yeah, but what would be the point? We've already been there, and there's not much we can learn that we haven't already, so it'd be spending a massive amount of money for some higher-quality videos.

       IIRC, the guy had been harassing Buzz repeatedly, despite multiple requests to leave him alone. Witnesses to the incident also agreed that Seibrel was "aggressively" poking him with the bible he kept insisting Buzz swear upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, Buzz  A) fought in wars (USAF, Korea) B) Did one of the most complex, high pressure jobs of the century, and C) Grew up when men didn't hide behind others when someone gets in their face and acts aggressively.

       If someone continues to harass you and your granddaughter, acts aggressively, then initiates physical contact, that's it. You don't have to start something, but you can sure as hell finish it.

       Do you know what the purpose would be of a fake moon landing? No, neither do I. Therefore, until we know the truth you have no way of knowing if it is or isn't relevant.

       If the government deployed space weapons, if they found the moon was artificial, if they found transparent structures (proposals given by others), that's all pretty relevant. Please add to the discussion, don't try to stifle it.

       I don't think we went when we said we did. I don't have any evidence to prove that. It's just a thought. Russia beat us to space, but we beat them to the moon? How?

       Well, entering LEO (while complicated) isn't nearly as problematic as a moon landing. When you essentially have the entire aeronautics industry of the USA working under a high budget, it's astonishing how much you can get done. However, this rush also led to the unsafe design choices for the Apollo 1 module, which is why they were heavily revamped before they moved back to manned missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviets, meanwhile, pushed very hard as well - but face major setbacks; mainly in the form of their primary mover (their take on the Saturn V) blowing up on the launch pad. It probably didn't help that the lead designer died well before it was anywhere complete. Their fuel was poorer quality, they didn't have the best computers, and the USA started designing their F1 engine 5 years before the Soviets started on their equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's tough to imagine these days, but back then the USA was
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       leading edge of aerospace, electronics, computers, and volume manufacturing.

       I don't think it was faked, however, there may have been backup footage made just-in-case the mission didn't succeed.  I've watched a lot of the moon conspiracy movies and this seems to be the most rational explanation to reconcile both camps.  Oh, and Stanley Kubrick may have been enlisted to help make the fake footage that was never used.

       As for more crazy theories.  That aliens/humans live on the dark side of the moon.  Scary thought, and how would the average person know for sure?  That means a full moon is a good sign, not a bad one, right?  heh.
      </p>
      <p>
       My favorite one is that we have to help the moon evolve spiritually, so it can help us fend off an asteroid/hostile craft by crashing into it.  If we fail to do that, life on Earth will be wiped out and we will have to evolve all over again.  I have no idea how we help it "evolve spiritually".

       I think that they actually went to the moon, but judging by the evidence it is probable that the moon landing itself was not live. The mission's most crucial part was very likely first carried out, then edited, and broad casted as if it was live. The astronauts were already on their way back to Earth during the 'official landing'. This was done mainly to prevent any unwanted data leaks and to cover up any possible failures.

       I've only skimmed the information about this subject and its ability to actually be performed.  One of the "damning" pieces of evidence is that the radiation from some outer-outer-space band would not allow human life to be able to pass through it, whether it was only for a few short minutes or not.  Also, the radiation would be present on the moon itself when the astronauts were taking their "walk".
      </p>
      <p>
       However the little bit of information that intrigues me is that if any of that part of the story is true, then what about the phone call between Richard Nixon and Neil Armstrong?  Is it feasible for telephone signals to be transmitted that long of a distance, going through such a high radiation field that is so described?

       On the note of the van-allen belts the capsule they were in was pretty heavily shielded and the dosage received on board was well within acceptable levels (around a hundredth of a sievert). It should also be noted that the path plotted was designed to spend as little time in the belts as possible.

       . The phone call was totally feasible although there would have been about a second and a half of delay thanks to the speed of light. The encoding used for both the phone call and television transmission was custom made for the fidelity they'd need at those distances.

       Ah, gotcha.  But in relation to the "theory" presented, if it could be faked for the Moon landings, it would be relatively easy to do the same for Curiosity?  Not taking any side, just trying to understand all of the facts and context of the situation.

       Very interesting.  Again, just because I don't have much expertise in this subject, but that was a color video?  If it was, how come there is only black and white film being used to take pictures while it's on the surface?  Or have I just not seen the color pictures?

       The only fact I made known was the conversation between Nixon and Armstrong.  Other than that, I referred to it as "damning" evidence that is used by theorists.  So not sure where you're coming from, except being a passive-aggressive deterrent from wholesome discourse.

       What you call a superb in depth analysis is a perfect example of why moon deniers (and by extension other conspiracy theorists) are not taken seriously. It is just a couple of assertions, backed up by nothing. I'd like to think that I am pretty well informed about the space program, having read a number of books on the subject including some written by the alleged astronauts. I have also read a lot of conspiracy stuff. I have never seen anything that would legitimately suggest the moon landings were faked. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, just that I haven't seen it. Usually, the conspiracy theorists make some reasonable sounding claims about shadows or something, but then they almost always go on to say something like "there are no stars in the pictures," which demonstrates they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. And, as some other comments in this thread have pointed out, it is almost impossible to believe that some of the stuff could have been faked with 1960s technology, and would be damn difficult to reproduce even with modern computer graphics.

       Starting at about 3:00, you can see a shot of the approach which, if it was a miniature, would have to have been many square miles. Sure, there were good reasons why the government might want to fake a moon landing, but those are the very same reasons why they might want to actually do a landing.

       Edit: Here is another video.

       Look at the dust he kicks up. It is definitely not slow motion, and it is also obvious there is no air. So, please explain to me how that could have been faked.

       these people are hilarious. notice how he's all of a sudden much more informed than you for reading books, assuming that you haven't, while making wide assumptions about what 'moon deniers' (yeah, we deny the fucking moon) believe. he probably won't respond to you because you refuted his points with clear logic and didn't jump to any conclusions, ending on a poignant, legitimate question.
      </p>
      <p>
       also notice how you are downvoted without any response. like i said, these people are hilarious. their responses reek of false superiority and ad hominem attacks on strawman arguments, and anything that conflicts with the hivemind of their subreddit (conspiracies dont exist and everyone who questions the government is a loon) gets downvoted. respond with facts, and don't pay attention to anything else. the one bypassing logic and playing logical fallacies is the one losing.

       After Neil Armstrong's death, on Saturday 8/25/12 the New York Times published
       <a href="http://imgur.com/DXD8h">
        this image
       </a>
       , titled "close up of the lunar module on the moon"  But by the following day, it was gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that someone at the NYT realized that this image of the "lunar module," which looks to be made out of roofing paper and curtain rods, might cause more than a few to wonder how such a rickety contraption could have blasted off from the moon and attained a speed of 4,000 mph to catch up to, and dock with, the command module.
       <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo2.html">
        As Dave McGowan put it
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        While what is depicted in the images may initially appear, to the untrained eye, to be some kind of mock-up that someone cobbled together in their backyard to make fun of NASA, I can assure you that it is actually an extremely high-tech manned spacecraft capable of landing on the surface of the Moon. And incredibly enough, it was also capable of blasting off from the Moon and flying 69 miles back up into lunar orbit! Though not immediately apparent, it is actually a two-stage craft, the lower half (the part that looks like a tubular aluminum framework covered with Mylar and old Christmas wrapping paper) being the descent stage, and the upper half (the part that looks as though it was cobbled together from old air conditioning ductwork and is primarily held together, as can be seen in the close-up, with zippers and gold tape) being the ascent stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The upper half, of course, is the more sophisticated portion, being capable of lifting off and flying with enough power to break free of the Moon’s gravity and reach lunar orbit. It also, of course, possessed sophisticated enough navigational capabilities for it to locate, literally out in the middle of fucking nowhere, the command module that it had to dock with in order to get the astronauts safely back to Earth. It also had to catch that command module, which was orbiting the Moon at a leisurely 4,000 miles per hour.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think we can all agree for now that such a sleek, stylish, well-designed craft would have no problem flying with that kind of power, precision and stability.
       </p>

       That's because you have absolutely no idea about how the lunar module was constructed.

       That's pretty accurate, it could easily be punched through. Weight had to be kept to an absolute minimum to get the whole mission off earth. You don't need an extremely solid build to fly in a vacuum.

       The superstructure (the tubular chassis, etc.) provides structure. The pressure hull (the thin alloy panels holding the air in) just have to hold the air in. 1 ATM of pressure = ~14.69 PSI So, an alloy shell only had to hold withstand a pressure differential less than the that of the average bicycle inner tube. Thinner alloy foils were used in non-pressurized areas.

       Saying it isn't sound because it

       is completely insufficient for your case.

        Legend holds that a dozen astronauts walked upon the surface of the Moon for varying amounts of time. The Apollo 17 astronauts alone were purportedly there for three days. For the duration of their visits, each of the twelve would have been treated to what was by far the most dazzling display of stars ever seen by the human eye. What they would have seen was many times more stars burning many times brighter than can be seen anywhere here on planet Earth.
       </p>

       So, I realize this is an ad hominem attack, but, your authority on the subject lacks basic common sense.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are also going to need to install a top-of-the-line heating and cooling system. Probably several of them, actually. Because the ‘weather’ on the Moon, so to speak, can be a bit unpleasant. According to the experts over at NASA, daytime highs average a balmy +260° F, but it cools off quite a bit at night, dropping to an average of -280° F. If you’re looking for anything between those two extremes, you won’t really find it on the Moon. It’s pretty much one or the other. If you’re in the sun, you’re going to be boiled alive, and if you’re out of the sun, you’re going to be flash frozen.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ok, basic astronomy; a 'day' on the moon lasts about 30 earth days.

       <p>
        Next we have to include everything required to keep ourselves alive and well. We aren’t going to be there very long, of course, and space is obviously limited, but we will still require some basic amenities. We will, after all, have to sleep somewhere in the ship, won’t we? Or will we just unfold cots on the lunar surface? We will also require a sanitation/septic system of some kind. Or did those missions bring about another ‘first’ that NASA has been reluctant to brag about? Was Neil Armstrong, unbeknownst to the American people, the first man to take a dump on lunar soil? Or was it Buzz Aldrin? Which astronaut has the distinction of being the first to soil the lunar landscape?

       Pretty much. They had an evacuation system for urine (it would pump it outside), but it could also be stored in bags as a backup, which is exactly what they did during the Apollo 13 incident.

       The moon contains these nano-particles and scientists have discussed it in depth enough to come to the conclusion that it is in fact artificial.

      <p>
       They talk about how moons enter the gravitational field of a planet without ever crashing into it...as if it just floated there? Chyea right..
      </p>
      <p>
       It's PLACED there. Also, when they bombed the moon in 2009 because India announced it had found traces of water...the moon resonated like a gong.

       NASA has formally ADMITTED to ALTERING the photos of the MOON and the surrounding areas.

       The footage was half fake and the real footage we will never see.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best smoking gun that half the footage is fake is the "Wires Footage" video.

       Can you please find any links to your claims of the moon being an artificial satellite. First time hearing this, usually what I get it the all too famous, greys, lizards, illuminati, inhabiting the Moon's dark-side !!

       Yes, nanoparticles on the sun are no secret amongst the global scientists and people that pay attention.

       Maybe I should rephrase. Not relevant to people's lives. Irrelevant conspiracies aren't worth discussing in my opinion. Its like debating whether or not there's a conspiracy at the local school between the school principle and the cafeteria.

       If you can explain how a fake moon landing in 1969 is in any way more relevant to the everyday person's life than the principle shaving money off the top of lunch orders, I will become fully open to discussing a fake moon landing.

       Here is an interview I did with a US Army Vet who was other than honorably discharged in 1980 for refusing to participate in a program which loaded anti-gravitic craft with freeze dried food, seeds, and other material intended to offer a way of survival to the world elites in an anticipated global catastrophic event in 2012.  These craft, according to this source which is corroborated by others in the black budget military - were supposed to be delivering the goods to the back side of the moon where there are numerous reptilian bases.  This interview was used by Bill Ryan of Project Camelot to formulate what he calls his "Ultimate hypothesis."  He uses other whistleblowers to corroborate what Dutch states in this interview.  That link is at the bottom of this post.
