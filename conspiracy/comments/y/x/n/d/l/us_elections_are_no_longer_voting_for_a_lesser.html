       The amount of 1% money being poured into R- money tells me they want him more. Saying both candidates are the same so don't vote or vote for someone that won't win is another tactic. Conservatives are doing every trick in the book to disallow voting. Don't believe the hype

       The problem with those, especially the rights of the LGBT community, is that they have always HAD those rights.  Now, they are getting distracted about being allowed those rights by a government.  The entire debate is backwards, with no outcome in sight.  Just more bickering and hot words, only when it comes to a boiling point will there be a minor law enacted that doesn't fix the problem at the heart.

       Right, I understand this.  But there is an issue outside of the issue that you are talking about.  The issue that somehow the government has become an agent that distributes "rights" to various groups and sects when the agitation for them reaches a boiling point.  What I'm saying is that the fault lies within the system, that those rights should not have to be mandated at all, they shouldn't even be processed by a governing entity.  That is the problem with these issues that you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       While that overlying problem is ignored, or not given adequate attention by both political parties and the media in all parts, the remaining methods are bickering over the personal opinions held by those in power.  Opinions do not matter in the conversation of rights.  Opinions can be held, but they hold no bearing over the realization that every individual has the same rights granted to everyone else.

       I agree with your first point - if the system changed so that the government wasn't involved in marriage at all, this problem would not exist, of course. However, this isn't the system that exists, and in our lifetimes, we're much more likely to see an amendment to marriage laws allowing gay marriages, than we are to see the government getting out of the marriage business altogether. There's an increasingly successful movement for legal marriage equality; there's no comparable movement to take the government out of marriage. Meanwhile as things like the linked story above continue to happen, principle will always give way to pragmatism.

       No idea why you're getting downvoted, your responses are civil and keeping up honest debate (upvote for you).  However, the issue I see with government solving the problem is that more often than not (when they do finally get around to passing some legislation) they address and try to solve the symptoms rather than the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar to the racial debate and segregation.  Aside from private property rights, the government forced people to allow anyone and everyone into their establishments, attempting to solve the problem of racism and bigotry within certain parts of the country.  However, forcing someone to do that does not change any aspect of racism and can make it worse.  Sure, everyone is now allowed into, say Tom's Grill, but who is to stop Tom from now spitting in the food of those he previously did not allow inside?  The root of the problem is the morality of the issue, and no law or legislative measure can prevent that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope the correlation makes sense, as the issue, I feel, can not truly be solved with government imposed measures, but rather on a more local and moral level.

       The right to abortion and gay marriage are trivial pursuits WHEN shown in comparison in the face of endless war and constant lies / propaganda WHICH affect LGBT / females just as much as other segments of the human population.

       These political candidates are meant to represent the people, not select pockets.

       Do you really saying that people being killed &amp; stopping the imperialism of USA are REALLY less important topics to focus on than gay marriage and abortions?

       So if Romney and Obama are exactly the same in every other way, does it not follow that Romney, who wants to take away (or continue to deny) basic human rights to women and homosexuals -- while Obama pledges to protect these rights -- is slightly more (not "the exact same") evil?

       Of course American imperialism is a big problem. I'm just able to think about more than one problem at a time.

       not really what I'm saying.. I mean that these issues shouldn't be issues. Who cares. You want to get married to some other dude, good for you, have a great life, hope you're happy. Need an abortion? big deal. BUT.. we are* allowing these things that really shouldn't even be issues to distract us from the REAL problems that we're facing as a society.

       They are real problems to the people they directly affect. Denying access to marriage keeps many important legal spousal and family rights/benefits out of people's hands. Even hospital visitation rights:

       whoosh. seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not belittling the issues to those that are affected by it, at all. In fact, I have many friends who are dealing with them on both ends at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i'm trying to say here is that these should not be issues in the first place. But, instead, Americans cannot "see the forest for the trees." That we are even having a discussion about whether or not we're going to allow this person or that person to do whatever the fuck they want in the first place IS the problem, and that is being used to distract the rest of society from the larger issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, seriously. We're being trained to be more worried about what our neighbor's are doing to themselves than we are about what the government and corporations are doing to everyone.

       The option of abortion is a right protected by the US Supreme Court. There is little Romney can do to attack it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama has left DOMA alone. Saying he's in support of legalizing gay marriage is NOT supporting the legalization of gay marriage. The REAL issue here is already above the president. Congress has written laws which provide protection for the states to DENY the RIGHTS of Americans in homosexual relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
       In many cases, State Supreme Courts rule that this legislation is UNCONSTITUTIONAL and the verdict is in favor of the rights of the gay or lesbian couple.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issues you mention are trivial in a presidential election because the Executive Branch is not the branch expected to have the greatest impact on civil rights. DOMA is already law. Obama isn't fighting it. If the law is to be repealed, it will be through the Supreme Court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I believe the BEST way to get better justices into the Supreme Court would be to elect a president with less political pressure from his or her party. That is, Democratic and Republican justice appointees will likely have more bias than their 3rd party counterparts.

       Really wish more people would vote 3rd party. They have this blindness to long-term effects of doing it, and assume since it won't mean someone else will get elected, what's the point.

       Do you think the voting system is accountable? Do you feel that there is no way they can steal, fraud, or snub this election to go their way? Do you think their could be an incident that would cause the elections to be suspended? I think we are going to see some serious shit come november.

       It doesn't matter at the this point because both candidates have been picked for their loyalties towards certain people and agendas. If a genuine third party had a real shot they would rig votes of just shoot them in the head. Bush rigged Florida so I think it's entirely possible with the electronic machines to have them rigged to put out certain numbers. Basically, I can't see a way to get someone legitimate in office at this moment in time.

       Exactlty. We have no accountability, and the system is out of control. All the checks and ballances are gone.

       whoosh. seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not belittling the issues to those that are affected by it, at all. In fact, I have many friends who are dealing with them on both ends at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       What i'm trying to say here is that these should not be issues in the first place. But, instead, Americans cannot "see the forest for the trees." That we are even having a discussion about whether or not we're going to allow this person or that person to do whatever the fuck they want in the first place IS the problem, and that is being used to distract the rest of society from the larger issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, seriously. We're being trained to be more worried about what our neighbor's are doing to themselves than we are about what the government and corporations are doing to everyone.
