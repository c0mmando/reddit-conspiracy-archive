    <div class="md"><p>Right, I understand this.  But there is an issue outside of the issue that you are talking about.  The issue that somehow the government has become an agent that distributes &quot;rights&quot; to various groups and sects when the agitation for them reaches a boiling point.  What I&#39;m saying is that the fault lies within the system, that those rights should not have to be mandated at all, they shouldn&#39;t even be processed by a governing entity.  That is the problem with these issues that you are talking about.</p>

<p>While that overlying problem is ignored, or not given adequate attention by both political parties and the media in all parts, the remaining methods are bickering over the personal opinions held by those in power.  Opinions do not matter in the conversation of rights.  Opinions can be held, but they hold no bearing over the realization that every individual has the same rights granted to everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first point - if the system changed so that the government wasn&#39;t involved in marriage at all, this problem would not exist, of course. However, this isn&#39;t the system that exists, and in our lifetimes, we&#39;re much more likely to see an amendment to marriage laws allowing gay marriages, than we are to see the government getting out of the marriage business altogether. There&#39;s an increasingly successful movement for legal marriage equality; there&#39;s no comparable movement to take the government out of marriage. Meanwhile as things like the linked story above continue to happen, principle will always give way to pragmatism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea why you&#39;re getting downvoted, your responses are civil and keeping up honest debate (upvote for you).  However, the issue I see with government solving the problem is that more often than not (when they do finally get around to passing some legislation) they address and try to solve the symptoms rather than the problem.  </p>

<p>Similar to the racial debate and segregation.  Aside from private property rights, the government forced people to allow anyone and everyone into their establishments, attempting to solve the problem of racism and bigotry within certain parts of the country.  However, forcing someone to do that does not change any aspect of racism and can make it worse.  Sure, everyone is now allowed into, say Tom&#39;s Grill, but who is to stop Tom from now spitting in the food of those he previously did not allow inside?  The root of the problem is the morality of the issue, and no law or legislative measure can prevent that.</p>

<p>Hope the correlation makes sense, as the issue, I feel, can not truly be solved with government imposed measures, but rather on a more local and moral level.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not belittling the issues to those that are affected by it, at all. In fact, I have many friends who are dealing with them on both ends at the moment.</p>

<p>What i&#39;m trying to say here is that these should not be issues in the first place. But, instead, Americans cannot &quot;see the forest for the trees.&quot; That we are even having a discussion about whether or not we&#39;re going to allow this person or that person to do whatever the fuck they want in the first place IS the problem, and that is being used to distract the rest of society from the larger issues. </p>

<p>I mean, seriously. We&#39;re being trained to be more worried about what our neighbor&#39;s are doing to themselves than we are about what the government and corporations are doing to everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The republicans cynically dangle this issue in front of their base for free votes.  They cant actually pass something that bans abortion across the nation because thats half the reason half their base turns out to vote at all. Which i assume you know so this isnt a counter point.  The over seas ban was just throwing a bone</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The option of abortion is a right protected by the US Supreme Court. There is little Romney can do to attack it.</p>

<p>Obama has left DOMA alone. Saying he&#39;s in support of legalizing gay marriage is NOT supporting the legalization of gay marriage. The REAL issue here is already above the president. Congress has written laws which provide protection for the states to DENY the RIGHTS of Americans in homosexual relationships.</p>

<p>In many cases, State Supreme Courts rule that this legislation is UNCONSTITUTIONAL and the verdict is in favor of the rights of the gay or lesbian couple.</p>

<p>The issues you mention are trivial in a presidential election because the Executive Branch is not the branch expected to have the greatest impact on civil rights. DOMA is already law. Obama isn&#39;t fighting it. If the law is to be repealed, it will be through the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I believe the BEST way to get better justices into the Supreme Court would be to elect a president with less political pressure from his or her party. That is, Democratic and Republican justice appointees will likely have more bias than their 3rd party counterparts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding DOMA, </p>

<p>The Obama administration announced last year that it would no longer defend DOMA in court. More recently, Obama announced his support for Dianne Feinstein&#39;s bill that would repeal DOMA in its entirety. This is all public information. Here: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what, exactly, has he <strong>done</strong>?</p>

<p>He <strong>said</strong> he&#39;s not going to defend DOMA. Like he <strong>said</strong> he&#39;s not going to use executive resources to enforce federal drug regulations regarding medical marijuana states?</p>

<p>He <strong>announced</strong> support for a bill? Am I supposed to vote for him based on his inaction? He said he won&#39;t veto it, so Obama&#39;s my guy?</p>

<p>What has he done besides talk?</p>

<p>Should we not be more worried about the HoR and Senate when we&#39;re considering issues of this nature? Should we not be more worried about military affairs, foreign relations and economic strategy when voting for president?</p>

<p>Not to mention, most third party candidates agree with Obama on these trifling issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter at the this point because both candidates have been picked for their loyalties towards certain people and agendas. If a genuine third party had a real shot they would rig votes of just shoot them in the head. Bush rigged Florida so I think it&#39;s entirely possible with the electronic machines to have them rigged to put out certain numbers. Basically, I can&#39;t see a way to get someone legitimate in office at this moment in time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>whoosh. seriously.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not belittling the issues to those that are affected by it, at all. In fact, I have many friends who are dealing with them on both ends at the moment.</p>

<p>What i&#39;m trying to say here is that these should not be issues in the first place. But, instead, Americans cannot &quot;see the forest for the trees.&quot; That we are even having a discussion about whether or not we&#39;re going to allow this person or that person to do whatever the fuck they want in the first place IS the problem, and that is being used to distract the rest of society from the larger issues. </p>

<p>I mean, seriously. We&#39;re being trained to be more worried about what our neighbor&#39;s are doing to themselves than we are about what the government and corporations are doing to everyone.</p>
