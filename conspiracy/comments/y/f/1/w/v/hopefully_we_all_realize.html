       that the easiest (and safest) way to combat the new world order and it's constituents is a personal boycott of corporate chain stores wherever possible.  First off, I understand use of the term "corporate chain stores" is not fully adequate and I also realize that for a great many of you I am 'preaching to the choir'.  Please bear with me, this is an important connection that not everyone makes.  A very significant amount of the money spent at these institutions funnels right up to the top of the pyramid.  This reality (by proxy of our choice of expenditure) transforms our hours of labor (spent earning said money), into munitions for the surreptitious assault on our free existence.   Consider each dollar a vote; personally I won't be voting for Obama or Romney come November, however if I am habitually spending money at institutions that contribute money to their campaigns or support them in other ways, may I not as well be?  If anyone knows of any businesses that might be included under this umbrella which are not in cahoots with, or that stand against the NWO and impending one world government feel free to let us know (please provide some form of verification).

       This is the problem with a modern revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past people revolted,got rid of their leaders and went back to their lives until everything settled down.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were not dependant on the system they destroyed,they grew their own food,collected their own fuel etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are hopelessly dependant on the system we wish to see gone.
We live in a technological bubble maintained by the people we want to get rid of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easy way is boycotting as you suggest and spreading information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way is too slow because people want to keep the status quo,better to have a master that beats and feeds you than one that just beats.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could be more optimistic but its impossible when confronted with reality.

       Isn't the problem with all these magical free energy engines that they run fine until you try to put any load on them and then suddenly they dont run so well anymore?

       The problem with all these engines are that they have not been able to demonstrate a repeatable way of extracting energy from them. There are thousands of "free energy engines" videos on youtube and they range from being complete scams/trolls to novelty inventions that can only spin a rotor without any load put on it. Until someone creates a prototype that can actually power something meaningful and this result can be reproduced/manufactured reliably I will remain in the skeptics camp on this one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that I didn't comment on solar power because that's a known free source of energy. I only take issue with these DIY engines built by people who make wild claims and drown their viewers in technical jargon that only serve to drown out any meaningful discussion/questions.

       Idk about the processor, I'm no techie.  I bought the computer used from a friend of my stepdad.   It seems my point has become somehow obscured..  I'm not claiming complete independence from 'the system' or anything close to it, if that was the impression you got perhaps I poorly conveyed my intent..  My sole aim is at raising awareness.  If you can pull it off then more power to you, but in my opinion an absolute, all or nothing stance on this matter is far too idealistic to be realistically obtainable in the lives of the vast majority of people.  However, that's not to say a conscious effort isn't worth being made..   Just some fish food for your brain thoughts :P

       Unfortunately there is no possible way you could get enough people to boycott these chains to make any sort of an impact. I agree with you on principle though.

       not that i disagree but just to play devils advocate.. if we all stop shopping at national chains and everyone starts buying locally..then those local businesses will get a huge boost in revenue, right? with the huge boost in revenue they are surely to expand their operation and branch out because after all, everyone is in business to make money, right? so at what point do you then cut off that formerly local business that expanded due to your patronage? this is a pure guess but i would assume most businesses have started locally or at least somewhat locally and have grown due to good business practice. im not saying you are wrong but at what point do you draw the line?

       That would be subjective I suppose.  For me personally, that line would begin to become evident as the number of locations starts to range the in scores, or hundreds.

       i think it should be more about supporting businesses that have good business practices. if a national chain takes care of its workers, doesnt outsource if not necessary and can provide a good product at a good price, they should be supported and rewarded for being a good business. whereas, if there is a local store that doesnt treat its workers well and doesnt provide good products and competitive prices, i dont feel they should be given any special consideration just because they are local...

       Good point.  It's just that above board national chains seem to be an increasingly rare breed these days.  As someone who strives to be a conscientious consumer, I feel it's much more important to be concerned with good business practices rather than competitive prices (as long as one has the means).

       Not sure if what you say is true in the sense that a boycott of corporate chain stores is realistic.  Presumably monied class have an ownership stranglehold on a great deal of the means of production,distribution of goods and services as well as money itself.

       I realise this sentiment is pretty pessimistic.  I think there is something to be said though for being frugal, making wise choices with what resources you have, not buying into advertising propoganda or buying their media and sports entertainment.
