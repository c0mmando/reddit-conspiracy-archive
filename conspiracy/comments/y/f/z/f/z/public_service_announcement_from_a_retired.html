<p>Since I am one of those <em>bullies</em>, I like to make my case. What HomegrownTerran describes as disinfo, is the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v0d15">attempt</a> to deconstruct disinformation. Disinformation which has been disseminated by Sorcha Faal and spreaded by lots of useful idiots. Not a single credible source has been presented which links the LIBOR scandal to Robert Holmes. Sorcha Faal made an initial claim which has been repeated again and again, but repetition of garbage is no verification that:</p>

<p>Robert Holmes planned to become a whistleblower.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes is scheduled to testify before an authorative body.</p>

<p>Robert Holmes was involved in Libor supervision, exposure or manipulation.</p>

<p>FICO, the company Robert Holmes works for had anything to do with either the obfuscation or the exposure of the LIBOR manipulation.</p>

<p>For stating these things and adding some further information HomegrownTerran attacked me on a personal  level. He accused me of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v0hju">I spotted you a few days ago, /u/drunkenshrew. Spewing disinfo.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v12dw">Meanwhile, you&#39;re one of the ones out here trying to cover up bank fraud.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v6qyk">/u/drunkenshrew and the 8 or 10 others actively burying this topic will eventually leave, and we&#39;ll be allowed to explore this ... unless the same people keep rearing their ugly faces every time the topic emerges, in which case we should have a good case to argue with the admins about gaming reddit. Meanwhile, I fight this futile battle against these <strong>cum garglers</strong>.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were just some of the attacks which were directly aimed at me. But HGT has attacked other posters who disagree with him with smears like <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v64k8">fuckers</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v9iey">vermin</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v9lf1">“you have bought your account”</a></p>

<p>Apart from his offensive style, HGT fails miserably at some basic approaches which people who look into conspiracies and subversive information generally use. He does not go to the primary source and he <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v6j01">fails</a> to provide a motive and has no answer to the simple question “Qui bono?”.</p>

<p>Hearsay doesn&#39;t kick it for me. It seems to be enough for some subsribers of this subreddit, but HGT takes the level flimsy hearsay to a whole new level. He came up with this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yfvde/part_44_of_the_james_holmes_conspiracy/">video</a> to make his case that there is independent verification that LIBOR and Robert Holmes are somehow linked. </p>

<p>Watch this documentary and than look how the The Libor/Holmes connection is sourced [starts at 10:40 and goes to 12:40]. Not a single person, institution or other verifiable source is used. We hear only <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LordDefiler">Mark Howitt aka LordDefiler</a>, the maker of the video. He repeats claims he has read elsewhere on the internet. He uses a more or less blurry facebook screenshot [at 10:41] and then narrates - &quot;this report says&quot;. This is were his info comes from.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1600.htm">But now the kicker. The narrator repeats the initial Sorcha Faal garbage verbatim.</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>You, and the other trolls and shills just like you, determined to bury this at any cost... you&#39;re demanding that we prove Sorcha Faal&#39;s claim (even though you don&#39;t necessarily phrase it in those exact words, you keep beating that dead horse).</p>

<p>The only thing that has to be demonstrated is the likelihood of him being a witness at LIBOR hearings.</p>

<p>If I mention that he worked at FICO, your shillery response is: &quot;thousands of people worked for FICO. what about all them?&quot;</p>

<p>If I mention that he&#39;s a programmer/software engineer, again: There are millions of those. what about them?</p>

<p>If I mention he&#39;s an expert in financial fraud, the list gets smaller, but: There are thousands of those. What about them?</p>

<p>If I mention that he&#39;s the author of a software which does financial predictive modeling, the list suddenly shrinks to a few dozen or less.</p>

<p>If I mention that he&#39;s also the author of software which detects financial fraud, the desperation sets in: But that&#39;s for credit cards, not for interest rate manipulation!</p>

<p>If I combine this all into one package and say he&#39;s all of those things... he suddenly becomes one of a tiny handful of people who could be considered an expert for the LIBOR case.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to connect Holmes or FICO to LIBOR - that would make him a suspect, not an expert witness in the area of tracking financial fraud.</p>

<p>Now get the fuck off my interent. </p>

<p>We are basically Voltarian thinkers in this thread from what I can tell.  This is a school of thought that everyone secretly likes and publicly groupthinks rationalizations to conform to social norms that actually do not exist.  </p>

<p>Throw in a few paid schills to lead some ignorant people who have spent zero time researching and you have what we see today.  </p>

<p>Frankly, answering schills with Voltaire quotes and answering ignorance with facts and access to new thoughts, with permission to go there is going to lead people to the truth.  </p>

<p>There is probably something in the Art of War about not sending a volunteer army to fight a paid army that has more intelligence about the actual truth while the volunteers are still gathering data and determining the actual truth.  </p>

<p>While the volunteers may be better intentioned and can see the insane reality ahead, to fight at this point is bad for the volunteers.  </p>

<p>When you have a solid set of facts, bring it to an occupy wall street or a tea party rally and share your documents with people.  Infiltrate the news by standing in the background and photobombing your info. (Obviously the anti-shill tactics.) </p>

<p>I have no idea what is true these days, that is why r/conspiracy is so awesomely fascinating.  Including the memes and including the shills and whoever else wanders in and says whatever.   After watching online poker scandals break over the years, those innocuous comments from schills, trolls, memes, and even guilty parties are the evidence that builds.   If their are paid shills they are self defeating because they do not understand the internet.  Their comments WILL be used against them in a court of law once the data aggregates to that point. </p>

<p>Sorry, that is quite a rant.  I approve my own good advice. </p>

<p>The idea is that people will pay attention if and only if it&#39;s worth the effort.</p>

<p>&quot;There is no bad publicity.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For personal reasons I wouldn&#39;t call it a &#39;truth.&#39; </p>

<p>I would call it an interpretation - one that seems reasonable.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also say, it&#39;s an invasion of an internet forum. I speak for myself when I say: &quot;I can spot bullshit a mile away and am not phased by it.&quot; I would encourage you to remind yourself that even if I was easily duped by spam it is <em>my responsibility</em> to think for <em>myself</em>. If the moderators of this sub have to tell the subscribers what to read - or what to think about what they read - then this sub is no better than r/politics.</p>

<p>Take heart. There are minds all up in this bitch. We may not be vocal, but we exist.</p>
