       9000sins, I posted this in the other thread but I wanna copy/paste it so I can maybe get some input from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't get why people argue so zealously about this subject. If we see any sort of information about the holocaust, it means -someone- is making money off of it. It seems completely possible to me that the numbers would very easily get skewed, simply because it was the goddamn 1940s and people are able to draw connecting lines very easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you guys are arguing about how many people got unjustly executed. It doesn't matter if it was 10 jews or 10 billion jews. They were still killed just because they were jews; The holocaust -happened- and it was -really fucking lame-.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, why do you think people care so much about the numbers and not just the actual event? It very obviously happened, and you are very obviously -not- saying it didn't happen.

       I also believe some of the history has been skewed. It is written by the winners, but in the end it just makes me wonder how genocide gets rolling in the first place. Pinning crimes or behavior on a group of people just for their heritage is mind bogglingly wrong and disgustingly manipulative. Without fail though, it manages to happen.

       Actually, Nazi Germany is one of the only states to ever leave its nearly-complete archives behind. Its history has been written by researchers and journalists who were otherwise not part of the Allied war effort (aside from being citizens of those countries). Their reporting can easily be verified against the Nazis' own records, which were used as source material in the first place. Check out William L. Shirer's "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" for example - it's written almost completely from primary sources. And hilariously uses the phrase "homosexual pervert" a few times.

       That's actually interesting, I can see in the confusion they would've just high-tailed away, probably realizing their crimes were too big to even try to hide. I also stand by the idea that most of modern history as it's written down is actually true, especially since most people who are able to get "history" published were probably not directly involved in the case and have nothing to gain or lose by fibbing with it. But even when facts are prevalent, things can get twisted very easily, from presentation to lack of memory to maliciousness. It's bound to happen when you get enough people involved, yah know?

       Scary thing, information...
      </p>

       Also, if you care to expand on the "homosexual pervert" thing, I'd love to hear more about it. I'm sure it's worth a chuckle or two  XD

       It's because the German archives were captured by the Allies before the Germans could destroy or try to hide them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a real gift to historians, as Nazi Germany is something people are likely to want to study for the rest of time.

       The Guard were usually SS and therefore would have faced severe retribution from the Allies. In most cases they didn't just run off but where replaced by auxiliaries and reserve troops from the Local Area, there usually was asome sort of guard at the liberated camps but they usually didn't fight.

       Yeah, I remember hearing that fact as well, that the guards had jumped ship early in many cases. I would have, too.
Also that's a good perspective to present; war causes mass shortages, and you're not going to be allocating food to prisoners.

       The dresden massacre happened too, my family members were imprisoned  for being of Japanese ancestry,  war is nothing more than a series of  atrocities for profit. The jews are the only ones that use WWII to keep the entire fucking world in a perpetual state of guilt so they can justify their own Nazi tactics and genocide in the middle east. Most of them are not the ethnic jews of the bible

       Hence my comment about "making money off of it," it'd just likely be wise to think that a percentage of the people making money off of the holocaust are might not be jewish in any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very hard to blame a group of people for money problems. You can still do it, but it'd take a lot of evidence. Or misguided people who believe you. Shoot, Hitler did it.

       Also, making money off of it is not in the tourism sense, though that's part of it, it's things the "aid" the US gives an extremely rich, developed country and the reparations Germany is forced to make to this very day. Fact, Germany supplies them submarines capable of launching the nukes they own, despite the guise of nuclear ambiguity policy here in the US. This is disturbing, given the "Samson" Option", worth a search as well.

       I don't think that questioners are arguing about numbers, that's a false paradigm. From what I see, it's more about questioning whether there was a Final Solution or master plan to carry out genocide on the Jews, rather than mistreatment by lower ranks, death by disease and starvation as these thing are very common in war. I've seen pics of the US Civil War camps that would fit right in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auchwitz is the most well know camp, to my knowledge, yet the "gas chambers" were constructed after the war! The plaques have been change from four million killed there to one and a half, yet the six million figure never changed. You say numbers aren't important and, while I realize your meaning, they actually are in the context of this guilt that enabled Israel to be conceived against international law and in justifying it's actions since. "Never again".
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger I imagined hate-speech as hateful neo-nazi types making death threats or something, when in reality it is respectable people, scholars and professors of academia being imprisoned over coming to different conclusions in their research. Fantastical claims require fantastic evidence and we have virtually none that this was a systemic operation. Quite to the contrary it seems great precautions were taken in fighting disease through delousing clothes with gas and the cutting of hair. The testing of the walls confirms this as the smaller personal articles chamber tested heavy for zyclon-b, the larger "death chamber" negative- this is not shocking as they were built after the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       What proof do we really have? No documents. The logistics of the gas supplied, the numbers involved needing to be cremated and the required fuel to do this were grossly short. Declassified Russian spyplane pics taken daily over the camp show nothing of the alleged activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do have is the Nuremberg trial where one Jew-one!- testified, along with the confessions of I believe sixty German soldiers. I think it's relevant that 59 of these soldiers had their testicles kicked in beyond repair prior to this monkey trial. We do have witness accounts and experiences but a shocking amount are outright fabrications and provably so, not just the completely absurd ones of skin used for lampshades, cutting their hair off to fill mattresses, the showerheads (the gas would not have poured out showerheads, no propellant).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect you to take my word for any of this but I would check out the following: a doc called Dr. Death, about American Fred Leuchter being recruited blindly into this very subject as part of the defense team for Ernst Zundel and his empirical research at the camp. The Last Days of the Big Lie.
       <em>
        Anything
       </em>
       by David Irving, a British historian who has really challenged my world view on this. Also, ask yourself why it's so taboo to question the authenticity of it, why people are imprisoned for doing as much, and why SO much attention is devoted to a possible three and a half million people of one faith (not race) being killed over tens of millions of others in the same time period. Then think about the big picture and, like my tag says, cui bono?

       It is remarkably strange that, with such a low jewish population, the holocaust is considered such a part of american history. All accounts strike me as odd, really. The whole thing is a mess and people claim to have evidence for both fights, but there are kernels of truth in every story, no matter how far fetched it sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you're mention of israel's conception is a very nice point. From the beginning, I have been saying, to some effect, that there are very very very greedy people out there, people who will do anything to get what the want, and -can- do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, how do we fix it?

       Knowledge is power. Educate yourself on the topic at hand, then speak out, loud and often. Realize that being an "expert" does not give you a monopoly on truth or make you any smarter than the average bear, ideally just more informed. If you want serious research on this I would check out David Irving. For more of the big picture on the 20th century, listen to Benjamin Friedman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former post of mine: Benjamin Freedman, formerly Benjamin Friedman, a Zionist defector who changed his name after converting to Catholicism. He was a millionaire who ultimately spent a good part of his wealth on newspaper space, etc. trying to warn the American people of Zionism well into his old age. I don't remember which speech, maybe the 1961 Willard Hotel, where he does indeed cover how the US was manipulated into WWI but also the blackmailing of Wilson and the resulting appointment of the first Jewish Supreme Court appointment.

       I can only reply for myself. But it's important, because it shows the critical weakness of the entire Holocaust story - the lack of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, Jews were isolated in Ghettos and then forcibly removed and deported to concentration camps. Yes, brutal experiments were performed on them in the name of science. Yes, their possessions and property were seized against their will. And they died of malnutrion, of disease and of overwork and in brutal and inhuman conditions that are crimes against humanity as we now understand it. For all of this there is ample record.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as for the turning of skins into lampshades and bodies into soap, the critics were proved correct and it is now conceded that this never took place. Similarly fabricated photos of smoke from smokestacks in fact exist. And there were cremetoria that were built after the war by the russians, and subsequently presented as authentic. And official numbers at one camp were reduced from 4million to slightly over 1 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most crucially, for the issue of gas chambers there is very scant evidence. There are no documents that give any indication or discuss the systemic genocide using this method. HCN/Prussian blue was in fact widely used for delousing of clothing, and records from the time on quantities correspond with this use. And the known cremetoria are clearly too small for the scale of the crime propsed. The only thing existing in favour of gassings is secondhand/ hearsay evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this doesn't mean that mass gassings never took place, but it's a valid question that deserves attention, not just a fact that should be assumed. And as for why it matters, it matters because if it turns out to be false, then it's a sham and a con.

       You are welcome to question it, but if you expect anyone to believe your claims about it you sure as hell better have some good evidence that both supports you and explains the boatloads of evidence, documents, photos, and eyewitnesses who say that it did happen.  Until you get that, STFU.

       The only boatloads of evidence are boatloads of propaganda provided by a Jewish owned and dominated media.

       I was repeatedly told growing up that the Nazis exterminated six million Jews living in Europe by gassing and burnt up the bodies.

       That is exactly the POINT. The Holocaust has become a state sponsored religion that NO ONE can question in a public forum without heavy handed repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has certain religious tenents that cannot be questioned in public forums or in the controlled mass media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a legend. It has the quality of a religion. Most people can actually recite the Holocaust tenets.

       So I don't worry about repercussions as much. It is that whole Freedom of Speech thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main purpose of keeping alive the Holocaust is to protect Jewish banking practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we should understand the real purpose of Holocaust indoctrination, which I now believe is this: our money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our money is our lifeblood. Without money, of course, we die as individuals. Without a proper money system, society dies, which is pretty much what is happening to our society now. This is due to the Jewish money system imposed on us by the aliens who own the private money-making company they call the Federal Reserve System.

       I'm not sure what actions we're taking, other than raising public awareness. I have no idea what sins has done. He may have banned the entire lot, for all I know (as much as I'd be against it, he did propose it in an earlier discussion).
      </p>
      <p>
       Raising public awareness is the most important thing we can do to begin with. Because, as I'm sure you'll agree, banning accounts just ends up with more accounts created to continue the dirty work.
      </p>
      <p>
       With one troll, banning 5-10 accounts over the course of a couple months is kind of a pain in the ass. Think what it'll be like if he bans 50 trolls all at once. &lt;-- this is why I oppose that idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Raising the awareness of our community about who they are and what they're doing so that they have less success in their invasions of our subreddit &lt;-- that's the answer. (In my opinion.)

       I've been visiting that sub for a while and have noticed their influence and mentioned it here before.  It's a difficult situation because to an extent people get excited and carried away , and bringing attention to all this is advertisment for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I'd suggest is that we should try to take people as we find them , lets not become partisan or implement any silliness such as banning people who comment in conspiratard.  Linking to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a different story as it could be seen as inciting drama and attention, although it could be argued that if someone finds something posted here ridiculous and or funny etc then they should have some freedom to post over there.

       that's partially the problem, they find something funny here, create a fake account to post more on to the stupid alien illuminati theory, and end up engaging that stupid post as proof that we are all lunatics.

       There is some truth to this but eventually they do get tired of making new accounts. Since they're only human. ;)

       I don't get why there is even a discussion about banning. A common topic here is censorship. And even if it pisses us off how can we justify censoring anyone? True knowledge comes from defending your beliefs and investigating otherss. The second we start locking this sub down, it turns into a circlejerk and the spirit of it dies.

       As for the holocaust, I probably vehemently disagree with the majority of this sub. Apparently I do at least. However, does that mean I have nothing to contribute to this sub, ever?

       I meant "they" as in the infiltration in general, added on top of the ongoing motive of the tards. The tards will have no problem burying anything they want to here now, because there are hundreds/thousands of new accounts doing the exact same shit. The momentum is not in our favor anymore.

       I can only reply for myself. But it's important, because it shows the critical weakness of the entire Holocaust story - the lack of evidence.
      </p>

       Yes, Jews were isolated in Ghettos and then forcibly removed and deported to concentration camps. Yes, brutal experiments were performed on them in the name of science. Yes, their possessions and property were seized against their will. And they died of malnutrion, of disease and of overwork and in brutal and inhuman conditions that are crimes against humanity as we now understand it. For all of this there is ample record.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as for the turning of skins into lampshades and bodies into soap, the critics were proved correct and it is now conceded that this never took place. Similarly fabricated photos of smoke from smokestacks in fact exist. And there were cremetoria that were built after the war by the russians, and subsequently presented as authentic. And official numbers at one camp were reduced from 4million to slightly over 1 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most crucially, for the issue of gas chambers there is very scant evidence. There are no documents that give any indication or discuss the systemic genocide using this method. HCN/Prussian blue was in fact widely used for delousing of clothing, and records from the time on quantities correspond with this use. And the known cremetoria are clearly too small for the scale of the crime propsed. The only thing existing in favour of gassings is secondhand/ hearsay evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this doesn't mean that mass gassings never took place, but it's a valid question that deserves attention, not just a fact that should be assumed. And as for why it matters, it matters because if it turns out to be false, then it's a sham and a con.

       The dresden massacre happened too, my family members were imprisoned  for being of Japanese ancestry,  war is nothing more than a series of  atrocities for profit. The jews are the only ones that use WWII to keep the entire fucking world in a perpetual state of guilt so they can justify their own Nazi tactics and genocide in the middle east. Most of them are not the ethnic jews of the bible

       I don't think that questioners are arguing about numbers, that's a false paradigm. From what I see, it's more about questioning whether there was a Final Solution or master plan to carry out genocide on the Jews, rather than mistreatment by lower ranks, death by disease and starvation as these thing are very common in war. I've seen pics of the US Civil War camps that would fit right in.
      </p>

       Auchwitz is the most well know camp, to my knowledge, yet the "gas chambers" were constructed after the war! The plaques have been change from four million killed there to one and a half, yet the six million figure never changed. You say numbers aren't important and, while I realize your meaning, they actually are in the context of this guilt that enabled Israel to be conceived against international law and in justifying it's actions since. "Never again".
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was younger I imagined hate-speech as hateful neo-nazi types making death threats or something, when in reality it is respectable people, scholars and professors of academia being imprisoned over coming to different conclusions in their research. Fantastical claims require fantastic evidence and we have virtually none that this was a systemic operation. Quite to the contrary it seems great precautions were taken in fighting disease through delousing clothes with gas and the cutting of hair. The testing of the walls confirms this as the smaller personal articles chamber tested heavy for zyclon-b, the larger "death chamber" negative- this is not shocking as they were built after the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       What proof do we really have? No documents. The logistics of the gas supplied, the numbers involved needing to be cremated and the required fuel to do this were grossly short. Declassified Russian spyplane pics taken daily over the camp show nothing of the alleged activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do have is the Nuremberg trial where one Jew-one!- testified, along with the confessions of I believe sixty German soldiers. I think it's relevant that 59 of these soldiers had their testicles kicked in beyond repair prior to this monkey trial. We do have witness accounts and experiences but a shocking amount are outright fabrications and provably so, not just the completely absurd ones of skin used for lampshades, cutting their hair off to fill mattresses, the showerheads (the gas would not have poured out showerheads, no propellant).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect you to take my word for any of this but I would check out the following: a doc called Dr. Death, about American Fred Leuchter being recruited blindly into this very subject as part of the defense team for Ernst Zundel and his empirical research at the camp. The Last Days of the Big Lie.
       <em>
        Anything
       </em>
       by David Irving, a British historian who has really challenged my world view on this. Also, ask yourself why it's so taboo to question the authenticity of it, why people are imprisoned for doing as much, and why SO much attention is devoted to a possible three and a half million people of one faith (not race) being killed over tens of millions of others in the same time period. Then think about the big picture and, like my tag says, cui bono?

       That is exactly the POINT. The Holocaust has become a state sponsored religion that NO ONE can question in a public forum without heavy handed repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has certain religious tenents that cannot be questioned in public forums or in the controlled mass media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a legend. It has the quality of a religion. Most people can actually recite the Holocaust tenets.
