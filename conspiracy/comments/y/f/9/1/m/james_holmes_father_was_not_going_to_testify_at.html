       Yes let's put this ridiculous crap to rest. The first and oldest source (25th of July) for the Holmes - Libor connection was Sorcha Faal in the article
       <a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1600.htm">
        Colorado Massacre Linked To Historic Bank Fraud
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's ignore that Faal is a notorious hoaxster who puts out one fraudulent story after the other and let's go to the meat. The claim is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Most important to note about James Holmes, however, this report says, is that his father, Robert Holmes, was said to have been scheduled to testify within the next few weeks before a US Senate panel on the largest bank fraud scandal in world history that is currently unfolding and threatens to destabilize and destroy the Western banking system.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There is
       <strong>
        no planned US Senate panel
       </strong>
       . No witnesses are ordered to testify. The closest are some questions asked by senators and calls for an investigation.

       Better read this report than Sorcha Faal crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Already on July the 20th it was known, that Robert Holmes works for FICO.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Both his mother and father have excelled in the sciences. Arlene Rosemary Holmes is a registered nurse; Robert M. Holmes Sr. is a senior scientist in the San Diego office of FICO. (Among other things, this multinational analytics firms provides credit scores.) Robert had a glittering academic career — degrees from Stanford, UCLA and Berkeley — and his son showed signs of following in those overachieving footsteps.

      <p>
       That is exactly how Sorcha Faal normally operates. He picks up some genuine information and mixes it with lots of bullshit.

       Yes. Because Sorcha Faal said it, we must dismiss it without assessing its likelihood.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spotted you a few days ago,
       <a href="/u/drunkenshrew">
        /u/drunkenshrew
       </a>
       . Spewing disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not Sorcha Faal says something has no bearing on the relevance or truth value of the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Holmes is the author of the most sophisticated financial tracking software in the world, used by FICO. The likelihood of him being a witness in the LIBOR case is PHENOMENAL.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, dismiss it because Sorcha Faal said it. Don't ever look at it again. &lt;-- that is not logic. That is burial of information.

       and made the argument that Kennedy spoke of covet means to highlight the greed of a secret banker cabal. After my first post he posted a link to the Wikipedia article about Executive Order 111110 and tried to used it as ultimative evidence for the secret banking cabal.

       Your comment, above, about Sorcha Faal, and your comments in my now deleted Kennedy thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes. I fully admit that I deleted comments and submissions. Here's why. When I commented on the burial of the hot-off-the-presses James Holmes Conspiracy documentary, I came under attack by a brigade of burial stormtroopers. I began getting mass downvotes to all of my comments on old unrelated threads. I was lucky that I discovered it happening in real time. I reported it to the mods. Then, I noticed every new comment I made in every new thread, regardless of subject was getting a downvote within minutes, and was being maintained at 0 or -1. I asked the mods to escalate it to the attention of the admins. After I had lost about 250 comment karma (from my entire comment history in the last 3 or 4 days), I began deleting comments. I had to delete five days worth of comments to stop the attack. I'm kind of hoping it'll trigger a flag for the admins to investigate. [EDIT: For clarification. I noticed all of this happening realtime over the course of about 30-45 min. Specifically, I noticed the first few pages of my comment history (going back about 3 or 4 days). The attack was on every comment I'd made, progressively going through the new queue, not through my comment history, which would be detected. I did the deletions from my comment history page in sequence until I got ahead of the attack - at about 5 days ago. Then, it finally stopped.]

       I cover up bank fraud? How so? I never donwplayed the importance of the Libor scandal. In fact, I even added a link to the report of the Treasury Select Committee.

      <p>
       I don't think lumping together Libor and James Eagan Holmes helps to  expose this organized banking fraud.

       If you are unable to point to fraudulent information and only disagree with the interpretation, you should make an argument to bring your point across. You can also simply downvote or ignore the comment.

       Disinfo means to purposeful spread information which isn't true.

       As for downvoting. I don't go on downvote-sprees to punish posters. I also haven't downvoted you in the Kennedy-thread. But I downvote ridiculous photo comparisons and posts with content that originated from Sorcha Faal's website.

       You are asserting that we should dismiss the investigation of a connection between Robert Holmes (the author of the most sophisticated financial tracking software in the world and who works for FICO) and the LIBOR investigation, simply because Sorcha Faal made an unprovable claim about it. You are an obfuscator, specifically. You are using information to distract, not to inform. To prevent inquiry, not to encourage it.

       Um. That was the summary statement of what I had just said. WTF is wrong with you? Do you have some kind of learning disability? Your canned responses to these topics followed by your "prove it, nanny nanny boo boo" bullshit makes it sound like you're a fourteen year old copy/pasting shit from GLP.

       Lots of ad hominem in your post, but no evidence/source showing that he was going to testify in the LIBOR scandal. Are you just butthurt that you believed it without evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just accept it: Someone made up something connecting LIBOR to the Aurora shooting, provided no evidence whatsoever, and you believed it because it follows your ridiculous narrative. You believed something without evidence, and now you feel stupid so you attack drunkenshrew's credibility in order to boost up your own ego. Face it:

       Oh, look. It's SilentNick3, the big bad troll with his accusing me of using ad hominem, followed by his own entire comment full of ad hominems.

       I don't have to prove he was going to testify. That's Sorcha Faal's claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I proved he was relevant to the case, and thus the connection should not be dismissed.

       He's the expert witness on the FICO tacking software. (and yes, I provided link citation for that)

The interlopers have no clue who anyone is here. They just dump their bullshit, smoke, mirrors, obfuscation, distraction, etc. and keep dumping it over and over and over as though repetition makes their lies become less dishonest.

       This thread isn't about bank fraud.  It's about the seemingly non-existent connection between Aurora and LIBOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't noticed anyone covering up bank fraud, but to be fair I haven't been paying attention to that specifically.

        This thread isn't about bank fraud. It's about the seemingly non-existent connection between Aurora and
        <strong>
         LIBOR
        </strong>
        . [emphasis mine]
       </p>

      <p>
       First: See the title. It's about James'
       <strong>
        father
       </strong>
       . It's about the connection between ROBERT Holmes and LIBOR. Furthermore...
      </p>
      <p>
       Uh... LIBOR isn't about bank fraud? What have you been smoking?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole argument here (from the OP, and 7 others just like him) is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sorcha Faal said it, so you must never look at Robert Holmes again. Ever. No, really. Ever.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And I've been fighting against that for two solid days. (for which you call me a troll and a detriment to this community)
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Holmes has a linkedin page which lists him as having expertise in financial fraud. THAT IS THE CONNECTION. It doesn't matter what lies Sorcha Faal added to it. Robert Holmes is the author of the financial fraud tracking software used by FICO. That is significant. They want it dismissed as irrelevant. They trivialize it by saying "but his software was about creditcard purchases, not about interest rate manipulation". Which is pure smoke and mirrors. He's an expert in the field of financial fraud and knows how to track it - I'd think that would be highly relevant to the LIBOR investigation on some level. ... regardless of whether or not he's currently listed on any witness lists.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, ignore all of that, because Sorcha Faal wrote similar things on a website and added lots of unverifiable crap along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I'm the biggest jackass on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the connection being dismissed by this Sorcha Faal shit. Don't look at the crooked banksters!

       It leads back to Aurora, right?  Or are you not part of the group that Aurora was a false flag to get Robert Holmes not to testify, or something like that.

       You're obviously not seeing the whole picture. And, as a result, not understanding my position in this matter. You saw me at my wits end, after two days of fighting an invasion force (see the link above), decided you didn't like what you saw me doing, and made your decision about me without all of the facts.

       <p>
        JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) and Barclays Plc (BARC) are among seven banks subpoenaed in New York and Connecticut’s investigation into alleged manipulation of Libor, according to a person familiar with the matter and company filings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subpoenas were sent in recent weeks to five of the banks, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) in addition to JPMorgan and Barclays, the person said yesterday. Citigroup Inc. (C) and UBS AG (UBSN) received subpoenas earlier this year as part of the investigation.

       Ahhh, "evidence." The weasel word of choice for truth-suppressors. Evidence is hard to come by when there's a persistent and global effort to destroy, tamper, obfuscate and hide evidence from truth-seekers. It's like writing a word on a piece of paper, burning that piece of paper, then saying "give me evidence of what that piece of paper said!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth-seekers have a new standard, a better standard, for discourse, free from your suppression tools like "evidence" and "burden of proof." We have what I like to call "known truths," things that are true, but the evidence to support the claim has been withheld by forces outside of our control. We know James Holmes didn't act alone.  That is a
       <em>
        known truth
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       These attempts to discredit truth-seekers need to have 9000sins' new suppressor-banning policy swiftly enforced.

       This is precisely why conspiracies and conspiracy theorists are so incredibly dangerous. They can make any claim they want, regardless of how outrageous it is, and when you ask them for proof to support their claims they can either call you a shill or deny that they need evidence at all. Remember, it's a conspiracy theory, often one that is "actively being covered up by the government and/or the media". Conspiracy theorists can claim anything they want and when asked for evidence they can just tell you that there is no evidence, since the government is suppressing it somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you're discussing conspiracy theories doesn't mean you can't provide evidence. You can't hold staunchly that a conspiracy theory
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       true in the face of logic and evidence, and then attack the people who say a conspiracy theory isn't true. It defies logic.

       You're dumb. I never said anything about James acting alone, since I don't think he did either. But trying to make a connection to LIBOR when there is none makes you discredited. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.

       Just because Sorcha Faal said something does not mean it's not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Holmes wrote financial tracking software. In fact, he wrote the most intelligent financial tracking software currently in existence, used by FICO. The Sorcha Faal reference is a distraction. Argument from ridicule. We discussed this exact disinfo tacting only days ago on this subreddit, and now here it is being used as if it somehow dismantles then entire conspiracy theory. "nothing to see here, citizen. move along".

       I'm not denying any of that. I'm saying that there is NO EVIDENCE he was going to be testifying at the LIBOR hearing. Sorcha Faal's reference is a red herring; a technique to make people look down the wrong path and come to the wrong conclusion.

       You ignored my proof, despite your claim to the contrary. LIBOR is about financial fraud. R.Holmes is the author of the most sophisticated financial tracking software in existence. The odds of him NOT being a witness at this trial are miniscule. The odds of him
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       a witness are phenomenal.
      </p>
      <p>
       But... ignore all of that. Just keep the discussion focused on the fact that Sorcha Faal said it, too.

       Where is the citation that he wrote the most sophisticated fraud tracking software of all time? He was/is a software engineer on a software called Falcon Fraud Manager which detects fraudulent point-of-sale credit card transactions. This has nothing to do with Libor.

       It doesn't matter what link I provide you, you'll dismiss it as irrelevant or you'll mock it as unreliable, or some other troll tactic. I don't have to prove he's testifying. That is YOUR claim.. your Sorcha Faal claim. I didn't make that claim. I've only claimed that dismissing it due to a Sorcha Faal connection is burying it - concealing evidence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the voting brigade which has invaded this subreddit (which I am a retired moderator of, so I know what normal behavior here is) will assist you in burying it, and down the road this freight train will continue to run... railroading James Holmes through a corrupted trial all so that the banksters can walk down the streets of America feeling safe.

       The software he wrote is called Falcon Fraud Manager, which detects point-of-sale credit card fraud. If you've even only seen one infographic about LIBOR, you'd know that it is not a scandal involving people using stolen credit cards to buy coffee.

       Thousands of people work in financial fraud prevention. Banks and credit rating agencies devote entire divisions to it. Credit card fraud and  interbank interest rate manipulation are in such completely different leagues that there is no reason to assume a connection in the absence of any other evidence.

       Everything I said in this post, and in my other post to which you didn't respond, is germane to the issue at hand. You have provided no counterarguments and are simply accusing everyone who disagrees with you of being a troll or shill. It's a transparent attempt to distract from the fact that you have nothing to back up your argument other than your own specious assumptions, and is fooling absolutely no one.

       I've provided plenty. Just because I didn't choose to engage your trollery doesn't mean I've provided nothing. I'm dealing with about eight of you bullies simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue at hand is this: The fact that Sorcha Faal said something about Robert Holmes does not mean it should be dismissed. &lt;-- that is a coverup tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Holmes has a linkedin account which shows he works for FICO tracking financial fraud via state of the art software (written by Holmes). The likelihood of him being a potential witness is staggering, despite the fact that his name does not appear anywhere on any lists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the absence of his name on any lists does NOT mean that he hasn't been contacted by the prosecution and is perhaps weighing things. True, he hasn't been subpoenaed
       <strong>
        yet
       </strong>
       , but the case is far from over.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all germain to the issue at hand, I do not need to provide links for simple google searches (ask r/askscience - they even have that as a formal policy).

      <p>
       Your assertions are no more binding than anyones. But, your determination to bury this information is suspect.

       The truth here is that I am a loyal member of this subreddit and have been for 2+ years. Despite the

        infestation that began this summer
       </a>
       and which has come out of the woodwork over this topic, I will remain loyal here.

       And you, like all the other interlopers here, will be gone. I will remain standing. You, thankfully, will not.

      <p>
       Your rhetorical attempts to characterize me in a way that encourages dismissal of anything I say is futile. This post, like all of the others on this topic, will fade into oblivion. You will move on. I will continue to press for truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you are only here to bury this one topic is the flaw in your strategy. It is what strips you of all credibility in this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that I have to continue facing these people, after you've gone, is the testament to my credibility. I do not fear this community. I do not fear you. You are nothing more than the lingering stench of a skunk infestation. It'll go away eventually, along with you.

       I'm not simply accusing everyone who disagrees with me of being a shill or troll. I'm pointing out that there is a flaw in the Sorcha Faal argument. A logical flaw (arguing from the conclusion). And anyone who steps up to defend that bullshit is suspect. Including you - you, who will be gone soon.

       There are two lines of argument here that you seem to be confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first concerns the source for the alleged LIBOR/Holmes connection. OP pointed out that the original source appears to be Sorcha Faal, which is mostly bullshit and should not be trusted. You pointed out that this does not discount the possibility, which is fine, though those who are more familiar with Sorcha Faal might disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to the second point, which is whether there is any other reason to suspect a connection. I and others in this thread have pointed out that there's no evidence of a Senate hearing on LIBOR, of Holmes being deposed for such a hearing, or of any reason why he would be. His work, while related to financial fraud, is on such a small scale as to be at face value completely irrelevant to high-level interest rate manipulation, which is what the whole LIBOR scandal is about. You have repeatedly ignored this point and somehow characterized it as a distraction from the Sorcha Faal discussion, which it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Sorcha Faal might be right about something by pure chance. There's a first time for everything. But outside of that Sorcha Faal post and the various people who have ripped it off, there is no reason to suspect a connection. You've jumped onto this idea and are clinging to it despite the lack of any evidence whatsoever.

       The only thing I've jumped on is the fact that you, and other vermin like you, don't want anyone looking at Robert Holmes, and you're waving Sorcha Faal as the reason to not look. &lt;-- that's coverup, not inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it turns out that R. Holmes is, in some way, integral to the investigation of LIBOR (even if we never find out in our lifetimes), you are participating in the coverup of bank fraud. I'm simply calling shenanigans on the aggressive coverup going on in this subreddit by an infestation of interlopers.

       You need to read more carefully.

      <p>
       Holmes's work has no overt connection to the LIBOR scandal. He works for a credit rating agency and his LinkedIn profile indicates that he writes software related to point-of-sale credit card fraud and assessing the credit risk of individuals. None of this has anything to do with banks manipulating interest rates. His career does not connect him to the LIBOR scandal any more than someone being a bush pilot in Alaska connects them to 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can call these facts "dismissal" all you want; that doesn't change the fact that there is no reason to believe that a connection between Holmes and LIBOR exists.

       This entire thread is about Sorcha Faal. It's the OP's premise for dismissing connection between ROBERT Holmes and LIBOR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorcha Faal's reports I'm willing to dismiss, but the part you continue to overlook and dismiss about my point is: That's no reason not to look at Robert Holmes. Sorcha Faal mixes fact with fiction. We all know that. But, dismissing any potential connection between Holmes and LIBOR simply because it was part of one such mangled report is irresponsible investigation. Which parts are false? Dismiss THOSE. But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

      <p>
       So, says you, an interloper in this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Holmes is an expert in financial fraud. LIBOR is a financial fraud case. Robert Holmes is, specifically, an expert in TRACKING financial fraud. Why is that not relevant to tracking financial fraud in the LIBOR case again? Oh, right... you never did explain that. You just dismissed it as irrelevant based on your opinion. &lt;-- that's not logical debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, my argument is: Don't dismiss Robert Holmes potential as an expert witness in the LIBOR case just because he's currently not on any lists - there are
       <strong>
        many
       </strong>
       reasons (his expertise in tracking financial fraud, specifically, regardless of whether or not his current job has him working on credit card fraud or international bank fraud - he's an expert at tracking financial fraud, period.) why he
       <strong>
        could still be called
       </strong>
       as a witness, or may have been requested to appear as an expert witness by the prosecution but has not responded yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too many unknowns in this to just dismiss and trivialize it simply because Sorcha Faal was the first documented blogger to mention it, and Sorcha Faal has a history of mixing fact with fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth here is: We do not know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bullshit here is: We shouldn't look.

      <p>
       I've said this about four times in this thread. His work has no direct connection to LIBOR other than being in the same extremely broad area. Thousands of people work in financial fraud prevention, probably tens of thousands. Any expert witnesses used in a trial would be experts in interest rates and inter-bank lending, not small-time shit like credit card fraud or defaulting on loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're equating two extremely different things - stealing credit cards and manipulating interest rates. Expertise from one does not transfer to the other. The connection is not evident, and your only justification is that both involve some sort of fraud. This is not a convincing argument. They have about as much in common as podiatry and neurosurgery.

      <p>
       (By the way, I love that you find it necessary to point out that I'm an "interloper in this community," as if that made my reasoning any less sound and yours any less ludicrous)

       Your ridicule and mockery aside, I think that's a pretty significant area of expertise - the ability to predict the flow of money and detect fraud enroute. I'd think that might be sort of relevant to being able to detect fraud in other areas, but... you know vinscountprawn says otherwise, so we must all bow to his superior knowledge.

        Most important to note about James Holmes, however, this report says, is that his father, Robert Holmes, was said to have been scheduled to testify within the next few weeks before a US Senate panel on the largest bank fraud scandal in world history that is currently unfolding and threatens to destabilize and destroy the Western banking system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert Holmes, whose “blueblood” family links go back to the Mayflower, is known throughout the global banking community as being the creator of one of the most sophisticated computer algorithms ever developed and is credited with developing predictive models for financial services; credit and fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.
       </p>
       <p>
        Educated at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University, Robert Holmes is currently the senior lead scientist with the American credit score company FICO, which was formally known as Fair, Isaac and Company, and which every American citizen is beholden to should they need to borrow money.
       </p>
       <p>
        The massive banking crime being investigated by the US Senate is called the LIBOR Scandal where UK banks fixed the London Interbank Borrowing Rate with the complicity of the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve (which knew about this crime for 4 years and didn’t report it) and many other major Western banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not known to the majority of those affected by this LIBOR rate scandal (which is everyone in the world) is that its historically low setting of interests rates since the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2012 has done more to destroy the life savings, stock investments and retirements of Americas middle class than any other single event in their entire history.

       Do you have a link for Holmes's software being the "most intelligent currently in existence"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, you seem to be equating all financial software. It's not clear that any software he wrote for his job would necessarily be relevant to the LIBOR scandal. Holmes's LinkedIn page says he developed:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        predictive models for financial services; credit &amp; fraud risk models, first and third party application fraud models and internet/online banking fraud models.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sounds reasonable given that FICO is one of the big credit rating agencies - the software sounds like it's more or less about determining how much of a credit risk someone is. How would this software be at all relevant to the manipulation of inter-bank interest rates?

       My understanding from what I've seen presented in various fly-by articles and links is that the software is capable of predicting where money will go, once it's issued. And for discovering fraud in that route of transactions. (My non-expert summary.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If he's that smart ... that he can actually predict (accurately) the flow of money,
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       detect fraud in that flow, then... I would think that is relevant as an area of expertise in the LIBOR case -- the ability to detect fraud based on known models, generically.

       You haven't come anywhere close to "beyond reasonable doubt." You're just stating things with no support. Some of them you've abandoned, like the baseless assertion that his software is the "most sophisticated in the world," but apparently that stage has passed, because you've now taken something that you think you might have read somewhere as truth without investigating, or even being willing to provide, the source of that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of proof is not "you say something and everyone else has to prove you wrong somehow." If you make a claim, you need to support it, and so far you've done nothing of the sort.

       Derp, of course I've googled this claim. The FICO site that describes the software mentioned on his LinkedIn page, Falcon Fraud Manager, says nothing about "tracking the flow of money after it's issued." It predicts behaviour of credit card holders and flags them for potential fraud if they do something unusual, like buying a big-ticket item in a foreign country. This is extremely standard and has nothing to do with what you claimed it does.

       Every other site that talks about this more or less just parrots Sorcha Faal and adds some speculation. I'm asking where
       <em>
        you

       heard this claim, because I know if I pull out a site that uses Sorcha Faal as a source you'll just accuse me of trying to distract from the issue. And also, because you're making the claim, the burden of proof is on you. You can't dodge responsibility by saying "google lol." Just post the site or sites where you read this claim.

       For the sake of the argument, let's just ignore, that there is no indication that Roger Holmes is in any way shape or form scheduled to testify before an investigative body (which has yet to be formed) and let's just look if the witness scenario makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB want Robert Holmes silence or cooperation. They don't bribe or threaten him. Instead, they decide to destroy his family. In the eyes of the public his son becomes a mass murderer. Do you really think this approach is the right way to get Robert Holmes cooperation? The choice between death penalty, life sentence or mental asylum for his son? I find this scenario very unconvincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Revenge would be a more plausible scenario. Especially if HomegrownTerran's assumption is true that it was:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        financial tracking software - likely his own [Roger Holmes] software - which was likely used to bust those scumbags

        )
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is there any indication, that it was sophisticated software which helped expose the Libor manipulation?  I have found nothing which points into this direction. Neither the warnings in newspapers like the WSJ, nor academic studies like the one from
       <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1569603">
        Snider and Youle
       </a>
       mention FICO, any kind of sophisticated software or Roger Holmes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone has a source that confirms the vital role of some kind of sophisticated software or can even find the name of the software Roger Holmes has helped to develop, please share your information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps central bankers were warned through special fraud detecting software. Mervyn King, Paul Tucker and Timothy Geithner knew about Libor manipulation before in became public knowledge. But the central bankers didn't pressure the banks. They tried to cover up the whole thing. So I think it is quite unlikely that whistleblowing/software of Robert Holmes angered shadowy bankers to such a degree, that they planned a gruesome revenge for Robert Holmes and his family.

       That's a pretty loaded demand: Solve the case now.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I've been arguing is: Stop dismissing shit without actually exploring it. Under normal circumstances this subreddit would be looking into Robert Holmes. But, this isn't normal circumstances. This is some kind of sick aberration - Anyone who mentions Robert Holmes is buried by the likes of you.

       and the 8 or 10 others actively burying this topic will eventually leave, and we'll be allowed to explore this ... unless the same people keep rearing their ugly faces every time the topic emerges, in which case we should have a good case to argue with the admins about gaming reddit. Meanwhile, I fight this futile battle against these cum garglers.

       Keep fighting for the truth! Don't listen to the suppressors in this thread. I'm contacting the moderators about having the appropriate people banned and having suppressive comments in this thread removed. Robert Holmes IS testifying. This is a known truth. There are plenty of us who stand with you, Homegrown.
