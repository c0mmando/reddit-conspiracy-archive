        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For the past 2 years and 8 months, I have maintained a publicly connected trail of usernames. Always informing you of my new username when I deleted a previous one.</p>

<p>I demonstrated, here, how it is that one can assert their <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/b77es/you_know_his_name_wasnt_really_jesus_christ_right/c0larnt?context=3">being</a>, completely separate from any given username identity.</p>

<p>You have recognized <a href="http://redd.it/yqeqw">ImJulianAssange&#39;s words</a>. You will recognize mine, as well. You will know my links.</p>

<p>You no longer have cohesive community leadership here. They have divided, they have conquered. You only have the mod invasion, happening before your eyes.</p>

<p>9000sins will, when the ability finally emerges, start assigning mod-assigned flair. He&#39;ll do it all friendly-like. Lots of fun choices, and only a few involuntary labels that never get used for the indoctrination period. You will embrace them. You will eagerly line up to get yours. And once you&#39;ve embraced them, he will start assigning them on his own... labeling people. It has been part of what he has wanted both publicly (in distinguished moderator posts to this community) and privately (in modmail).</p>

<p>The leaders from the past have been pushed out amid accusations of anti-semitism, while I pleaded with them to steer away from racism and toward the global issue of Rothschild Zionism. I hope our sacrifices have been worth it.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been taken over by the likes of </p>

<ul>
<li><p>greenw40, self-appointed judge of what is and/or is not a conspiracy worthy of this subreddit (9/11 and the Aurora shooting are okay, but don&#39;t get too close to the real puppeteers - no faked moon landing discussions), and</p></li>
<li><p>drunkenshrew, a professional disinfo agent spewing long walls of quoted text to distract you from the important issues that need investigation (don&#39;t look at the bankster connections, Kennedy&#39;s speech was about communism, not the banksters, and Robert Holmes can&#39;t possibly be an expert witness in the LIBOR investigation)</p></li>
<li><p>DomesticTerranist (formerly FemaCampDirector), horking the cleverness of one of my own usernames -- a military psyop</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You allowed this to happen. You allowed opposition to these infil<strong>traitors</strong> to be silenced, right here in your own subreddit. You failed to defend those who tried to fight against this (me, being one).</p>

<p>You deserve the collapse that has come upon you, the absolute and complete loss of integrity this subreddit is now embracing.</p>

<p>With ImJulianAssange spearheading the link aggregation and me spearheading the discussion focus, we shined a very bright light upon the real heart of the world of conspiracy theory. Now, look at the queue... it&#39;s full of rap videos and &quot;do you believe in the illuminati?&quot; self posts, as if we haven&#39;t proven our case a hundred times over. Your subreddit now exists in the shadow of doubt, once again. We had climbed up out of the bowel of that darkness and became a source of quality news, but those days are now over, as well. </p>

<p>Mark my words. Watch the change in what makes your front page - I see it already happening in the new queue. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve been taken over because there was too much &quot;pay attention to me&quot; being played by your infil<strong>traitor</strong> leader in chief, a self-absorbed megalomaniac. The detractors from this takeover (unbornmonster, DomesticTerranist, etc.) have blamed me, publicly.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of psyops. What you will witness, hereafter, is one psyop against another psyop. Spy vs. Spy. There are no longer any real voices here. Only spies.</p>

<p>When I joined this community as ithinkican, I thought I could. I was right. I was part of this subreddit&#39;s climb to success. But, I cannot fight off a wave of subversion which is endorsed by the site&#39;s ownership. I could only do that while this subreddit was free, under the radar, and had community bond. I helped you get noticed. And, for doing that, my outspokenness against corruption is no longer welcome here. I&#39;ve been silenced.</p>

<p>I deleted HomegrownTerran (my main of the last 9 months) yesterday, upon hearing of ImJulianAssange&#39;s departure in email. I will delete all of my remaining accounts by the end of the day... and then I will withdraw my presence.</p>

<p>This is now Zionist real estate, because this community was unable to maintain cohesion against their invasion.</p>

<p>I have so much more I want to tell you, but ... even in parting... I retain the dignity of my credibility. I will not post screencaps of modmail (and that&#39;s some juicy shit, brothers and sisters).</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

<p>The Contheory Spiracist</p>
