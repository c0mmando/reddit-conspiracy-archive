<p>It&#39;s not like I&#39;m surprised; Rachel probably hated these fucktard sickos but was too classy to say so.</p>

<p>Not shocked that these Redditors would mock and ridicule a dead girl who fought nonviolently for PEACE...these are the same people that see Palestinians as human garbage and its apparent they do the same to Corrie who only sought peace and hated nobody.</p>

<p>Its OK, if there indeed is some kind of &quot;hell&quot; after life they will be burning there along with their terrorist heroes like Begin, Peres, Golda Meir, Nutty-yahoo, and the rest of the Zionist sick fucks that advocate, and of course <em>love</em>, taking innocent people&#39;s lives for no reason other than their own sick and twisted pleasure.</p>

<p>Zionists, you think CORRIE was a bitch...wait until you see what KARMA has in store for you!</p>

<p>If the situation were reversed <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would be very pro Israel and we&#39;d be called anti-Semites anyway because the Palestinians are semetic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is false.  Palestinians are &quot;semitic&quot;, but as has been explained here dozens of times, &quot;anti-semitism&quot; as a German term referring to <strong>hatred of Jews.</strong>  Anti-semitism does <em>not</em> include arabs, no matter how often you try to tell us what the word &quot;semite&quot; means.  That&#39;s simply not the meaning of the term &quot;anti-semitism&quot;, which has been around for over a hundred years, and has ALWAYS described the specific phenomenon of persecution of Jews.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s about love instead of hate, stop defending and propping up people like bumblingmumbling and tttt0tttt from criticism.  These are people with agendas of pure hatred, and you protect them.  I&#39;m not asking you to BAN them, I&#39;m asking you not to defend and shield them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, r/conspiracy.  Especially you, dusty!</p>

<p>Graped_in_the_mouth here.  Some of you, I imagine, know me, as a member of the r/conspiratard community, a skeptic, pro-science/vaccination activist, and frequent poster to this subreddit before being banned (for criticizing Nazis.)  This is my second account, and the first time I have made a post on an account that wasn&#39;t my primary.  It should be pretty clear that I am who I say - I have a pretty distinctive writing style, and I imagine some of you should have no trouble recognizing it.  </p>

<p>As you can see, this account was created today - a necessary step, as my primary account was banned, and I imagine this one will be as well, soon.</p>

<p>The comments replying to this are absolutely insane, largely because you, members of r/conspiracy, have followed in Dusty&#39;s footsteps in judging a group of thousands based on the words of three.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right - three individuals.  There are ONLY three people whose posts have been linked by Dusty (aka Ghibmm, aka Krugmanisapuppet, etc).  If someone took the time to link the worst of what <em>he&#39;s</em> posted, I assure you, there wouldn&#39;t be a very wide gap.</p>

<p>Who you think JCM, GhostofTzvika, and Einsteimer are, that&#39;s up to you.  I can&#39;t tell you what to believe, particularly because their support of Israel is where my views diverge from theirs...but they are complicated people, and while they&#39;ve made a number of sick jokes at times, none of them are the sub-human monsters you&#39;ve judged them to be based on Dusty&#39;s testimony and obsessive stalking.  </p>

<p>R/conspiratard is not, and has never been an organized downvote brigade.  If individual members choose to game votes, that&#39;s on them, but the rules are clearly stated in the sidebar.  </p>

<p>R/nolibs, on the other hand, is.  They stalk JCM religiously, following his every post.  Krugmanisapuppet is, for lack of a better word, obsessed with him (and everyone who has ever associated with him), and has a habit of taking everyone he disagrees with, and throwing them on a &quot;shill list&quot;, which he then later refers to as proof of its own validity - a textbook example of circular citations.  </p>

<p>Say what you want, but this assumption that everyone on r/conspiratard is a Zionist, a supremacist, a government shill, or an all-around evil human being is based on a handful of posts by a handful of users - far from a sufficient sample size for you to make such a judgment without displaying your own confirmation bias and prejudice.</p>

<p>You can pretend that we&#39;re the trolls, you can pretend that we&#39;re the monsters, but if this is what you have - a few jokes in bad taste from THREE users - then you&#39;re on very shaky ground.  Our forum, on the other hand, has <em>dozens</em> of pro-Nazi, pro-Hitler, Jew-bashing posts from MORE than a small handful (over a dozen) users, whose posts are frequently voted into the double digits right here, by your community.  That means more people are clicking that little &quot;up&quot; button than down.  That would be a <strong>Majority</strong> of your voting clique.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the posts quoted of distasteful songs, and hateful rhetoric that Dusty has provided, are all in the negatives, or on VERY tiny subreddits - certainly nothing like <em>75,000</em> who could be upvoting.  </p>

<p>Take this as you will.  Believe what you will.  But don&#39;t let yourselves be fooled into believing that r/conspiracy is full of love, and r/conspiratard full of hate, because Dusty linked you a handful of old posts from a handful of users.  We can show you this hate repeated tenfold in your own community, by a larger number of users, many of whom have posted in this very thread, pretending to have the moral high ground.  Guys like PrimaryPerception, who has argued that the Jews&#39; history of persecution is proof that they deserved it; people like No1113 who <em>actually</em> suggested that a second Holocaust was in order, and that genocide of all Jews was justified.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re more than welcome to judge our community based on these few posts - because we&#39;ve been judging you, too, with a much larger sample size.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;ll confirm what you&#39;ve all heard: we do have an agenda.  The agenda is to expose the hypocrisy, bigotry, irrationality, and outright hatred that have become rampant on this subreddit over the recent months.  </p>

<p>This is why we cross-post, to highlight this hatred.  This is why we mock you, when you say we&#39;re all &quot;paid shills&quot;, without even the TINIEST shred of evidence (your unsourced list doesn&#39;t count, Dusty!)  This is why we come here to demand evidence for unsupported, irrational claims.  This is why we debate.  </p>

<p>Because we want to see the truth prevail, over the rumors.  To see reason outshine hatred.  THAT&#39;S the prevailing mindset of the people I&#39;ve met at r/conspiracy...and those of you who refuse to see that, simply aren&#39;t looking in the right places.  </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.  </p>

<p>Unlike the targets of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>  Rachel Corrie didn&#39;t kill anyone . Neither was she deceiving the public. She was a young ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Corrie">23 yo</a> ) idealistic women  who was trying to prevent homes being destroyed. </p>

<p>Rachel Corrie died in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Corrie">march 2003</a> 2 years before reddit started. The <a href="/r/conspirtard">/r/conspirtard</a> crew in all their guises are still making  <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/RachelCorrie">&quot;jokes&quot; about Rachel Corrie in 2012</a> - 9 years later. That&#39;s an unhealthy obsession if ever there was one. </p>

<p>The link you provided included this quote:</p>

<p>Usually he just does things like register accounts for one comment, or even one thinly veiled threat that he sends from PM. </p>

<p>Sounds like &quot;Dusty&quot; has been harassing JCM, under multiple names.  That monster, making fun of a person who sends him veiled threats!</p>

<p>Irrationally?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m of Jewish descent, so this shit hits home.  Hitler - and all of his Nazi friends - didn&#39;t differentiate between &quot;Zionists&quot; and non-zionists.  He didn&#39;t go door-to-door asking Jewish people if they were active in their communities.  He just fucking rounded people up, based on <em>lists</em>.  Practicing or not, Zionist or not, you were lumped in as a &quot;Jew&quot;.  </p>

<p>This mindset is not dead.  One of No1113&#39;s posts made it clear that in his view, the eradication of <em>all</em> Jews was justified, because &quot;a majority&quot; were actively trying to enslave everyone on Earth.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t sit here and tell me that MY focus on Jewish related issues is unhealthy - it&#39;s the focus HERE, among a surprising portion of r/conspiracy, that&#39;s the problem.  Guys like PrimaryPerception, tttt0tttt, bumblingmumbling and Occidentalist post on r/conspiracy for almost no other reason than to blame Jews for one problem or another...and they <strong>get upvoted for doing it.</strong>  And <strong>I&#39;m</strong> the one with the &quot;irrational&quot; or &quot;perverse&quot; focus on Jewish issues?  Ridiculous.</p>

<p>Excuse me for not wanting to get sent to the gas chambers.  How irrational of me, to take an interest in combating violent rhetoric from people who, if they had their way, would probably execute me.  </p>

<p>This is what you don&#39;t get.  This is why there are so many people concerned with &quot;Jewish issues&quot; on r/conspiratard - because we&#39;re first on the chopping block if no one calls attention to these hateful bigots who have free reign on r/conspiracy to spread their hate speech.  We don&#39;t exactly ignore other forms of bigotry, either...but I don&#39;t see very many posts on this subreddit about how blacks, Asians or Hispanics are ruining and enslaving America, do you?  </p>

<p>People like this exist, and you have the nerve to criticize <strong>me</strong>?  To call <strong>us</strong> irrational, for trying to stem the spread of the hateful lies that flow from these people?  What a load of misleading, dishonest bullshit.  </p>

<p>Fuck you for pretending this is some obscure issue that has no bearing on me.  I&#39;ve seen what the sort of hate speech that gets praise here does when unchecked, and so I intend to combat it wherever I find it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of us believe every bullshit conspiracy theory. If people looked at what a conspiracy theory actually meant they&#39;d find it does not mean delusional fantasy. It means a theory that inquires into two or more people committing illegal acts in <em>secrecy.</em> The very nature of a conspiracy theory means that it is not public. It&#39;s really fun to watch the conspiratards cry out &#39;FIND ME PROOF!&#39; when there is little to no proof due to the secretive nature of the illegal act being committed by one or more people. I highly doubt half the illegal acts would happen if there were proof, because then the people committing them could get in trouble for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah thats one thing I can&#39;t understand about people who don&#39;t believe anything with the word conspiracy attached. First off if the event took place a conspiracy happened regardless of who committed it. Secondly what evidence would they leave behind? Do you think if the government was behind 9/11 they would record themselves discussing it or document the plans? The only evidence that could be gathered is if someone came forward and said &#39;I took part in planning 9/11&#39; and even then the conspiratards would call them crazy and disregard their evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it was, immensely. And coupled with the fact that the perpetrators of 9/11 had been caught <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bojinka_plot">previously</a> yet the attack still happened later is incredibly suspicious as well. It&#39;s my belief that folks who control money, and here is a direct evidence quote from David Rockefeller,</p>

<p>&quot;For more than a century, ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Then it becomes more suspicious that it happened on 9/11, and that we&#39;re now invading the middle east to do just exactly what he said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with the 9/11 theory being one of the biggest joke theories. Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not saying it was the government but the basic theory behind it does make sense and there are pieces of information here and there you can put together that makes the idea seem a lot less far fetched. Things likes Operation Northwoods prove the government was willing to discuss crashing planes into their own towers to start a war at one point so the idea of them taking the next step is not as crazy as people would like to believe. None of this is solid evidence and doesn&#39;t prove anything but its does make the overall idea a lot less crazy than at first glance.</p>

<p>Of course there is no solid evidence but why would there be? Solid evidence comes in 3 forms, documents, video/audio and witness testimony. If you where the goverment and where planning on crashing planes into 2 towers to start a war would you really document it? Would you record audio or video? The only possible evidence would be a witness coming forward but they would instantly be labeled crazy and their evidence would be invalid. So even if members of the government where behind 9/11 it would be impossible to prove because they wouldn&#39;t create any evidence in the first place.</p>

Often when you question/scrutinise a CT&#39;s beliefs they claim there is no evidence because its &#39;secret&#39; and yet they believe it anyway, even to the point of claiming its actually &#39;proven&#39; or &#39;common knowledge&#39;.  There&#39;s no logic there...</p>

<p>Claims of &#39;I don&#39;t need logic, I have common sense&#39; refute themselves.  You can&#39;t have common sense <em>without</em> the presence of logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a reply (1 day old), from a recent <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> thread that can be <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/y9kf4/i_just_want_to_know_if_i_did_it_right_should_i/">found here</a></p>

<p>A <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> user is asking for comments and criticisms on his newest troll attempt (of a 911 truther), here&#39;s one example of the advice he is getting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FVAnon 2 points 1 day ago* (2|0)</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, and with all due respect to everyone who says otherwise, I am going to go ahead and disagree a lot with the popular consensus.</p>

<p>Rational debate with conspiracy nuts is never a good idea. I have never seen a conspiracy nut or any other crazy change his mind once. Not once. You will not change their mind. You will get into long drawn out wall-of-text wars that nobody except you and them will care about at all, full of constantly moving goalposts and vague arguments about scientific facts between two unqualified people. I guarantee you that you will not get anywhere, and the argument will just go on until someone gets tired.</p>

<p>Mockery, on the other hand, is a very useful tool. I speak from experience when I say this. I&#39;ve been active in a Project Chanology group (fuckin&#39; with Scientology, but also recently these guys, WBC, and even OWS) since 2008, and what started off as a somewhat civil protest group turned quickly into a pure mockery/crude comedy crew.</p>

<p>We quickly learned that mockery is a very useful tool. Getting plain laughed at and disregarded stings a lot more than being respectfully argued against. An anecdote that I always like to bring up is the case of one Scinetologist who left the church because some kids passed him by while he was handing out flyers and said something like &quot;hey look, that&#39;s what a cultist looks like!&quot;. Those kind of remarks really get to people. This isn&#39;t to say that you should hope to change people&#39;s minds with mockery, because most of the time, nothing can change their minds. It&#39;s like trying to convert someone away from their religion. It&#39;s a pointless goal. However, if you are looking to get a rise out of someone or make other people around them laugh, mockery is great!</p>

<p>So to sum it up, if there&#39;s anything that ~5 years of experience in this shit taught us, its this:</p>

<p>People with preconceived delusional beliefs will not change them, especially because of some stranger.
    Nobody gives a fuck about a &#39;civil discussion&#39;. Especially if its about crazy shit. Chances are if you get into a &#39;rational discussion&#39; with the homeless guy on the street ranting about chemtrails, you&#39;ll look crazy yourself just for discussing it. Sane people ignore that shit.
    Mockery is the only tool we found to be at all useful in engaging various crazies, and it is usually done for our / someone else&#39;s amusement as opposed to for the purpose of changing someone&#39;s mind, but sometimes it can stir up enough shame/regret/feelings of silliness inside people to sway them away from crazy.</p>

<p>As such, the rule that we live by is to never get entrenched in discussion with our targets, and to simply extract as much humor/laughter from our encounters with them as possible. This may seem cold at first, but since 2008 a lot of our enemies&#39; &#39;arguments&#39; against us have been along the lines of (direct quotations here) &quot;I know you are Satan in there&quot; and &quot;The government uses witchcraft on you through chips in your phones, which is why you act this way&quot; and &quot;We know you are paid by Pfizer. We are watching you&quot; and various death threats. When presented with such bullshit for long enough, you really start to realize that the only thing you can do is laugh.</p>

<p>Am I correct in assuming that you believe that there is some sort of invisible wall that keeps these cloud seeding experiments from effecting weather down wind? You do know that our world is essentially one large organism, what happens upwind is carried by either the wind/ocean currents and has the potential to effect other locations.  Radioactive fallout, volcanic ash, even smoke from forest fires can be detected hundreds of miles from where the original event took place.  How is this any different?</p>

<p>Do you have a link to that?

And indeed it seems to match. Aside from that, the text on the side of the edited video only appears for a split second, which would be easy to miss.

You can see they hate people, there is no respect or regard for others. That behavior is objectively observable. The crowd is a combination of sick fanatics, mentally ill, and sane but cynical paid political operatives. The operatives ones deny of course they are doing it as a job, but who has the time to do this for 10+ years online daily this much and still maintain a job outside? The core leaders are probably paid by another nation to be traitors to America and help steer it into obedience to an apartheid fanatic religious state. Hence they attack Americans who stand up against the invasion and the apartheid.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s a bit insensitive and actually monstrous? You have to realize that when you mock the death of a human being, you&#39;re actually coming out as an advocate of their killing. Or, at worst, your indifference. This is not right. This is not ethical behavior. Perhaps you can understand why some people cannot go there with you. I cannot advocate anyone&#39;s death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does &quot;anti-Jew&quot; mean to you, though? Is it opposition to a religion? Or an ethnicity? Because, as an atheist, I&#39;m against all of the Abrahamic religions. It has nothing to do with ethnicity whatsoever.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say you have to admit anything, only that you have to <em>realize</em> something. If you don&#39;t realize it, then it&#39;s your hard-headedness and nothing else. The idea that the bulldozer had &quot;terrible visibility&quot; is an Israeli taking point. Israel is smack dab in the middle of a region with a lot of ignorance. I think this ignorance has permeated Israeli culture, as a result, to the extent that it&#39;s looked at as just another Middle Eastern country by many; Second, if not Third, World; at least in terms of ignorance. This kind of gross disregard for human life you&#39;re displaying is not a tenet of the civilized world. It&#39;s barbaric and unintellectual.</p>

<p>If her cause was just, wouldn&#39;t she <em>deserve</em> martyr status? Like the burning monk? No one mocks his status. Maybe reason told her death would speak louder (to people in the West <em>and</em> the Middle East) than anything else she could do in life and that it was <em>worth it</em> to give her life for what she believed in. The Palestinians are being driven out and off of their land. I&#39;m not sure you can even be a leftist and not hold this position.</p>

<p>Yes, I would, actually.</p>

<p>Israel is a small state. The smaller the democracy, the more representative it is, unless there&#39;s just some extreme tampering going on or some fundamental brokenness to the system. Parliamentary systems tend to reflect a citizenry&#39;s politics pretty accurately.</p>

<p>Stop trying to skew what I&#39;m saying. I have never been saying that ALL Israelis have an impudent attitude toward anti-Zionists. In fact, I have <em>gone out of my way</em> to say that I&#39;m not saying that.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rabid Zionists often don&#39;t care for context one bit when it comes to being &quot;anti-Jew&quot;. They&#39;ll paint any/everybody with that brush. I can empathize with that suspicion, but it&#39;s not making people all warm and fuzzy when you call them unwarranted names. I&#39;m anti-Judaism (just as much as I&#39;m anti-Christianity or anti-Islam). I just don&#39;t know if you think that makes me racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just think about this for a second... <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> exists only to ridicule people and stifle conversation about certain controversial topics.  Anyone who is a member of that subreddit should be ashamed of themselves.  </p>

<p>Say what you will about conspiracy theorists, but they are mostly genuine.  People come here because they genuinely believe that there is more going on than we realize (which is an indisputable point).  People go to conspiratard to circle-jerk each other to completion at the notion of ridiculing mostly genuine people with altruistic intentions.  They are either willful tools or too stupid to realize that they are tools.  Who the hell has time for that?  There are some really awful subreddits on Reddit, but I wouldn&#39;t waste my time, dedicating an entire subreddit to ridiculing them.</p>

Think of it this way... everyone is on a different level of personal evolution... we all have different educational backgrounds and are experts in different fields.

    <div class="md"><p>From what little I&#39;ve seen of <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, most of the top posts seem to be pointing out obviously ignorant conspiracy theories which lack any kind of evidence whatsoever.

<p>Perhaps if you dig deeper into the actions and posts of conspiratard contributors you will find a bunch of hate and ignorance (like OP did), but that&#39;s not the vibe I get when I look at the top posts on that subreddit.</p>

<p>Basically, OP seems to be judging the entire subreddit based purely on the actions of its creator.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure what&#39;s wrong with poking fun at people.  It&#39;s my <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a>, just more interesting than stupid memes and advice animals.</p>

<p>Many posts in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> have supporting evidence that isn&#39;t completely absurd (I would say &quot;most&quot;).  Therefore, they aren&#39;t the type of theory people from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> make posts about.</p>

<p>As an example, <a href="http://s1.b3ta.com/host/creative/8088/1345964573/armstronghoax.jpg">this</a> is the top post on tard right now.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mainly concerns itself with somewhat feasible conspiracy theories: you don&#39;t exhibit the level of paranoia (in addition to a paucity of evidence) that <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>&#39;ians find amusing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Far be it for me to tell people what is funny and what isn&#39;t or what people should find funny, but I will say this... there are confirmed conspiracies out there... there are others that are obvious but are as of yet unconfirmed.  <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a>, even with seemingly innocuous pictures like the one you linked to actually does a disservice by ridiculing &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; (and conspiracy theorists).  </p>

<p>And fine, people can think whatever they want, but to some degree it is damaging because it is a targeted attack on a group of people that are already CONSTANTLY attacked, whether they are right or wrong... most of whom just want to seek truth and make the world better (somehow).  </p>

<p>And sure, there are definitely some fringe posts on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that have no merit (some of which are actually disinfo posted by people trying to discredit theories or the community on the whole... yeah, that happens) and there are also racists and bigots.

<p>Simple, it&#39;s been confirmed that many from your group have been coming here to downvote comments and submissions in an effort to do nothing more than to stifle opinions that you disagree with.

<p>I&#39;ll address these one-at-a-time even though I think it is foolish for you to even suggest that everyone in this subreddit embodies all of these.  Some of these are outright false.</p>

<ul>
<li>paranoid - Yep, but is it paranoia if there is something really going on?</li>
<li>anti-government - Yeah, but that&#39;s only a by-product of being aware enough to come to this sub in the first place.  Plus, saying &quot;anti-government&quot; really has no meaning.  The government is supposed to be of the people, by the people, for the people.  I think few people would argue that this is truly the case.  Anti-unrepresentative government that exists only to enrich the elite and acquire power for the few?  Yes, definitely.</li>
<li>anti-progress - Definitely not.  I&#39;m not sure of the breakdown of conservatives vs. liberals here, which is probably the best common barometer that can be used.  However, I can say that if you&#39;re talking about drones, wiretaps, blanketed surveillance cameras, and TSA patdowns as a means to &quot;improve&quot; security.  Yes, most of us are against that.</li>
<li>anti-technology - See above</li>
<li>anti-semetic - There are some that are outright anti-semetic, but you can&#39;t discount the entire community because of that.  Also, many of them draw the distinction between being anti-semetic and anti-zionist, which I can <em>sort</em> of understand, but too many make it the focal point and make it clear that they are compartmentally bigoted (without probably even realizing it).<br/></li>
<li>jingoists - I think that word means what you think it means.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>I know its a typo on your part, but you cant leave yourself open like that.  ;-)</p>

<p>Jingoism, as defined by the Encyclopedia Brittanica is :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an attitude of belligerent nationalism, the English equivalent of the term chauvinism. The term apparently originated in England during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 when the British Mediterranean squadron was sent to Gallipoli to restrain Russia and war fever was aroused. Supporters of the British government&#39;s policy toward Russia came to be called jingoes as a result of the phrase &quot;by jingo,&quot; which appeared in the refrain of a popular song:We don&#39;t want to fight, yet by jingo, if we do,We&#39;ve got the ships, we&#39;ve got the men,And got the money, too! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I wont say that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a bunch of war mongers, but I will say that there are quite a few flag wavers in the group that are more than ready to drop their plowshares, pull their trusty Pennsylvania Musket Rifle off the fireplace mantle and storm out the door with a dream of throwing out the current government by way of a revolution.  You want to talk about rhetoric? How about the posts of people screaming that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta &quot;admitted that the US is under NATO control&quot; when in fact that is patently not true? Or the countless posts using terms that are incorrect like &quot;media blackout&quot; or &quot;banned from TV&quot; or the countless other posts that do nothing but fire up the crazies into thinking that big brother is out to get them? You want to talk about rhetoric? <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is rife with it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Have you heard of the saying, &quot;Im rubber and you&#39;re glue. Whatever you say bounces off of me and sticks to you,&quot;?

<p>And you still make no effort to defend the petty &quot;jingoistic&quot; attacks from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello, r/conspiracy.  Especially you, dusty!</p>

<p>Graped_in_the_mouth here.  Some of you, I imagine, know me, as a member of the r/conspiratard community, a skeptic, pro-science/vaccination activist, and frequent poster to this subreddit before being banned (for criticizing Nazis.)  This is my second account, and the first time I have made a post on an account that wasn&#39;t my primary.  It should be pretty clear that I am who I say - I have a pretty distinctive writing style, and I imagine some of you should have no trouble recognizing it.  </p>

<p>As you can see, this account was created today - a necessary step, as my primary account was banned, and I imagine this one will be as well, soon.</p>

<p>The comments replying to this are absolutely insane, largely because you, members of r/conspiracy, have followed in Dusty&#39;s footsteps in judging a group of thousands based on the words of three.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right - three individuals.  There are ONLY three people whose posts have been linked by Dusty (aka Ghibmm, aka Krugmanisapuppet, etc).  If someone took the time to link the worst of what <em>he&#39;s</em> posted, I assure you, there wouldn&#39;t be a very wide gap.</p>

<p>Who you think JCM, GhostofTzvika, and Einsteimer are, that&#39;s up to you.  I can&#39;t tell you what to believe, particularly because their support of Israel is where my views diverge from theirs...but they are complicated people, and while they&#39;ve made a number of sick jokes at times, none of them are the sub-human monsters you&#39;ve judged them to be based on Dusty&#39;s testimony and obsessive stalking.  </p>

<p>R/conspiratard is not, and has never been an organized downvote brigade.  If individual members choose to game votes, that&#39;s on them, but the rules are clearly stated in the sidebar.  </p>

<p>R/nolibs, on the other hand, is.  They stalk JCM religiously, following his every post.  Krugmanisapuppet is, for lack of a better word, obsessed with him (and everyone who has ever associated with him), and has a habit of taking everyone he disagrees with, and throwing them on a &quot;shill list&quot;, which he then later refers to as proof of its own validity - a textbook example of circular citations.  </p>

<p>Say what you want, but this assumption that everyone on r/conspiratard is a Zionist, a supremacist, a government shill, or an all-around evil human being is based on a handful of posts by a handful of users - far from a sufficient sample size for you to make such a judgment without displaying your own confirmation bias and prejudice.</p>

<p>You can pretend that we&#39;re the trolls, you can pretend that we&#39;re the monsters, but if this is what you have - a few jokes in bad taste from THREE users - then you&#39;re on very shaky ground.  Our forum, on the other hand, has <em>dozens</em> of pro-Nazi, pro-Hitler, Jew-bashing posts from MORE than a small handful (over a dozen) users, whose posts are frequently voted into the double digits right here, by your community.  That means more people are clicking that little &quot;up&quot; button than down.  That would be a <strong>Majority</strong> of your voting clique.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the posts quoted of distasteful songs, and hateful rhetoric that Dusty has provided, are all in the negatives, or on VERY tiny subreddits - certainly nothing like <em>75,000</em> who could be upvoting.  </p>

<p>Take this as you will.  Believe what you will.  But don&#39;t let yourselves be fooled into believing that r/conspiracy is full of love, and r/conspiratard full of hate, because Dusty linked you a handful of old posts from a handful of users.  We can show you this hate repeated tenfold in your own community, by a larger number of users, many of whom have posted in this very thread, pretending to have the moral high ground.  Guys like PrimaryPerception, who has argued that the Jews&#39; history of persecution is proof that they deserved it; people like No1113 who <em>actually</em> suggested that a second Holocaust was in order, and that genocide of all Jews was justified.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re more than welcome to judge our community based on these few posts - because we&#39;ve been judging you, too, with a much larger sample size.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;ll confirm what you&#39;ve all heard: we do have an agenda.  The agenda is to expose the hypocrisy, bigotry, irrationality, and outright hatred that have become rampant on this subreddit over the recent months.  </p>

<p>This is why we cross-post, to highlight this hatred.  This is why we mock you, when you say we&#39;re all &quot;paid shills&quot;, without even the TINIEST shred of evidence (your unsourced list doesn&#39;t count, Dusty!)  This is why we come here to demand evidence for unsupported, irrational claims.  This is why we debate.  </p>

<p>Because we want to see the truth prevail, over the rumors.  To see reason outshine hatred.  THAT&#39;S the prevailing mindset of the people I&#39;ve met at r/conspiracy...and those of you who refuse to see that, simply aren&#39;t looking in the right places.  </p>

<p>Thanks for reading.  </p>

<p>Irrationally?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m of Jewish descent, so this shit hits home.  Hitler - and all of his Nazi friends - didn&#39;t differentiate between &quot;Zionists&quot; and non-zionists.  He didn&#39;t go door-to-door asking Jewish people if they were active in their communities.  He just fucking rounded people up, based on <em>lists</em>.  Practicing or not, Zionist or not, you were lumped in as a &quot;Jew&quot;.  </p>

<p>This mindset is not dead.  One of No1113&#39;s posts made it clear that in his view, the eradication of <em>all</em> Jews was justified, because &quot;a majority&quot; were actively trying to enslave everyone on Earth.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t sit here and tell me that MY focus on Jewish related issues is unhealthy - it&#39;s the focus HERE, among a surprising portion of r/conspiracy, that&#39;s the problem.  Guys like PrimaryPerception, tttt0tttt, bumblingmumbling and Occidentalist post on r/conspiracy for almost no other reason than to blame Jews for one problem or another...and they <strong>get upvoted for doing it.</strong>  And <strong>I&#39;m</strong> the one with the &quot;irrational&quot; or &quot;perverse&quot; focus on Jewish issues?  Ridiculous.</p>

<p>Excuse me for not wanting to get sent to the gas chambers.  How irrational of me, to take an interest in combating violent rhetoric from people who, if they had their way, would probably execute me.  </p>

<p>This is what you don&#39;t get.  This is why there are so many people concerned with &quot;Jewish issues&quot; on r/conspiratard - because we&#39;re first on the chopping block if no one calls attention to these hateful bigots who have free reign on r/conspiracy to spread their hate speech.  We don&#39;t exactly ignore other forms of bigotry, either...but I don&#39;t see very many posts on this subreddit about how blacks, Asians or Hispanics are ruining and enslaving America, do you?  </p>

<p>People like this exist, and you have the nerve to criticize <strong>me</strong>?  To call <strong>us</strong> irrational, for trying to stem the spread of the hateful lies that flow from these people?  What a load of misleading, dishonest bullshit.  </p>

<p>Fuck you for pretending this is some obscure issue that has no bearing on me.  I&#39;ve seen what the sort of hate speech that gets praise here does when unchecked, and so I intend to combat it wherever I find it.  </p>

<p>Do you have a link to that? Because it said in the EC video that it was an edited version of this footage <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j8XN3iKLak">here</a> (I think), in which no explosions are seen or heard. And indeed it seems to match. Aside from that, the text on the side of the edited video only appears for a split second, which would be easy to miss.
