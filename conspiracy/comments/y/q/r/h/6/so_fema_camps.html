<p>That said, Area 51 has been one of the most top-secret highly classified areas in the USA for <em>decades</em>, and we still have pictures, both satellite and from people on the perimeters. Why are we seemingly unable to get any pictures from FEMA camps? You&#39;re insane if you think other countries don&#39;t have similar espionage capabilities as the USA, yet I&#39;ve never seen evidence of the FEMA camps outside of Conspiracy circles such as Jesse Ventura&#39;s show. </p>

<p>If these exist, and are as bad as we think they are, why do we have no real proof they exist? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2006, Halliburton got a multimillion dollar no-bid contract from the US govt to construct detention facilities and improve existing detention facilities for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They aren&#39;t FEMA camps, they are ICE camps for illegal immigrants. They new that AZ was going to pass laws that are harsh on illegals, other states will follow suit, and they estimated how many people that would require detaining and realized they were woefully under-accommodating as far as having the facilities to house that many illegals before sending them back to their home countries. SO, what many people think are FEMA camps built for Marshal Law are really ICE camps for illegal immigrants. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems far too high of an estimate. Supposedly there are 800 camps. I don&#39;t know exact figures, but assuming 10k in each that is 8 million. Do we really think 8 millions illegal immigrants are going to cross the border before we have time to send the rest of them home? I&#39;d think if it were that large of a number, we&#39;d have put far more money into building a fence....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>William Lewis is the guy in the Ventura show whom it is claimed of him that he&#39;s identified 800 sites. Buuuut you have to buy a movie to find out anything more specific, it seems. However in the show, the cops that come and chase Ventura&#39;s stooge off say some telling things. It lends it more mystique, at least. </p>

<p>There is also a defense contractors&#39; bid for services and supplies, which is usually offered as more possible proof. </p>

<p>Ultimately, it shouldn&#39;t be surprising that they&#39;re not to be found on google earth, or whatever. </p>

<p>What would truly be worth it to settle the debate wholly, is to have reddit send a group out to physically visit some suspected sites. This should be the logical next step. </p>

<p>Defense contractor bids. Ok. This I could get into. Links? I&#39;ve heard of these, but again never seen proof. </p>

<p>Not on Google Earth I get. But what about China? Russia? They&#39;re superpowers and at least China would (appear to) want to see the US fall. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, he wants money, that&#39;s what I was saying.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/01/new_nationwide_fema_camps_should_raise_eyebrows.html">bid link.</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much chinese and russian media you see, besides the obvious RT and such, but I&#39;ve rarely seen those superpowers offering up american military secrets so boldly anytime recently. Europe began, I&#39;ve read, to cause a stink about HAARP technology until we let them in on it, which is all they&#39;d have really wanted. Certainly, having the threat to &#39;leak&#39; photos of them would be a playing card in someone&#39;s hand. I don&#39;t want to speculate too much. I&#39;ve seen all the vids, read all the lit. I&#39;m ready to just go and look and the damn things if they&#39;re there. So, I guess that makes two of us.</p>

<p>you also might want to have a look at <a href="http://www.libertyforlife.com/jail-police/concentration_camp_army_regulation_21035.htm">this</a>, passed secretly in &#39;86, later quietly declassified by clinton in 97. tl;dr it basically outlines army coordination of civilian prisoner labor camps administrated by the prison system, supported by the civilian courts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some conspiracy theories are exactly that: theories. I&#39;m willing to lower the bar for &quot;evidence&quot; based on the fact that our government hides things (so do private corporations) and ... you know... LIES.</p>

<p>But the fact that no one has actually seen these camps. None of the workers have ever come forward as a whistleblower? No anecdotal evidence? Nobody saw anything?</p>

<p>It means I don&#39;t have to believe it. Besides, there are plenty of other theories to keep me occupied.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should say that there are some references to underground cities that I do believe in. This isn&#39;t really related to the FEMA concentration camps, but they pop up at the same time. I have no trouble believing that the Denver airport has an underground base. And the literature does sometimes make references to plans for a controlled nuclear war, moving into these underground cities, and the elite emerging as overlords (see Dolores Cannon, Conversations with Nostrodamus, Volumes 1 through 3).</p>

<p>In case you haven&#39;t noticed, they never give exact coordinates. If Jesse Ventura had given exact coordinates to where the camps he went to are, and they were blurred or otherwise obscured in GMaps, that would provide evidence that at least -something- was happening. </p>

Why not just move the &#39;low security&#39; peons to a fenced in fairground and put the higher level people in the existing Max and SuperMax prisons?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t it in the realm of possibility that these camps don&#39;t show up on google earth or any other gps program because the data has been deleted? Or something to that affect. With things like trapwire and Stellar Wind, it wouldn&#39;t be hard to create a program that overlays the camp sites with something like empty land or homes. Pure speculation but worth stating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of where I&#39;m leaning. I mean, seriously. There wasn&#39;t some huge buildup of German CC&#39;s. They kinda sprang up by re-purposing and fencing in areas. Obviously the newer high tech detainment stuff would take a bit longer to put together, but why build a giant, expensive max security prison for someone like me that couldn&#39;t fight my way out of a spiderweb? Why not just move the &#39;low security&#39; peons to a fenced in fairground and put the higher level people in the existing Max and SuperMax prisons?</p>
