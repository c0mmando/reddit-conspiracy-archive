       Allegedly these exist. Sure, I can see it. I agree that we're on a path to Totalitarianism. I don't doubt in the least that it's coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, Area 51 has been one of the most top-secret highly classified areas in the USA for
       <em>
        decades
       </em>
       , and we still have pictures, both satellite and from people on the perimeters. Why are we seemingly unable to get any pictures from FEMA camps? You're insane if you think other countries don't have similar espionage capabilities as the USA, yet I've never seen evidence of the FEMA camps outside of Conspiracy circles such as Jesse Ventura's show.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these exist, and are as bad as we think they are, why do we have no real proof they exist?

       In 2006, Halliburton got a multimillion dollar no-bid contract from the US govt to construct detention facilities and improve existing detention facilities for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They aren't FEMA camps, they are ICE camps for illegal immigrants. They new that AZ was going to pass laws that are harsh on illegals, other states will follow suit, and they estimated how many people that would require detaining and realized they were woefully under-accommodating as far as having the facilities to house that many illegals before sending them back to their home countries. SO, what many people think are FEMA camps built for Marshal Law are really ICE camps for illegal immigrants.

       This seems far too high of an estimate. Supposedly there are 800 camps. I don't know exact figures, but assuming 10k in each that is 8 million. Do we really think 8 millions illegal immigrants are going to cross the border before we have time to send the rest of them home? I'd think if it were that large of a number, we'd have put far more money into building a fence....

       I thought it was too high a number too but i've seen estimates of 15 million or more. now, to fill up those detention centers, they are counting on an unrealistic success rate, i think.

       William Lewis is the guy in the Ventura show whom it is claimed of him that he's identified 800 sites. Buuuut you have to buy a movie to find out anything more specific, it seems. However in the show, the cops that come and chase Ventura's stooge off say some telling things. It lends it more mystique, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a defense contractors' bid for services and supplies, which is usually offered as more possible proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, it shouldn't be surprising that they're not to be found on google earth, or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would truly be worth it to settle the debate wholly, is to have reddit send a group out to physically visit some suspected sites. This should be the logical next step.

       William Lewis wants money. Slightly controversial viewpoint followed by 'so buy the video'. Having 'thugs' chase off 'truthseekers' is right to the heart of conspiracy buffs "shut up and take my money!" Anything this big being monetized screams fake to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Defense contractor bids. Ok. This I could get into. Links? I've heard of these, but again never seen proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not on Google Earth I get. But what about China? Russia? They're superpowers and at least China would (appear to) want to see the US fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit group? I can't even get 50 people to show up to a barbecue with free beer in a metro of a few hundred thousand. I'd like to see, more specifically be a part of it, but how likely is it?

       I don't know how much chinese and russian media you see, besides the obvious RT and such, but I've rarely seen those superpowers offering up american military secrets so boldly anytime recently. Europe began, I've read, to cause a stink about HAARP technology until we let them in on it, which is all they'd have really wanted. Certainly, having the threat to 'leak' photos of them would be a playing card in someone's hand. I don't want to speculate too much. I've seen all the vids, read all the lit. I'm ready to just go and look and the damn things if they're there. So, I guess that makes two of us.

       , passed secretly in '86, later quietly declassified by clinton in 97. tl;dr it basically outlines army coordination of civilian prisoner labor camps administrated by the prison system, supported by the civilian courts.

       Some conspiracy theories are exactly that: theories. I'm willing to lower the bar for "evidence" based on the fact that our government hides things (so do private corporations) and ... you know... LIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact that no one has actually seen these camps. None of the workers have ever come forward as a whistleblower? No anecdotal evidence? Nobody saw anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       It means I don't have to believe it. Besides, there are plenty of other theories to keep me occupied.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I should say that there are some references to underground cities that I do believe in. This isn't really related to the FEMA concentration camps, but they pop up at the same time. I have no trouble believing that the Denver airport has an underground base. And the literature does sometimes make references to plans for a controlled nuclear war, moving into these underground cities, and the elite emerging as overlords (see Dolores Cannon, Conversations with Nostrodamus, Volumes 1 through 3).

       Gladly. Give me the coordinates. I'll go check it out.

      <p>
       In case you haven't noticed, they never give exact coordinates. If Jesse Ventura had given exact coordinates to where the camps he went to are, and they were blurred or otherwise obscured in GMaps, that would provide evidence that at least -something- was happening.

       Unless the camps are really Walmart stores.

       Think about it. They are big enough to hold hundreds if not thousands of people. They are everywhere already. Just put the people in and lock the doors and force them to buy their own food while inside.

       I'm just throwing it put there that someone on the web put pins over Google Maps to show the FEMA camp locations. I live in SF and looked around California spots because I've been along the Sierra Nevada before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure they're camps, but they do look like serious lock down facilities. They also have railroad tracks running along side them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to shuttle large groups of people, train transport is the easiest method.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it when you find FEMA camps and their general locations.

       Because they don't exist? I would like to see information stating  that they exist in the textual form, if that is proven, then perhaps they are real. But I have yet to see a convincing article. Not to mention why have camps built premade when one could be constructed in hours?

       Perhaps.  It must be a "state" prison that has no inmates yet a full staff working.  It has been "empty" as it is being cleaned for the fresh load of citizens, oops I mean "inmates".

       This is kind of where I'm leaning. I mean, seriously. There wasn't some huge buildup of German CC's. They kinda sprang up by re-purposing and fencing in areas. Obviously the newer high tech detainment stuff would take a bit longer to put together, but why build a giant, expensive max security prison for someone like me that couldn't fight my way out of a spiderweb? Why not just move the 'low security' peons to a fenced in fairground and put the higher level people in the existing Max and SuperMax prisons?

       These camps do not "allegedly" exist.  Rather they "objectively" exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Florida, one can drive west on SR 528 and approximately 15 miles west of I-95 is a FEMA camp that is visible from the road.

       Isn't it in the realm of possibility that these camps don't show up on google earth or any other gps program because the data has been deleted? Or something to that affect. With things like trapwire and Stellar Wind, it wouldn't be hard to create a program that overlays the camp sites with something like empty land or homes. Pure speculation but worth stating.
