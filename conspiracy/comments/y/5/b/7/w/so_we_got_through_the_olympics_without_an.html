       For everybody who sees it as /s, there is at least 1 who sees it as real.

       In this case, it's cuz the general flavor of this /r/ is enough to suggest that many people

       seeing it as sarcasm, but rather a legitimate point that simply confirms their pre-existing worldview.

       It's because the Olympics never actually happened in London.  They were orchestrated and filmed in a old blimp hanger on an abandoned island in the Bikini Atoll.  If anyone tells you there WAS an Olympics in 2012, they are either still asleep or a disinformation agent.

       The only people whose fears seem to be escalated are the VERY few people who a) spend all their time looking for "hidden clues" in every commercial, cartoon and ad they see on TV, and b) the people so desperate to find validation for their paranoia that they actually buy into the crap that group a spouts.

       When the Guardian Newspaper writes an article about it, it can't happen. Imagine if the New York times wrote on Sept 9th "Government about to stage a false flag attack on WTC and Pentagon". You think it still would have happened?

       counter intelligence, If someone claims they know of an attack it is probably false information.  They do this to discredit the conspiracy theorist.  Example ; The Anarchist Cookbook,  Jolly Roger was a C.I.A agent giving bad recipes so potential terrorist would blow themselves up.  They are assassinating the character in a broad way of people worried about the new police state.  The Olympic Bombing conspiracy was probably invented and reported by our own goverment.

       NWO - Shit's getting real. Just because events weren't staged in grandiose fashion based on conspiracy theorists' predictions doesn't change anything.

       We need to keep talking this out in order to come up with solutions, not mocking who was right/wrong on predicted possible events.

       Yes, we must not get sidetracked by the lack of evidence, and the failure of that which is claimed to be evidence to accurately predict actions or behavior.  The absence of proof IS the truth.

       There will certainly be future attacks and more psychological attacks designed to sway public opinion. Atrocities happen daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you don't understand is that the truth is within you. It entertains all hypothesis. Maybe all the bullshit about the card game, the shows, the clip from 2012 disaster flick, was all compiled just to make anyone who would talked about it look looney tunes. Who's to say? Maybe that was their contingency plan? Maybe it was the plan all along?
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally know that shadow government exists and they could very well have planned a sophisticated attack years in the making, to be carried out the same way 9/11 was done. Maybe vigilant citizens or police somehow foiled their dastardly plot and subsequently got caught and murdered and/or bribed to keep their mouths shut? We know the MSM wouldn't say shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the thing about the truth and any grand plan. We can only speculate because we are not in their creepy cult for liars.

       There was no attack because of people like the brave truth-warriors on this subreddit. We uncovered the plot, piece by piece. All of the predictive programming, the subliminal attacks, the occult symbolism, the outright warnings... we dug it up. The truth movement is probably the most important movement happening on earth right now.

       When someone says "I'm coming over at 6," you're not
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       to say you know that it's going to happen. Now if you call them back and say "no, you can't come over," you've changed the outcome, but you weren't wrong about the initial assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is much the same situation. We received the advance notice and we changed the outcome. TPTB put an unprecedented number of clues out there. They basically said "this IS happening, and we're so certain that here's the playbook."
      </p>
      <p>
       What they didn't count on was the thousands upon thousands of truth-warriors out there, taking these declarations, and exposing them to the light. We took this information, we parsed it, found the black and white truth in it, then held it up for everyone to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       So were we wrong? Hell no!

       So because a bunch of people who nobody outside of their community respects or believes decided to claim the London Olympics were going to be attacked by super-powerful terrorists (evidenced in card games and CGI mascots), the super-powerful terrorists were so afraid of YouTube videos and posts on AboveTopSecret that they decided to call it off and not jump-start the New World Order?

       Actually, it's more like you saying to me that "someone is coming over to your house to punch you."
      </p>
      <p>
       If it happens, then you were right to warn me of the punch plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it doesn't happen, you can claim that your knowledge of the punch plot prevented the punch from happening.
      </p>

        Or another way.

      <p>
       I can say that I have assembled a play by play plot of an attack based on the placement of the articles in tomorrows newspaper.
       <br/>
       It says in black and white that someone will dress up like a chicken and throw eggs at Mitt Romney.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it happens, I have decoded "their" language.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it doesn't, then my exposing the knowledge of the plan stopped them from doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        OR,
       </strong>
       there never was a plan to begin with, either to punch me or throw eggs at Romney.

       I am just wondering apart from spreading the word on the internet what practical and pragmatic steps did you take in the real world to prevent this catastrophe occuring?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I am asking is just because you knew and spread the word re. what was going to happen why did that stop them carrying it out? Surely it makes no difference to their plans if a group of 'truth-warriors' are aware of them? Wouldn't they just carry on with their plans anyway? As you can see from the responses to your post most people deny their existence etc so why would a few people knowing about them be enough to make them stop?
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly happened to make them call it off?

       Have you read, by chance, Tim Clancy's Rainbow Six? Good book. That said, you're all nuts. MAYBE it happened. Yes, and MAYBE the Olympics didn't happen, and it was faked. MAYBE cats are actually aliens from the Moon, sent to watch us. How do you explain their eyes?! MAYBE, well, you get it, I hope.

       Yes, we must not get sidetracked by the lack of evidence, and the failure of that which is claimed to be evidence to accurately predict actions or behavior.  The absence of proof IS the truth.
