        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-08-13 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/CarlSagansHaircut.html">CarlSagansHaircut</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I absolutely expect this to be completely buried but, it&#39;s something that has been on my mind for the past 1+ years of my stay on Reddit. First and foremost, Reddit is completely partisan and leans heavily to the left so, really, I don&#39;t see much coming from the &quot;right&quot; here on Reddit. I&#39;m not quite sure that&#39;s because there just AREN&#39;T any &quot;right&quot; leaning posts or if the &quot;left&quot; leaning Reddit following buries them all. Doesn&#39;t really matter, to be honest, because the point I&#39;m going to try and make will be just as proven one way as the other. </p>

<p>A lot of this stems from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. It&#39;s all the same old bullshit. Posters HAVE to qualify in the headline of their post whether someone or something is D or R. For example, if someone wants to post a story about something they&#39;ve learned where, say, some small town politician did something they deemed &quot;good&quot;, they&#39;ll make sure you know it was a D. Negative? Throw an R on it. This goes vice versa as well. </p>

<p>This is just a strong indication of the partisanship going on in this country. People feel as if they have no choice but to tow their party line and accept whatever bad comes with the good because they don&#39;t look at themselves as voters, but D&#39;s and R&#39;s. I&#39;m not sure if this comes from some deep seeded urge to be a part of something, or they actually believe in the system at work. Obviously, the system doesn&#39;t work. It never has. But at what point did everything fall apart? When did this animalistic urge show it&#39;s ugly face? </p>

<p>The only people, I believe, that are worse than your lemming-like &quot;voters&quot; that hang onto every word their fearless leaders spew are the ones that KNOW the 2 party system, politics in general and the economy are not fixable and have been in a state of failure for decades and STILL feel a need to vote for one side or the other. Or vote at all. </p>

<p>This kind of hive mentality is rampant on this site, and I&#39;m worried that this kind of behavior is the rule, not the exception. </p>

<p>Sometimes I read through the comments and I just have to shake my head in awe. There&#39;s no way these people hold these kinds of opinions and believe them, right? Or is it really THAT bad and there&#39;s really no hope? People CAN&#39;T look down their noses at you and spew some vitriolic bullshit he or she heard Olberman/O&#39;Reilly/Maddow say and think they&#39;re part of the solution, right? </p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine what more proof they need that the system is set up to bind and torture. To dumb you down and distract you to the point where all you can do is argue R&#39;s and D&#39;s. Daily we are seeing some abhorrent and disgusting things going on. On a daily basis we are spoonfed lies and distractions, yet the zombie masses will still litter Reddit with their regurgitated opinions, chasing red herrings and not see exactly what the fuck is going on. </p>

<p>How can some patchouli stink hipster Obama supporter look me in the eyes and tell me, with clarity, that he still supports the president he &quot;supported&quot; in &#39;08 (&quot;supported&quot; because they supported the history they were making, like true altruistic cunts). How can Romney supporters do the same?</p>

<p>And why can intelligent discussion on these topics happen without finger pointing or saying &quot;Well, BUSH DID THIS&quot; or &quot;OBAMA DID THAT&quot;?</p>

<p>This upsets me and I&#39;m wondering what can be done? Will there need to be some collective movement where everyone awakens and says, &quot;That&#39;s it! I&#39;m done with this system&quot;? Or, probably more realistically, the rabbit hole gets deeper and deeper and those around us that still believe this system is the only way will continue to plunge its depths, forever blind to the corruption, but not giving a single fuck. </p>

<p>I mean, hey, Breaking Bad is on Netflix. I don&#39;t have time for politics unless I&#39;m voting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>reddit is filled with semi-clever folks who happen to be &quot;authoritarian follower&quot; type consumer personalities whether they realize it or not. </p>

<p>The subjective bias is a thick membrane that coats most people&#39;s minds and reddit is no exception. Look at the OP&#39;s rant about &quot;patchouli stink&quot; lefties. While attempting to make a point about the psychological malaise of authoritarian followers he cannot help but depict one sort of person as &quot;bad&quot; and stupid while he must most certainly be good and wise. </p>

<p>Even in the world of people who realize that conspiracy drives and shapes society many grab onto the conspiracies that can relate or &quot;resonate&quot; with while rejecting those that are too awful and dis-empowering to grasp. </p>

<p>Cointelpro abounds and even if you are willing to realize that conspiracy is at the heart of real power there is a maze of half-plausible limited hangouts and other pitfalls awaiting the seeker of truth. </p>

<p>Objectivity and persistence are the key. See all sides and weigh the facts against the wishful thinking. If you begin to take sides you are already lost in the maze.<br/>
The point is some people do not WANT to wake up as the truth means a deep sorrow will reside in your heart for the rest of your days. 
We all self-deceive for comfort and sanity, it is the way of the human. 
Long before anybody is in a position to WAKE UP anybody else one must truly, honestly let go of hope and comfort and without illusion KNOW THYSELF. 
Too many open minds are steered into roundabouts of certitude that  ensnare and truncate one&#39;s ability to see the true terror and horrible beauty of real human existence.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fucking hate the Obamabots.  They are a serious hindrance to progress.</p>

<p>Anyone with more than half a brain realizes that Obama, in many regards, is <em>worse</em> than GWB was.  Obama&#39;s main asset is that he lacks the speech impediments that his predecessor did.</p>

<p>So many &quot;boutique liberals&quot; care so much more about their fashion statement (being from the south is not fashionable) than about substance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This logic I understand.  Actually, every human being is an expert at using this type of thinking.  They are attempting to create a reality and project it onto another person.  In this case they seek to demonize a perceived enemy.  They hope to create the perception that you are not able to defend a position which you don&#39;t hold.  They keep their world very small and they win a lot, as far as they know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have got to come to terms with the fact that if the Government is to release the burden of dependance, the &quot;job creators&quot; need to provide the wages that people can prosper in the most menial of jobs.  The facts are that corporations seek lower wages for menial jobs and will not change this unless government forces it upon them.  </p>

<p>Corporations are not charitable, anything they do in charity is used as a marketing and public relations tool to make them seem charitable.  If they were at all charitable they would be running no profit and allowing the lowest wrung employees to survive in this economy.  But no one is getting these pay raises except the top, they do not need it, they are taking it with a sense of entitlement much greater than any welfare recipient.  We cannot vote them out of corporate offices so we must use the force of government to advocate for the poorest of the poor because we can vote a change in policy in government.</p>

You cannot say patchouli stinking Obama hipsters like they are worse than the gunpowder smelling neocon hipsters.  By doing so you are representing the problem. Do not blame anyone but the ones you agree with.  Do not allow the ones you agree with to fall into groupthink and start blaming the group you disagree with for causing the problems.

    <div class="md"><p>Uniting and collectivism isn&#39;t the answer I don&#39;t believe. I wish it would be but that&#39;s just not realistic. You see, it can&#39;t happen because the 2 party system has it set up to keep us (well, most of us) at ends. </p>

<p>The only thing I think that can spark the kind of emotion needed to get something done is something so drastic that rational people from both sides can agree that this can&#39;t go on any longer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would bet that right now, there are more people that are aware the L/R paradigm is false that ever before.  We are one intellectual movement away from shepherding the populous (sheep) from the wolves in the L/R into the correct pasture.  Sheep follow, we need leaders who are not wolves.  They do not even need to be from Harvard, they can just be people who are not predatory narcissists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is interesting, I think, is that <a href="http://i.imgur.com/pdcbE.png">this quote</a> does more than illustrate the triviality of our political discussions. By using the metaphor of a hinge, this quote displays that people engaging in this discussion to begin with, forget to ask a key question &#39;Why does this matter?&#39; and so, become trapped in a dichotomy that is irrelevant to the established purpose of the company.</p>

<p>In other words, it shows how people become limited by debating two sides of a coin within and referring to a specific entity</p>

<p>This begs the question &#39;What other hinges limit our political debate?&#39; And furthermore, why must we be constrained to speak within and about a given entity. Why are we not free to speak about the issues themselves outside of that dichtomy?</p>

<p>Relating it back to, and completely explaining this in reference to, the Chick-Fil-A situation, why are people incapable of discussing the issues themselves? Why must we be constrained to see how one company looks at these issues when we could, in reality, be examining how our own country feels about these issues. Personally I believe that enforcing one&#39;s beliefs on another violates natural freedom and this is exactly what repression of self-expression (homosexuality) does. By expressing oneself, a person does not even affect others insofar as transgressing their rights.</p>

<p>In essence, what I find fascinating is the way people enthrall themselves to one entity to discuss these issues. Much in the same way that our country&#39;s hinges, the entities which constrain our discussions, are our capitalistic economy and democratic government.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that either capitalism or democracy need to go; I&#39;m simply pointing out that the inability to make these decisions or even discuss their outcomes realistically is limiting.</p>

<p>We never have national, political discussions as to whether our nation should remain democratic or capitalistic. The idea seems as absurd as beginning to ask the political motives of Jack in the Box.</p>

<p>&#39;What? Jack in the Box? Why would we ever talk about them? We&#39;re talking about CHICK-FIL-A?&#39;</p>

<p>In reality, what you&#39;re discussing has nothing to do with Chick-Fil-A, it has to do with the moral and ethical implications of repressing someone&#39;s self-expression.</p>

<p>&#39;What? Socialism? Why would we ever discuss that? We&#39;re a capitalist democracy! And only within those guidelines may we discuss our own progress&#39;</p>

<p>In reality, what we&#39;re discussing isn&#39;t capitalism or democracy, it has to do with the best economic system and the most representative leaders. Why do we refuse to see these possibilities outside of the already established infrastructure?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t capitalism a hinge?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This logic I understand.  Actually, every human being is an expert at using this type of thinking.  They are attempting to create a reality and project it onto another person.  In this case they seek to demonize a perceived enemy.  They hope to create the perception that you are not able to defend a position which you don&#39;t hold.  They keep their world very small and they win a lot, as far as they know.</p>
