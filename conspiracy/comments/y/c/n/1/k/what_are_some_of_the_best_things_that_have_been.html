       For all of Wikileaks supposed "successes", no heads (of any significance) have rolled, and no real "shocking" info has been exposed. If wikileaks were legitimate, they would not be cultivating the cult of personality around Assange, and their leaks would have more significant impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at what wikileaks specifically isn't talking about, and you will know what the real game is here. Nothing about 9/11 false flags (Assange dismisses it specifically) and nothing about US/Israeli drug running or destabilizing Libya over Qaddafi's push to introduce a new gold backed international currency, nothing about the US/Israeli assassinations of top Iranian scientists against international law, etc. There is data supporting all of these facts, yet wikileaks is strangely bereft of any of this data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that if the US really wanted Assange, he'd already be in Gitmo, one of the secret torture prisons we so lovingly and illegally maintain around the world or dead of an "accident" as is SOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks is simply more theater for fools who are easily distracted and bereft of critical thinking skills. Downvote if you must (and I assume the J-brigade will attack now), but this is obvious to those with discernment and analytic skills.

       Once again, the argument is:  I don't see any things that I believe in on Wikileaks, therefore they must be wrong.

       Quit putting words in my mouth. I didn't say the rest of the world is sheep. I implied strongly that you are an unthinking idiot. Big difference that, but given your lack of critical thinking skills, I can see how you missed it.

       The reason Assange is still alive and why no one will touch him is because of the 'poison pill' he released into the wild - over a Gig of 256-bit encrypted data that's been freely downloaded and shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he dies, the key is released and the most damning stuff he has on everyone is released as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mutually assured destruction.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why there's all this theatre around him. Why they can imprison him but they'll never kill him. But at the same time, that's why he'll never release the key early, because as soon as he does, he's a dead man.

       You watch too much television. That little bit of drama was just for people like yourself. If he were truly untouchable thanks to his "insurance" file, he would not be arrested. He already threatened release of the file if he is arrested or if Wikileaks is taken down.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you believe Assange is the real deal and wikileaks is pure, then cool. I'm just personally not buying it and I am surprised that anyone with critical thinking skills still is at this point.

       He's trying to say that since Wikileaks hasn't released information on the shit he thinks is important, then they must be a CIA/MOSSAD disinformatoion operation.

       It's equally possible that very sensitive information has been passed to Wikileaks and they choose not to release it. Instead they pass along this info to the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would otherwise be known as a honey pot. Honey/honey/poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't prove anything either way, but judging by the lack of hard hitting info, with any real repercussions for Western governments I'd agree with OP and say the honey pot scenario is most likely.

       Has Wikileaks really exposed anything that we werent expecting? A few were borderline strange, like the one about Middle Eastern countries supporting human cloning - but generally most of it was stuff we could have suspected or was discussed by conspiracy theorists in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to that how the mighty US and UK cant catch this charismatic loner who manages to hide from them while still being able to star in a news program on RT. Plus he "suprises" everyone, even the UK government, by gaining asylum while in the Ecuadorian embassy (which he went to with all the press taking pictures of him and the police didnt bother to do anything about it).
      </p>
      <p>
       They keep claiming that they cant touch him because he threatening to release all the other files if they do, well what has he released that wasnt doubted before?
      </p>
      <p>
       This all looks like an inside job from some governmental agency, maybe its our CIA or the Mossad like someone suggested, but personally I think if the US and CIA wanted him dead he wouldnt have lived for this long. There's something strange about Wikileaks, I just hope im wrong.

       I don't agree with the killing, but comparing the leader of an Islamic militant group to a civilian like Assange is not appropriate.  These drone killings are official US policy now.  Killing civilians, even if they are political enemies, is not.
      </p>

       How about some proof of a civilian being taken out by the US govt?

       You simply asked for proof of killing someone for less.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Assange has done is far more detrimental to the US Govt. What he has done is punishable by death for an american citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the main issue, you ask for proof i could give you some and then you would just disregard it as you already have done. This is r/conspiracy friend my GOVT has done some sinister shit far beyond what we may ever be privy to, take that with a grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you dont think they would kill innocent civilians look at Japan in the 40's, Castle Bravo in the 50's and then tell me they wouldnt kill some random ass dude for divulging Secret classified material. If you cant just think on it, im not asking you to belive but percieve your own thoughts then maybe this isnt the subreddit for you.

       Fair enough, but your examples of Japanese casualties during war time and military personnel during nuclear testing don't fit into this conversation either.

       If you do come cross any civilian deaths rumored to be linked to the CIA, please link me.

       I actually just thought of one. Gerald Bull who was developing the Iraqi supergun.  His death was never officially linked to the US, but it isn't out of the question that the CIA was involved in some way at least while the Mossad did the dirty work.

       The reason Assange is still alive and why no one will touch him is because of the 'poison pill' he released into the wild - over a Gig of 256-bit encrypted data that's been freely downloaded and shared.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he dies, the key is released and the most damning stuff he has on everyone is released as well.

      <p>
       Mutually assured destruction.

       That's why there's all this theatre around him. Why they can imprison him but they'll never kill him. But at the same time, that's why he'll never release the key early, because as soon as he does, he's a dead man.

       Fair enough, but your examples of Japanese casualties during war time and military personnel during nuclear testing don't fit into this conversation either.

       If you do come cross any civilian deaths rumored to be linked to the CIA, please link me.
