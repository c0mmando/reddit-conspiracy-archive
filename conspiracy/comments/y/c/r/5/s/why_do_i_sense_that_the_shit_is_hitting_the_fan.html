<p>For those of you watching events a little too closely... Remember this:</p>

<p>History in the past has been <strong>way, way worse.</strong> Think WW2. Think Cuban missile crisis, think 1970 inflation and gasoline shortages.</p>

<p>If anything, the elite are worried about <em>their</em> shit hitting the fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly do you mean by shit hitting the fan?</p>

<p>The world is a large and complex place and crazy shit happens all the time on a small scale.  If you think that the end of the world as we know it is coming, you&#39;re probably wrong.  It&#39;s most likely just some paranoia creeping in.  </p>

<p>Back around 1997-98 I thought the same thing for a while where some events lined up perfectly and paranoia crept in.  I was ready to bug out and buy a cabin and leave the major population center I currently live in.  After a few days I realized I was being a dumbass and returned to my normal life and nothing worth worrying about ever happened.</p>

<p>Just relax man, the most likely outcome is that nothing major is going to happen.  Nothing that affects you much anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shit hitting the fan.... What is going to happen, is what already happened in 2008, and before that in 2000, and before that.. well you get the idea. The bubbles are getting bigger and popping faster. None of those bubbles have been resolved, they&#39;ve just been moved around to other assets. Now they&#39;re all sitting on the dollar, and there is no where left to shuffle them off to. Basically, the US dollar is doomed. By the numbers right now, even if no one is purposely trying to crash it, its crash is inevitable. There will be no balancing the budget, or paying off the &quot;debt&quot; the liabilities are in the 100&#39;s of trillions of dollars. It simply is not possible.</p>

<p>The last crash in 2008 happened in a matter of hours. The fed (like&#39;m or not) fired all of its ammo to stop it. They cant lower rates any further. And they cant just print another 200 trillion dollars and ignore the root of the problem like they did 4 years ago. They can keep trying the &quot;quantitive easings&quot; but sooner or later (sooner) that little magic pill is going to turn into poison and actually cause the next panic.</p>

<p>The 2012 crash, or 2013 crash or 2014 crash will happen, and it will happen in a matter of hours. And once it happens, there will be no stopping it and no saving the dollar.</p>

<p>After that? I give the country a week, 2 tops, before the shit really hits the fan. There will be no more social security, there will be no more medicare, no more unemployment, no more welfare, no more foodstamps - you name it. Your 401K, your bank balance? Gone. Because there will be no money. Then the riots will start. It will be like New Orleans, but it will be the whole country.</p>

<p>The foulbastard doesnt know if this is a planned conspiracy by the 1% to further consolidate their power completely (exactly what happened after 2008 crash, just count the number of independent financial institutions that exist now compared to then, they were all absorbed with bailout money).</p>

<p>All the foulbastard does know is that the next market panic is inevitable - and without any tools left in the box to stop it, and without anywhere else to move the bubble to, this is the last move of the game. Checkmate, its game over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True it was said about 2008, but 2008 did have the worst financial collapse in modern history (it was just plugged by the Fed and the traders who wanted the bubble to go a bit loner).  So as OP said in the post, things are falling apart, but it&#39;s also a matter of the measures taken by tptb in gauging when and how severe the updates become.<br/>
