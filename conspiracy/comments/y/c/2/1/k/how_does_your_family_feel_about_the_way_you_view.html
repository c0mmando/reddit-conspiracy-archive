However, since I&#39;ve become more vocal about my negative view of the government, he&#39;s been getting really worked up about it and arguing with me constantly. </p>

<p>Basically, he&#39;s just been bringing up the most typical and well-known conspiracy theories, like who was behind 9/11, etc. He attempts to &quot;prove me wrong&quot; by sending me links to articles backing the 9/11 commissioners reports and findings, and explaining that sometimes I just need to accept the facts and not look for things that aren&#39;t there. No matter how much counter-evidence I produce, he remains very stubborn...something we both have in common. </p>

<p>Has anyone dealt with friends/relatives behaving this way? I really feel a lot of genuine respect for my father and I want to find a way to handle these sorts of conversations and not get so frustrated. </p>

<p>If someone says something I don&#39;t agree with, but it&#39;s not the time and place to discuss it, I don&#39;t pop off and start arguing about it.</p>

<p>I also typically only discuss things I can actually provide research and thorough answers to any questions I might receive as well. I leave the &quot;What if&quot; scenario conspiracy theories to those who are like-minded.</p>

<p>Yes. Stay away from chem trails and depopulation and HAARP and Nibiru+planet X(whatever the hell it is, I don&#39;t know) <strong>especially reptilians</strong> around friends and family. 9/11 should also be avoided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 9-11 I did a lot of research because something didn&#39;t seem right. This led to the discovery of conspiracy theories like the Free Masons, and Illuminati. I was all excited to bring this info to my family and so at the next gathering I was discussing everything. This family gathering was at a Mason Lodge and I found out my uncle is very involved, of course he thinks it&#39;s all for a good cause. There were handouts he had there to join too, unfortunately I couldn&#39;t join his because I live in a different state. But, our relationship has gotten better since I told him I know there is more in plain view than we can see. I believe he feels the same way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot force anyone to believe something or to quit believing in something. Everyone needs to find their own truth. I have given up on most people - fuck &#39;em, their inability to think is why we are in the mess we are in. I will no longer push my views on anyone ... I will ask questions about the holes in their explanations, if a &quot;charged topic&quot; arises!</p>

<p>Try speaking with one who is highly religious. As an agnostic, these folks are rather uneasy around me; however, they are unsure of why. I should mention that I live in one of Canada&#39;s bible belts. <a href="http://inkandpaperguy.wordpress.com/2011/12/20/911-trauma-and-denial-why-people-resist-the-truth/">There is a growing group of mental health experts who are realizing that some people are mentally &quot;stuck&quot; and unable to process the information</a> that has rocked the paradigms of their world. These folks will attack if you offer to unlock their cage.</p>

<p>PS: My own conspiratorial beliefs are centred around financial and political issues. I am not convinced about lizard people, aliens, David Icke, UFOs, or the illuminati. The outrageous claims have a much higher burden of proof than believing in a conspiracy regarding something in the realm of a political scandal.</p>
