       My father and I are generally very close, and agree on many different topics. However, since I've become more vocal about my negative view of the government, he's been getting really worked up about it and arguing with me constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, he's just been bringing up the most typical and well-known conspiracy theories, like who was behind 9/11, etc. He attempts to "prove me wrong" by sending me links to articles backing the 9/11 commissioners reports and findings, and explaining that sometimes I just need to accept the facts and not look for things that aren't there. No matter how much counter-evidence I produce, he remains very stubborn...something we both have in common.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone dealt with friends/relatives behaving this way? I really feel a lot of genuine respect for my father and I want to find a way to handle these sorts of conversations and not get so frustrated.

       The more entrenched someones life is into a false world view the more resistance you are going to receive from them.  I was able to corner my own mother at one point that she "didn't care" if WTC7 was blown up because no one was hurt.  This shows the desperation of a mind dealing with fundamental world view level cognitive dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't care how they feel about it,'feelings' are just an excuse to avoid the truth.  I just pick and choose my battles with them and wake them up bit by bit where I know I can.

       They listen but don't hear I guess you could say. I mostly get chuckles and "uh huh" but the worst is some good friends of mine who have the "well there's nothing I can do about it so who cares" attitude.

       Family is very supportive, partially because I don't jam information down their throats constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone says something I don't agree with, but it's not the time and place to discuss it, I don't pop off and start arguing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also typically only discuss things I can actually provide research and thorough answers to any questions I might receive as well. I leave the "What if" scenario conspiracy theories to those who are like-minded.

       Yes. Stay away from chem trails and depopulation and HAARP and Nibiru+planet X(whatever the hell it is, I don't know)

       After 9-11 I did a lot of research because something didn't seem right. This led to the discovery of conspiracy theories like the Free Masons, and Illuminati. I was all excited to bring this info to my family and so at the next gathering I was discussing everything. This family gathering was at a Mason Lodge and I found out my uncle is very involved, of course he thinks it's all for a good cause. There were handouts he had there to join too, unfortunately I couldn't join his because I live in a different state. But, our relationship has gotten better since I told him I know there is more in plain view than we can see. I believe he feels the same way.

       It is sad that sometimes the people we care about the most, that we love and respect, have to be spared of some info or opinions for fear of sour discussions and disagreement. Specially when dealing with older people. No one likes to find out that things aren't as they believed their whole life, specially at a life stage when things like health and economic security can seem fragile.

       I find keeping my opinion to myself is the best road in many aspects. Sometimes I feel I'm too pessimistic towards the world after reading this forum for too long. I know I can't go back to sleep, but I wish I didn't constantly think in my head "what is the point of all of this? the lies, the wars, the money, the drugs, the world?"

       I try to keep to myself, but I feel like if i dont share my thoughts with anyone then noone will ever "wake up". If people are never told anything then they will never know. I talk to the people I love the most about everything I believe because I want to try and help them understand. But nonetheless I try not to cram my beliefs down there throats. But I feel very strongly.

       I broke my parents, i kept dropping infobombs on them and then just letting them work it out from there.  They watch CNN a lot and I said after the Aurora shooting, the day it happened, i said "hey they are going to start pushing gun bans very aggressively on the news", my mom was like "i doubt it" but then i was proven correct and she was like "how did you know that?" i said "because I know the agenda, i am not an idiot mother"

       I believe that truth is stranger than fiction, thats what I always tell my dad. I talk to my dad all the time about 9/11 and chemtrails, etc. and he doesnt believe a word I say. All he does is look at me like ive got 3 heads. Ever since ive expressed my views, I just feel very distant from my dad..My dad has a government job and he believes there just looking out for us. But I tell him otherwise..I cant give you much advice on how to deal with this type of situation,  but I can tell you that I feel your pain.

       You cannot force anyone to believe something or to quit believing in something. Everyone needs to find their own truth. I have given up on most people - fuck 'em, their inability to think is why we are in the mess we are in. I will no longer push my views on anyone ... I will ask questions about the holes in their explanations, if a "charged topic" arises!

       Try speaking with one who is highly religious. As an agnostic, these folks are rather uneasy around me; however, they are unsure of why. I should mention that I live in one of Canada's bible belts.

        There is a growing group of mental health experts who are realizing that some people are mentally "stuck" and unable to process the information

       that has rocked the paradigms of their world. These folks will attack if you offer to unlock their cage.

       PS: My own conspiratorial beliefs are centred around financial and political issues. I am not convinced about lizard people, aliens, David Icke, UFOs, or the illuminati. The outrageous claims have a much higher burden of proof than believing in a conspiracy regarding something in the realm of a political scandal.

       I stick to the simplest bedrock facts. The presence of melted molybdenum is a good example. Create the element of doubt by opening a crack that can't be closed. The next person pop talks to about the attacks might just board the 911 doubt train.
