<p>In the US</p>

<p>Our food does not give us nutrition. Look at the supermarkets where the masses get their food and the nutrition is not there.  Look at how many people are so over weight. Especially how it has become socially acceptable.  It is nothing but weakness, it is so strange.  I want people to notice how terribly these people age, the ones that go to the super markets that sell this food.</p>

<p>It has become acceptable to place mercury in our mouths despite the history of mercury use causing death.  </p>

<p>The people cannot watch the watchmen.  Look at how many secrets there are.  Why keep secrets from the people you serve?  </p>

<p>Does anyone think our education system should really be this terrible for how advanced the human race is?</p>

<p>Metal byproducts are in our water.</p>

<p>Flip flopping with vaccines.  Thimerosal was used in quantities of up to 50mug multiple times if you happened to be born at the wrong time.  Now its illegal in such quantities, but was any action taken? Was no one held accountable for the overdose of mercury? Damn it all.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t there a study recently done that literally proved that music is dumbing down?  </p>

<p>What is going on here...?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did I ever say nothing should be open? No? Okay then.</p>

<p>What I meant was with such things as weapons technology, troop movements, and maps of the Pentagon, there&#39;s no need for the average person to need to know about them, and keeping them secret prevents the enemy from learning about them. If I may clarify my earlier statement, secrecy is important <strong><em>when used wisely</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I agree with your quote, we should be able to have frank and open discussions with our government about various matters and the government should not feel afraid to reveal their reasoning behind their policy. The government should feel pressured to create reasonable policy that helps the people, not lobbyists with large checks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the clarification. I wasn&#39;t trying to be a dick but your first statement sounded a bit sinister.  </p>

<p>As well, I was not implying that the transparency is cut-and-dry in the context of government.  However even the slightest amount of secrecy lends itself towards more secrecy and so on.  When I was a child and stole cookies out of the cookie jar without my mother knowing, I became emboldened even more daring taking twice the amount next time.  </p>

<p>Once a government operates freely behind closed doors, only bad things can come of it.  Even secrecy used wisely is dangerous.  For example, it would be wise/logical for the gov. to conceal the names of agents working in foreign territory.  But the question then becomes, what are they doing there?  But that question cannot be entertained, because the gov. already deemed the situation a secret. </p>

<p>I have always thought that if we cannot, as a country, operate in the open, what is the merit in operating at all.  </p>

<p>edit:  I am far too much of an idealist for these types of discussions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s quite a dilemma. How can you know if secrets need to be secret if you can&#39;t know what the secret is?</p>

<p>There are supposedly agencies in place who evaluate the level of secrecy needed for various secret documents, but their actions are secret, so we go right back to the first question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its funny/sad I was thinking the exact same thing this morning going into work. I almost feel like we&#39;re becoming cattle and we are doing it to ourselves. Look at the television shows we are watching watch 30 seconds of commercials on TLC (the learning channel what bullshit is that). Look at the food we eat. People are becoming lazy sedentary sloth people (those motherfuckers from wall-e aren&#39;t that far off dude). Look at the US (not to pick on the US I just see it the most blatent there but look around it&#39;s everywhere) Romny trying to steal the election like it&#39;s no big deal. Bush did the same things 12 years ago on the DL and people were PISSED now Romney is doing it so obviously and noone is saying SHIT like it&#39;s the thing to do. Fucking people shooting up people every other day it seems we see a story about someone who just snapped and shoots up a temple a movie theater a convention a church and office building. And people wonder why I fear for my childrens safty...</p>

<p>One of the best drummers ever lives in our era/generation.</p>

<p>A guitarist who was put even in the same light as Jimmy Paige also belongs to our generation.</p>

<p>Electronic Dance Music might not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but it&#39;s certainly more complex than people give it credit for, it&#39;s just not an instrument.</p>

<p>Maybe a study that shows how bad the pop radio stations are? But you can blame the listener for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most appalling part to me has to be the food situation and that is globally, especially in western nations. The complete disregard for proper education on what is good food culture is disgusting. Look at just about any suggested meals and you&#39;ll find tons of carbohydrates everywhere. This in itself is not harmful, its a natural product of certain foodstuffs like potates/corn/rice/pasta/wheat etc. The problem lies in that the vast majority of people that take part of this food culture have no idea what this does to them. Combine it with fatty products and the carbohydrates bind the fat in your body, essentially creating a barrier that prevents your body from burning through the fat until it has burned through the CH. And CH are way tougher for your body to process than fat (im generalizing here there are bad/good fats too) so unless you live a very physically active life you end up gaining weight, steadily.</p>

<p>Then looking at stuff you buy at your grocery store just about everything is loaded with ch, and if you want low-ch products you&#39;ll have to fork out extra for it.</p>

<p>Then take something like LCHF which is a diet sort of that picks out all products with medium-high CH and uses high fat products instead in your meals. End result? A much much smoother blood-sugar level(s) which have helped many diabetics normalize completely and get off the medications, weight loss to a great degree since you don&#39;t have to burn CH and can instead work on the easier fat.</p>

<p>But this is a way of life they don&#39;t want. It&#39;s bad for business. It makes you a non-participant in the fast-food culture and the constant drive to chow down huge portions loaded with CH that will turn you into a sad fatigued sloth.</p>

<p>edit: Oh and the propaganda is in full swing against LCHF as well. Apparently it kills you with heart-attacks, turns your blood to acid and ruins your sexlife too! Oh and it doesn&#39;t help diabetics, that&#39;s just them imagining things. Sigh.</p>
