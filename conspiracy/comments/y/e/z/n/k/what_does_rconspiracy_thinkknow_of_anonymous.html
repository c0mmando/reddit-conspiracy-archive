    <div class="md"><p>I do know this, the general theme I seem to grasp from Redditors is that most people think Anon is still just script kiddies and DDoS&#39;ing random people. Not the case so much anymore.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be surprised just how much world news goes through YourAnonNews Twitter, and despite their sometimes hypocritical nature, I think Anon is on our side.</p>

<p>People who claim CIA really confuse me, just seems like those are the people who truthfully feel like <em>everyone</em> is out to get them, and at that point I don&#39;t get why they even have the internet, a cellphone, etc.</p>

<p>There is a difference between the collective people refer to as <em>Anonymous</em> and those who are apart of the idea and the &#39;movement&#39; of Anonymous. The hackers still believe in the idea, the movement of Anonymous, but those who are just &#39;foot soldiers&#39; for the idea, aren&#39;t necessarily also hackers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree; I think the thing people tend to overlook when thinking of &quot;Anonymous&quot; is that it is not necessarily an organized group of people. It is anyone on the internet who wishes to claim to be part of the hive mind that is &quot;Anonymous.&quot; It&#39;s directly related to the chans (specifically 4chan) as I&#39;m sure you already know, and if you look back to the pointless troll raids that took place on various websites such as habbo and the like; it&#39;s merely the participants who wish to involve themselves that make up &quot;Anonymous&quot;</p>

<p>Not discrediting the idea that government intelligence could have hijacked the idea to spread propaganda and catalyze their agenda; but for lack of a better way to put it, it&#39;s roots are &quot;pure.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe its roots are pure. I have no way to know that or anything else about those who claim to be Anonymous. As you point out, anyone on the Internet can claim to be a member of this headless organization. Its very anonymity renders its claims and pronouncements meaningless.

<p>Edit: I like how you framed the &quot;are they &lt;this&gt; or &lt;that&gt;&quot; and honestly, I think they&#39;re a bit of both.

    <div class="md"><p>Now that, no. I have no faith in them doing much of anything about corrupt bankers at all. The change in that arena is only going to come about through public education, awareness, and possibly a lot of action from &#39;higher up&#39; as well. Just tonight I found an organization that sprung up almost overnight in my country protesting the banks and their shady practices and exploitation of 100-year-old laws and such. And these guys... Well, these guys I can trust because they aren&#39;t protesting behind masks, they&#39;re not kids (their chairman is mid-40s) and they&#39;re bringing real action and education to the local community. So far their protests are only like 30 people max but damn! So good to see people doing something about the <em>real</em> roots of so much of the poverty and corruption where I come from... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, don&#39;t worry, the media serves that purpose here too, and everywhere else. Part of the reason I&#39;ve always kind of liked what Anon are doing in terms of spreading news and information is for that same reason. i.e. they&#39;re not bound to any corporate entity or individual that &#39;owns&#39; them and tells them what they can, and canNOT say. I&#39;m also very much aware of how media functions in society than even most of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> - not trying to be immodest, but the reason I dropped out of my major in media studies was because the more I learnt about how journalism works... The less I wanted to be a journalist. And I really wanted to be a journalist. </p>
