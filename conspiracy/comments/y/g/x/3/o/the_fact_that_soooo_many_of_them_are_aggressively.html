<p>And they repeat that shit ad nauseum</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/shill/comments/yfaxi/in_my_opinion/">Here are 8 of them who were active on this yesterday alone</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Reasonable Suspicion / Reasonable Doubt.</p>

<p>They are determined to bury this at any cost, demanding that we prove Sorcha Faal&#39;s claim (even though they don&#39;t always necessarily phrase it in those exact words, they keep beating that dead horse).</p>

<p>The only thing that has to be demonstrated is the likelihood of him being a witness at LIBOR hearings.</p>

<p>If we mention that he worked at FICO, their shillery response is: &quot;thousands of people worked for FICO. what about all them?&quot;</p>

<p>If we mention that he&#39;s a programmer/software engineer, again: There are millions of those. what about them?</p>

<p>If we mention he&#39;s an expert in financial fraud, the list gets smaller, but: There are thousands of those. What about them?</p>

<p>If we mention that he&#39;s the author of a software which does financial predictive modeling, the list suddenly shrinks to a few dozen or less.</p>

<p>If we mention that he&#39;s also the author of software which detects financial fraud, the desperation sets in: But that&#39;s for credit cards, not for interest rate manipulation!</p>

<p>If we combine this all into one package and say he&#39;s all of those things... he suddenly becomes one of a tiny handful of people who could be considered an expert for the LIBOR case.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to connect Holmes or FICO to LIBOR - that would make him a <strong>suspect</strong>, not an expert <strong>witness</strong> in the area of <em>tracking financial fraud</em> - wholly relevant to the LIBOR scandal.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Don&#39;t let them bury information. Don&#39;t let them dissuade you from looking into information, just because &quot;Sorcha Faal&quot; said it or because &quot;it was on Alex Jones&#39; website&quot; - &quot;LOL&quot; &lt;-- this is how they <strong>prevent</strong> inquiry.</p>

<hr/>

<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7yZ_V0KYDw" title="And, because the temptation was too great, some of them helped us put this submission on our hot page. Currently at #2, at the time of this edit. +113/-43, net +70, despite them burying every comment I made. They still put this post -- all of ^ this ^ information -- at #2 on our hot page. They&#39;re not very smart."></a>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does Sorcha know this information and no one else does?  What other evidence is there to link Holmes&#39; father to Libor? If you eliminate Sorcha&#39;s claim based on her lack of credibility, what other information is there?</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m upvoting this because I would really like to see someone answer the question. If you eliminate Sorcha Faal&#39;s claim, What credible evidence is there that links Robert Holmes to the LIBOR testimony?  Is he on the list of people that are/ were scheduled to testify? I assume that list should be public knowledge. </p>

<p>If he was considered an expert, why wouldnt he STILL testify?  Just because his son became a homicidal maniac? If you are requested to testify, you cant just say &quot;no thanks, I dont want to&quot;</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">26</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/viscountprawn.html">viscountprawn</a> 2012-08-19</p>
    <div class="md"><p>There is no other evidence. OP&#39;s idea that Holmes has some relevance to a LIBOR hearing depends on a chain of very doubtful assumptions.</p>

<p>-First, that Holmes&#39;s work on software on credit card fraud and identity theft has some relevance to inter-bank lending and interest rate manipulation. FICO&#39;s website indicates that this software, Falcon Fraud Manager, tracks where credit card holders buy stuff and flags potentially fraudulent transactions. ( <a href="http://www.fico.com/en/products/dmapps/pages/fico-falcon-fraud-manager.aspx">http://www.fico.com/en/products/dmapps/pages/fico-falcon-fraud-manager.aspx</a> ) The OP claimed to have seen evidence that this software instead &quot;tracks the flow of money after it is issued&quot; or something similar, but refused to provide a source for this claim when challenged.</p>

<p>So maybe Holmes wrote some kind of other software that would be relevant to LIBOR, or maybe this software does something secret that&#39;s not listed on FICO&#39;s website? Maybe? This is all supposition.</p>

<p>-Second, assuming that there is some tangential link, that Holmes would be deposed for a LIBOR hearing. Aren&#39;t there people who have direct expertise in the issues surrounding LIBOR - interest rate manipulation and interbank trading - who would be more likely to be deposed in a hearing? Particularly in a criminal trial, an &quot;expert witness&quot; without direct expertise is likely to come under extremely intense scrutiny and be rapidly dismissed. </p>

<p>Holmes works for FICO, a company that does credit scoring for individuals in the United States. The OP is claiming that he would be a likely target for deposition in a case involving large financial institutions in a foreign country. Why? Because some sort of fraud was involved. This is a really tenuous connection and there would be hundreds of people more qualified to testify in such a trial.</p>

<p>So maybe there&#39;s some connection that we don&#39;t know about. Okay? Maybe possible?</p>

<p>-Third, that a hearing or trial even exists. As pointed out in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yf91m/james_holmes_father_was_not_going_to_testify_at/c5v0d15">this post by drunkenshrew</a>, there is no plan for a U.S. Senate hearing, and the hearing on LIBOR in the UK parliament doesn&#39;t list Holmes as a witness.</p>

<p>So maybe there&#39;s a secret hearing, or one whose details haven&#39;t been released, but the witnesses for which have already been identified?</p>

<p>Any one of these could be true on its own, but for this theory to make any sense they all have to be true at the same time. OP would have you believe that he&#39;s proven &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that Holmes was likely to be deposed as a witness for some sort of LIBOR hearing, but... well... judge for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there is nothing wrong with posting a THEORY about something. The problem is that fanatics in this subreddit take these theories and then - through the magic of the internet and hive-mind thinking - mutate them into being allegedly incontrovertible facts. </p>

<p>This subreddit exists to entertain me by displaying half-baked opinions usually formed from a complete lack of evidence. I enjoy reading the latest moon hoax or ancient Martian lifeform theory, then doing my own personal research to learn the actual reasons for something. In a way, these crazy concocted ideas encourage me to learn and grow as a human, and therefore I consider this subreddit required daily reading.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hm, I&#39;m trying to find a way to phrase this so it isn&#39;t condescending (it might come across that way but please keep in mind my intent is something different) but I think you might be engaging in some projection. For example, you seem to be equating discussion with agreement. While I&#39;ll see occasional fanatical posts I think people are generally good at pointing those out and also add in that some of these more &quot;radical&quot; things are people attempting to do some discrediting. Your perception seems to then support this idea that your better/smarter and people who think differently then you should just serve as your entertainment. I mean I like to find out the stories behind things too but I think your rationale for inquiry limits any chance for discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t speak for everyone here... but in order to find the truth to a situation facts need to be studied and ideas presented and absorbing them as gospel shouldn&#39;t happen until the information is, at the very least, coherrant.  Putting pieces of the puzzle together so that they make a picture that looks the way existed prior to the pieces being scattered is imperative.  Though I do believe that the shooting has some EXTREMELY suspect details omitted and absurd circumstances and direct questions that have not been answered truthfully this theory is one that needs ironing out.  Regardless of the person who presented the theory it has given some people motivation to try and establish validity and possibly uncover more details in the process.  You&#39;re being a skeptic to skeptics.  It&#39;s necessary.  It is that kind of discourse that creates plausibility or deniability.  The back and forth about 9/11 backed by witness accounts, expert information, and basic physics has solidified into something plausible.  This is an early stage conspiracy theory... naturally people come of as quacks early on because they tend away from the TRUE hive mind provided by news sources (and sometimes they are just quacks).  I think what is important is that they are noticing discrepancies with what they are being told, they want it fixed, and they know they can&#39;t count on it from the higher-ups.  If you want to &quot;grow as a human&quot; disregard the &quot;fanatics&quot; pick a side and provide the information necessary to disprove or prove as you feel inclined.  Viscount has done the service of using common sense to lay groundwork for possible research, but what we are lacking at the moment are verifiable facts pertaining to the situation.  Get on it fuckers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some conspiracy theorists are in it for the stimulating porn like aspect of conspiracies.  I must admit there is a part of me that enjoys it too.  The idea that there is something amiss is so much more appealing than trying to make sense of everything that makes no sense whatsoever.  One of the bad things about reddit is that content is often down voted because someone doesn&#39;t agree with you.  I usually downvote if someone is insulting and not contributing or aren&#39;t funny with their insults even if they aren&#39;t contributing.  But you can downvote for whatever reason you see fit.  Great thing about the interwebz.  You&#39;re still free to do somethings.  I think the best bet would be to get in with the locals and see what the hell they think happened.  I mean it&#39;s clear that JH is not himself.  Red hair aside he barely looks like the JH from previous pictures and videos.  It&#39;s almost like he&#39;s a new person.  That shit is just weird to me.  I know from working in the psych field that physical characteristics can change as a result of trauma.. but I&#39;ve never seen this applied to bone structure.  In the end I&#39;m not sure what was to gain from the whole of the incident.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m most curious about because the other pieces should fall together if there was something of substance to shoot for... no pun intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t answer the testimony question. <a href="http://deadlinelive.info/2012/07/26/breaking-colorado-massacre-linked-to-historic-bank-fraud-yes-and-this-also-follows-the-batman-rising-phoenix-plot-perfectly/">Here is a link to a report that is not based on Sorcha Faal</a> (who I hadn&#39;t even heard about until I started seeing all this). This just shows how he could&#39;ve been tied in and speculates based on information from his LinkedIn page. Apparently <a href="http://jamesholmeswiki.com/james-holmes-parents-robert/">there is a James Holmes Wiki and this has a page on his dad</a>. No mention of a pending testimony there either. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1600.htm">The Sorcha Faal article</a> is supposedly based on a Russian Ministry of Finance report (no explanation on how she received this) which says that Rober Holmes was scheduled to testify.</p>

<p>I have yet to see any credible evidence that a Senate Panel was subpoenaing witnesses or scheduling testimonies. So, I can&#39;t really elaborate on those final questions because it requires too much speculation without knowing whether or not there was this Senate Panel...where is this Russian Ministry Finance Report...etc...Someone else may have better information on that or it might just be a hoax.</p>

<p>As to your final point about the news I think you are expecting a little much out of today&#39;s journalism. While I don&#39;t think the entire news bureaucracy is conspiring there are plenty of examples of press releases being passed on wholesale, whether its politically related or not. Also, it may not be possible to get someone to speak out on the issue. If this conspiracy theory were true I&#39;d hardly expect Holmes or FICO to comment. </p>

<p>Also, consider that the 24-hour news networks particularly build off narratives. Its not like only 2 or 3 compelling stories exist at a time, but this is generally how their coverage works and this coverage trickles down to the ABC&#39;s and NBC&#39;s and CBS&#39;s etc...(print journalism is at even more of a disadvantage in my opinion). You have an event, that event spawns a few narratives, explore those for a bit, and thne move on to the next one. So the shooting has its narrative, but now that narrative has ended because it was the Olympics and now its the election cycle narrative. A lack of coverage could simply stem from the reporting has moved onto elsewhere.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to effectively kill a story. So, if you don&#39;t really have anyone talking and, as in this case, court documents are sealed there also really just isn&#39;t anything to report. So, the chance for developments to occur is minimized and naturally the story loses its momentum. </p>

<p>I did that merely to avoid someone making the standard <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> reply that mainstream media doesn&#39;t cover such stories because their globalist/ Zionist puppet masters wouldn&#39;t let them (or some equally ridiculous explanation). The reality seems more likely that mainstream isnt covering the suggestion that Robert Holmes was going to testify in the LIBOR hearing because there is no credible, verifiable evidence to suggest that. And most legitimate news agencies have a standard of ethics that they have to follow, while anyone with a blog can spout off whatever poorly-conceived theory they want without any thought to ethical standards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean ideally that&#39;s how it would go, and sometimes you have every part of a newsroom working in that direction but from a historical perspective its usually the opposite. Just starting at the early days of Yellow Journalism you had knowingly shoddy reporting. This hasn&#39;t improved much with the conglomeration of sources, either. So you have cases like the Iraq War. But I don&#39;t think the media has been able to serve as the Fifth Estate since the need for newsrooms to actually make profits and conglomeration.</p>

<p>How are the two events related? Holmes had been planning this attack long before the general public even knew what LIBOR was. This is utter nonsense and a HUGE jump to conclusions with absolutely no evidence to connect the two events. But say it in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and a flood of like-minded theorists will suddenly believe it all makes sense.</p>

<p>I understand where you&#39;re coming from, though. You read the Sorcha Faal article, you got excited. Everything finally tied together! Then you find out the article is a joke. Dammit! But your conformation bias starts tingling, and that feeling of blowing the lid off a huge conspiracy is just too alluring.

    <div class="md"><p>We know about Sorcha Faal, okay. That&#39;s old news.</p>

<p>He takes bits of fact, mixes them with unprovable claims, disseminates it as &quot;OMG The shit&#39;s hitting the fan now!&quot; </p>

<p>But, the key here is... he takes bits of fact.</p>

<p>The LIBOR witness theory is, at present, just a theory (a hypothesis, actually). A theory that hasn&#39;t been disproven except via &quot;Sorcha Faal. LOL. Herp derp.&quot;</p>

<p>And you&#39;re one of them presenting that argument (argument from ridicule).</p>

<p>The only witness list released was a <strong>tentative</strong> one, because there is not yet a senate panel selected for an investigation (all of the Sorcha Faal claims). The fact that he&#39;s not on a <em>tentative</em> witness list, for a <em>non-existent-but-potential</em> case, does <strong>not</strong> mean that he&#39;s irrelevant to the LIBOR investigation.</p>

<p>We, here in this subreddit, get accused of a lot of logical fallacies, but this one... this &quot;bury any references to Robert Holmes as a potential witness to bankster fraud&quot; is BULLSHIT. It&#39;s the most suspect act of gaming in this subreddit I&#39;ve seen since I joined 2 years ago. It&#39;s the hottest, most active, corruption of this community in my entire time here.</p>

<p>And, you&#39;re defending it. Why? What&#39;s your stake in this? Why do you care whether or not we speculate on possible theories and connections?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sorcha Faal said it, so you have to dismiss it as a default falsehood and never look at it again. EVAR.</p>

<p>Alex Jones said it and he&#39;s a Zionist shill. So, you must ignore every bit of news that comes from any of his websites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You aren&#39;t here investigating. You&#39;re here shouting &quot;DO NOT INVESTIGATE THIS LEAD. EVAR!&quot;</p>

<p>Did I summarize that pretty well, <a href="/u/HouseOfHouse">/u/HouseOfHouse</a>?</p>

<p>You really need to chill man, people can disagree with you, all you are doing is repeating this rumor over and over, the less intelligent someone is, the more likely they are to believe in superstition rather than facts and knowledge, ironically, those with very high intelligence are also prone to illogical conclusions as well, because they tend to rely on INTUITION too heavily. Im not sure where you fit into all this but you really need to look up trivium and quadrivium and the kybalion and reteach yourself how to intake information and reach conclusions, good luck, im going to leave you alone now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do sound a bit like a broken record.</p>

<p>I have no idea who this Sorcha Faal dude is, but that seems to be the only source of evidence you have, which certainly doesn&#39;t mean you are wrong, but still. One source of evidence makes you harder to believe. And you can use that to your advantage. Find other sources that can&#39;t be traced back to Faal. If people start claiming the exact same things about whatever source you have...then you may be onto something. Right now it could just be that the 9 or so people that you think are disinfo agents could just have a personal bias against Faal. But if they start saying the same things about any <em>new</em> evidence you bring up....then you can be suspicious, then you might be onto something. </p>

<p>But who are you to pick and choose what part is fact? Couldn&#39;t the &quot;fact&quot; part be &quot;yes he works at FICO&quot; and the unprovable claim be &quot;He was going to testify&quot;? Who are you to tell anyone they are wrong when you fail to even see the possibility that you, yourself, may be wrong?
These are honest questions I am asking here. I like Mulder in the sense I want to believe, but I need <em>real</em> info before I can.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that some of the people you listed may be actively trying to deny things, but you also need to account for the fact that some people may just be misinformed and not part of something bigger. This is the reason we need to post evidence for our claims. Those who are misinformed <em>cannot</em> be convinced by calling them &quot;shills&quot; or &quot;sheep&quot; or anything else, they can only be convinced by proof.</p>

<p>Plus, once you have amassed evidence of your claims, you can more easily point out those who are just denying things left and right since they will deny no matter what evidence you throw in their face. Someone that is just misinformed or is simply of a differing opinion will at least consider your argument and evidence.</p>

<p>one of the reasons why those posts get downvoted is because users living in other countries</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that you should say that. I observed my comment karma during the (US) overnight hours, and compared them to (US) daytime hours.</p>

<p>Daytime, my comment karma was going down... all day yesterday. I went down about 100 points yesterday total.</p>

<p>Woke up this morning and I had regained about 80 of those points.</p>

<p>So, the US was downvoting me during the day, and other countries were upvoting me during the night. I found that kind of interesting to observe.</p>

<p>Then, today, I lost another hundred <strong>in one hour</strong> this morning.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been holding steady at around 3200 all day today. Up until about an hour ago, every comment I got was receiving a downvote within one or two minutes. I&#39;m just monitoring. Despite what the detractors say (LOL you paranoid), I&#39;m confident there&#39;s some gaming of this subreddit going on -- on this specific topic.</p>

<p>Then, much to my surprise, just a little bit ago, someone (one of the &quot;skeptics&quot; who decided to participate) noticed <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/shill/comments/yfaxi/in_my_opinion/c5vm8aj?context=3">this</a>.</p>
