    <div class="md"><p>Basically, yes. People have very limited personal perception and rely on external information for everything else. This external information or disinformation shapes 99% of everyone&#39;s perception of reality. There isn&#39;t really anything that can be done to &#39;fix&#39; this, so it will continue as always. If anything technology is making it easier to manipulate information not harder. People may be becoming more aware that information can&#39;t be trusted but at the end of the day they have no choice - they have to trust something and inevitably they will trust the wrong things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[tl;dr: Shit has already hit the fan. We just don&#39;t realize it and will never realize it.]</p>

<p>it&#39;s more likely going to be more of the same, just worse.</p>

<p>2001 was over 10 years ago.</p>

<p>And the &quot;elites&quot; have been oppressing populations for thousands of years.</p>

<p>They&#39;re just getting better at it. They&#39;re far more organized, efficient, and purposeful than whatever is working against it.</p>

<p>What we have to look at is the sheer number of things that are going on at the same time. That a small part of it is coming apart at the seams (to us, it seems) means not that the system is failing. It probably means that they are approaching a sort of police state singularity (or fascist singularity). The rate of change in their realm is far greater than you realize (as you become aware of only the part of it that fails).</p>

<p>The general population is not concerned enough with bringing down the only system that they know. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to, psychologically.</p>

<p>The police state singularity is so in-your-face now that they need hide less and less. This makes it normal, expected, and ultimately accepted. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was part of the plan all along to condition a population to accept the reality that it wants. (And if most &#39;leaks&#39; are strategically-timed, conspiracies invented by the perpetrators, entities like Wikileaks a front for the CIA, etc. Apple and other corporations do the same thing. But somehow we don&#39;t believe our government is capable of it.)</p>

<p>Governments are not short-term thinkers like we are. They are long-term planners. In 25 years what do you think the world will look like given the current rate of the singularity?</p>

<p>The police state will be so normalized and so pervasive in society that you won&#39;t even know it&#39;s there. You&#39;ll always think that it&#39;s a possibility in the future if things continue to go the way they have been.</p>

<p>Proof: right now, you don&#39;t know it&#39;s there. All the things that seemed impossible or &#39;crazy&#39; before 2001 are a reality now. You&#39;ve <em>already</em> accepted this reality as the only one.</p>

<p>Our brains fool us into thinking that those things have 1) always been there; or 2) have a good reason to be there. A few years ago you could walk with your loved ones to the gate at the airport without fuss. Now people basically accept being sexually assaulted and harmfully radiated in order to get on a plane. Nevermind that your ticket is checked umpteen times. We could make a list of hundreds of these small changes that, when put together, are a significant change to society.</p>

<p>By the way, people have always been &quot;waking up&quot;. It does not mean that anything will change for the better, on the whole. The more people that wake up the less power you have to do something, because it takes a long time for people to wake up enough to affect real change.</p>

<p>Do you think 911 was an inside job? Do you think floating orbs created holograms to project the image of planes flying into the buildings to trick us all into believing it? Both are valid &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; that are posted in this subreddit. </p>

<p>What about the bombing of the moon? Do you think we did it to discover water or do you think we discovered a mysterious &quot;portal&quot; that shows that the moon is actually hollow?  (I&#39;ve also heard its just a hologram itself to trick us into believing...I dunno...something)</p>

<p>Why must &quot;they&quot; work in secret? If &quot;they&quot; are truly powerful enough to take control of the world, what is preventing &quot;them&quot; from doing so openly? If &quot;they&quot; are <em>not</em> that powerful, why should we fear &quot;them&quot;?</p>

<p>For more than a century ideological extremists at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon well-publicized incidents such as my encounter with Castro to attack the Rockefeller family for the inordinate influence they claim we wield over American political and economic institutions. <strong>Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as &#39;internationalists&#39; and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure--one world, if you will. If that&#39;s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.</strong> [emphasis mine]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;They&quot; are the international cabal of bankster families. <a href="/r/rothschild">The Rothschilds</a> being at the center of that cabal. The rest being the cousin families: Rockefeller, Morgan, De Beers, and the like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You forgot the rest of the quote, where he talks about you:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The anti-Rockefeller focus of these otherwise incompatible political positions owes much to Populism. <strong>&quot;Populists&quot; believe in conspiracies and one of the most enduring is that a secret group of international bankers and capitalists, and their minions, control the world&#39;s economy.</strong> Because of my name and prominence as head of the Chase for many years, I have earned the distinction of &quot;conspirator in chief&quot; from some of these people.</p>

<p>Populists and isolationists ignore the tangible benefits that have resulted in our active international role during the past half-century. Not only was the very real threat posed by Soviet Communism overcome, but there have been fundamental improvements in societies around the world, particularly in the United States, as a result of global trade, improved communications, and the heightened interaction of people from different cultures. Populists rarely mention these positive consequences, nor can they cogently explain how they would have sustained American economic growth and expansion of our political power without them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ask this: How is trying to build a worldwide and united political-economic structure intrinsically a bad thing (aside from the Christian belief that any such thing instituted by man is doomed to fail and is a harbinger of the Antichrist, the end times, etc.)? Assume said global structure is built in such a way as to minimize the usual excesses of government - would it still be intrinsically negative?</p>

<p>I <em>do</em> know that such a construct is woefully unlikely, and the kind of structure feared by the users of this subreddit - a massive, oppressive government focused on uplifting a small group while quashing everyone else - is more likely, isn&#39;t the way said structure behaves what is important? If the global structure is definitively benevolent, is its mere existence a bad thing?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is, have you ever considered the possibility that not all conspiracies are malevolent in nature?</p>

<p>Right, like I said - it&#39;s not the existence of a worldwide, united political structure in itself that is bad, it is the way it is structured that determines whether it is &#39;good&#39; or &#39;evil&#39;. A worldwide democratic structure with equal representation, rights, and opportunity would be &#39;good&#39;, while the authoritarian structure is - to most - &#39;evil&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes without saying that there is a plan (affected or not) in place to control and manage populations.</p>

<p>We need to get over the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; and replace it with &quot;plan&quot;. Most conspiracies are not evil. You probably conspired something in the past few hours.</p>

<p>Humans are altruistic by nature. It is hard for us to believe that another human being wants to do very bad things. But we fail to realize that our behaviour changes when we group with other humans.</p>

<p>10 generally good kids may act like ignorant fools when they are together. (I tend to avoid any grouping of 2 or more, myself.) Governments and corporations are no different.</p>

<p>That dynamic groups of people make plans to control the population even more than they already have is a given.</p>

<p>Modern governments and corporations are psychopathic by nature. When was the last time you heard of a government planning to lessen its control over people and let them govern themselves? To toss out laws that don&#39;t work? A corporation making plans for un-growth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are confusing the structure of the government/corporation with its actions. For example, the structure of the USA&#39;s government - a democracy - isn&#39;t psychopathic, as it is designed to put power into the hands of the people. However, the actions - the rampant corruption and insanity, the ever-increasing polarization of issues, etc. - are definitely psychopathic.</p>

<p>If humans are altruistic by nature, then it follows that most conspiracies - or plans - are altruistic by nature as well. The road to hell being paved with good intentions and all that. <em>Most</em> people who do evil things are not doing them for the sake of being evil - not everyone is the Joker. More often than not, someone who is decried as evil has good intent - wants to protect the people, wants to liberate the people, etc. - but goes about it in a way that isn&#39;t good.</p>

<p>Before you say that this is real life, not fiction, consider this: Fiction, good fiction, reflects life and places ordinary beings in extraordinary circumstances. What holds true for well-written villains - not inherently evil, but does evil things for reasons of good - also holds true for many people in the government. I don&#39;t believe that the people who try to restrict freedoms with legislation such as PIPA are doing it with the intent to restrict freedoms. For whatever reason, they truly and honestly believe that this is the single best course of action and anyone who opposes it is dangerous. That isn&#39;t correct, but emotion and belief are difficult to harness with logic.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe I&#39;m just an optimistic fool. It could very well be that I&#39;m wrong and people are intentionally trying to crush the masses. If so, why are they doing it in secret? If they have the power to take over the world, wouldn&#39;t it just be more effective and simpler to do it openly and strike fear into the hearts of the masses? If they&#39;re not powerful enough to openly take over, why should anyone fear them?</p>

<p>Interesting comparisons with comic book characters, there. One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the comics have gotten darker, and the characters more cruel, and less noble, in recent decades. Compare the television Batman, played by Adam West, which I grew up with, to the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; of today.</p>

<p>When &quot;heroes&quot; like today&#39;s Batman can be described as you just described the &quot;villains&quot; - &quot;does evil things for reasons of good&quot;, which I think is a fair characterization of the &quot;Dark Knight&quot;, how does this reflect upon modern society? What about those who <em>do</em> have more wealth than Batman will <em>ever</em> see, and <em>do</em> call the shots? Can you expect them to be as noble and just as the original caped crusader? They are also products of today&#39;s world, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US government is exactly that. It is not &quot;...designed to put power into the hands of the people,&quot; as you state but engaged in a persistent pathological lie to make people believe that it does just that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how many of us truly believe the US government is &quot;for the people and by the people&quot; but I think those numbers are dwindling.</p>

<p>The actions of government <em>is</em> the structure. It does not matter how it was designed hundreds of years ago. It does mean the structure is the same if the name stays the same.</p>

<p>My point is that the structure has changed to one that supports psychopathy. A host of psychopathy eventually becomes what consumes it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;They&quot; is a wide range of conspiring factions, and in this case there are several who would like to control information, especially since information can advance or hinder their various objectives.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;they&quot; being &quot;out to get me,&quot; this is not the case for most conspiracies.  They have their own motivations and goals and getting me usually isn&#39;t one of them.  If I get in their way however, become a real nuisance or something, this can change and they could indeed be out to get me.  Character assassination, framing, blackmail, incarceration, murder... they have many methods and tools for dealing with human obstacles. </p>

<p>Who &quot;they&quot; are is a question with many answers depending on who you ask, but it is a very well documented that most of recorded history is full of various conspiracies and there is nothing new which has eliminated people who plot in secrecy.  </p>

<p>It is inaccurate to make generalizations like &quot;they&quot; is one target to point the conspiracy finger at.  Similarly, &quot;All of you mention&quot; and &quot;do you guys really believe &#39;they&#39; are out to &#39;get&#39; you?&quot; is a pretty broad stroke when referring to 74,000+ people on r/conspiracy.  </p>

<p>You mention numerous factions, but don&#39;t name any of them. What are these factions?</p>

While I&#39;m not...exactly...going to dismiss anything I read, claims such as yours are going to be taken with a large grain of salt. So far, just skimming the titles of links here, there seems to be a lot of fear of the the nebulous &quot;they&quot; without any calls to action or posts about ways to avoid attracting &quot;their&quot; attention. &quot;They&quot; are doing this, &quot;they&quot; are doing that - who is &quot;they&quot;, and why do &quot;they&quot; care?</p>

<p>Many posts avoid blaming one of these factions for an action and simply use the blanket term &quot;they&quot;. Is there a reason for that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What claims did I make that aren&#39;t well known?  History and current events are full of conspiracies, you know, when people make plans to break the law or take advantage of others for their own gain, things like that.  Those are conspiracies.  Some are successes; the Contras eventually were able to topple the Sandinista government with the CIAs assistance,  many contemporary governments were the result of conspiracies against monarchs, bankers are now walking free after conspiring to falsify numbers, bet against bad investments they sold, launder money for drug lords, and many other crimes which result in penalties which are pennies on the dollar to the profits of these crimes.  </p>

<p>If you do not think there are any conspiracies, you would do well to pay more attention if you care enough about helping make a better world.</p>

<p>I will mention one contemporary group of conspirators, because you asked:  The Fellowship.  </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_(Christian_organization)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_(Christian_organization)</a></p>

<p>TL;DR - The Fellowship is a group of around 300 &quot;core members&quot; and 30,000 &quot;outer circle&quot; who are some of the most influential government, corporate, military, and religious leaders in the U.S. with some members abroad.</p>

<p>An example of just one of these 300 core members guys was Chuck Colson, who is recently deceased.  He worked for Nixon in dirty elections, with the lobbyists, controlling some of the press, falsifying documents, ordering burglaries and illegal surveillance of U.S. citizens, and all sorts of stuff.  Just before the his Watergate trial he was converted to Christianity by and joined &quot;The Fellowship.&quot; He got out of prison about 7 months into his sentence because his son was busted with a pound of weed with intent to sell and Colson was released for family problems.  </p>

<p>He quickly released a memoir &quot;Born Again&quot; which also soon becomes a Hollywood feature film and a comic book.  He also starts &quot;Prison Fellowship&quot; and &quot;Prison Fellowship International&quot; which became the largest prison ministry in the world in a matter of just a few years.  </p>

<p>Members of The Fellowship have had and currently have many involvements with foreign dictators, war criminals, and other geopolitical strongmen.  </p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<p>General Suharto of Indonesia </p>

<p>Siad Barre of Somalia</p>

<p>Charles Taylor of Liberia</p>

<p>Yoweri Museveni of Uganda</p>

<p>Going back to Chuck Colson&#39;s Prison Fellowship branch of all this, his ministry is often one of the first on the ground in some of these countries just before or just after coups and civil wars.  Like in Liberia when Taylor took control after a bloody civil war and actions which make him (on paper at least) worse than Joseph Kony; child soldiers controlled with drug addiction or threat of death and dismemberment, slave labor in mines, assassination and imprisonment of political opponents, etc.  Y&#39;know, all the sadly typical brutal african warlord shit we a told about.</p>

<p>Pat Robertson, another member of The Fellowship uses his public relations networks put the word out on 700 Club and other places that Charles Taylor is a good Christian man bringing peace to Africa and collects funds for his African charities in Liberia (and other places).  A pilot eventually snitches and says instead of flying food, medical supplies, etc. to Liberia, he has been flying mining equipment.  turned out Pat Robertson was a proud owner of a gold mine in this place with a horrible reputation for it&#39;s treatment of miners.  Most importantly to U.S. law, he was using his non profit ministry to make a profit off the gold mining.  An official investigation was done in Robertson&#39;s home state of Virginia and finds wrongdoing, but the case is closed because Virginia District Attorney, Mark Earley (also a member of The Fellowship), refused to prosecute.  It also must be noted that Robertson was Earley&#39;s largest campaign contributor during his political career.  </p>

<p>Bringing it back to Prison Fellowship, Mark Earley quit his job as D.A. to run for Governor (only after it was pointed out to him he had to quit to run), and he lost the election.  Out of a job, Chuck Colson steps down as CEO of Prison Fellowship and gives the job to Earley, where he makes beween 200k and 250k as.. well, pretty much a lobbyist for privatized prisons and various corporations.  It must also be noted Earley was previously a &quot;lock em up and leave em&quot; type when it came to criminal justice (his own quote), until Colson convinced him otherwise (y&#39;know, so he can more effectively appear to be in it to help prisoners).</p>

<p>I could probably write a book about Chuck Colson&#39;s Prison Fellowship, there is just so much information out there on the subject, but most people would only know Colson through media outlets partially or entirely operated by other members of The Fellowship.</p>

<p>What I have shared is a tip of the iceberg regarding just 1 person&#39;s &quot;conspiracy activities&quot; (and let me tell you, there is a much more I haven&#39;t the time to tell you, it&#39;s gotta be in a book some day).  This is 1 person out of 300 core members, with 30,000 outer circle members (Mark Earley would be an example of one of the outer circle) and these 30,300 (estimated members of a group which admits it&#39;s own secrecy), have multibillion dollar businesses and &quot;non profits,&quot; positions in government, law enforcement, justice, media, military, intelligence (two Prison Fellowship employees I know of; Ron Humphrey, ex CIA psychological warfare operative during the Vietnam war, imprisoned for feeding information to Vietnam intelligence after the war and now a senior writer for Prison Fellowship.  The other is Norwin Meneses who smuggled cocaine into the U.S. for decades with the knowledge of law enforcement, but someone told them to leave him alone.  It is suspected some of the profits of these sales were used to assist the Contras in Nicaragua during the 1980&#39;s)</p>

<p>Now, consider this is all 1 person&#39;s part of a larger group of secretive individuals, all coming together only to help each other out when necessary but generally operating autonomously.  NOW, consider this is only 1 example of an organized conspiracy.  There are others, and even these groups of conspirators are willing to work with other groups of conspirators when they find they can work together.  </p>

<p>If you want me to cite sources, first see if you can look up some of these names on Google yourself.  It is much more interesting than hearing my third hand account of things!</p>

<p>Now, I HAVE made claims that are not well known, but again, you have Google and public libraries.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re straying too far into conspiracy nut cliche assumptions again.  I never mentioned world domination.  Why do they work in secret?  Because they don&#39;t rule the world, there&#39;s always someone else who can take a conspiracy down.  This is the essential thing you are missing from your view of conspiracy theories... they don&#39;t control everything.  Often they are in competition with each other, this trips them up from time to time, puts them at each others&#39; throats.  Look at Watergate; they were all looking at legally defined conspiracy charges against the people involved, but they got lesser convictions, like Colson only got obstruction of justice.  Nixon, a conspirator, was paranoid of other conspiracies against him and many involved in that circle (Colson included) maintain there was a conspiracy against them!  Did any of these people &quot;control the world,&quot; did Nixon plot to take over the world, did the people who brought down Nixon plot ruling the world?  No.  They were part of money conspiracies, most conspiracies are about money, wealth, power.  </p>

<p>There are some world domination conspiracy theories, but that doesn&#39;t mean there are really plots at this objective (though I don&#39;t rule it out).  I don&#39;t think anyone has reached this goal, and it is one of those thing if anyone could prove there was such a plot it would piss off countless people and something unwanted would happen to such a conspirator.  Again, huge need for secrecy.  </p>

<p>If you were planning a crime or other activity for your own benefit, would it be a good idea to not keep that a secret?  </p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; and &quot;I&quot; is how I think of it more than, &quot;They&quot; and &quot;us.&quot;  When I think &quot;us&quot; I am thinking about people I care about and sometimes in an abstract sense of everyone not intentionally part of a conspiracy, such as the consumer who pumps money into a system which eventually leads to many deaths.  Taxes for war and profits for corruption, I&#39;ve paid my share of both but don&#39;t want anyone to die of it, but I&#39;m too attached to so called civilization to go live in the woods.  &quot;They&quot; would be the conspirators, obviously, of any conspiracy I know of or don&#39;t.  Most of them I&#39;ll never hear about.  Anyone who knows they are doing great wrong, politicians who see pollution but protect the culprits because they fund campaigns and provide other benefits are an example, these are to a lesser degree (to me) part of &quot;they.&quot;  Cops and soldiers are too low down the chain most of the time to be called &quot;they,&quot; but sometimes they have to be brought into the shit or dealt with.  If the cops ever come after me for speaking out against something, I&#39;ll guess &quot;they&quot; set them upon me.  Cops and soldiers are tools to &quot;they&quot;, as Kissinger allegedly said &quot;Soldiers are dumb, stupid animas to be used&quot; as pawns in foreign policy.  </p>

<p>Some &quot;they&quot;s are &quot;greater&quot; than others.  Example, if people at work decide they do not like me for promotion but hear I might be promoted, then plot against that happening to me.  Or maybe, I start dating a cop&#39;s ex girlfriend and he starts spying on us or using a little of his authority to fuck with us.  Sometimes &quot;they&quot; may refer to wall street war profiteers funding political candidates who support &quot;free markets&quot; and &quot;military strength,&quot; or Vatican officials doing everything they can to cover up sex abuse scandals or financial schemes.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the best I can do to explain &quot;they.&quot;  It&#39;s a perspective, they is whoever you or I think are involved in something we don&#39;t like, or wouldn&#39;t if we knew about it.  In the case we don&#39;t know who &quot;they&quot; are, well, obviously, we don&#39;t know about them.  Some other times, we might not know who &quot;they&quot; are behind some other conspirators, but suspect &quot;they&quot; may be &quot;pulling the strings.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, this is such a vague question, you are going to get a variety of answers.  </p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m trying to avoid that and to actually <em>learn</em>, to understand and not just dismiss everything as &#39;typical conspiracy nut hogwash&#39;.</p>

<p>So there isn&#39;t a massive all-encompassing &#39;they&#39; - essentially, &#39;they&#39; is as simple as &#39;someone who works toward something I dislike&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Covertly working toward something criminal or against yourself or others.  Some things are perfectly legal but despicable and might be desired kept a secret.  Campaign funding for example or data collection for another.  The covert part is key in defining a conspiracy as well as being indicative of what kind of work they do.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of people doing stuff and working toward goals you might not like, but that doesn&#39;t make them conspirators.  A petty example would be friends plotting behind your back to break you up with your girlfriend, but this subreddit is for conspiracies that affect many more people than that.  Covert criminal plot = conspiracy.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to understand why the belief that not all is it seems is prevalent.</p>

<p>The U.S. government LIED about the Gulf of Tonkin to go to war with Vietnam. They slaughtered the men, women, and children of Waco, Texas.</p>

<p>The publicly &#39;official&#39; story is often just that. Questioners are attacked and derided. Evidence is ignored and destroyed. The official report pushes an agenda, which is never Justice. </p>

<p>See who and what you&#39;re not allowed to question, and you begin to see connections.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many posts avoid blaming one of these factions for an action and simply use the blanket term &quot;they&quot;. Is there a reason for that?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s not like there is a player roster. This place is about conspiracies. That is secret agendas. Sometimes a story just looks suspicious. It requires dynamic &amp; critical thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a serious matter for researchers who have to rely on records, unlike physical science researchers.  Any documentation should be questioned, especially now with technology&#39;s ability to fake things.  The thing I try to keep in mind, &quot;Is there any reason someone would fake this?&quot;  There often is, but this is only one of many things to consider in piecing together conspiracy puzzles.  Logic is a very useful tool to have when considering information and more people should learn it instead of having a general concept of what it is.  Lastly, knowing you may not be &quot;right&quot; will keep a theorist flexible and more able to make real discoveries, instead of being the theorist who is only trying to prove themselves right.  Not saying to not pursue theories, just keep in mind the answer may not be what you originally thought it was.  </p>

<p>This is my amateur opinion of where I am at right now with handling disinformation.  I would like to hear how I can improve my methods and perspective though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your perspective mixes a little bit of &quot;question your sources&quot; with &quot;doubt yourself&quot;.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t watch the Olympics at all this year (haven&#39;t had a TV turned on in my house in about 5 years. Gave my last one away about a year ago). However, I think this might be appropriate: Self-doubt is not the path to a gold medal. Just sayin.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean you should always believe you&#39;re right, but you should at least be confident enough to know when you&#39;re on the right track and to be willing to pursue that track aggressively in the face of adversity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I knew of a solution to the high signal-to-noise ratio on our internet. For now, it seems like it&#39;s up to an individual&#39;s critical thinking and intuitive ability. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any way to actually prevent the noise short of removing its source. </p>

<p>In that sense, our struggle is one of consciousness, striving for clarity and transparency, both internally and externally. Usually that comes from direct experience, all other information is second-hand at best.</p>

<p>So if information comes from elsewhere, the question is trust in the source. Perhaps we can develop some sort of rating system like reddit karma to vote on the legitimacy of the source. Of course, what&#39;s to stop that from being drowned in noise too? Ultimately, we have no choice but to put our trust in someone, or in no one. On the internet, it&#39;s a matter of trusting no one and then slowly developing your view based on what you make of as many different and diverse views as you can find. At least, that&#39;s all I know to do.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a site that allows you to customize a search on the whole internet for articles/blogs, filtering by topic, political slant of the source, date of topical event, date of article, and perhaps some kind of &quot;legitimacy rating&quot;, if such a thing is even possible? I&#39;m thinking everything from the tiny anarchist blog to the big networks&#39; front page news. </p>
