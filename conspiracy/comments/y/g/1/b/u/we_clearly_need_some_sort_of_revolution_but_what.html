<p>I think the kind of revolution we need is one that overhauls our legislation. Repeal most everything but the bare essentials in every area, and start over. If you look at JUST the EPA, they went from advising Congress to being one of the biggest money-sucking, power-hungry legislative machines our country has ever seen. </p>

<p>Just drive through Washington D.C. - There&#39;s a street (I can&#39;t remember which street) that hosts EPA head-quarters. I swear the building is four full blocks long, at least. It goes on and on and on. It&#39;s too much, and our government has many more areas that are like that. They were never meant to be a part of our government, but they are multiplying at our expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Planned and peaceful.</p>

<p>In today&#39;s society, a massive violent revolution would be incredibly ugly.</p>

<p>Regardless, there needs to be a plan. What do you do if the revolution works? What do we do if we actually succeed? We need to have a plan for the aftermath of the fact or it could be worse than just living in the system we&#39;re in now.</p>

<p>People need to be informed and want change, but a bunch of gun-toting people screaming on about how they&#39;re gonna shoot everyone is not the best way to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so hilarious.  Its mostly funny because this concept of revolution that you so adamantly desire, is all part of the plan.  Isnt any outcome of any type of revolution actually playing into the change of paradigm and switching of the guard?  More interestingly isnt opposition to this change, simply playing right into this plan as well?  </p>

<p>What ever shall we do then?  How about follow the useful tactic of co opting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we need no revolutions, thank you. The only thing revolutions change is the names of the guys at the top of the pyramid. We need to get rid of the pyramid.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p><strong>There is nothing you can do</strong>. You can&#39;t change the world. Any attempt to change the world is an assault on the world (ie, others). We are living in the world that somebody else shoves down our throats - how do you like it?</p>

<p>Those who can wake up, wake up. Those who cannot, will be very upset if you try to wake them.</p>

<p>Before you start criticizing me, please note: I tried. I tried hard. I wanted everyone to realize what was going on; to be actively opposed to it.</p>

<p>But after some 10 years of trying, I figured that the only thing we all want is to be happy. The formula of happiness is different for everyone. Enforced paradise is torture.</p>

<p>You are not a Messiah. None of us is. Take care of yourself and let everything else take care of itself.</p>

<p>Live your own life the best you can. If you succeed, others will want to copy you, and this is your only chance to make an impression on the world.</p>

<p>If you want to make a statement, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secessio">walk away from the Machine</a>. Cancel all your subscriptions, switch to barter, unlearn everything, be curious and alert.</p>

<p>Cringing on the death bed is extremely painful - live well. Whatever you do, do it like it&#39;s your last thing on Earth.</p>

<p>When enough people stop worrying about the &quot;world&quot; and start taking care of themselves, that will be a revolution.</p>

<p>As long as people waste their lives worrying about things beyond their control, Status Quo is safe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great, I dunno, <em>manifesto</em> I guess, for modern times.</p>

<p>You are right; I have dedicated my life to trying to wake people up. Truth is, most DO NOT want to &quot;wake up&quot; and, yes, they get vehemently angry if you attempt to open their mind.</p>

<p>If only it were possible to fully &quot;walk away&quot; from the machine! The only true way to do this is to be dependent on NOTHING but your tools and your own skills. I know I can do it (I have) but, lemme tell you, it ain&#39;t easy. You almost have to live like Kaszinsky...no ID, no DL, no insurance, no credit, no banks, and no frivolous consumption (YES, that includes phones, internet, sat...of course).</p>

<p>Beautiful advice. I will look at this often to remind myself. Thank you.</p>
