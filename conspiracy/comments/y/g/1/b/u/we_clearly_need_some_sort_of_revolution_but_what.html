       I feel like we (America) really need a revolution, but I don't know what kind. What kind of revolution do you think we need? A new political party? A whole new form of government? Also, what would the revolution look like/how would it come about?

       We need to put control of people's lives back in their own hands, the essentials anyway. That way money wont have such a choke hold on everyone. If you could make your own energy and grow food you'd be tons better off. So I guess the best bet is an

       revolution, if people learn they can take control they are more likely to do so IMO.

       I've thought about organizing some sort of "red Friday" (opposite of black Friday) protest to guilt people into not buying as much shit they don't need on black Friday. Black Friday celebrates this pointless consumerism worship that I've grown to hate.

       That term limit's an interesting idea, but maybe it should be eight years instead, then they'd have nothing to disagree with it. and yes, Legal bribary as I call it, has got stop, along with campaign money coming from questionable sources. I do think that the average American should be able to contribute to their favorite candiadate financially though, BUT no companies, and there should be a cap, and no more Anon donors.

       I've thought that once they pass an internet censorship law then we are really done. I think this is why they are so desperate to censor it. We cannot let them censor it. If they succeed, we will have this weird age range of people who were old enough to access and understand the internet, but young enough to use the internet to learn about the truth and see through their bullshit. Because everyone younger would never have had a free internet and everyone older would've never used the internet for these kind of things.

       Having just finished an in-depth study of the founders' documents and correspondence about what kind of government America should have, I don't think there is any better form.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the kind of revolution we need is one that overhauls our legislation. Repeal most everything but the bare essentials in every area, and start over. If you look at JUST the EPA, they went from advising Congress to being one of the biggest money-sucking, power-hungry legislative machines our country has ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just drive through Washington D.C. - There's a street (I can't remember which street) that hosts EPA head-quarters. I swear the building is four full blocks long, at least. It goes on and on and on. It's too much, and our government has many more areas that are like that. They were never meant to be a part of our government, but they are multiplying at our expense.

       I think the American people need to realize that we empower ourselves. We don't need to obey the government, but they need to obey us. We need massive peaceful. Protests, televised to the world. Something to force the establishment to show its true Colors.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point either the government steps down and the people take control, or the government puts it down and that motivated the populace to revolt.

       I find this hilarious, because America was founded by a revolution, founded by a whole new form of government. It'll just end up the same way it is now, people are power-hungry, and anybody put in a powerful position is going to try to gain control of the people. It's inevitable.

       This is so hilarious.  Its mostly funny because this concept of revolution that you so adamantly desire, is all part of the plan.  Isnt any outcome of any type of revolution actually playing into the change of paradigm and switching of the guard?  More interestingly isnt opposition to this change, simply playing right into this plan as well?

       No, we need no revolutions, thank you. The only thing revolutions change is the names of the guys at the top of the pyramid. We need to get rid of the pyramid.
      </p>
      <p>
       How?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        There is nothing you can do
       </strong>
       . You can't change the world. Any attempt to change the world is an assault on the world (ie, others). We are living in the world that somebody else shoves down our throats - how do you like it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who can wake up, wake up. Those who cannot, will be very upset if you try to wake them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you start criticizing me, please note: I tried. I tried hard. I wanted everyone to realize what was going on; to be actively opposed to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after some 10 years of trying, I figured that the only thing we all want is to be happy. The formula of happiness is different for everyone. Enforced paradise is torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not a Messiah. None of us is. Take care of yourself and let everything else take care of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live your own life the best you can. If you succeed, others will want to copy you, and this is your only chance to make an impression on the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to make a statement,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secessio">
        walk away from the Machine
       </a>
       . Cancel all your subscriptions, switch to barter, unlearn everything, be curious and alert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cringing on the death bed is extremely painful - live well. Whatever you do, do it like it's your last thing on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When enough people stop worrying about the "world" and start taking care of themselves, that will be a revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as people waste their lives worrying about things beyond their control, Status Quo is safe.

       This is a great, I dunno,
       <em>
        manifesto

       I guess, for modern times.

       You are right; I have dedicated my life to trying to wake people up. Truth is, most DO NOT want to "wake up" and, yes, they get vehemently angry if you attempt to open their mind.

       If only it were possible to fully "walk away" from the machine! The only true way to do this is to be dependent on NOTHING but your tools and your own skills. I know I can do it (I have) but, lemme tell you, it ain't easy. You almost have to live like Kaszinsky...no ID, no DL, no insurance, no credit, no banks, and no frivolous consumption (YES, that includes phones, internet, sat...of course).

       Beautiful advice. I will look at this often to remind myself. Thank you.
