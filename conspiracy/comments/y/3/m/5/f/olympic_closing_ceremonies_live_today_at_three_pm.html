       I wanted to make a topic after the Olympics as well, calling out any claims of a terrorist attack/ any sort of disaster. Glad you did OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: And, since there won't be any attack or event to launch off World War 3/Prison Planet/New World Order, what does it say about all these "predictions"? Will

       In all honesty most of the people who claim to " know" if conspiracies are really just dying for attention and someone to say how smart they are. People like Alex Jones spout out tons of theories then when one even comes within 1 iota of what they " predicted" they run around screaming how smart they are.

       Very little people from my understanding said something will happen, people just pointed out at tell-tail signs that made it suspicious and hinted at possibly something happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then on the other hand maybe it really was exposed and they backed off, I mean who knows. I think a lot of people would have wanted millions of people exposing 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch the youtube videos you'll see combined they have tens of millions of views, plus all the conspiracy sites, plus various forums, so we are really looking at huge exposure here.

       Sounds feasible. "They" plan a false-flag attack that they intend to abandon if a few people guess it will happen, but still leave hundreds of clues around that the attack will happen. Try again.

       Well again maybe its getting people ready and you aren't aware of it, it works. Sort of how there were tons of sings and hints before 9/11 happened, but back then there weren't millions of people aware of false flag and thins like that.

       There are 7,000,000,000 people on the planet. If each of them predicted 5 different things a day, you'd get a one-in-a-trillion correct prediction
       <strong>
        <em>
         every lunar cycle
        </em>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       -- edit
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been corrected:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The probability of at least one prediction coming true out of a trillion predictions (assuming a one-in-a-trillion chance for any one coming true) is about two-thirds. Pretty good odds, but not dead certain. To break the 99% barrier, you'd need something close to 5 trillion predictions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's kind of like how rolling a d6 six times will not guarantee that you roll at least one six. The odds are
        <em>
         pretty
        </em>
        good, but not great.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aggregate probabilities involving distinct random events can't be calculated by simply adding up each event's probability.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a result has probability P of occurring, the probability of non-occurrence is (1 - P). The aggregate probability of a series of occurrences is P
        <sup>
         n,
        </sup>
        where n is the number of consecutive occurrences. To find the probability of at least one occurrence in n samples, we simply subtract the probability of a series of n non-occurrences from 1.0. So:
       </p>
       <p>
        P(aggregate) = 1 - (1 - P)
        <sup>
         n
        </sup>
       </p>
       <p>
        So the odds of rolling at least one six in 6 rolls of a d6 is 1 - ((1 - (1 / 6))
        <sup>
         6
        </sup>
        ) = 0.67, or 67%.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cool, huh?

       That is not exact science. When predicting things, which is what I said didn't happen here, I said people point to reports and news and stuff and come to a conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But either way yeah someone at home somewhere may predict something, but we are talking about something on the big stage as false flag, conflict, etc... with great accuracy.

       Who are the conspiracy theorists that said there was going to be an attack? The UK Gov put missiles on top of apartments so they thought there might be an attack...
      </p>
      <p>
       But thats a conspiracy theory aswell isnt it? Gov just wants people to live in fear and beg big daddy Gov to protect them.

       Then it really takes off with everything from aliens revelaing themselves,bluebeam HAARP etc.

       I wish I knew more about social psychology,Im sure this attaching your wishful thinking big event to another big event thats actually happening can be explained simply enough.

       Each of these is related to a supposed "attack", staged or not, at the London 2012 Olympics. There are more, but this is just what I grabbed quickly. It was a common opinion that there would be a false-flag attack, or some staged event at the Olympics. But, I'm willing to bet that most of these people will back out of their claims. I don't mean to pick out
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Doing a google search expands the view.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Olympics pass without event, the conspiracy theorists that are too attached to their belief will find some loophole to extend it. Whether it's because "too many people knew about it", or "they just wanted to show off all the secret symbols", people will find a way to validate themselves. I can't think of the term for it but you're right, this is all deeply rooted in social psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a lot like cult's psychology. They focus on a few key icons (like Alex Jones for example), and...shit I'm getting off topic. But yes. You're absolutely right, it's Cult Psychology 101.

       The empty seats were the only thing interesting to me but (without even googling!) I heard on the radio that this is easily explained because all the corporate sponsors got loads of free tickets they gave to their friends who being super rich and stuff had better things to do than watch obsessive compulsives running around and throwing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is something that shouldnt be of course and yet again shines the spotlight on more problems with corporate sponsorship but no one is talking about that real issue becuase there might be a terror attack or aliens landing.

       Much of this starts with our compulsory education system which stifles creativity and critical thinking but does make for nice wage slaves-- people cannot entertain an idea without believing it- they are trained to accept the word of "experts"- conspiracy theorists differ, not because they are critical thinker-- but because they get their gospel from alex jones and random youtubers instead of the main stream media-- not a whole lot different when you think about it.

       What you don't seem to understand is that many of these so called 'terrorist' organizations are in no position to even be considered as such. as stated previously, terrorism is a tactic not a group. the US, UK, and most of the other big countries are themselves being run by terrorist organizations. fighting a terrorist group does not make you a terrorist. these groups are against our governments not our people.
      </p>
      <p>
       yes there are terrorists, but they are not who you say they are. at least that the conclusion ive come to. now my question for you is why the fuck are you here? why do people like you insist on coming in here and insulting us? what brings you to this subreddit? you are accomplishing nothing by coming here to tell us we're all wrong. i never thought there was going to be a false flag or even a real one at the Olympics but the fact of the matter is that there are conspiracies and alot more than we know. if you don't believe that it's fine but leave us the fuck alone.

       I think what may be implied is that those are anti aircraft missiles.  So what need is for anti aircraft missiles?   From terrorism?  Well then from which group?  And in all reality, which terrorist group is going to be able to commandeer an aircraft, hijack it, and use it as a weapon over london without being shotdown from Royal air force?  Unless they are all away on training of course.

       I'm okay with saying it doesn't exist. If they were at war with us and truly wanted to harm us, they would. It would be continuous waves of terror, hitting everything from bridges, to hospitals, to water supplies. They would find a way. But they don't. Obviously, eleven years after 9/11 there hasn't been any actions that warrant the constant assault on our freedoms that have ensued since. They hate us for our freedoms? They must be loving us more and more now.

       Because London went overboard with security? That's my answer. They just took advice from the Daleks on how to do security. Overboard doesn't mean Master Plan, just means too much.

       Well generally speaking that is how logic works, events occur, you examine the evidence and make a determination.  To say any bad event that goes on at the Olympics is automatically an "inside job" is just as dumb as the police arresting you for a murder you are going to commit in 5 years.

       My opinion is that the conspiracy theorists WANT something to happen. It's fun to speculate, argue and debate stuff online. But, the real world is headed in a downward spiral. People are losing their jobs, infrastructure is crumbling, the economy is doing bad, things are getting more expensive and the rich are only getting richer. Basically, the world sucks. A lot of people dream about a new future. They want a pivotal moment that changes history. Some big event that sends us hurdling into the next phase. They need something BIG to happen that will cause all of the patriots to band together to fight against the current system. That is why everyone keeps wishing, hoping, and speculating. Waiting for the catalyst that will spark the next revolution. If it isn't this thing.... maybe it's the next one?

       The conspiracy theory part is just a way to try to predict future events based on observation of random data points. The human brain loves to try to create patterns and find order within chaos. It's usually just a non sequitur.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that they want it to be an attack on the Olympics per se. It could be anything (911, Iran, WWIII, Syria, aliens, etc.). That is the nature of conspiracy theories. You look for something big.... and speculate. You spin a bunch of "what if?" scenarios. And you try to prepare for any outcome. If it doesn't happen, you put it behind you and move on to the next big thing and start to speculate.

       This is really meta, and I like it. This is really insightful into the nature of conspiracy theories, and why we make them. It gets even more cemented when you have an outgroup to focus on (Jews, terrorists, foreigners, Commies). Once you get that outgroup your conspiracy theory gets even stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it derives from our distinct distrust of "out groups". We all belong to "in groups" and shun "out groups". When it comes to creating a theory of who's ruling the world, it's only natural of us to choose an out group to focus our hatred. Then that cements it even further...

       Obviously not every conspiracy theory is false. History teaches us that, in which every government and group conspires against another. To say that no conspiracy theory is true would be incredibly naive. And being the watchdogs of government/society is a very, very good thing. However, the "X group is secretly harming me/my group" thought process is deeply rooted in both sociology and social psychology. To think there isn't a science behind the thought process is in itself naive.

       We've got a tad more security nowadays... and a whopping two dead? It's no wonder I hadn't heard about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm in no way suggesting that the bombing wasn't a terrible thing, but we pulled it off without any unplanned explosions, as I expected.

       I saw your message before you appropriately deleted it.

      <p>
       Skipping the royalty statement, the 93 bombing of WTC, while rendered moot after 9/11, still had an effect upon those who watched it unfold. As did the attack on the Cole, the Marines in Lebanon, etc.
      </p>

       These things can and do happen. Keeping your eyes open is a good thing.

       93 bombing plus okc created anti terrorism laws (loss of freedoms for everyone), 9/11- patriot act (more freedoms), random almost blew up plane with shoe, underwear, baby bomb, etc, though always thwarted (loss of more freedoms)

       Didn't expect anything at the Olympics this year.  Not like the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics when you had 2 tons of missing explosives, a Mossad front running security, and the Canadian Parliament being shut down for months before hand without explanation.

       It wasn't for no reason that parliament was prorogued...

       iirc,  the conservatives were avoiding the Afghan detainee scandal, where the Canadian military was handing pow's to govt's who knowingly used torture. It was swept nicely under the carpet....

       There won't be any attacks, but the stargate looking wheel and pyramid were interesting. Fits well with the sun god ceremony from the openings.

       Edit-
And now they're singing "sun sun sun". Awesome.

       Something about the olympics didn't sit right with me, although I was never convinced by either the false flag theories, or the idea that it would be targeted by 'extreamists'

       My biggest beef with people is that they seem to "hope" something will happen, just so they feel like they "know" what is going on or are special or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there are tons of shitty people, yes there have been so many false flags and instances where govt or ptb let attacks occur or people die when they could have stopped it...
      </p>
      <p>
       but--
      </p>
      <p>
       to fight it, you spread information, not superstition, you try to make the world better through awareness, not hope that the govt actually is going to do something just so that you can be right.

       The way you worded it I initially thought you were saying any terrorist attack you would say was "bullshit". I took it to mean you would automatically assume a terrorist attack was a false flag.

       What a ridiculous change of topic.

       There are any number of groups/individuals that would be very happy if they launched an attack at the 2012 Olympics.

       I said leave us alone i didn't say get out. i don't need your 'i am skeptical and logical i know how everything works bullshit attitude on every single one of my posts. condescending posts about how impossible a conspiracy is are so annoying. we already deal with a downvote army from r/conspiritards and you're just being a douche to add to that. i'm not invading other subreddits i disagree with and launching OMG UR SO RONG campaigns so why the hell are you?
