    <div class="md"><p>I am not Julian Assange.</p>

<p>I adopted this user ID when I discovered Reddit. At that time people in my government and the sycophant syndicate media were calling for Julian Assange to be assassinated. I wanted to express the idea that if you take one of us down a hundred will rise in his place. I got the idea from Anonymous and the movie <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8h_v_our_Q">I am Spartacus</a></em>.</p>

<p>I have been taking a back seat to all the new posters.</p>

<p>I disguised myself as one of <strong>you</strong> (based on my reading of the demographics) then became one of <strong>us</strong>.</p>

<p>My original intent was to
&quot;cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears.&quot;</p>

<p>I moved to exposing people to ideas that challenge the conventional wisdom that religion, free public education and nationalism would have us believe.</p>

<p>I wanted people to know that the game has been rigged in their favor but soon, like it or not, the matrix will not recognize them as one of its own. When that happens they will become the victims of the system they now blindly defend.</p>

<p>Very few people are capable of respecting (let alone understanding) any interpretation of events other than the one to which they feel naturally inclined by the circumstances into which they are born. We are all born into circumstances we did not create and cannot control. So we develop a method of understanding what is happening in, around and to us called culture. When the precepts of that culture are challenged the natural tendency is to &quot;correct&quot; the person who presents the challenge or to eliminate the discordant information. I think this is an adequate explanation of the shills. This is particularly true of the naïve and innocent “jews” who, having been taught a false history and a supremacist/victim narrative, actually believe they have been uniquely chosen to be persecuted (throughout history) and can only overcome that persecution by persecuting others. Their cultural mindset also suggests a futility in trying to argue with them. However, just being exposed to a constant barrage of counter-intuitive ideas (the more annoying the better) has a cumulative effect of &quot;breaking through&quot;. The status quo mindset is like a water jug that people carry on their heads. You do not have to demolish it to make it useless, ONE crack will do.</p>

<p>I am moving on. “Like the fog which forms when conditions are right and disappears when they are not, so must the resistance to tyranny be.” </p>

<p>Thank you for your concern and your expression of support for my efforts.</p>

<p>Let your voices be heard as often and in as many venues as seems appropriate to you. Everybody is a sleeper cell of non-violent, non-compliant resistance.</p>

<p>Persevere; venceremos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you underestimate the comprehension of the people. But different states of consciousness is not only democracy, it&#39;s humanity. Slowly but steady everyone will find his way to enlightenment. </p>

<p>At first it begins by understanding, that the surroundings are not what we thought they were. Reasons differ and understanding comes out of naivity. </p>

<p>The human comprehension is so limited. And inside their boundaries of understanding they get even lied to. Therefore no one can be blamed, as it is in their natural state of mind to understand what they understand.</p>

<p>For myself I haven&#39;t figured out yet, how big the part of at least &quot;informed&quot; people are. The actions of world politics are plain visible in their scheme and either the majority refuses speaking about it out of fear or truly the intelligence of the people is lower than their naivity.</p>

<p>Either way. The path of fate lies in front of us. And we will walk him. And what lies in the end depends on each state of mind. For some the end is bad. And many will not even see it coming. But keeping a healthy and positive attitude is the most important thing, even when times look bad, the present is always made by our mind. And changing the happenings is like using the software panel within the giant machine of destruction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>The actions of world politics are plain visible in their scheme</em></p>

<p>One of my key insights was the realization that what the rulers of the world do, and what they say they do, has no correspondence. None. At all. Nothing. There is a total disconnect between words and actions, and it is by design. Soooooo, what you have to do is completely disregard what the leaders say they will do, or are doing, or are going to do, and examine only what they have actually done. This requires some mental gymnastics, because we are all so accustomed to giving creedence to what others <em>say</em> they are going to do, or are trying to accomplish. We need to completely, and I mean COMPLETELY, ignore what these bastards say they are doing, what they say they want, or are trying to achieve, or what they have done, or why they have done it ... disregard ALL OF THIS BULLSHIT. Look at only what they actually do. That the key insight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You currently have -87 downvotes. </p>

<p>We can assume the majority come from r/conspiratard, since there&#39; is an open thread on the topic. It&#39;s ironic that this subreddit has a chief moderator who is a known Zionist/racist and who openly peddles hate (the ongoing pancake meme/joke about the death of US citizen Rachel Corrie).</p>

<p>It proves your point well. For the most part, people are negative and receptive, and simply cannot identify and disambiguate the agendas that surround them.</p>

<p>Good luck</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two sides in this argument. Both accuse each other of racism. Muscular expressions of downvoting and chest thumping hyperbole achieve little.</p>

<p>The facts are, that Zionism is not a conspiracy theory and Israel in it&#39;s current form is an apartheid state. The FBI has in the past classified the ADL as a terrorist organisation. And AIPAC is the most influential bipartisan body in US politics and is sufficiently active  that Ivy league academics question it&#39;s potential to jeapodize national interests. These are the primary Jewish institutions in the modern US. There are no equivalents for Catholics, Wasps, Buddhists etc.</p>

<p>If you believe that pointing out this shit is irrational anti-semitism, it means you have latched on to an appealing sound-bite that contains a noble appeal to the equality of man. But without any attempt to properly articulate the nature of these power structures there is a risk that the intrinsic self-interest and highly racial behaviour of these groups will be allowed to continue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to see you go, and I mean that. All the others who have posted &quot;farewell&quot; messages can go hang themselves, but you actually contributed worthwhile material to this subreddit.</p>

<p>On this point:</p>

<p><em>Very few people are capable of respecting (let alone understanding) any interpretation of events other than the one to which they feel naturally inclined by the circumstances into which they are born.</em></p>

<p>I completely agree with you, and it has been my own effort to shake people out of their conceits and preconceptions and programmed brainwashing by posting outrageous or shocking content -- but always content that I believe to be honest and true. It&#39;s like hitting a stone wall with a hammer, as I know you have discovered yourself. The sheer mass of human stupidity is virtually unmoveable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good-bye, from a non-poster who respected you silently. I wasn&#39;t always in aggreement with your conclusions, I felt subtle manipulation to your personal agenda to educate. </p>

<p>I studied you quite a bit though. Stalked, some would say. You are a thinker, and have the potential to be a modern-day philosopher. Everybody has a story, many of which are too intimate to be shared. Everybody who steps off the train to Bliss vouluntarily does so for profound reasons not easily explainable. Your motives seemed altruistic, however, as much as they could be, considering your personal issues as a human being which you deal with. </p>

<p>Personally, I awakened myself. &quot;Diagnosed&quot; with ADHD back in 1983 at 7 years old and immediately heavily drugged with Dexedrine. I am also a diagnosed sociopath, kept benign due simply to my Sword of Damocles, the ADHD.</p>

<p>Along with all that baggage, as well as heavy child abuse from so many vectors...well, the only knowledge I acquired was from the printed word. Anything. Encyclopedias taught me about human culture, body language and micro-expressions. My unique amoral perspective gave me an objectivity concerning myself and others that taught me well. </p>

<p>Do not listen to anyone&#39;s agenda. Ever. Pick your mystery and bulldog it, ignoring the weaknesses caused by human emotion, and the biased mannerisms they create. Collect the same3 information from as many diverse sources as poissible, weed out all common themes and ideas, then research the shit outta those..Study what remains, while keeping an eye on basic human psychology, socioeconomics, and your interior wolf (who wants to help, but will try to influence your decisions)</p>

<p>Finally, after all this research, if you did it right, you should be left with a pile of cold, hard truth. Use <em>that</em> to form the basis of your conclusions.</p>

<p>If anybody was patient enough to reafd all of this attentively, I would like to thank you for the respect. If I have managed to even slightly pick a resonant chord deep within <em>your</em> ID, all I ask that you take from all this is: <em>None</em> of this is good. We <em>have</em> lost our way, and sold our spirit to those who do not have our best interests at heart. Do not feel guilty for this, though. The only way we will truly see a real and positive change is when we rise as ONE race, from ONE planet, with ONE voice; only THEN shall we survive, and voyage to the stars, or the answers that we seek so desperately, at least.</p>

<p>There is <em>something</em> though, a coomon force of will that we have done miraculous things with. Karma and the Theory of Relativity, and our silly religions that obviously come from the same stories. Amino acids which are the true building blocks, present pretty much everywhere we&#39;ve managed to look.</p>

<p>None of this is mystical, from Jesus, or from Spider-Man. It just <em>is</em>, someday we will be able to understand why, simply not right now.</p>

<p>Thanks dudes, good luck Julian, even if your voyages are as sociopathic in nature as mine, and you are only heading for the next reddit account. They could be, but if that&#39;s the case, the person you <em>should</em> have become had the right idea. I see him.</p>

<p><strong>Edit- to Julian&#39;s downvoters, amd mine who didn&#39;t appreciate my perspective. YOU are the resaon it all sucks. Your arrogance and cries of &quot;Disinfo agent!!&quot; simply because someone challenged your perceptions, and rather benignly, I might add. Your strident cries of &quot;Sheeple!&quot; have accomplished nothing but discredit yourselves to the very people whom you have arrogantly decided to &quot;save&quot;. Lulz. YOU are parasites, hiding behind cowardice, and a piss-poor grasp of critical thinking, together which allow you to ignore the guilt you cannot face, which is the fact that your personal demons are enabled by the evil you would presume to fight. I am a sociopath who faked his way through everything, quite amoral, and well aware of the drain you represent upon all that is just and good. Your fragile ego&#39;s would prefer to live the Apocalypse, only so that you can be vindicated, instead of the dawning realization that YOU are the diseased meat, the weakness which should have been culled from the herd. Die. Please, and do your small part to restore Balance.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>How many Germans were killed in WW I and II? How many Americans of German descent killed them? How many Germans killed American&#39;s of German descent? The Jewish Zionist elite like Bernard Baruch pulled the USA into those wars. Why? So the Zionist elite could run international banks? </p>

<p>We were manipulated into a Civil War that destroyed our cultural bonds. Who profited? Baruch made $200 million off of WW I alone. </p>

<p>Ask your Zionist brethren in the USA why non Zionist Jews in Europe died and were displaced. </p>

<p>The Zionist political movement started at least 40 years before the Nazis. </p>

<p>AIPAC is pulling the same for profit war mongering bullshit as the Zionist elite did back then. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you underestimate the comprehension of the people. But different states of consciousness is not only democracy, it&#39;s humanity. Slowly but steady everyone will find his way to enlightenment. </p>

<p>At first it begins by understanding, that the surroundings are not what we thought they were. Reasons differ and understanding comes out of naivity. </p>

<p>The human comprehension is so limited. And inside their boundaries of understanding they get even lied to. Therefore no one can be blamed, as it is in their natural state of mind to understand what they understand.</p>

<p>For myself I haven&#39;t figured out yet, how big the part of at least &quot;informed&quot; people are. The actions of world politics are plain visible in their scheme and either the majority refuses speaking about it out of fear or truly the intelligence of the people is lower than their naivity.</p>

<p>Either way. The path of fate lies in front of us. And we will walk him. And what lies in the end depends on each state of mind. For some the end is bad. And many will not even see it coming. But keeping a healthy and positive attitude is the most important thing, even when times look bad, the present is always made by our mind. And changing the happenings is like using the software panel within the giant machine of destruction.</p>
