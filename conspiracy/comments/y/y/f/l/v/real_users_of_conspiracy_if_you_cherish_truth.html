We need you to summon your courage and stand up for your beliefs. This sub  needs you, your countrymen need you, and your brothers and sisters around the world with no voice need you. If you&#39;re paranoid, then focus your energy on learning to become anonymous with proxies, vpns (use a paid service and shop for one in a country that does not like the USA), and the onion network. </p>

<p>Regular users: We need fact checking on shit as much as possible. Upvoting shit sources like commondreams and alternet make this place /politics with less Obama cocksucking. Don&#39;t just downvote. Tell us why, leave a comment. </p>

<p>I guarantee if we don&#39;t pull off some momentous shit in the next few months this sub will be fucked. Probably get so polluted with shit and sock puppet accounts it&#39;ll become a default sub... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Or perhaps we could have a list in the side bar with 3 categories and each theory that has come up, especially the most well known, would be placed into one of the categories: Confirmed, disproved, and contested. The confirmed can be used to awaken the sheep, and should link to many good supporting sources and information. False would obviously be things that even among us, seem to not be true. Again with reasons why. The fun part and perhaps largest category would be the contested, and with each NEW theory that comes in or with each post it would then be fun to be able to vote on if we think its true or not. We could then use these results to color code the &#39;contested&#39; items (green if more than 50 percent think true, red if not) and that enable us to jump in somewhere and help try to solve the mystery. Let me know what you think team.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that if a subreddit that consists of almost nothing but youtube links can not only survive but can produce original content and worthwhile discussion one day out of the week, then surely we, a subreddit that is supposed to thrive on intelligent thought and the pursuit of the truth, can do so just as easily. </p>

<p>Do you really think that the average poster here is incapable of forming their own thoughts rather than just posting links to news articles and the such?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that is the point. The discussion going on here is because of a self post. If we had a day where that was all that could be posted we would slowly begin to foster an environment where intelligent discussions would be more commonplace than they are now. People would need to actually go into the thread to see what it was all about, which, in turn, would get rid of the people that just show up to give or remove karma or those who upvote solely based on the name of the link.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are assuming these tactics are effective when deployed against individuals who are even casually familiar with grammar, logic and rhetoric.</p>

<p>Though, I agree with your assessment, and the number of individuals who possess this critical knowledge are few and tend to utilize it in an abusive manner to support the establishment.  This is what needs to change, before any tangible shift in awareness will occur.</p>

<p>If you know the rules of the game, it doesn&#39;t matter how many trolls and shills are spreading disinformation and impeding opposing discourse.</p>

<p>No I wasn&#39;t. Just used that example to point out how something can be plausible yet very unlikely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was an inside job, this is the most important fact out there right now, it has the power to wake a lot of people up when presented properly. Stop with the mini nukes and the lazer weapons and the no planes, that&#39;s all dis info. I wouldn&#39;t even be to sure about a missile into the pentagon. </p>

<p>President Kennedy was assassinated, his brother was assassinate using a Manchurian candidate. MLK was assassinated.</p>

<p>Oklahoma city was staged and there were bombs in the building. </p>

<p>Then there are countless conspiracies which have basis in truth, but are riddled with dis info. Sometimes there is a cover up, but its not always the extreme conspiracy scenario. Civilization is so much older than they are admitting right now, but that doesn&#39;t mean aliens were involved in building stone structures. </p>

<p>Planned obsolescence is real, but not to the extent people think. In reality the free market mostly won that battle, now the problem is just consumerism. We could demand better products but the market has spoken. </p>

<p>Cancer can be cured naturally, but there are many bullshit answers out there and half truths.</p>

<p>HIV has at least an 80% misdiagnosis rate, especially in Africa. There is no test for HIV only HIV antibodies which is very inaccurate and unreliable.</p>

<p>Most wars are over money. Don&#39;t go to the extreme of world dominance and mass extermination. This very well might be the end game, but you don&#39;t know that. </p>

<p>80% of the world is deficient if vitamin D. 
People are eating to much sugar and grains. </p>

<p>No one knows everything, separate the good from the bad and always be ready to reexamine a currently held belief. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t need big government, we might not even need a government. </p>

<p>There are a lot of people out there who know some of these things but don&#39;t know everything. Your less alone than you think. Always keep learning and never be to sure of yourself. </p>

<p>There are many more conspiracies, this was just a rant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess whose teaching you and writing your texts books. Being a medical student means very little without independent thought. Knowing an HIV researcher means even less. Look into the HIV test that they give. Also look into the difference between AIDS and HIV. Just because you have AIDS doesn&#39;t mean you got it from HIV. Look into the most common form of diagnosis in poor African countries, they don&#39;t even administer HIV test, they do it my symptoms (which match malnutrition and typhus).

<p>We need sources. We need to uncover stories like the supposed radiation cover up and propaganda(psy-ops officer yesterday posting an ama or new accounts uploading military prop). We need to put more pressure on the people to ask questions about the apartheid in in Palestine. We need to ask questions about 9/11 and about the elite child sex slave rings that are being found all over the world. Whether chemtrails are real or not(personally believe some they are real but very well covered up) isn&#39;t the point. If it&#39;s real we need to PROVE it.

I can totally understand getting so frusterated with the truth (of the conspiratorial view of history) and going to pick a fight in conspiratard. haha just to vent.  Because again, conspiratard is like Vegas, u go when you absoluetly need to and the stories stay there.  </p>

<p>I just want r/conspiracy to be back to full tilt again.  You know, this place was a lot more live when I was posting my William Cooper posts daily.  </p>

<p>I will discuss the truth anytime anywhere, but would love to make r/conspiracy a class act again.</p>

<p>And while I appreciate the kind words &quot;maybe you should have made this post&quot;, I feel that this is, in itself, the point of this whole thing.</p>

<p>We are equally as responsible for this subreddit individually and as a whole.  So it doesn&#39;t really matter who posts it, as long as it is True.</p>

<p>I am here to do my part to help us make a better world, let alone a better subreddit.  We need to be the change we want to see in the world.</p>

<p>I see the population of the world increasingly becoming more apathetic, careless, violent, angery, and dumb. </p>

<p>I am here to help combat this with rational conversations to dig at a deeper, more true understanding of history and the world that we are living in and I would hope that EVERY PERSON IN R/CON is here for the same fucking reason.  Truth, Hope, Education, Freedom.  And our collective future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this. I have had some excellent conversations with some of you here about giving this sub some much needed credibility... </p>

<p>The following is an anecdotal short-list of how users should be posting here...</p>

<p>1) Provide evidence to claims of fact, sourcing your evidence from as &quot;reputable&quot; of a source as possible. </p>

<p>I realize &quot;reputable&quot; is very subjective, as many facts that are discussed here are difficult to source at times, not to mention the question of &quot;what counts as credible/reputable source? Perhaps a question for another post in and of itself</p>

<p>2)Admit your limitations to the factual knowledge of the topic you are discussing, conveying when speculative claims have unreliable/undisclosed evidence... Even purely speculative claims or theories have a purpose here, IMO, if they can be used to make connections about events/circumstances that require more research of the community to find out causal/factual claims within the overall speculative-theory</p>

<p>3)Positively critique your peers in a respectful way, utilizing the methods of non-violent communication.</p>

<p>4) Add comments, questions, supplemental evidence that evoke further discussion and research out of this community</p>

<p>5) Outright name-calling, ad hominem &amp; Strawman logical fallacies should not be utilized in posting what-so-ever. If someone violently communicates with you, feel free to report the comment to the mods. </p>

<p>6) Racism should not be tolerated whatsoever. </p>

<p>When discussing the Zionist Conspiracy, for example, very thoughtfully and carefully choose your words. Understand that this topic in general is where a chasm of hate for this subreddit stems from. Simply put, attempt to separate race from the socio-political and maritime &quot;philosophies&quot; of Zionism. If you discuss racial issues within that subject matter, do so in a tasteful and respectful, ethnographical perspective and methodology. </p>

<p>7)Carry yourself as a diplomat from our community. When you post here, and in other subreddits, you represent a desire to seek truth. Express your passion for verisimilitude in every post. Again, choose your words carefully and wisely. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll edit this if I think of anything else. I hope this adds to the overall discussion of this thread. Peace and love. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m aware of that particular example, and you&#39;re certainly right, hiddenhand-- it&#39;s a touchy issue.    </p>

<p>After speaking with another mod, I think that banning such users wouldn&#39;t help or be appropriate. Unless outright &quot;hate-speech&quot; or beligerant racist ranting takes place, it would be best for those of us who are concerned to respond respectfully to said users. If sonething inappropriate is said, request sources for factual claims, ask why certain words are used instead of others(is it context-specific?), and just generally debate such posts or question language used. As with normal reddiquette, if a post is illogical, irrelevant, or inappropriate, downvote and report if necessary. Perhaps users should even message the person making questionable statements... </p>

<p>I&#39;d say that authentic debates with anyone making inappropriate comments, regardless of their position, is a positive thing...</p>

<p>I agree.</p>

<p>Subjectively I feel that those making accusations of anti semitism generally seem to use circular logic without providing rational arguments to counter the claims or opinions of the &#39;anti-semites&#39;.   That&#39;s just my opinion of course.</p>

I don&#39;t know where he gets his sources, and unless he quoted directly from a Judaic &quot;holy text&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t say his arguments have much validity. I would suggest that you debunk his arguments, point by point, show the fallacies in the sources he draws from, and prove his &quot;facts&quot;as incorrect if they are. </p>

<p>Your mods here will address this in detail at some point, but generally speaking, debate him and attempt to prove him wrong. If any facets of his arguments hold up, that will be sorted out in the debate process Downvote and report if you feel so inclined... These kinds of statements should be regulated by the community itself. So get on him, man. I haven&#39;t had computer access, but I plan on helping with these kinds of issues in discussion as I can.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s much better to call people out on their beliefs than to have them be removed from the discourse, wouldn&#39;t you agree? Or do you want to be protected from their dirty thoughts that might corrupt your precious mind? Hmmm? Would you like some higher power, some man far greater than you to take this person out of the argument?  I mean, yeah he&#39;s said stuff that I&#39;ve called him out on too. Just stupid stuff. Stupid/hateful but not like hateful/hateful ya know? Nothing in my opinion that was close enough to constitute a ban, if I even believed people should be banned for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition began in the 18th or 19th century and ended in the 20th century. It is not more correct because you have a fondness for that time period. It was a fad that was incorrect. (See definition 3a: no longer in technical use!)</p>

<p>My definitions (1, 4 and 5 above) are at least a thousand years old. However, definition 3c is modern. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition is based in a concept that &quot;the races&quot; are biologically different, based in the theory of eugenics. As far as science and sociology is concerned there are no races, only ethnicity and skin color, humans just aren&#39;t biologically diverse enough for the term &quot;race&quot; in biology.</p>

<p>In sociology the term race was closely tied with eugenics for a lot of the 19th and 20th century, the modern understanding of biology has effectively debunked eugenics are a real science, therefore race is seen as a social construct- usually projected on to a group as a means of classification... it holds no meaning outside of an outdated way to classify groups of people. As far as science is concerned it&#39;s about as accurate as classifying people by how big their ears are. </p>

<p>So when you say race you probably are referring to a &quot;population&quot; or &quot;ethnic group&quot; </p>

<p>In political science(my specialty) &quot;race&quot; is sometimes used to describe the specific <em>construct</em> of categorizing populations, especially in law (&quot;jim crow&quot; or affirmative action legislation)  rather than a literal biological category. I understand why it&#39;s confusing but I don&#39;t get how the old, now debunked way of thinking about populations has stuck around while other rebutted terms eventually fall out of favor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Crux of the argument is Jews are a religion and not a race. To say racism implies a kind of discrimination that has not happened since ww2 whereas people of color have been continuously discriminated against since the institution of slavery was engrained in the constitution. It shows a lack of understanding and sympathy. </p>

<p>The way to discriminate against Jews is to say something like all Jews by nature of their religion are a part of an overarching conspiracy against mankind. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gaining Full Control</p>

<p>It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavorable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the &#39;ultimate victory&#39; as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms.</p>

<p>Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a &#39;honey pot&#39; gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. file:///D:/Documents/Cointellpro forum techniques/Forum_COINTELPRO_Techniques.htm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey! You made it to wikipedia!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is something wrong about applying an appropriate title to someone who is intent on preventing intelligent discourse through the use of ad hominem attacks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about negating the claim of the author by questioning his intelligence (which your examples do). It&#39;s pointing out that the author acts like a moron when they resort to ad hominem attacks.</p>

<p>The difference is what I&#39;m doing isn&#39;t baseless. It&#39;s baseless to suggest that someone must be a paid agent because they disagreed with you. It&#39;s not baseless to suggest someone is dumb because they are acting dumb.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t call the morons <em>before</em> they call people shills, it&#39;s <em>after</em> - and that is a big difference!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t call people morons to lessen their claim that I&#39;m a shill - I call them a moron because they made the shill claim in the first place. Once again, a big difference!</p>

<p>To apply one of your examples it would be more like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m definitely being negative. No, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s a non-point. It&#39;s certainly ad hominem in nature, but it&#39;s also based in fact i.e. the logical fallacies already put forth by said moron. Unlike the claim of being a shill which is based upon an <em>imaginary</em> logical fallacy. </p>

<p>For example - it wouldn&#39;t be fallacious to present an ad hominem attack in the case of the non-college attendee explaining what the college experience is like. They didn&#39;t go to college. Yes, it is a negative fact, but it&#39;s still relevant. </p>

<p>From the wikipedia article that you seem to like so much: </p>

<p>Doug Walton has argued that ad hominem reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue,[13] as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject&#39;s words.</p>

<p>The philosopher Charles Taylor has argued that ad hominem reasoning is essential to understanding certain moral issues, and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the apodictic reasoning of philosophical naturalism.[14]</p>

<p>In this case that moral issue would be whether or not it is right to knee-jerk shill-call anyone who disagrees</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Commondreams and alternet are good sources. If I have any criticism of them it&#39;s that they often reprint some of the more interesting articles from the MSM. </p>

<p>This is one of the most useful pieces of information I got off common dreams, and which was a reprint of an LATimes article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Proactive, Preemptive Operations Group, (P2OG), brings together CIA and military covert action, information warfare, intelligence, and cover and deception. Among other things, this body launches secret operations aimed at &quot;stimulating reactions&quot; among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction -- that is, for instance, prodding terrorist cells into action and exposing themselves to &quot;quick-response&quot; attacks by U.S. forces. 
<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1028-11.htm">http://www.commondreams.org/views02/1028-11.htm</a></p>

<p>In fact I think the organized attacks on them are from righties or corporate media trying to destroy them.</p>

<p>And your posting history doesn&#39;t give you much credibility. Sounds like you&#39;re trying to destroy this subreddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no no.  The list isn&#39;t who gets killed.  The list is who is protected.  </p>

<p>&quot; In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern. Although the so-called &quot;moral issues&quot; were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent.</p>

<p>Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace, and tranquillity, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few. &quot;</p>

<p>Unless you are an initiate, you are cattle.  You do not matter to the adepts.  For they believe themselves to be of a higher destiny then ours.  They are <em>building</em> a great work.  That&#39;s why they have taken the name of the Mason.  Wake up.  Wake up. Wake up.  </p>

<p>Bill Cooper is a hero who broadcasted over <a href="http://www.hourofthetime.com/wordpresstest/?page_id=7576">1900 hours of broadcast for us to have</a> before they killed him.  How many will you do?  You&#39;re already in R/con oOoooOoOooooOooO.</p>

The truth and providing evidence and proof of the truth.  Complete transparency.

There is evidence out there. If I can be a little cliched for a moment...The truth is out there. Find it! Bring it to us and the rest of the world!</p>

<p>/politics with less Obama cocksucking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You do realize that the whores who took over <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> are the same group that has been taking over the internet for the last 4+ years to eradicate any anti-Obama talk?  The red party has talk radio, the blue party has internet message control.</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re fact-checking and looking for truth, that means they think you need to be silenced.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has 76000 &quot;readers.&quot;  They&#39;re targeting any information stream that has the potential to get a message out and gain a little bit of momentum.</p>

<p>This is very creepy stuff, but I don&#39;t know what you can do about it.  If you oppose them, they&#39;ll just herp derp you until you want to quit.  Reddit, Inc. is obviously part of their turf, which means it&#39;s a biased playing field.</p>

<p>You kind of over-killed the comparison to the OP (i got it after the first one :P) but I see your point clearly now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know where he is getting his information. Talmud &quot;quote mines&quot; with fake quotes and dishonest quotes that are brazenly modified or taken out of context. Or maybe it&#39;s the controversial, demented ramblings of a Rabbi with Alzheimers that 99.99% of Jews have never heard of and suddenly its the belief of all Jews. </p>

<p>I am trying to show you from that example that his <em>way of thinking and generalizing</em> is bigoted/racist. </p>

<p>EDIT: I have a challenge for you. Invent a quote that is actually antisemitic, apparently unlike tttt0tttt&#39;s comment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I certainly can&#39;t vouch for tttt0tttt and those remarks that you consider anti-Semitic. I don&#39;t know where he gets his sources, and unless he quoted directly from a Judaic &quot;holy text&quot;, I wouldn&#39;t say his arguments have much validity. I would suggest that you debunk his arguments, point by point, show the fallacies in the sources he draws from, and prove his &quot;facts&quot;as incorrect if they are. </p>

<p>Your mods here will address this in detail at some point, but generally speaking, debate him and attempt to prove him wrong. If any facets of his arguments hold up, that will be sorted out in the debate process Downvote and report if you feel so inclined... These kinds of statements should be regulated by the community itself. So get on him, man. I haven&#39;t had computer access, but I plan on helping with these kinds of issues in discussion as I can. I hope my answer helps :) </p>
