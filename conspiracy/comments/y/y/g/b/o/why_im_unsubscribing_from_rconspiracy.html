       I make a post, from a reputable source, about a

      </p>
      <p>
       It got 7 upvotes in 7 hours... Meanwhile sensational titles questioning whether we landed on the moon or faked 9/11 have garnered way more upvotes. Apparently since it wasn't an Infowars article, it's no good?  Go fuck yourselves

       While this is true. I'd say a good third of these stories are about James Holmes' father and many of the other submissions are highly sensationalized.

       This isn't about activism. This is about reminding those who are unaware of what is going on with this ongoing investigation. I got banned in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       the first time I made a Ron Paul submission. I expected
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to at least entertain the idea of the events taking place in our world... not conceal them. Look at the front page and tell me that this subreddit isn't an absolute joke. If I simply wanted to read a "discussion board" I would go to Above Top Secret.

       As for your link, this community has a good understanding of Libor already (I think?), how it happened and what the implications are. You shouldn't expect too much of a response about a well-documented banking scandal unless your title is highlighting novel information from your source.

       You want too believe in Aliens from MARS Sidonia are inflicting the earth with pod people viruses?? That's your choice! Want to provide proof or no proof? That's your call!

      <p>
       ALLOW PEOPLE to make their own discernment. They don't need a chaperon...they are adults!!
      </p>
      <p>
       So bring on every conspiracy from A to B. We are here to decide for ourselves. Not to have it decided already for us.

       Most people here browse through the new and down a few pages through the list.  LIBOR is kind of old news so we are aware and it is complicated and usually boring to read that kind of stuff, but we know what is up for the most part.  Try posting something about Agenda 21 and watch the downvotes flow in.

       Bearskinrug, I feel ya, and understand your frustration, but listen to me here...just for a minute.  This is exactly why this community needs you.  You provided an excellent example of a new, major, hard hitting conspiracy that has literally cost the public Trillions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post got buried by bullshit, it happens, but if you stick around, along with me, and others, we can turn this ship around.  I feel your pain, it sucks that good content gets buried by "Zionists are eating your babies!", and "11 Reasons Why Rand Paul Is The Anti Christ"...it really is ridiculous, but keep in mind, some folks around here like to upvote bullshit to keep the good stories buried...either for the "lulz" or just because they are jack knuckles.

       Truth is perspective. Perspective is unique from each perspective. As a collective consciousness, we must become bored with the trivial before we can grow to the important. To give up, is to loose consciousness. Stay and endure!

       Everyone has been where you are. The fact of the matter is r/conspiracy is a crap shoot. Now more than ever, you have political parties circling the waters (pony 2012!). And we've always had the "all seeing eye" keeping it's tentacles near the breach.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you choose to retire then that's your deal. As for me and many others, we will fight against the tide. We will constantly submit new articles. With no regard if they downvote them into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will never give up.
And we will try to inform as many people as we can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay informed or stay dead.
The choice is yours.

       I'm not desperate for upvotes. I'm just tired of reading the same bs on this subreddit. People are saying why care about Libor? It's not a conspiracy if it's proven? What the hell is this? So we find a conspiracy with some basis, but because some people think its too complicated - they don't care. Others think that because it's proven, it's not a conspiracy - they don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here we are... a group of banks and bankers systematically rape the very foundation of the global economy, likely causing millions to lose their homes when they otherwise would have got to keep them and it's not important. This. This is why I'm unsubscribing.
