        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>-- This is a transcript of the Bloodline Breakdown--
Now, let me regress just a little bit. King William the Lion, who was born in 1165 and died in 1214, had a daughter, Isabelof Scotland. </p>

<p>Well, Isabel married a certain Robert Rose [Roos]. Robert Rose [Roos] was a Knights Templar who was heavily involved in the first efforts -- and was very successful -- at international banking. </p>

<p>Plus, he established the first overt andcovert international intelligence gathering organization which all, all subsequent intelligence organizations had been basedupon since. </p>

<p>His son, Sir William Roos, and his daughter, Lucy Roos, figure prominently in the story to follow. Lucy marriedSir Robert Plumpton. They sired two children: Sir William Plumpton and Alice Plumpton. </p>

<p>During this period of time, this family, this family, as the Knights Templar were going to ground, in the male progeny of this family always followed in their father&#39;s footsteps and entered into the order. </p>

<p>They established, in secret, the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, and may have had a significant role in the establishment, for intelligence reasons, of the order known as the Ancient Order of the Rose and Cross.</p>

<p>Now, Alice Plumpton married Sir John Boteler. They gave birth to a daughter, Alice Boteler, who then married JohnGerard, who had a child, Constance, who married Sir Alex Standish. </p>

<p>The following children issued from that marriage: Ralph Standish, Sir Alex Standish, Roger Standish, and Alice Standish, who then married James Prescott. </p>

<p>The children of this marriage were Roger Prescott, Ralph Prescott, John Prescott, and Captain Jonathan Prescott. Jonathan Prescott married Rebecca Buckley. They had two children, Abel Prescott and Lucy Prescott, and Lucy married Jonathan Fay. </p>

<p>They sired three children: Samuel Prescott Phillips Fay, Samuel Howard Fay, and Harriet Eleanor Fay. Harriet married Reverend James Smith Bush, son of merchant Obidiah [Newcomb] Bush. </p>

<p>Their son, Samuel Prescott Bush, became the president of Buckeye Steel Castings Company of Ohio. A pioneer family of Franklin, Ohio between Dayton and Cincinnati, and was one of the membersof the Golden Circle and Order of the Quest, also known as the JASON Society, which gave issue to most of the political elite of the United States of America, who are, by the way, all (and I mean
all without exception) related to each other.</p>

<p>Now, Samuel Prescott Bush married, and his son Prescott Bush became a U.S. Senator from Connecticut, the director of Prudential Insurance, the director of CBS, a partner in Brown Brothers Harriman, chairman, National Republican Finance Committee, funds placed in Merrill Lynch accounts in Switzerland under the guidance of Donald Reagan. </p>

<p>When he married,that marriage gave issue to the following:Prescott Bush II: an investment banker indicted for fraudulent banking practices.George Bush: Chairman of Zapata Oil from 1963-64; Chairman of Republican Party, Harris County, Texas, when J.F.Kennedy was killed; delegate to the GOP National Convention (1964); 1968 member of the 90th and 91st Congress from Texas; from 1965-66, Nixon appointed Bush as ambassador to the United Nations to deal with China; he was the director for the Central Intelligence Agency; Chairman of the GOP party; Vice President of the United States of America; and President of the United States of America.</p>

<p>Four other children were William H. Bush, James Bush, Jonathan Bush, and Nancy, who married Alex Ellis.</p>

<p>The issue of George and Barbara Bush was: Dorothy, who married William LeBlond; John Ellis Bush; Neil Bush, son of the director of CIA, becomes director of Silverado Savings and Loan and launders CIA drug money. </p>

<p>Silverado loses over $100million dollars and Neil goes unpunished.And the two other children? </p>

<p>Marvin Pierce Bush and George Bush II. Folks, this intelligence was gathered by one of our agents, code named &quot;John Galt,&quot; who spent literally years in dusty libraries and books of genealogy. And I&#39;m not going to tell you which libraries or how he arrived at this information. But it has been checked, it is absolutely accurate and this is just one portion of the pedigree of George Bush, who&#39;s literally related to most of the royal families of Europe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry there is a problem here that is simply solved through basic numeric analysis of a population.   Basically if you go back 30 generations (or less) anyone is related to every person on the planet.  1000 years is enough to say that everyone thats alive is in some way related to King William.   </p>

<p>If you dont believe me look it up.  It has to do with exponential growth.  Basically every generation increases by a power (2 parents have 2 parents have 2 parents) until at 2<sup>30</sup> you have 1,073,741,824 which is more then all the people who have ever lived.   So at a point there is a pinch that requires in breeding and after that point the interconnection basically increase exponentially.</p>

<p>What Im saying is, you too are related to every templar that ever lived if they still have a living line at all that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true, however, you&#39;re falsely assuming that each generation consists of separate individuals -- that there is no overlap in the family tree.</p>

<p>This may be true for the first several generations -- grandparents likely don&#39;t overlap, nor great-grandparents -- but go back 10 generations when you&#39;ve got 1024 ancestors at that level, and there&#39;s significant chance of some of those ancestors filling multiple spots on your family tree, especially if you have family from a small village. </p>

<p>Now that said, I still agree with your basic idea: of course the Bushs are related to some random European guy 1000 years ago. But you&#39;d have a much harder time convincing me they&#39;re related to some Mesoamerican guy 1000 years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed its a weak summary of a well documented phenomenon.  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19331938">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19331938</a>  They fill in the gaps of overlaps along with regionality to prove mathematically how many generations it takes to achieve what Im talking about.

    <div class="md"><p>But this is a linear bloodline.  It would be different if it was a cousin that was in the line.</p>

<p>This goes parent-child-grandchild etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not thinking about this clearly or maybe I didnt explain it well.  Its always a straight line.  Look pick any point in this he beget she, and instead of the daughter that was chosen choose a different child, that would have others who would birth others exponentially.  No matter what branch it will always be a straight line.  Thats the point.  Literally all of you could follow a line back to this line of people.</p>

<p>Oh maybe this will make it more clear.  How many great great great great great great great grand children would there be if all of the William family had only 2?  2<sup>16</sup> (based on my count of marriages) is 65,536.   Now imagine if they werent just 2 but a nice low average of 4.  Wow look:  4,294,967,296  Yep.  We&#39;re all related.  And its always a straight line.</p>

<p>Also this seems to defy some odds, the average generational length based on this time line is 52 years.  It should be lower probably based generational over lap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe this excuse either. The royals commited incest to keep the power close. They would never interbreed with their slaves/serfs. The blood lines have been traced and I am not related. This argument seems to be commonly used when this is brought up. Bush, Obama, Romney are all cousins and drink beer together on family reunions where they plot to take over the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting, Interesting.  And while that may be true.  I am not a knights templar or freemason and if you are not an adept, you are nothing in their eyes.  The bushes have followed in their ancestral traditions and have continued to pledge allegiance to the secret societies.  </p>

<p>I, however, do not.  And that is why this is very important information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The founders of America escaped England because they didn&#39;t like monarchies, where power was passed father to son... Yet, we have had two Presidents serve terms, one being the son of the other, and their terms were only separated by one person. Pretty self explanatory right on that point alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are, as a whole, risk-averse i.e. far more willing to go with the devil they know than risk the new one. That&#39;s part of the reason why chain-stores are able to beat out local stores - if you go anywhere in the world, McDonalds is, more or less, still McDonalds (the other reason is economy of scale, but let&#39;s not get into that). The demographics of people who voted for Bush, Jr. were strongly older, richer, and married, which is to say that they were the most risk-averse because they had more to lose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even like they were hiding the fact that part of the campaign was &quot;If you liked Bush, you&#39;ll like Bush, Jr!&quot;. They had Bush, Sr. campaigning for his son pretty strongly. A good strategy, since Bush, Sr. won in a landslide. Heck, part of that was because he was capitalizing on Reagan&#39;s success by pledging to continue his policies - &quot;If you liked Reagan, you&#39;ll like his former VP Bush!&quot;.</p>

<p>I think that it&#39;s more likely that the known irrational tendencies of human decision-making are at fault than the unknown efforts of a neo-monarchist conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make a very good point, and I do agree to some extent that human&#39;s natural aversion to that which is new is probably the main problem here. That kind of plays into the way that Bush Jr got elected into a second term as well. </p>

<p>It is weird that there are all kinds of stipulations for what it takes to be eligible to be a President, yet being related to a past president elect is not something that would disqualify anyone. Seems like a bit of a loophole there. </p>

<p>I mean, think about anytime there are free giveaways from radio stations or other sales gimmicks, it says clearly in the fine print that you cannot be related to anyone who works for the company doing the giveaway.</p>

<p>All that being said, we don&#39;t need to go into the whole recount issue, where Gore won the majority of the votes until it was demanded that they be recounted over and over until enough votes went &#39;missing&#39; one way or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s basically two schools of thought on it: one is that the people need to be protected from an emergent oligarchy. We can&#39;t have a hereditary and perpetual ruling-class so we can&#39;t have related politicians and we need term limits. The other is that if you&#39;re going to have a democracy, you have a democracy and trust that people will make the right choice. If they think that the best man for the job is the guy who&#39;s been in politics for 20 years and is related to a bunch of politicians, then you respect the people&#39;s choice.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t know which group is right. I do know, however, that both ideals fall short of the current system, which is the worst of both worlds.</p>

<p>As for Flordia - jeesh, yeah. If anybody doesn&#39;t believe that conspiracies exist, they need to take a look at the completely astro-turfed &quot;protests&quot; that happened there in 2000. The Republicans definitely learned their lesson there - astro-turfed protests work, but try to make them at least half-ways look like they&#39;re not faked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A while back I read in an LA Times article that Obama is related to Bush ( <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/10/barack-obama-related-to-sarah-palin-rush-limbaugh-bush.html">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/10/barack-obama-related-to-sarah-palin-rush-limbaugh-bush.html</a>). How odd is that? I&#39;ve also read somewhere that 49 of the presidents were all related (with the exception of Grover Cleveland, out something like that) but I&#39;ve been trying to figure out if that&#39;s true or not.

<p>&quot;In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern. Although the so-called &quot;moral issues&quot; were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent. &quot;

<p>Silent weapons for quiet wars was basically the topic of the first bilderberg meeting.  </p>

<p>Bill Cooper used to say that if the word &quot;sheeple&quot; makes you upset, then he has hit his target by saying. And if it didn&#39;t then, he would say, that it was not meant for you because you are one of the &quot;rational, intelligent listeners&quot; . I do not mind the term because I know it does not apply to me.  Does it apply to you?  Do you feel like a sheeple?  I hope not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2nd degree. It&#39;s simple really, we&#39;ve been at war with the Templars (let&#39;s use that as their name from now on. It, like ours has changed several times so we&#39;ll do this for simplicity&#39;s sake) for ages. The reason all western religions are based on dichotomy was an attempt by regular people to understand the clashing of forces beyond their comprehension, but that is a story for another time. Well in the crusades the Templars put a considerable amount of their power on the line in the hopes of winning the Vatican to their cause. We were trying to do the same under the name of the Knights Hospitaller, however, we saw great promise in Saladin and as the enemy of my enemy is my friend, we won him to our cause. At this point we began circulating false reports of our dwindling power due to battles with Saladin, what was actually occurring was a large troop transfer to Saladin. With Saladin battering the Templar forces we began spreading rumors (actually just reporting actual Templar secret activites) to Pope Clement V who, upon seeing the Hospitallers and Templars dwindling in strength, requested a meeting with our two Grand Masters. This is when we, the Freemasons truly turned the tables on the Templars. Knowing Templar Grand Master de Molay was a lover of french wines, our Grand Master de Villaret made up an excuse to not show up and sent an obscene amount of wine to make up for his absence. Then all it took was previously placed servants constantly filling his glass for him to make Pope Clement believe all the things we&#39;d been telling him about the Templars the whole time. Later, the pope contacted us asking what could be done about this Templar menace so we pointed him in the direction of King Phillip IV of France, who was a large debtor of the Templars and therefore well motivated to see to their downfall. Que Friday the 13th 1307 and the Templars being forced into a more underground group. They did flee to scottland and the seas as mentioned, and we persued them to Scottland, where we changed our name. We stole their skull and bones symbol as an insult to them, much as the early Christians stole the fish symbol from Aphrodite. </p>

<h2>I hope you will give me the same attention in reading what I believe to be the <em>true story</em> of the fall of the Knights Templar.  </h2>

<p>&quot;Pope Adrian IV had died; [the] two rival popes were elected: Alexander III by the Sicilian group, and Victor III by theimperial party. At first the Templars acknowledged Victor; but in 1161 they switch their allegiance to Alexander. There wasprobably some sort of secret arrangement behind this, for by January 7th of the following year the famous Bull was issued. By the terms of this document, the Templars were released from all spiritual ties except to the Holy See [itself]; they werepermitted to have special burial-grounds in their own houses; they could have chaplains of their own; they had no tithes topay; [which in that day and age was miraculous] and were allowed to receive tithes [which was absolutely incredible]. Nobody who had once entered the Order could leave it, except to join one with a stricter discipline. The stage [dear listeners] was setfor clerical hatred of the Templars and Hospitallers (who had similar privileges) [and in fact were one and the same and stillare today], although the advantages to the Pope from the combined support of these two Orders could hardly be overestimated&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In 1184 an incident occurred which inspired a great deal of distrust of the Order, although the rarity of its occurrenceshould have underlined the fact that it was nothing of much consequence. [You see,] the English knight, Robert of St. Albansleft the Templars, became a Moslem, and led an army for Saladin against Jerusalem, then in the hands of the Franks. Thecharge against the Templars that they were secret Mussulmans or allies with the Saracens does not seem borne out by the factthat Saladin accused them of treacherous truce-breaking and other crimes and—unlike his usual chivalrous self—took asolemn oath that he would execute such Templar captives as he could obtain, as “beyond the limits of Islam and infidelity alike.” Nor did they make any [attempts] to invoke any religious bond with Saladin when they were captured, as we know fromthe Arabic
 Life of Saladin
written contemporaneously by his secretary, Qadi Yusuf. Strong evidence of this is given in theevents which followed the terrible Battle of Hittin. Two years before, Saladin had made a pact with the Assassins that they would give him a free hand to continue his Holy War against the Franks [which we discussed on an earlier program]. On July 1st, 1187, he captured Tiberias. He attacked nearby Hittin at dawn on Friday, July 3rd. Thirty thousand [Christians; 30,000Christians!] were captured, including the King of Jerusalem. No Templar [not one] is mentioned in the detailed Arab accountas asking for mercy on religious or other grounds, although all knew that Saladin had issued a war-cry: “Come to death,Templars!” The Grand Master, Gerard of Ridefort, and several other knights were among those taken. Saladin offered themtheir lives if they would see the light of the True Faith. [Well, according to history,] none accepted, and all these knights werebeheaded except, admittedly, the Templar Grand Master. [Could it be that he did accept the true faith, or the “light of the truefaith,” as Saladin had put it?] A non-Templar, Reginald of Chatillon, tried to invoke the sacred code of Arab hospitality, andother Crusaders claimed that they were Moslems, and were spared: none of them were Templars or Hospitallers. Reginaldand the Templars collectively were sentenced to death for breaking the truce and the “war crime” of killing unarmed pilgrimsto Mecca. Arab accounts include only a few references which could be construed as indicating any collusion with theChristian army. One says that on the Friday at midday ([and] the battle lasted for two days), Sultan Saladin issued the attackcry to be passed along the Sarasin host, “On for Islam!”, at which the striped banner of the Templars was raised, “and the EmirLion-of-the-Faith said, ‘Are those Sultan (Saladin) Yusef’s allies, of whom I have heard from the Reconnaisance men?’” [Well,]this cannot be regarded as anything at all conclusive. The only other reference is to a body of Templars who went over to theSaracen side, and whose supposed descendants survive to this day as the Salibiyya ([which means] Crusader) tribe in north Arabia&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This engagement [folks] spelt the end of real Western power in Palestine for over seven hundred years, although it didstimulate the unsuccessful Third Crusade. Although the Templars—and some other Crusaders—were still in the Holy Land hey had lost almost all of their possessions there. But in the West lay the real seat of their power. At this time their Europeanpossessions numbered over seven thousand estates and foundations. Although principally concentrated in France andEngland, they had extensive properties in Portugal, Castile, Leon, Scotland and Ireland, Germany, Italy, and Sicily. WhenJerusalem was lost, their headquarters were transferred to Paris. This building, like all their branch churches, was known asthe Temple. It was here that the French King Philip the Fair took refuge in 1306, to escape a civil commotion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is said thatthis visit gave him his first insight into the real wealth of the order: [Now, remember, the wealth was not for the members, forthey practiced the first true Socialism—international Socialism, or Communism.] the fabulous treasures which his hostshowed him giving the bankrupt monarch the idea to plunder the knights on the pretext that they were dominated by heresies.Phillip the Fair was not entirely without some grounds for attacking the Templars. [For] in 1208 we find Pope InnocentIII, a great friend of the Order, censuring them publicly for “Causing their churches to be thrown open for Mass to be saidevery day with loud ringing of bells, bearing the cross of Christ on their breasts but not caring to follow his doctrines whichforbid to giving offense to any of the little ones who believe in him. Following the doctrines of demons, they affix their crossof their Order upon the breast of every kind of scoundrel, asserting that whoever by paying two or three pence a year becameone of their fraternity could not, even if interdicted, be deprived of Christian burial . . . and thus they themselves, beingcaptive to the devil, cease not to make captive the souls of the faithful, seeking to make alive those whom they knew to bedead . . .”The first sign of an attempt to bring some sort of physical restraint upon the Templars came from Henry III of England.[For] in 1252 he hinted that he might try to seize some of the property of the Order: “You prelates and religious,” he said,“especially you Templars and Hospitallers, have so many liberties and charters that your enormous possessions make you ravewith pride and haughtiness. What was imprudently given must therefore be prudently revoked; and what was inconsiderately bestowed must be considerately recalled.” [Those were the words of the King.]The Master of the Templars immediately replied: “What sayest thou, O King? Far be it that thy mouth should utter sodisagreeable and silly a word. So long as thou dost exercise justice thou wilt reign; but if thou infringe it, thou wilt cease to beKing!”[Now remember that the Knights Templar at that time were the very first international bankers. They were the wealthiestOrder, wealthiest group, then known in the world—even surpassing the kings of the different countries that existed. And eventhough the Hospitallers were created before the Knights Templar, eventually the two became the same Order, though to thepublic and to the rulers of Europe, they were different orders with different names.]The haughty Templars of the fourteenth century owned land and revenues, gained steadily in honor and importance.They might have thrones had they wanted them; for such was their power towards the end that, banded together (as onehistorian points out), they could have overcome more than one of the smaller countries of Europe. Perhaps, though, they aimed even higher than that. If their eventual aim was world hegemony, they could not have organized themselves better, orplanned their aristocratic hierarchy more thoroughly. [And you will see that that&#39;s been carried over even onto the modern-day.] The pride, arrogance, and complete confidence and self-sufficiency of the Order is something which shows through eventhe least inspired pages of the chroniclers. Their power was legendary:“Everywhere they had churches, chapels, tithes, farms, villages, mills, rights of pasturage, of fishing, of venery, of wood.They had also in many places the right of holding annual fairs which were managed and the tolls received by some of thebrethren of the nearest houses or by their donates or servants. The number of their preceptories is, by the most moderatecomputation, rated at nine thousand; the annual income of the Order put at about six million [pounds] sterling: an[unbelievable, unimaginable] sum for those times!&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Heres where we get into the &quot;good part&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;There had been continued rivalry between the Templars and the Hospitallers [on the surface, underneath, they were oneand the same]; and Clement, six months after his enthronement, wrote asking them to visit him for a conference, ostensibly for the purpose of making plans for aiding the kings of Armenia and Cyprus. The Pope was, however, hoping that he couldeffect a reconciliation between the two Orders, which would in turn strengthen his own position as their only ultimate head.William de Villaret, Master of the Hospital, was fully engaged in an attack upon the Saracens of Rhodes when the invitationarrived, and could not obey it; but Jacques de Molay, Grand Master of the Temple, decided to accept. He handed over thedefense of Limassol in Cyprus to the Order&#39;s Marshall, collected sixty knights, packed 150,000 gold florins plus much othertreasure, and set sail for France&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At Paris, de Molay was received with honors by the King who was plotting his downfall. In Poitiers, he met Clement, anddiscussed the possibilities of a fresh Crusade. De Molay opined that only a complete alliance of all Christendom could be of any avail against the Moslems, and that the amalgamation of the two Orders was not a good idea. The Grand Master returnedto Paris; and almost at once rumors began to circulate about certain serious charges to be preferred against the Order.Troubled at this campaign, the Master (together with Rimbaud de Caron, Preceptor of Outremer; Jeffrey de Goneville,Preceptor of Aquitane, and Hugh de Peraudo, Preceptor of France) returned to Poitiers to justify the Order before the Pope.An audience took place, about April of 1307, in which the Pope mentioned the charges which have been made. Thecommission understood that their answers satisfied Clement, and returned to the capital in good heart. But this [dearlisteners] was only the beginning.The method by which the charges were originally said to have been made was through a former Templar who had beenexpelled from the Order for heresy and other offenses. This Squin de Flexian found himself in prison, together with anotherman (a Florentine named Noffo Dei), and they thought (or were told) that they could obtain their release and a pardon for thecrime of which they were currently accused if only they would testify against the Order. One account has it that de Flexiancalled for the governor of the prison, saying that he had a disclosure to make which he could tell the King personally; andwhich would be more to him than the conquest of [an entire] kingdom. Another chronicle has it that both men were degradedTemplars, and had been actively engaged in the revolt against the King during which Philip had been forced to take refugewith the Templars. It is further stated that Cardinal Cantilupo, the Chamberlain to the Pope, who had been in an associationwith the Templars since he was eleven years old, had confessed some of their doings to his master&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ten main charges were made by de Flexian against the Order:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each Templar on his admission swore never to quit the Order, and to further its interests by right or wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>The heads of the Order are in secret alliance with the Saracens, and they have more of Mohammedan infidelity thanChristian faith. [And] proof of the latter includes that they make every novice spit upon the cross and trample upon it, andblaspheme the faith of Christ in various ways.</p></li>
<li><p>The heads of the Order are heretical, cruel and sacrilegious men. Whenever any novice, on discovering the iniquity of the Order, tries to leave it, they kill him and bury the body secretly by night. They teach women who are pregnant by themhow to procure abortion, and secretly murder such newborn children.</p></li>
<li><p>They are infected with the errors of the Fratecelli; they despise the Pope and the authority of the Church; they scornthe sacraments, especially those of penance and confession. They pretend to comply with the rites of the Church simply to avoid detection.</p></li>
<li><p>The superiors are addicted to the most infamous excesses of debauchery. If anyone expresses his repugnance to this, heis punished by perpetual captivity.</p></li>
<li><p>The Temple-houses are the receptacle of every crime and abomination that can be committed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Order works to put the Holy Land into the hands of the Saracens, and favors them more than the Christians.</p></li>
<li><p>The Master is installed in secret and few of the younger brethren are present at this ceremony. It is strongly suspectedthat on this occasion he repudiates the Christian faith, or does something contrary to right.</p></li>
<li><p>Many statutes of the Order are unlawful, profane and contrary to Christianity. [In fact, some of them are stonepenises.] The members are therefore forbidden under pain of perpetual confinement to reveal them to anyone.</p></li>
<li><p>No vice or crime committed for the honor or benefit of the Order is held to be a sin&quot;</p></li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;[Now] these charges were later augmented by others which were collected through testimony from other enemies of theOrder, and included such assertions as the use of the phrase
Ya Allah
([which means] O, Allah!) and the adoration of an idolcalled the Head of Baphomet. [In fact, the Head of Baphomet was not an idol that they worshiped but represented thereceptacle of the intelligence, or the seat of the intelligence: the brain, the light, Lucifer, the gift of intellect, primordialknowing—and that is what
really
the object of veneration was.]</p>

<p>Philip and his advisers prepared a great secrecy for the descent upon this powerful organization [the Knights Templar].[And] on the 12th of September, 1307, sealed letters were sent to all the governors and Royal officers throughout France,instructing them to arm themselves on the twelfth of the next month and open the sealed orders—and to act upon themforthwith. By the morning of Friday, October 13, [and on that day] almost every Templar in France was in the hands of theKing&#39;s men. [And thus was born the legend that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day. </p>

<p>And notice that it was October , Friday the13th, the very first October surprise.]
Hardly one seems to have had any warning. [But they did because, before the kingacted, the Templars had moved their wealth, their treasure, and their holdings out of the country of France.] On the day before his arrest, the Grand Master had actually been chosen by the King to be a pall-bearer at a state funeral.</p>

<p>The secret orders had it that all Templars were to be seized, tortured and interrogated. Confessions were to be obtainedfrom them; pardon might be promised only if they confessed. And all their goods were to be expropriated. [But the only thingthat they really got was the actual real estate property held by the Templars in France and nowhere else. None of the gold,none of their wealth, none of their jewels, none of their treasures, none of the relics that have recovered from the Holy Landwere ever found.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The King himself took possession of the Temple at Paris as soon as the Grand Master and his knights were arrested. Thenext day the University of Paris assembled, together with canons and other functionaries and ministers; and the Chancellordeclared that the knights had been proceeded against for heresy. Two days later the University met in the Temple and someheads of the Order, including the Grand Master, were interrogated. They are said to have confessed to &#39;forty years&#39; guilt’[whatever that means].</p>

<p>[Now] whether de Molay and others confessed on that occasion or not, the King was emboldened to publish anaccusation, in which he called the knights “polluters of the error and devouring wolves.” A public meeting was called in theRoyal Gardens and addressed by monks and representatives on this subject.Edward II was the son-in-law of the French Philip, and to him was sent a priest who invited the English monarch to act atonce against the Order in Britain. </p>

<p>[Well,] Edward almost at once wrote to say that the charges seemed to him to be incredible.But Pope Clement wrote on November 22nd to London, assuring Edward that the Master of the Temple had confessed of hisown free will that knights on their admission to the Order had denied Christ. Others had admitted idolatry and other crimes.He therefore called upon the King of England to arrest all Templars within his domains, and to place their lands and goods incustody until their guilt or innocence should be ascertained. [He condemned them to torture by the Dominican monks underthe Inquisition until they confessed their guilt or were dead.]</p>

<p>[Now notice the date folks: November the 22nd in the year 1307 
. That&#39;s a significant date in our history and has directbearing, as you will see, many hours down the line.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Before [the King of England] received this missive, [he] seems to have been sorely troubled by the allegations. He wrote,on November [the] 26th, to the Seneschal of Agen, asking about the charges. On the 4th of December he wrote to the kings of Portugal, Castile, Aragon and Sicily, asking “what they had heard, and adding that he had given no credit to it”. He wrote tothe Pope himself on December [the] 10th, expressing disbelief of what the French King said, and begging His Holiness toinstitute an enquiry [Well folks,] by December [the] 15th, when the Papal Bull arrived, Edward felt that he must act upon itwithout question. </p>

<p>On December [the] 26th he wrote to the Pope that his orders would be obeyed. [But] in the interim,Edward had sent word to Wales, Scotland and Ireland that the Templars were all to be seized, as in England; but they were tobe treated with kindness.On October [the] 19th, less than a week after they had been arrested [in France], 140 prisoners were being tortured by theDominican Imbert, in the Paris Temple. Promises and the rack produced many confessions. Thirty-six of the examinees diedduring these proceedings. Throughout France the racks worked overtime, and the confessions poured forth. [Many good menwere crippled for the rest of their lives.] Many of these were contradictory and confused; [and] perhaps there is little wonderof that. [How many of you could resist, even for five minutes, the tortures of the medieval Inquisition?]</p>

<p>The Pope now seemed a little uneasy at the arbitrary methods which were being employed. Philip wrote sharply to himsaying that he, the King, was doing God&#39;s work, and rendered accounts to God alone. He offered to turn over all the goods of the Templars to the service of the Holy Land, Clement, still a weakling, merely stipulated that the inquisitions of each Bishopshould be confirmed by a Provincial Council, and that the examination of the heads of the Order should be reserved tohimself. Now we hear a constant succession of confessions and retractions, allegations that the heads of the Order confessedcompletely and spontaneously to the Pope himself. The Pope himself, for some unexplained reason [folks], tried to escape toBordeaux, but was stopped by the King. Now he was the monarch&#39;s captive as well as his creation&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Detailed confessions of individual Templars have been kept on record, many of them undoubtedly obtained by extremeracking and other tortures. The Templars who were prepared to defend the Order in court were brought to Paris, to thenumber of five hundred and forty-six. Deprived of their knightly habits, and the sacraments of the Church, they had nomeans to acquire defense counsel. Their numbers rose to nine hundred, and now they clamored for the presence of the GrandMaster, who was held elsewhere. An Act of Accusation in the name of the Pope was drawn up, and seventy-five Templarsdrew up the Defense.</p>

<p>The accusation had it now that “At the time of their reception they were made to deny God, Christ, the Virgin, etc., and inparticular to declare that Christ was not the true God, but a false prophet, who had been crucified for his own crimes and notfor the redemption of the world. They spat and trampled upon the cross, especially on Good Friday. They worshiped a cat,which sometimes appeared in their chapters. Their priests, when celebrating Mass, did not pronounce the words of consecration. They believed that their Master could absolve them from their sins. They were told at their reception that they might abandon themselves to all kinds of licentiousness. They have idols in all their provinces, some with three faces, somewith one. They worshiped these idols in their chapters, believed that they could save them, regarded them as the givers of wealth to the order and of the fertility to the earth; they touched them with cords which they afterwards tied around theirown bodies [underneath their robes—and that is still practiced today by Freemasons
and 
by the Mormon Church]. </p>

<p>Thosewho at the time of their reception would not comply with these practices were put to death or imprisoned.”The reply of the Templars denied every charge and stated that they had been subjected to every kind of illegality sincetheir arrest. Fifty-four of the knights who had volunteered to defend the Order were committed to the flames, having beendeclared relapsed heretics, before the trials had even started. [And you&#39;ll see this number fifty-four crop up later, and even inthe modern-day, and sometimes it&#39;s fifty-four plus one—the Grand Master, who later was burned at the stake.]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Four years to the day after the first arrests, the Pope led a convocation of one hundred and fourteen bishops to come to afinal decision about the Templar Order. [Well, folks,] the prelates of Spain, England, Germany, Denmark, Ireland andScotland called for the Templars to be allowed to defend themselves. The Pope reported by closing the Session almost at once.[He would not hear of it.] Out of fifteen hundred to two thousand Templars who were in hiding in the vicinity, nine knightscame forward to testify for the Order. The Pope doubled his guard and sent a message to the King to do the same, as there was still danger from the hidden knights. They were not heard. Only one Italian prelate and three French ones voted toprevent the Order from putting in its defense.Now Philip, deciding that something should be done to hasten affairs, sent off for Venice and the conference. His arrivalhad an electric effect. On his sole authority the Pope almost immediately abolished the Order of a secret consistory. [And]this was on March 22nd, [in the year] 1313.
116
 [And 1313 plays a significant number later on as that was a famous address inNew Orleans, as some of you may remember.] On May 2nd, when the Bull was published, the Order ceased officially to exist.The Grand Master, assumed but not proved to be guilty, was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment. Most of the other knightswere released and many of these past their remaining days in poverty. De Molay and one of his chiefs, Guy of Auvergne,[pronounced or] proclaimed their innocence on the public stage to which they had been taken to have sentence announced.The King, upon hearing [them recant their confession], immediately had them committed to the flames.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway - to the OP&#39;s theory - hasn&#39;t it been proved that we (of European descent) are pretty much <strong>all</strong> related to kings back in the 11th &amp; 12th centuries, just due to the simple fact that if you go back that many generations you end up with more ancestors than people alive at the time?</p>

<p>But yes, I definitely agree that the Bush&#39;s dynasty is corrupt and premeditated. Not sure about the link back to the founding fathers of free-masonry &amp; the knights templar though.</p>
