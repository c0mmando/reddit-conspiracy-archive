<p>You had a few folks heading up discussions in the new queue, sometimes with sarcasm, other times with puns. These prompted more serious discussion, and the exploration was always in motion. The names were fairly consistent (you know the ones, no need to mention them)</p>

<p>What happened this summer?</p>

<p>Sometime over the summer, this subreddit became toxic, attacking your community leaders. </p>

<p>Burying inquiry into current events is NOT the way this subreddit works. </p>

<p>Where did these people come from? </p>

<p>Who are they? </p>

<p>Some are ancient accounts, some are very new. But all of them that are doing this are NOT the regular members of this subreddit.</p>

<p>And, most importantly, why are they here NOW? What are they covering up? It has to be something bigger than the normal sort of conspiracy for there to be such a broadscale invasion of this subreddit.</p>

It&#39;s kind of bordering on circle jerk in that there is no directly linked content to discuss.

<p>Seriously people, use RES and just hide stuff you don&#39;t want to see, and participate in discussion you do want to see.  Complaining about the sub is fruitles and more annoying than being spammed with blog posts and UFO landings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>obvioulsy r/conspiratard and r/skeptic have stepped up their game of trolling.</p>

<p>I think to some degree the actual paid trolls are just hitting their stride as the persona management tech is maturing, remember this is developing field and government is slow to react.</p>

<p>Also reddit&#39;s maturing as a key info nexus makes it a juicier target, and it avoided attention at first, maintaining the cohesion and quailty you mentioned before, while other more high profile sites were targeted earlier and have already been largely disrupted. </p>

<p>Then there is the proximity of the war with Iran and the next crash, the recent obvious coverups of multiple shooters at the theatre and the temple, things are just starting to heat up and the COINTEL types have to ramp up their response accordingly to keep the pressure on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol You&#39;re a few bricks short of a stack. Just because I posted here doesn&#39;t mean you can just assume that I believe whatever you want to stuff in that straw man. </p>

<p>Nobody believes that EVERY idiot from r/conspiratard or r/skeptic is a shill, most of you are just wounded amateur hour blowhards who massage their own egos by chewing at the fringe and r/conspiracy is an obvious target. Why pay a dog to chase cats?</p>

<p>Nevertheless a complete survey of the field does include a few of those who have graduated into professional agitators (like a sponsored skateboarder, usually recruited and managed by a private PR firm) or soldiers stuck at NAVY desk farms etc.</p>

<p>I have never accused a specific person of being a paid shill. I assume that the shills are lazy, and usually, when a prick takes the time to write a longwinded one sided garbage post like yours, right or wrong I assume he is just a sad piece of crap with nothing better to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be honest, I don&#39;t think that happens. </p>

<p>If you are attempting to associate those in this subreddit with a particular stereotype of some anti-scientific asshat basement dweller, then no, I think you&#39;re wrong. There have been an influx of said asshat basement dwellers, but TBH, I don&#39;t think that is a genuine representation of this community. Those whom have been here for a while know what I&#39;m referring to. </p>

<p>If someone provides well sourced evidence that is logical and presented in a respectful way, than regardless of its conclusions, it should be welcomed as valuable discussion. The kinds of devils advocate questions as well as well sourced critical materials are typically received in a productive capacity, whereby a thought-provoking discussion can arise.   </p>

<p>So I personally think there is a bit of poisoning the well by either rude, asshole Jones jocks, or sockpuppet forum-sliding accounts.</p>

<p>Edit: Ah, I see you&#39;re a fan of conspiratard and that you typically post aggressively contrarian arguments, phrased in a condescending tone...  I wonder why people called you out? . . . . .  </p>

I KNOW that someone interested in getting at the truth would logically lay out argumentation, provide sources to materials, and respectfully conduct conversation.</p>

<p>This subreddit probably does need some instruction on &quot;non-violent communication&quot;, but I&#39;m saying that at this point, it is very difficult to tell who is a legitimate user of this sub, and who is attempting to forum slide or play to the stereotype of calling others &quot;government shills&quot; or whatever. </p>

<p>I&#39;m posting this in defense of the legitimate users of this subreddit. We know how to provide empirical evidence and peacefully have conversations with contrarian views...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to believe this is the truth. The problem I see is that there seems to be a difference of opinion about what constitutes a &quot;reasonable and logical comment&quot; and what constitutes &quot;disinfo&quot;. Because disinfo is, quite often (especially if it&#39;s a quality artiste), presented quite logically and well-sourced... but specifically intended to reinforce the &quot;official government coverup&quot;. Well-sourced being: MSM shit. Logical being: laid out neatly to lead the reader <em>away</em> from investigation, not <em>into</em> it.</p>

<p>p.s. I like making sarcastic remarks about the transparency of fascism, tyranny, and the police state, because it appeals to a common denominator which isn&#39;t below the IQ of the common masses. i.e., most people will get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, that is a good point. Realizing that those kinds of discussions can get quite circular (sources vs sources)... If investigation has taken place on the part of the real r-cons user, than that person should be able to point out contradictions in the &quot;MSM version&quot;, or at least relay the understanding of why one would be concerned about, or question some &quot;official&quot; aspect of the &quot;story&quot;.</p>

<p>RE: your PS, I should have clarified... I mean negative sarcastic remarks, which are usually strawman-based. I&#39;m actually okay with clever sarcastic remarks, because they usually can drive out some discussion if thoughtful enough. </p>

<p>There needs to be an effort in this sub of responding in an ACADEMIC manner. This entails solid sourcing of materials, logical argumentation, non-violent communication, and insightful comments to spawn further inquiry... just my opinion i suppose...</p>

I know that is how I feel, and I know for sure that I&#39;m no agent or paid shill.

<p>I can&#39;t believe that I get shit on as much as I do for asking for evidence. I really don&#39;t see what is bad about getting proof to make your case stronger, but apparently many of you frown on that. Not pointing fingers or accusing anyone, I like many of you, even if I downvote some of your posts. Most of you are intelligent folks with interesting viewpoints and thoughts, and I like the discussions that happen here. Well, most of the discussions. The intelligent ones that allow for multiple viewpoints to be expressed without the words &quot;sheep&quot; or &quot;shill&quot; being thrown around. Just because I don&#39;t believe some of the same conspiracies that you guys do doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m here to spread disinfo or something, it just means I don&#39;t agree. But I do value all of your viewpoints and thoughts.</p>

<p>There, been wanting to say that for a while now. I know I don&#39;t just follow what the majority does and that can bite me in the ass sometimes, so be gentle with the downvotes and name-calling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This subreddit has been in decline for a while.  You get the sheep from r/politics and the trolls from everywhere else more often than you get a genuine post anymore.  But i do see that there has been an uptick in the degradation of post quality mire so now than before.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it is because of the upcoming election.  Forums like this one are being flooded with crap that links one side to a conspiracy all while painting the opposition as the hero of truth.  You then get responders who are rooting for one side or the other engaging in flame wars over the nonsense.</p>

<p>Both sides are full of shit yet everyone in the country needs to hitch to one of them it seems.  Guess social engineering really does work on the simple minded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that&#39;s been bugging me for a while is the fact that there is basically a torrent of stories/theories constantly being flooded into this SR. I get that posts are about the topic of the SR and belong here - <a href="/r/archery">/r/archery</a> suddenly having content other than archery stuff would be similarly stupid but sometimes it seems that people are posting all sorts of completely random things and just slapping a &quot;maybe conspiracy&quot; tag on it.</p>

<p>It feels like there&#39;s a great deal of talk on topics just for the sake of having something to talk about. This seems strange but perhaps that is the classic reddit mentality at work. But don&#39;t we need to be able to focus the attention on the things that are actionable? There&#39;s plenty of conspiracies with real documented evidence that needs to be propped up in the public&#39;s eye but these things are being lost is the noise of people posting stuff, be it eagerness, ignorance or just malicious intent.</p>

<p>No. it&#39;s the three-in-a-row comments directed at me to characterize me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bad enough that I have a vote stalker (confirmed by the mods and at least a half dozen people in PM). I don&#39;t need a comment stalker. If you have something productive to add to the conversation, I don&#39;t mind it. I <strong>DO</strong>, however, mind it when your message is one that characterizes me as a paranoid lunatic. (Yeah.

    <div class="md"><p>As a subscriber to both conspiracy and the conspiratard subreddits I know that I along with many others are not paid, I would doubt there has been a cent made by either side. We would only like to see evidence, thus when supposed things are &quot; proven&quot; based on evidence that is hearsay or backed by someone with a PhD in a non relevant field to the discussion, it leads us to point out the problems in the argument. Looking back on many of my classes in college which were mostly political science, history, religion, criminal justice, military science, and philosophy, there were few proven facts, most everything studied were theories and almost everything could be spun into a conspiracy. The fact of the matter is that there are ways to make anything fit your intentions if you start using secondary sources or omitting facts that are convenient. I once got a D on a paper discussing the coronation of Charlemagne, because it did not line up with the professor&#39;s view, even though what I wrote was supposed to be the many theories as to why it happened. I covered all theories I could dig up yet when making an argument for what I believed it to be I was, in effect, downvoted by my teacher. And that is what happens here in conspiracy. Presenting a differing opinion for the sake of discussion is downvoted. I have a future father inlaw who believes conspiracies and when anyone offers that there could be another explanation he gets angry and calls us a communist etc. I think many would rather see arguments go through proofs like seen in a philosophy class. 
If anyone is making money out their opinions it is people like Alex Jones who at best would be considered an entertainer and fiction writer, similar to Dan Brown, or Tom Clancy who both use facts to add realism to their stories and add alternate endings to today&#39;s issues.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, exactly. Discussions usually have two sides, and in the case or conspiracies, two common thoughts are &quot;this is real&quot; and &quot;this might be real, give me something to believe&quot;.  I never said I want to disprove conspiracies, I actually believe a few. For example, I believe that the Holmes case is awfully fishy, 9/11 is obviously some kind of cover-up, and that the Vatican has more control over our country (and probably most of the world) than many of us would like to admit.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen this community &quot;come under attack&quot; as much as I have seen people suddenly become interested and not have a single clue where to start when exploring the world of conspiracies. You, for one, seem to think that <em>any</em> ignorance or request for evidence means that the person is a shill or some agent. Were you fully aware of all the facts when you first starting getting into this subculture? I doubt it, not many are. And that is fine, it is expected. Us conspiracy theorists can get into some heavy shit and not all of it is beginner friendly. Answer a few questions for people once in a while and don&#39;t get so damn defensive. You seem like you know a lot about this stuff, spread the info around when people ask you about it.</p>

I&#39;ve had no less than 10 in the 2 years I&#39;ve been a member of this community, due to stalkers... about one every 3 months. One of the other respected members of this community asked me, politely, to stop shuffling my usernames so that the community could keep better track of me. So, I&#39;ve stuck with this one now about 9 months (longest ever, so far). Up until last weekend, I hadn&#39;t had any problems worthy of note (CowzGoesMoo being the only exception, but that was generic attacks on the mods and I think he finally worked through his issues.).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not oblivious to being followed <strong>within</strong> this subreddit.</p>

<p>So, you believe some conspiracies, but others are obviously bullshit and need to be debunked. Is that it?</p>

<p>Oh, by the way... with one of my other accounts (former mod account here), I posted <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yfzfz/public_service_announcement_from_a_retired/">this</a>, just 3 days ago... the content of which is , you know, ... mathematically accurate and stuff. The fact that you &quot;haven&#39;t seen&quot; it may simply be because you aren&#39;t looking at it... eager to dismiss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No other usernames, I tend to just stick with this name on pretty much all sites I go since it has meaning to me and is easy to remember. I guess iI can see why you would want to change names if people are stalking you, but I can assure you that isn&#39;t the case with me. You make a lot of posts in many different threads and I try to read as many threads as possible. I honestly think it is just coincidence.</p>

<p>Kinda. I believe some theories (the ones I listed earlier are a few examples) but I just can&#39;t buy others (the moon landing being faked for example). <strong>However</strong>, if some kind of evidence pops up to prove me wrong I will gladly read it and seriously consider it and I could end up changing my mind. I don&#39;t think those theories &quot;need&quot; to be debunked, I just personally don&#39;t believe them and understand why others may not as well. </p>

<p>And yes, I may be eager to dismiss (I try to be forgiving - it can be a flaw sometimes) but you seem to be eager to accuse. Just calling it like I see it. But seriously, lay off with the stalking thing. Remember, you came into a thread I started just yesterday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This forum isn&#39;t about conspiracies. Its about how, they believe, everything you know is wrong. Actual conspiracies, legitimate conspiracies with massive amounts of evidence are dismissed because IT MUST GO DEEPER. Take 9/11. An actual conspiracy between members of a religious sect and a central Asian government that was successfully carried out. This shit should be the crown jewel of conspiracy theorists. Every time someone calls them crazy they could point at it. Think about it. How many posts about religious minorities conspiring with state power come up here? But instead no, that couldn&#39;t possibly be what happened, we need to add at least 3 layers of batshit crazy on top to satisfy the ego because were soooo much smarter then everyone else.</p>
