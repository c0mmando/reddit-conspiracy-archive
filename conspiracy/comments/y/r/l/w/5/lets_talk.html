       I think you are wrong to call out 9000sins like this.  You are perpetuating the behaviour that you are drawing attention to.

       Honestly I do not really care about points, upvotes, downvotes. I am here for information to help me make decisions. I called him out on purpose,and what I said is truthful, why else make a post like that? There are many perpetuating this cycle. Enough is enough, maybe just maybe I may piss him or someone else off enough they will prove me wrong? And get back on track....But I digress....

       This calling out of disinfo agents, trolls and shills happens every once in a while here, as it should. New subscribers need to be aware of their existence, their allegiances and their agenda.

       It's one of those issues that won't go away , nor should it I guess.  But it seems to all get a bit hysterical sometimes.  To a degree it's an endless cycle.  One of the chief accusations made by the

       It has had 10 comments and 134 upvotes as I type this despite being 22 hours old.  So if you guys want to get on track, look at this.  A tale of corrupt local and state politicians, real estate businesses, police, FBI, etc:

       You can't vote against a botnet / paid shills. They are there watching for new posts, and downvote for any content that they don't want being visible. Ten downvotes right away is enough to bury a post.

       To a degree I think part of the problem is somewhat aggressive posts like yours. It's easy to blame shills and conspiratard for everything and get frustrated but on the whole I think it's best to maintain civility here.

       You should be commended for your passion and dedication but when a person starts from a position of arrogance or agression they weaken that postion in my opinion. Far better to make your point politely and gentlemenly if you ask me. You are a regular around here and I do n't want to patronise or belittle you.  Hopefully you can take my comments as well meaning criticism.

       Everyone has an agenda.  (on some level anyway) . If you take him on face value, he's frustrated and wants to air his point of view and open it up to discussion.

       I don't doubt there will be more introspection and soul searching but let's not jump to hasty conclusions about the motivations of people.

       All I am saying is , I think we should avoid being aggressive for a start.
      </p>
      <p>
       One way to ruin a community is to sew division and drama within it, and let human nature take over. In actual fact people are quite capable of destroying something good without outside intervention.  Aggressive comments just invite retaliation and drama.  Calm collected responses are better.

What opportunity I DO see is for everyone to stop acting like kids, grow a set, and get back on track... I could give a crap less who is here and who is not. What I do care about is the information or lack thereof that is getting and not getting posted.. And your mentality here is of a high schooler, really I want to see him go admit it?...

       No I would not, I called him out on his post, AND other comments I saw he made in the thread I refer too... I do not know him, I could care less, BUT when that person becomes part of the problem, they need to be called on it.. I have no ill will towards him, I do hope he stays, BUT enough is more than enough.......Let us ALL get back on track, or go elsewhere, it really is at that point. That is why I did this post, either we do it, or move on....

       Well, we seem to have a aquired a promising mod
       <a href="/u/supercede">
        /u/supercede

       in the process so perhaps 9000sins post was succesfull in that regard alone. Only time will tell though.  Based on my knowledge of supercede though, I think he could be a very welcome addition.

       This is either someone trolling, or someone disturbing, I would go with the former.. Downvote him to hell, or talk to the mods, I am sure if there is enough outcry they will take action..

       Wait a minute......
The mods want to color code users and use descriptive tags based on what they post? Well, who decides what tags are used? The actual users? Or the mods? What if you piss a mod of and suddenly you are tagged "zionist"? Everything you post will get downvoted to hell. But really, and this is the most ironic/sad part, but color coding people? Didn't Hitler do something like that? Different colors for homosexuals, Jews and other groups?

       I would hope that comparison to a nazi tactic would lead most to believe it is wrong.
Well, you didn't get it, of course. That part whizzed over your head, didn't it? 
EDIT: I didn't have to ask you if it is right or wrong. You said it was ok because r/conspiratard does it. That's why I asked whether two wrongs make a right. Damn dude! If you're going to post back and forth at least
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       to remember who said what and to whom. JFC!

       Considering libraries use the
       <em>
        Dewey
       </em>
       Decimal system, no. 
I never said I didn't apply it to them. I even asked : Does two wrongs make a right?
If this is saying "Yeah sure! It's ok for them to do it!" to you, then you lack the proper skill sets to take part in a forum.

       Uh, the fact that users get no say so in how they are labelled. Someone
       <em>
        other than
       </em>
       the user gets to pick it. How is this not fascist? 
You know what? Never mind. If you don't get it, you don't get it.

       He'll put a label on you, too, you know. And if you don't kiss ass properly, it won't be a positive labe.

       No. It was not. Although I didn't object to it. I left it until I deleted that account.

       The story goes like this

      <p>
       Troll says, "You're the biggest jackass on this sub."
      </p>
      <p>
       I shared this wittiness with the mods, sins offered to make my flair reflect that. sunshine (apparently) put the text in (it's just text, i can change it).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about mod-assigned flair that is visible to the public that the user cannot change. Different situation altogether.

       What is the difference between mod assigned and user assigned though.

       I assumed there was no difference .

       Currently it works like this (laymans terms / paraphrase-description)...
      </p>
      <p>
       Selection 1 is "do you want user flair in your subreddit?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Selection 2 is "can users set their own flair?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, r/conspiracy says "yes" to both. The available flair options (of color) that currently exist were written by Ambiversive and myself (Ambiversive did waaaaaaay too many colors - I trimmed it back to the selections you currently see).
      </p>
      <p>
       At present, there's no way to have both user-defined text
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       mod-defined (not changeable by users) stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it ever becomes available to do both, 9000sins has already told me he intends to implement mod-assigned flair.

       You seem to be one. If you do read them and like the vision they offer, you can also get involved in making his ideas a reality.
