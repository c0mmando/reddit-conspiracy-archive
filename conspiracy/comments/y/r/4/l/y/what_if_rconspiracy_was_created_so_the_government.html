    <div class="md"><p>It is not a forgone conclusion that the subjective feeling that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has gone to shit is the result of TPTB infiltrating it.  </p>

<p>People are free agents and are confused enough by themselves to spread disinformation and contribute to confusion and discord, whilst meaning well or out of boredom.</p>

<p>Do not forget there are numerous motivations that people can have for their actions and to jump to conclusions does no one any favors.  You&#39;ll be fighting ghosts and chasing shadows that way.</p>

<p>Sadly , I believe this sub is suffering mainly from growing pains, for want of a better phrase.   It&#39;s been growing faster than the community can reasonably cope with and maintain the character which made it attractive in the first place.  This happens everywhere both on the net and in businesses all over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately , the only remedy is strong moderation.  You&#39;ll never get that imaginary <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that you dream about in your mind , but done well , but you may end up with something worth subscribing too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like to think that&#39;s why we have people like Alex Jones and Ron Paul out there.  Now we may agree to disagree on what the true purpose of &quot;truth seekers&quot; like AJ or RP.  However, I do believe there are &quot;truth seekers&quot; or websites that have been created or are monitored by the government in order to keep tabs on those of us who might not go with the sheeple.  </p>

<p>I have no doubt whatsoever that the government is monitoring this subreddit and reddit itself.  There is nothing they don&#39;t monitor these days.  The difference seems to be the &quot;why&quot; behind the monitoring. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t give two flying fucks about this sub.  Why? we&#39;re zero threat.  We&#39;re completely un-unified, bicker amongst ourselves, and the entire concept of the sub allows for provably stupid shit to get posted and at least get a fair shake from the community.  There&#39;s also at least one other entire sub dedicated to making us look like fuckwits.  A vast majority of whom are obviously not under any sort of direction but just feel they&#39;re doing humanity some service by discrediting us.  </p>

<p>Add that together and this sub is comically easy to manipulate.  Anything really important they can either slide, caste doubt on, or call on their personal retard brigade with a few choice words like &quot;anti-semite&quot; strategically placed.</p>

<p>The reason they care a lot more what someone like Brandon Raub posts on facebook is his posts cannot be drowned out, and he probably has a lot of RL military buddies who can view his feed.  If they already hear hushed whispers of the same sentiment within the active duties, they sure as shit don&#39;t want them talking to each other once their contract is served.</p>

<p>Honestly, what are you going to do?  Post that 9-11 was an inside job?  They&#39;d just tell you to take a number and go stand by all the other assholes they are ignoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always said that TPTB let out conspiracy type info to damn us all to persecution later on.  All of our typed words are recorded and can be used against us.  Once they start bringing in laws that bar anti-govt speech as &quot;Terror speech&quot; or whatever, we could all be rounded up.  Think about in 1984, the O&#39;Brien character, he gives Winston all the info he needs and then sets him up.  It is a way to weed out cognitive dissonance and get the people who are not &quot;controlled&quot; out of the system because they could potentially cause a stir in the collective hivemind.  Like Jones could be O&#39;Brien.</p>

<p>addendum:  Weeding out the actual critical thinkers.  People that don&#39;t buy the bullshit.  They are the threat to the power elite.</p>

<p>Almost like, he started a program to sway conspiracy theorists investigations. Then all of a sudden he quits and our subreddit is confused as to who the mods are or where they went. Almost as if his job was done/cancelled/lost funding?</p>
