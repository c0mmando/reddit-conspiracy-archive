        I'm handing this thread over to supercede

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        [ Well hello everyone! First, let me say that I'm so very honored to play a role in this subreddit. OP, I'll take this post as a compliment, and say that I appreciate you bringing my placement up for discussion :) . I have been a user on reddit since about 2008, but for at least a year or so, I didn't care to post or comment, I only lurked. My previous username was
        <a href="/u/throneandaltar">
         /u/throneandaltar
        </a>
        . There's not much to see on that account. Interestingly enough(or not), I forgot my password and had some login troubles, so I had to create a new username. As for my personal interests, I have written academically about how social-media could specifically be used in an open-source, collaborative-research capacity, whereby each user expresses their brilliancy onto a community, receives feedback, and calibrates their thoughts and actions based on the brilliancy of the entire community. As a result, the brilliancy of the community- the credibility, the quality of information, and the actions that users take - are made holistically better. I'm happy to share my personal research with anyone interested. Anyway, I can assure you that I am a genuine poster here and have absolutely no relation to grapedinthemouth. I don't really care for him; actually, and I'm sure many of you feel the same way haha. 9000's "I'm Out" post seemed like as good of a post as any for me to air out some issues that I saw here, and some solutions that I thought would be helpful. I do have the utmost revere for this subreddit, and I hope to be a helpful and positive moderator here. Speaking to the rapidity of my succession into moderator status, the whole turn of events is just as amazing to me as it is to many of you! I had no inclination that I would be a mod here yesterday morning. I made some (I assume) well received suggestions about increasing the credibility and the authentic discussion of this subreddit. A few well known participants here "nominated" me to be a mod. I had a good conversation with sunshine-x, and other mods remembered some of my posts, so they gave me the go ahead, remarkably. :) I'm truly honored to be a moderator for this community. I want to be transparent with all of you, and if any one of you have questions of how I would like to see this subreddit develop, or about me personally, feel free to AMA. Getting to the definition of my username... The word "Supercede" or "Supersede" means a great deal to me, personally. Essentially, I know that the current status-quo can be made obsolete via the unique efforts of each one of us. In virtually any niche aspect of the Establishment(the matrix) that we witness, people with significant knowledge, integrity, and ambition could create localized organizations or solutions that would make the corrupt/coercive/contradictory aspects of the status-quo be irrelevant to our every-day existence. I genuinely believe that each of us should look for contradictions in reality and actively work to make those contradictions obsolete. The manifestation of supersedence is unique to each person's knowledge set and experience, and would involve taking action in a vast array of fields and contexts for each person. I would love to speak with any of you about some specific examples of how to "supersede", but I can tell you that it is a "philosophy" which I have taken hold of in a tangible way in my personal life with great success. Anyway, I'm so appreciative of the opportunity to be here. Again, I would love to speak with you guys about my vision for this place, so AMA!]

       EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE IS OP, ABOVE IS SUPERCEDE
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I don't write this to attack anyone, I genuinely would like to know where
       <a href="/u/supercede">
        /u/supercede
       </a>
       came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find his comments to be well formed and highly articulate.  I've nothing but respect for his meticulously thought out commentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       One small point does unsettle me however.  A redditor for over a year with such a powerful command of the English language with so little karma.  I know this is petty of me to ask but surely there is another username you use?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once this idea fluttered through my gray sponge I began to examine your writing style to see out of curiosity if i could link you to another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other redditor that I've found that shares your eloquence is
       <a href="/u/graped">
        /u/graped
       </a>
       in the mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't mean that supercede and graped are the same person, and its not an insult.  If someone compared me to graped i would consider it a complementary act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rapidity of the succession of supercede into moderator status on the very same day as 9000sins was going to disembark seems at a glance to be very preplanned.  Almost as if supercede, superseded a normal rise to such a status.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings me to the definition of supercede (more commonly spelled as supersede) I invite everyone to look into the definition for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly I invite supercede to introduce himself to the community for who he really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       I am NOT HGT, but for the sake of fun, if anyone guesses who I actually am without just randomly listing usernames I'll reward you with a month of reddit gold.  You have to explain how you uncovered it with your guess.

       I don't want to drag my everyday account into this mess because I'm not a mod and I'm still reserving my judgement in regards to supercede.  I enjoy this subreddit more than any other I don't want to piss off a brand new mod or the existing mod team.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as what my other account is, I will withhold that information.  Its an account you most likely read here a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as graped being a troll, he/she probably does enjoy debates in here a little too much but I don't think anyone here with half a mind would deny the eloquence of that user.

       We can agree to disagree about whether he is eloquent. But look at his comment history. He is a regular participant at
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard
       </a>
       . A neutral description of that subreddit is that they enjoy mocking conspiracy theorists as an every day amusement. Why would you, ostensibly someone who sincerely cares about the best interests of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , praise someone from there?
      </p>
      <p>
       You, a sockpuppet, come here trying to draw negative attention to supercede. Your case against him is extremely weak. Forgive me if I doubt
       <em>
        your
       </em>

       The submitter's case is that supercede is eloquent, and graped is eloquent, so therefore supercede must be a sockpuppet of graped. That's incredibly weak logic. I think the submitter might be someone from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">

       I agree that the argument is weak. It's highly speculative and subjective to link the two together but hey this is

       same, i usually do it simply to disengage their own misinformation with facts. They aren't all trolls, but they do like their logic. That logic sometimes impedes them from having an open mind and doing research on topics, skeptics as they are and all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Arguing that they are all trolls is like their attitude towards us. As part of the human element, we should engage civilly with them to showcase their faults of reasoning.

       Also, if you want to bend occam's razor on the 9/11 issue, simply mention Sun tzu and the art of war. Their beloved method becomes our greatest tool in reason at said point. Military tactics like 9/11 have happened for aeons.

       That doesn't exactly make someone a bad person, it just means they prefer to believe the official story.  Or a number of other reasons they haven't awakened to the sad truth of our reality.  I don't think the moon landing was faked, does that make me a shill? I do think fluoride should be banned from our water supply.  You don't have to be all IN all the time. Not every conspiracy is true.

       It's one thing to accept official stories and be unconvinced by other people's skepticism over those stories. But it's contemptible to make a regular practice of mocking and trolling people who call things into question, even if their arguments are weak.

       I agree, its also equally [tits] to assume that every official story released is somehow obscuring some great mystery or evil plot.  That sort of extreme conspiracy theorizing, is a form of trolling of its own.

       Some people seem to think that any ill conceived conspiracy theory appearing in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       reflects badly on the whole community. I disagree. In many parts of reddit, suspicions of wrongdoing by the powerful can be unwelcome. I see
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       as a place where such concerns can and should be permitted without censorship or self-censorship. There needs to be a place where suspicions can be discussed. And just because a submission has upvotes and comments taking it seriously does not mean that every sincere participant of the subreddit unconditionally believes it.

       New mod, no real rep in r/conspiracy, hasn't posted significantly in a year (more likely has used a sock puppet), specializes in social media.

       I think we need to push for a removal based on the fact the user is unknown. It is much more appropriate to have a known active member with a history.

       Right now my guess is he is a subversive agent sent here to censor or gain control of the subreddit. Otherwise he would not be unknown.

       Who's bright idea was it to make an unknown contributor a Mod? For all we know he is Cass Sunstein or one of his agents. I am serious when I say that.

       Sunstein said they would infiltrate conspiracy groups.

       The mods have definitely not been superseded. I had a good conversation with Sunshine-X, and after a few people "nominated" me to be a mod, Sunshine-X said he wanted to speak with the other mods about asking me on. I was just as surprised as anyone.

       Please don't find a new site. I've made some suggestions, that have been well received among the mods to encourage sound discussion, and discourage spiteful/hateful language. That's about it really. There are some specifics about what I would like to see that I am happy to share with anyone.

       lol. I suspect that the meaning is more in alignment with the idea superseding a way of thinking or paradigm and is not related to replacing mods here or any other such idea.

       Yes, this is what my whole purpose in life is. I attempt to find contradictions in reality, and work genuinely to create things myself that slowly make those contradictions obsolete. I'm only one dude, but if everyone tried to "supersede the bullshit" as I've said, I believe things would look completely different.

       This is the correct definition. I created this username a while back because I want to supersede the socio-economic and political system that is becoming increasingly obsolete. Each of us, uniquely and individually has specific knowledge and experience to step out into the community and create things that are holistically
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       than what we have. I suppose that I've tried to create a philosophy of supersedence, but it is basically counter-economics. If you don't agree with something, make it irrelevant. :)

       This is the best type moderator, an outsider. I sometime participate in SRD and the biggest mod drama is always users who mod more then one sub become 'power mods' and can do no wrong. If you slight them they hunt you down on other subs they mod and ask other power mods to hunt you to.

       Yes we must be careful.  Especially knowing the people over at conspiratard and EPS and seeing how they have in the past infiltrated subreddits as mods and caused havoc.  I think it was one of the OWS subs they infiltrated.

       Well hello everyone! First, let me say that I'm so very honored to play a role in this subreddit. OP, I'll take this post as a compliment, and say that I appreciate you bringing my placement up for discussion :) . I have been a user on reddit since about 2008, but for at least a year or so, I didn't care to post or comment, I only lurked. My previous username was
       <a href="/u/throneandaltar">
        /u/throneandaltar
       </a>
       . There's not much to see on that account. Interestingly enough(or not), I forgot my password and had some login troubles, so I had to create a new username.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my personal interests, I have written academically about how social-media could specifically be used in an open-source, collaborative-research capacity, whereby each user expresses their brilliancy onto a community,  receives feedback, and calibrates their thoughts and actions based on the brilliancy of the entire community. As a result, the brilliancy of the community- the credibility, the quality of information, and the actions that users take - are made holistically
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       .  I'm happy to share my personal research with anyone interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I can assure you that I am a genuine poster here and have absolutely no relation to grapedinthemouth. I don't really care for him; actually, and I'm sure many of you feel the same way haha. 9000's "I'm Out" post seemed like as good of a post as any for me to air out some issues that I saw here, and some solutions that I thought would be helpful. I do have the utmost revere for this subreddit, and I hope to be a helpful and positive moderator here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking to the rapidity of my succession into moderator status, the whole turn of events is just as amazing to me as it is to many of you! I had no inclination that I would be a mod here yesterday morning. I made some (I assume) well received suggestions about increasing the credibility and the authentic discussion of this subreddit. A few well known participants here "nominated" me to be a mod. I had a good conversation with sunshine-x, and other mods remembered some of my posts, so they gave me the go ahead, remarkably. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm truly honored to be a moderator for this community. I want to be transparent with all of you, and if any one of you have questions of how I would like to see this subreddit develop, or about me personally, feel free to AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting to the definition of my username... The word "Supercede" or "Supersede" means a great deal to me, personally. Essentially, I know that the current status-quo can be made obsolete via the unique efforts of each one of us. In virtually any niche aspect of the Establishment(the matrix) that we witness, people with significant knowledge, integrity, and ambition could create localized organizations or solutions that would make the corrupt/coercive/contradictory aspects of the status-quo be irrelevant to our every-day existence. I genuinely believe that each of us should look for contradictions in reality and actively work to make those contradictions obsolete.
      </p>
      <p>
       The manifestation of supersedence is unique to each person's knowledge set and experience, and would involve taking action in a vast array of fields and contexts for each person. I would love to speak with any of you about some specific examples of how to "supersede", but I can tell you that it is a "philosophy" which I have taken hold of in a tangible way in my personal life with great success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm so appreciative of the opportunity to be here. Again, I would love to speak with you guys about my vision for this place, so AMA!

       Thank you for your excellent response.  And I apologize for my shell shock.
      </p>
      <p>
       My primary concern was that reddit-proper was trying to remod us as I've witnessed happen to many politicized subreddits.  Top down infiltration seemed more likely to me given your gift of eloquence with language.  So my question to you is, are we going to start moderating posts that could be seen as anti Semitic or racist?
      </p>
      <p>
       In some of your suggested changes you expressed a desire for this sub to be taken more seriously and to be more credible.  How do we achieve such a feat without sacrifices to the purity of free thought?  The only way to make people over at conspiratard take us seriously would be to "get back in line".

       Excellent questions, and I'm glad you posed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, I don't plan on doing any post moderation (removals or bans) until I can get a better understanding of this thing. I'm too new to step in here and start booting people -- I would never do that anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of the posts that could be seen as anti-semetic or racist, there is a fine line here with the topic of Zionism. We can perhaps discuss my specific views on this another time, but the influence that zionists have on MANY different facets of our socio-economic and political system are far reaching. This is provable and it is fact from the research I've done. Throwing around the word "Jew" is where it gets tricky. Like I said, I would always check with other moderators before taking any action(I won't do anything like that for a while).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I do desire for this sub to be taken more seriously and to be more credible. I can understand how one could think this would be a difficult undertaking without censoring. I should first explain that my philosophical roots are in
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntaryism">
        voluntaryism
       </a>
       , which means(to me) that I philosophically have a problem with the kind of top-down censorship/heavy moderation that you're referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I think the way we give some credibility to this sub is by changing some aspects of the side bar(i'll get into the specifics), and encouraging key users here to post intelligent, well-sourced, positive discussion-based comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       To best explain what I mean, I'm going to transparently share with all of you my specific suggestions to the mods. Please feel free to let me know what you think.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In short, we need to change our sidebar and some posting guidelines.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not going to cut it any longer:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         This subreddit is for the REDACTED and the discussion of REDACTED that may or may not have REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED REDACTED government agents.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        We need to be specific that posts here need to foster sound sourcing, and respectful argumentation. We need a subreddit description similar to that of true-reddit, that acts as our statement of purpose. I'm generally speaking here about a re-branding of this subreddit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here, check out truereddit's sidebar statement:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         A subreddit for really great, insightful articles, reddiquette, reading before voting and the hope to generate intelligent discussion on the topics of these articles...To maintain the focus on great articles, Please (follow especially this part of the reddiquette and) do: Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something. But only if you really think it might help the poster improve.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        We should also think about collaborating within the community to write a mission statement. This by itself would make great strides to build the community of truth-seekers that I think we all want...
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm attempting to foster a culture of authentic discussion and credible-sourcing of opinions. I believe somewhere we need to mention that users should disclose their level of speculation or uncertainty as to the verifiable, factual-content of the post or comment. If there is some admitted degree of uncertainty about information, then users are basically sharing that they need the help of the community to get at the truth of the matter. This will be gold for our subreddit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Likewise, if a user claims factual evidence, any untruthful or contradictory statements found should be respectfully critiqued, using the tenets of "non-violent communication" as a guide. I believe it would be really beneficial to include this somewhere on the sidebar. I think it could tone down some of the rudeness that happens here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another suggestion is to use the "continuum of epistemic certainty", essentially "Imagine - Think - Believe - Know", as a guide in the encouragement of users to express their certainty of fact in any post they make. We could create some quantitative expression to represent this, or we could simply encourage users to help with the credibility of the subreddit by admitting when they are speculating about a topic. I think this, in and of itself would give us more credibility among reddit.
       </p>
       <p>
        After an examination of validity by the community, it should be encouraged that posts which have a strong factual basis be further researched for their connections with other related topics.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would love to hear your guys' thoughts on my suggestions. I won't be offended whatsoever if you guys don't think these are appropriate, I just wanted to get my mod position off to a good start...

       I like these ideas. Especially about the side bar. Im pretty new so i cant speak too much but i would like to see some more backing slash proof on these posts. Or at a minimum at least be prepared to back your post up. And about the Zionism, I agree that there is a fine line but i feel racist posts are fairly obvious in nature and perhaps we could have a 3 strike sort of thing before banning. I also liked how this sub really offered the true side of things, trying to show the unbiased look from a new angle so we could not only see the bigger picture but also what the f is really going on. Want to see this sub be more of that with discussions encouraging open debate as opposed to a 1 sided post about a vague shooting where the evidence is sketchy and debate is stifled. My 15 cents.

       I don't want to drag my everyday account into this mess because I'm not a mod and I'm still reserving my judgement in regards to supercede.  I enjoy this subreddit more than any other I don't want to piss off a brand new mod or the existing mod team.

       As far as what my other account is, I will withhold that information.  Its an account you most likely read here a lot.

       As far as graped being a troll, he/she probably does enjoy debates in here a little too much but I don't think anyone here with half a mind would deny the eloquence of that user.
