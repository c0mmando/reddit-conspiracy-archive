<p>This is some really fishy stuff. Either these guys are really into some serious shit, or it&#39;s a joke or something. To quote a few &quot;definitions&quot;.  </p>

<p><strong>ATF</strong><br/>
Alcohol Tobacco and Fire Arms.  Rednecks with a license to kill.  Never, ever, ever ask for their help on anything.  </p>

<p><strong>BYM</strong><br/>
Bright Young Man.  Doesn’t know shit. Doesn’t know that he doesn’t know.  Likely to burn you the first time out.  Try to get him killed as quickly as possible.  </p>

<p><strong>Customer/Consumer</strong><br/>
The real user of intelligence.  A decision maker who uses the intelligence to make real decisions.  Also the one who decides to blame intelligence when his stupid plans blow up in his face.  Must be kept happy at all times until he is executed.  Avoiding being executed with him is a key part of the Craft.  </p>

<p><strong>Deniability</strong><br/>
Some ops are too ugly to be owned.  They need deniability. The craft teaches the means of deniability. Not having deniability is like tightrope walking without a net. It can be done—for a while. Then they scrape you up with a spatula.   </p>

<p><strong>Duplicitous little bastards</strong><br/>
Israeli Intelligence  </p>

<p><strong>FBI</strong><br/>
Federal Bureau of Investigation, aka the Downtown Gang.  Very good a breaking up used car rings.  Kind of confused on anything more complicated.  Fun to jerk with.  Not fun when they jerk back.  </p>

<p><strong>Fucking French</strong><br/>
Fucking French  </p>

<p><strong>Hoover’s Dress</strong><br/>
Yes, Jedgar liked to pop a dress on once in a while, just to kind of kick back and relax with Clyde. The dress is classified Top Secret and kept in a vault in the basement of the Hoover Bldg. Play with that thought for a while and then decide if this profession is for you.  </p>

<p><strong>Safe house</strong><br/>
A place to go where no one, not even your wife, will suspect that you are.  Good place for rigorous interrogations.  Soundproofing, for all uses, is essential.  </p>

<p><strong>Source-quardrupled</strong><br/>
A source who you think is working for you who is actually working for the other side, even though you knew he was working for the other side…. Too fucked up to think about.  Shoot the bastard and start over again.  </p>

<p><strong>Swallow</strong><br/>
From the Soviets.  A young lady (or gentleman) of a certain level of attractiveness whose job it is to entertain potential sources while artistic photographs are taken.  Make sure that the target gives a shit what his wife thinks.  Otherwise, you’ve just given the SOB a night to remember and nothing else.  </p>

<p><strong>Target--reactive</strong><br/>
Oy.  This target is waiting for you and is ready to react.  You go to a Moscow park to pick up a package.  You get the package and all the nice people with strollers open fire on you.  Very bad.  Usually leads to a board and a funeral.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the CEO of Stratfor when the leaks occurred was George Friedman. I think he resigned right after the leaks happened and the Stratfor site went down, but I&#39;m not 100% sure as I&#39;m just going off memory here. Still, dem eyes indeed o_O</p>

<p>It&#39;s a jokey reflection of the reality of the field. There is no morality in the intel world and it is criminal by nature. Whatever works is what is done, camouflaged as much as possible. Low-rung people are disposable. All intel apparatuses stink to varying degrees: gangs protected by the state.</p>

<p>A read I found interesting that reflects the reality of low-rung intelligence involvement is an interview done with Delmart Vreeland, a guy that was raised from age 14 to do intel work and ended up a mess of a human being then being discredited and disappeared.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On February 13, 2002, a former U.S. Attorney named Tom Henry wrote Vreeland a letter. Henry, who is Leo Wanta&#39;s legal advisor, had put Vreeland through a series of tests attempting to see if Vreeland could recognize certain &quot;passwords or security code names.&quot; Vreeland aced it. Henry&#39;s letter concluded, &quot;On best information and belief I am of the opinion that my clients would endorse that you gathered the information that you have shared with my client while acting in the capacity of an &#39;intel op&#39; agent of the U.S. Government.&quot; In the past, Henry has worked with the Department of Justice in the Ford Administration before moving on to become a consultant on business matters in China.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s serious but written to be readable. If the author had written this as a doctoral dissertation, nobody would have read it. As it is, it&#39;s readable and its utility is enhanced. Also, some of what&#39;s said is useful and real. I will paraphrase one of the definitions:  &quot;Great briefers (marketers) are narcissists and must be bitch slapped regularly.&quot; This is so very true in so many corporations I work with.</p>
