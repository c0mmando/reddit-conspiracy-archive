        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First off, YES, this is a throwaway account. I actually post here regularly, but seeing as this question will probably get blasted by SRS , I don&#39;t want my other account involved. </p>

<p>I was watching the movie Romper Stomper the other day and it started me thinking about Hitler and his obsession with trying to annihilate the Jews. Then I got to thinking about the Jews role in today&#39;s world and how they have taken over MSM, hollywood, and trying to take over the world basically. </p>

<p>So I started putting two and two together and it got me wondering if Hitler could have possibly foreseen what was to come. I have heard that he was very deep into mysticism and the occult and I wonder if maybe he was given a vision of what they would do.</p>

<p>Let me be straight with you, i in no way support Nazi agenda. but i am curious to know if maybe Hitler was not only trying to be all powerful, but also trying to protect the world from someone who will take the world over in secret.    </p>

Posing questions, any questions, is not an admission of guilt, it&#39;s a search for answers.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a theory completely and utterly impossible to prove or disprove, with zero factual basis, so I&#39;m not seeing how any meaningful discussion is possible. It is akin to arguing that slavery was a good thing, or any instance of genocide might be for the greater good. Or maybe that the people who are really in control of Israel have some info from a magical source that the Palestinians will destroy us all, and are currently treating them like shit so they could be stopped. You don&#39;t see how that could be extremely offensive to some people, if not most?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re jumping to weird conclusions, probably based on your own biases. There does not need to be meaningful discussion in order for the theory to be discredited, in fact stating the discussion is ridiculous might be enough for OP to disregard it. You&#39;re coming at this as if all things are equal. As if OP&#39;s brain works the same way as yours. He could be 12 and just learning about critical thinking. He could be high as shit and just postulating stupid <em>what ifs</em> that he&#39;ll be embarrassed about later. Or he could be a racist asshole, as well as a number of other things. None of these can be gathered by a few questions being posed. </p>

<p>This idea that anything that can be remotely considered critical of Jews or Israel should be considered anti-semitism, is in fact perpetrated by the the ones most egregiously guilty of the concept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Criticizing Israel is not anti-semitic, and I never have and never will defend that country. Criticizing &quot;Jews&quot; as a general group, without recognizing individual or small, factional perpetrators, is almost the definition of anti-semitism. There seems to be little confusion in this sub regarding the difference between Jihadists and Muslims, or Christian-based hate groups like Westboro or the Klan and Christians in general, but Jews, Zionists, and the country of Israel are all treated as interchangeable here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In who&#39;s eyes though? Certainly everyone is guilty of over generalizing in speech or writing, but it can usually be attributed to laziness or maybe to intentionally make the listener question their own responsibility if there is any. I might often use the term <em>we</em> when talking to people about the atrocities the US government is committing overseas but nobody is dense enough to think I&#39;m literally saying each and every US citizen is personally responsible for said atrocities. Why should there be a different standard for anyone?</p>

<p>Read that whole thread, check the number of upvotes on the more fucked up comments, and notice how a valid post about Zionists morphed into an attack on <em>Jews</em>. It is a VERY different standard. Am I imagining all this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What exactly are you arguing here? That there&#39;s anti-Semitic assholes in this subreddit? I&#39;m not disagreeing. All I&#39;m saying is being critical of Jews does not automatically equal hatred for all Jews. Certainly we can both come up with examples agreeing with this, if you can&#39;t you&#39;ve just shown your true colors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m arguing that if there are a small but vocal group of anti-Semites in this sub, than the overwhelming majority here seems more than ok with their presence and &quot;contributions&quot;. Being critical of specific Jews is perfectly fine, and often justified. Being critical of Jews as a people or race, implying that they are all a certain way, with some exceptions, is as fucked up as criticizing Whites, Christians, Muslims, Blacks, Asians, etc. Please search this sub for posts with the words &quot;Zionists&quot; and &quot;Vatican&quot; in them. Similarly accusatory posts appear for both. Now search &quot;Jewish&quot; and &quot;Christian&quot;. Those are night and day. Are they not analogous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was somewhat overly straightforward with that last comment and I feel you deserve more. People have been socially conditioned to perceive things as anti-semitism whenever anything pertaining to Israel is criticized or questioned. This was conscious and intentional. We&#39;re seeing similar conditioning happen with stuff pertaining to the US government. So in essence, one might be <em>shilling</em> for the another group without it being a conscious choice. It&#39;s a psychological tactic that works very well, and one we should look out for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fair. At the same time, we should also be aware of sources&#39; motives. If you check the other videos posted by the guy who uploaded the &quot;Jews changing Wikipedia&quot; video, it is clear that he is a holocaust denier and nazi defender, and his main purpose was not to promote truth, but spread hate. I&#39;m not saying that the person who brought it to reddit had a similar agenda or that the post doesn&#39;t belong here, but that the line between Zionism and Judaism is being intentionally blurred by a small handful of people here, and everyone seems ok with it. </p>
