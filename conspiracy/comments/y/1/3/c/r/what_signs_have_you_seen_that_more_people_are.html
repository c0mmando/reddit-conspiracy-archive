       Same here. Some small pockets of waking up, especially when it hits them personally and stuff like that, but at this point I think US has the most awake people, Europe is lacking, although people here are way more united  on big issues and can sort of go from zero to hero, from 10% to 80% of protests and stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, so far in the general equation we are loosing, its sort of go 1step forward, two steps back.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, people will wake up, sooner or later, I'd like it to be sooner, but either way, they will wake up.

       At what point though do we start calling some of the big name alternative news sites Main Stream Media?

       There are so many things that don't make any sense at all -- occupying countries in the Middle East, the supposed War on Drugs that hasn't stopped or even slowed the drug trade, the prohibition against growing hemp (totally crazy), sending billions of  dollars to Israel every year when Americans can't even afford to repave their own roads, torture being accepted in the entertainment media and by the US government as standard practice (torture, for fuck sake -- it's like a return to the 14th century). There's just a lot of insanity, a lot of common practices that are totally nuts when you consider them.

       Yep, we are definitely going downhill. There used to be the prospect of modest social mobility after WW2, but that is gone. US is now one of the countries where you can't move out of the class that you are in.

       they want to keep everyone doped up. They make the money off it, so it will never be legal. If they catch you and you go to prison, they make money off of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are very much into violence as a method of control. The wars and the torture are all a part of that along with the worship of the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU is back and they are outperforming us. China will be there soon. It will be all downhill from these as far as I can tell.

       That I've seen more people questioning and less people using words like sheeple and waking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Completely serious though. We live in a very interesting age for what is going on around us, and the more I see people questioning what they hear and wanting to know what the truth is, not just berating those who don't, the more I see people "waking up"

       I have seen signs that some people are waking up MORE, and that some people are falling into the collective more.  Like

       is the hivemind collective hangout.  Anything anti-"green", anti-Marxist, or anti-Obama gets downvoted.  If you bring up media manipulation everyone downvotes you.  We are being divided as a nation.

       The rate of the dark side's prominence in society is far greater than anything else.

       Yes, people are waking up. Hasn't it always been that way?

       But more of us are being put into a deeper slumber than are waking up.

       It's like you're walking down the aisle of a speeding bus in the direction opposite the bus is going. It may seem like your'e avoiding the destination but this is just an illusion.

       Our world is very different from 5, 10, 20 years ago. But most of us don't realize it. We tend to justify our reality when it's deeply integrated into our personhood, no matter how crazy.

       Your only option is to move OUT of such places. Some of you seem to think this is running away. And you'd be right.

       It's the same kind of running you should do when confronted by a gigantic monster that wants to consume you. You want to stay and fight? Go ahead.

       More? What are you talking about? Very few ever wake up. Just take a stroll down your street or go to a party and ask people. They will look at you like your crazy if you start talking NWO/Illuminate stuff and either walk away or tell you to STFU or your a nutjob.

       No matter what you think of the man, David Icke being able to fill Wembly Arena, when he used to only have small numbers at his talks, is a sign that people are slowly coming around. The Icke trail may not be the best trail for people to take, but at least they're turning off of the highway.
