    <div class="md"><p>I distrusted authority figures as far back as I can remember, probably because I had bad parents, but also because I was exposed to how awful cops can be when I was young.  As I grew older and read more, I learned about war and industry which increased my distrust of government, business, and religion.  </p>

<p>Turned out I was a &quot;spirited child&quot;, or I had a lot of energy and quick wit, so I was a pain in the ass for all authority figures in my life; parents, teachers, police, any adult trying to convince me or force me into something.  This resulted in my parents locking me up for several years as a teen even though I broke no laws and had no mental problems.  It&#39;s called &quot;voluntary placement&quot; and is completely legal, though in my opinion unconstitutional.  </p>

<p>After years of being locked up and being told I am wrong about how I view the world, I just kinda had the fight taken out of me.  I retired from caring about issues larger than myself, it was easier on me.  Couldn&#39;t block everything out though, I just let observations get buried under my desire to enjoy life.  Started reading more fiction than non fiction and buried my head in the sand of drugs, sex, and entertainment.</p>

<p>Then I came to a point where the world around me started falling apart and started fucking up my enjoyment of the world.  Cost of living got too high and wages don&#39;t keep up, then the recession hit and I haven&#39;t worked full time since.  I started speaking up a bit more, but most people rolled their eyes at me, my views of things, and how I felt things were going.</p>

<p>Then Occupy Wall Street started and I went down there to check it out.  Turns out I wasn&#39;t alone in many of my opinions, far from it!  There was a HUGE variety of people and ideas floating around the protest, but everyone was on the same page of &quot;shit isn&#39;t what they tell you it is.&quot; This was what finally convinced me that standing up for MY beliefs is NOT wrong, lonely, crushing, and pointless.  I&#39;m just one of many who &quot;woke up&quot; then... but I don&#39;t like the term because sleeping isn&#39;t what I did previously; I was acting for others while trying to push my mind away from serious thoughts which caused me various miseries.  I didn&#39;t live in a dream, I was constantly trying to bury the truth so maybe I could live in a dream.</p>

<p>Much of this is pretty vague, but I hope I answered your questions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>this voluntary placement perturbs me. great story! though i was hoping for someone who innately towed the line to tell a story of increased rationality. i concede the change you described, as well as the state you occupied, are likely to be similar in any case.</p>

<p>once i was an athiest, now am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism">theist</a> and thought perhaps it might be relatable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It always pissed me off they officially call it &quot;voluntary placement!&quot; The whole time I was in custody I requested to be made responsible for myself and released.  I was old enough to work and if I had legal status as an adult I could rent an apartment.  Even went so far as taking my GED at 16 and applying to colleges, but wasn&#39;t able to get the right help and had impediments to helping myself.  </p>

<p>I studied and experimented with theism, religion, and various &quot;spiritual stuff,&quot;  but that has so little to do with my becoming an activist I&#39;d call it negligible.  I still respect peoples&#39; belief in and search for... whatever they want to call it, but I decided my time is more useful for humanity if I focus my efforts in the material world around us.  I&#39;m not against other peoples&#39; interests and research though and will be as thankful for real spiritual answers as spiritual people will be for real progress on Earth.  :)   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; you&#39;re referring to. Democrats and Republicans? Al Qaeda and the US/west?</p>

<p>If the latter, the difference is clear. They are motivated by their religious values and principles, whereas the US/west is motivated by greed.</p>

<p>If the former, well, I don&#39;t see much of a difference, <em>especially</em> on foreign policy. As Helen Keller said a century ago about our 2 ruling parties, &quot;Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means that we choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.&quot;</p>

<p>In that area of the would there are two (2) types of &quot;toilet&quot;. One is called &quot;the long drop&quot;, and is used while sort of Squatting / half standing up (<a href="http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/611840903/Hot_sale_ceramic_squat_toilet_eastern.html">http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/611840903/Hot_sale_ceramic_squat_toilet_eastern.html</a>), and one is called &quot;the seat/base&quot; and is used while sitting down.</p>

<p>See:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Arabic version of the sit-down toilet has an additional useful feature - a water pipe for washing yourself. This is either a separate hose, or a small, carefully aimed pipe set in the bowl of the toilet. This kind of toilet may be provided with toilet paper <strong>or not</strong>.</p>

<p>For the last 100 years or so, this latter version has been called &quot;Al Qaeda&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OH MY GOD HE&#39;S RIGHT.</p>

<p>A very common and widespread use of the word “Al-Qaeda” in different Arab countries in the public language is for the toilet bowl. This name comes from the Arabic verb “Qa´ada” which mean “to sit”, pertinently, on the “Toilet Bowl”. In most Arabs homes there are two kinds of toilets: “Al-Qaeda” also called the &quot;Hamam Franji&quot; or foreign toilet, and &quot;Hamam Arabi&quot; or “Arab toilet” which is a hole in the ground. Lest we forget it, the potty used by small children is called &quot;Ma Qa´adia&quot; or &quot;Little Qaeda&quot;. </p>

<p>For all of these &quot;conspiracies&quot; there is always some proof. 9/11 has a TON of video evidence that supports the basic outline of the official story. A lot of conspiracy theorists like to dismiss this evidence and question-beg. That is just foolishness.</p>

&quot;However, the most effective weapons used against the conspiratorial theory of history are ridicule and satire. These extremely potent weapons can be cleverly used to avoid any honest attempt at refuting the facts. After all, nobody likes to be made fun of. Rather than be ridiculed most people will keep quiet; and, this subject certainly does lend itself to ridicule and satire.

<p>It&#39;s obvious the government is a fucking scam.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious the banks are fucking us over.</p>

<p>All of our wars and military involvement are scams...</p>

<p>Its all fucked!</p>

<p>But what the hell can we do, really we need to start doing something, NOW! </p>

<p>We have no power... Change through politics is basically impossible. Ron Paul was our best shot, and look what happened to him. They made sure he never had a chance. Even if you didn&#39;t agree with Ron Paul, you at least have to realize that he was the only honest choice and he wasn&#39;t in the pocket of big business. He at least had morals.</p>

<p>The system in place is designed to perpetuate itself and sheild itself from change. Those with power are accumulating more and more of it. Our liberties are being slowly eroded, and we don&#39;t even care, we probably are encouraging it because &quot;it makes us more safe&quot;.</p>

<p>What the fuck do we do....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it serves as just a little peace of mind, one cannot do much, but many, aligned can. The system after all depends on us, not them, and that&#39;s what they&#39;re afraid of.

<p>Search the web, there is much you can do actually ...</p>
