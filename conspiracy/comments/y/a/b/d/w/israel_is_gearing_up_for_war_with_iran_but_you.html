IMHO, this approach to upvoting or downvoting is a reflection of ignorance and stupidity.

<p>Second, it&#39;s hard to believe because there are over 1.5 million Muslims living in Israel.

    <div class="md"><p>yah, but with all of their rhetoric about bringing about the 13th Imam and the destruction of the world required to do that, I find it kind of hard to believe that they wouldn&#39;t if given the chance.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, though.. I don&#39;t really give a shit either way so I don&#39;t really follow it TOO closely. People everywhere need to stop being such extremist assholes, though. Too bad we don&#39;t see moderates with more vocal opinions. Or, if we do, it&#39;s always the extremists that get more air-time in the media because they evoke a more emotional response from everyone and that&#39;s what sells the news. I have yet to hear one single republican on the news say, &quot;gay marriage? Meh.. How does this hurt me again and why should I give a shit?&quot; But I know they&#39;re out there. I have a couple of friends who are.</p>

<p>Eh. Back to work for me... Have a great day! :)</p>

<p>Edit: Just to say that I upvoted both of your comments above here.. They both added to the discussion and I think they were both pretty well thought out. You obviously did your homework before making them. Any downvote you got was probably just because people didn&#39;t agree with you, just as davida_usa had said about the news topic posts here in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think that there are too many people in the anti-Iran camp just because of all of the biased reporting that we&#39;ve seen from western media outlets over the years.  Pundits and U.S. officials have been saying that war with Iran is just around the corner ever since the Iran-Iraq War ended in 1988.  I&#39;m inclined to believe that Iran is just responding to the reality of the Middle East right now.  Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Afghanistan are all areas that are under Western influence, and they essentially have Iran surrounded.  </p>

<p>Iran&#39;s main goal is to ensure its sovereignty (just like any other country would).  When they look around them, they&#39;ve seen invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as Gaddafi being forcibly removed by NATO.  None of these nations had nukes, and yet we don&#39;t go marching into North Korea and China because they have nukes (note that the Pakistani army has no problem with us drone bombing their territories, they just need to pretend that they&#39;re upset so that the population doesn&#39;t revolt).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect most people to agree with me, but if/when they don&#39;t, I do expect them to engage in an honest debate that is heavy on facts and light on opinion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No prob!  That&#39;s why I like having discussions in this sub.  People here are usually more interested in getting to the bottom of debates rather than just &quot;rooting for their favorite team&quot;.  </p>

<p>I do worry about a nuclear-armed Iran (just like I worry about a nuclear-armed Israel), but I just don&#39;t see the Iranians ever using a nuke.  Any nuke that Iran might use would undoubtedly be intercepted before impact, and it goes without saying that Iran would be nothing more than an impact crater once Israel and NATO respond with retaliatory strikes. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a firm believer in M.A.D. (it got us through the Cold War!).  Americans were told during the Cold War that the Soviets were godless atheists who didn&#39;t value human life and wouldn&#39;t hesitate to end the world by launching nukes at America.  Now that the Cold War is over, we see that the Soviets just wanted to counter our influence in the world as both sides were busy overthrowing governments and offering aid to any regimes who would align themselves with either the East or West.</p>

<p>Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday that he was confidant &quot;the fake Zionist (regime) will disappear from the landscape of geography,” Iran&#39;s Mehr News Agency reported.</p>

<p>Israel is not the same thing as the Zionist Regime (meaning the Likud government), and nowhere did anyone mention that Iran would ever use a nuke on Israel (especially given the reality that there are 1.5 million Muslims living in Israel).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>War with Iran has been &quot;imminent&quot; since at least 1993 (take a look at the backissues of <em>Time</em>!)</p>

<p>This may work out well though. Nuttyahoo wants his war before the elections (because, as a second term president, Obama probably won&#39;t hesitate to tell him to stuff his yamaka in his ass)...if before the election though, Obama may worry that his approval will suffer. For the prez its pretty much a no-win. It&#39;s hard to tell how many of O&#39;s supporters are Zionists. Being a Dem, of course, he has a large Jewish base, but Jews and Zionists are two very different animals.</p>

<p>Of course, if Richie Rich wins the presidency (not too likely) the scum Zionists&#39; war has already been bought and paid for. I guess we will see.</p>

<p>BTW, love the quote &quot;...the United States is our greatest friend and we will always have to co-ordinate such moves with it.&quot; Meaning, without American weapons and, ultimately, Gentile American blood, there is NO WAY Israel will strike and win, let alone win with only &quot;500 or so&quot; Israeli losses.</p>

<p>Israel learned very well from their tormentors, they are the most genocidal, war mongering nation on earth. Their practice of apartheid is despicable and the use of chemical and white phosphorus weapons on urban centers in Palestine are truly war crimes. </p>

Then I noticed that there were many news outlets (including the BBC) reporting that the Israelis were upping the rhetoric by talking to their people about what a war would be like.  On Reddit, however, everyone who posted these stories was getting downvoted.

    <div class="md"><p>As another testament, I read <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> daily and have seen articles about the impending Iran war for months now if not over a year. Newspapers talk about it, FOX talks about it, other news agencies talk about it, etc. I think it is big news, just not as big as when it actually will happen.</p>

<p>But there is something about Israel/US taking out Iran everyday in Worldnews on the frontpage. On top of that theres even articles about Stuxnet/Flame/Gaus viruses that have been going around, and people calling that preemptive acts of war from Israel and the US against Iran.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with its an interesting story, but I don&#39;t think Reddit is censoring this story at all. It gets posted almost everyday actually and is normally on the front page of worldnews. Sure a war might eventually break out, but at this point it&#39;s kind of like the stories about &quot;North Korea vows to attack South Korea if it catches one more fish on this river!&quot; It&#39;s interesting and provocative, but so far nothing has happened.</p>

<p>See for yourself: Notice that some of those articles go back <em>four</em> years. This isn&#39;t a new story, perhaps why people are tired of it and downvoting it. I especially like the story from 4 years ago at #11 &quot;Bush gives Israel tentative &#39;OK&#39; to strike Iran&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The very point of the many articles is that the saber rattling has grown to a whole new level.  Now, Israeli officials are talking about how many citizens will be killed, how missiles will hit Israeli citizens and how long a war with Iran will last.  It may be hot air, but it is stupid for anyone to downvote important news just because they don&#39;t like it.  People need to know the truth; sticking your head in the sand doesn&#39;t make the bad news go away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you assume that Iran would ever want to nuke Israel?  Even if Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons, they know that they&#39;d be destroyed if they ever used one.  They would only be looking to acquire them so as to challenge the West&#39;s control over the Middle East.  </p>

<p>Iran sees nuclear-armed nations like China, North Korea, and Pakistan being relatively free from Western intervention (yes, drone bombings in Pakistan, but they&#39;re being tolerated by the Pakistani military).  Why wouldn&#39;t Iran want to acquire nukes and further ensure their sovereignty?  </p>

<p>Why do you assume that Iran would ever want to nuke Israel?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Iran&#39;s leaders have consistently said they want to destroy Israel.  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Muslim leader of Iran, as early as 2000 called Israel a &quot;cancerous tumor&quot; that should be removed from the region.  Just yesterday, he was quoted in international press saying &quot;the fake Zionist (regime) will disappear from the landscape of geography&quot;.  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has said &quot;Israel must be wiped off the map of the world and, god willing, we shall soon experience a world without Israel.&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve actually never said that they want to destroy Israel.  They&#39;ve repeatedly said that they want to &quot;wipe the Zionist regime from the pages of time&quot; (at least that&#39;s how it translates from Farsi).  &quot;Zionist regime&quot; refers to Israel&#39;s current Likud government and not to Israel as a whole (especially given the fact that over 1.5 million Muslims live in Israel).</p>

<p>wiped off the map</p>

<p>Every Middle East scholar knows that this is a mistranslation.  Frankly, it&#39;s ridiculous that there are still people who spout this line as if it&#39;s actually what Ahmadinejad said (and I&#39;m by no means a fan of him).  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not necessarily blaming you for holding these opinions on what Iranian officials have and haven&#39;t said over the years because of the sustained propaganda campaign that has and is currently being carried out against Iran.  <a href="http://www.oneangryman.com/ken/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/military-spending.jpg">Have you seen this yet?</a></p>

<p>Apparently you haven&#39;t read the holy texts, or even the link that you provided.</p>

<p>The Shia believe that the Mahdi will return with Jesus in the event that the world falls into an unnecessary civil war in order to bring about peace and justice.

    <div class="md"><p>Haha what? Israel has had nukes for a long time and has used them... not once.  Israel is a first world country, they have nukes to protect them from all the crazy ass countries around them.  Have you been to Lebanon?  Holy shit.  Beirut in the 80s was crazy.  You would be surprised if your house wasn&#39;t blown up or you didn&#39;t get murdered on your way back from work.  Israel has only once started a war preemptively and that was the Six Day War and it saved thousands if not millions of lives because they knew that Egypt, Jordan, and Syria were about to attack.  Besides that, Israel has been extremely cautious about not starting and only retaliating.</p>

<p>Want to know a real good reason Iran shouldn&#39;t get nukes?  They will hold hostage the Strait of Hormuz where a huge percentage of oil from Arab countries comes from.  They would be able to terrorize the whole world.  Look it up, it&#39;s been in the news for a year, nobody here seems to care though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reasons for preemptive strike on Iran, a follow-up on the Bush Doctrine - &quot;hit them before they hit us&quot;:</p>

<p>Tel-Aviv believes that uranium enrichment and nuclear technology in Iran are for military purposes (nuclear weapons), while Tehran denies, claiming such tech are exclusively for medical and energy purposes.</p>

<p>The IAEA (UN&#39;s nuclear watchdog) haven&#39;t been granted full access to Iran&#39;s installation plus latest satellite imagery showing increasing activity around the facilities, led to the recent EU and US backed economic sanctions against Iran.</p>

<p>The war is basically covert and already on-going (e.g. virus stuxnet, assassinations of chief Iranian scientists, drone flybys).</p>

<p>Tel-Aviv wants to bombard the nuclear research / development sites, effectively destroying them, before they can enrich weapon-grade uranium. This would set back their development by 7/10 years.</p>

<p>Tehran has never recognized Israel as a state, considering them occupiers of the Palestinian homeland. And not once claimed that &quot;Israel should be wiped off the map&quot;.</p>

<p>The US and its &quot;partners&quot; want Iran back in their sphere of influence with a puppet goverment as Iran holds the 4th largest oil reserves. Considering US&#39;s control over Iraq as a launch platform, if need be, against Iran. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but...</p>

<p>The Iranian government was 10 months old when the US had Iraq attack in the Iran/Iraq war.</p>

<p>Since then they (Iran) has earnestly and quietly perused an indigenous self defense capability. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be surprised if no Israeli planes return to base. Israel would not use Syrian airspace as the Russian &quot;advisers&quot; would gleefully shoot the bombers down with the S-300&#39;s stationed there and otherwise the Syrian air defense is among the best in the world. If Israel used Saudi airspace, (with or without permission) expect the Saudi oil export business to come to a screeching halt, and a new country called &quot;The Islamic Republic of Arabia&quot; come in to existence. If Israel uses Turkish airspace, expect Iran to do a deal with the soon to be new country of Kurdistan, thus removing 1/3 of Turkey from Turkey.</p>

<p>Now here&#39;s the biggie...</p>

<p>If the US helps Israel, expect every US warship from Deigo Garcia to the Mediterranean to be sent to the bottom (save the USS Enterprise, they will let that one remain afloat.) and in a single day we will see the biggest power shift we have seen since WW1. (That will lead to the collapse of the US dollar.) <em>(Hence 0bombya telling Israel to wait.)</em></p>

<p>If the Israeli airforce loses half their jets, and the 500 Iranian Shahab-3&#39;s take out runways, fuel depots, and a bunch of infrastructure, expect Hezbollah to waltz in and sterilize the west bank and the Golan heights of the erstwhile Europeans. </p>

<p><em>Iran needs NO Nuke deterrent, you don&#39;t have to believe me, just look at the facts on the ground!</em></p>

<p>I do believe that Israel is insane enough to do it, so I am stocking up the popcorn and preparing for a huge celebration! ☺</p>

<p><strong>So be it, fine. That means all Iranians should be held accountable for Iran&#39;s government, all Syrians should be held accountable for Assad&#39;s actions (I&#39;m sure they would love to hear that), all Libyan&#39;s should be held accountable for Gaddafi&#39;s actions, all Iraqis should be held responsible for Saddam&#39;s actions, all Egyptians should be held accountable for Mubarak&#39;s actions, all Russians should be held accountable for Putin&#39;s actions, all Germans should be held responsible for Hitler&#39;s actions, and so on.</strong> </p>

<p>If you believe that way, so be it, but your stupidity is astounding.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s news to me that Israel = All jews in the world. I find it hilarious that you can call all Jews in the world cunts (nice anti-semetic generalization there), because of the actions of Israel. Yes, a Jew living in Australia must be a cunt due to the actions of the Israeli gov&#39;t! Do you realize how dumb you actually are?</p>

<p>If that&#39;s the case, so be it, but then we should also blame all Muslim&#39;s for Gaddafi&#39;s actions. Fair is fair, no? I mean, if all Jews are responsible because of Netanyahu&#39;s decisions, then all Muslims are responsible for Gaddafi&#39;s decisions. Or, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll argue otherwise and fail to see the hypocrisy behind your claims.</p>

<p><strong>FFS dude, one of your comments claims that all Jews are &quot;retroactively earning their holocaust&quot; due to Israel&#39;s actions. You literally, and I truly mean this, are the most disturbed person I have ever met. I would call it stupidity, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s much worse. You should seriously consider getting help. You truly are sick animal.</strong> </p>

James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence.</strong> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/13/world/israel-sells-arms-to-china-us-says.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/13/world/israel-sells-arms-to-china-us-says.html</a></p>

<p><strong>A Senate report due out later this week says the Israeli exports include military technology developed by the US, and which Washington expressly forbids from being exported to China.</strong>

<p><strong>Even when Israel has clearly violated U.S. export controls, American officials have declined to crack down. In a notorious case last fall, an Israeli-owned company exported American ballistic missile components to a South African company and used them in its own Jericho-2 missile.
The Administration imposed trade sanctions on the South African company, but waived them for the Israelis.</strong>

    <div class="md"><p>First, the most recent of those reports is from 19 years ago. That&#39;s a long time, bud. </p>

<p>The first one doesn&#39;t mention that it is classified US military technology, just that it is advanced military technology and there are worries that it might extend to US technology. <strong>There is no confirmation of any Israeli sales of US military technology to China, just worries that it could transfer over to that.</strong> No facts in that article, just here-say and worries about future actions. Since it&#39;s been 20 years, and there haven&#39;t seem to be any more developing worries, those concerns seemed misguided at best.</p>

<p><strong>The second article as well mentions Israel selling military technology to China, but doesn&#39;t provide any proof of that technology either originating from the US or being considered classified.</strong> Similar to the first one, it provides no proof of the accusation, other than a &quot;senate report to come out later this week&quot;. </p>

<p><strong>The third one is an opinion piece, and never provides any confirmation of the accusations that Israel sold the technology to China.</strong> It just speaks of what the repercussions would be &quot;if&quot; Israel did so, and that &quot;intelligence reports&quot; say that they have. <strong>There are no citations to these intelligence reports however.</strong> It does mention the export of US technology to a South African company, however. That can&#39;t be denied. Like I said earlier though, this article is from over 20 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>Sorry, but I&#39;m not seeing your proof from any reputable source, which was my request.</strong> You are just reading articles from 20 years ago that state un-confirmed accusations and future worries stemming from those accusations. <strong>Since your comment</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, Israel does a wonderful job of selling classified US military technology to China. This has been the subject of a lot of grief for the US.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>indicates that it is a fact, I&#39;d like to see some proof of the accusation, rather than here-say and opinion pieces.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This just seems like more of a case of hoping that some type of information is true, and convincing yourself that it is based off of unproven accusations, even if those accusations are from 20 years ago and were the most recent articles on the subject you could provide me.</strong> </p>

<p>I find it alarming that your original comment indicated that these transactions were fact, even though there is no confirmation of them being so. It&#39;s also odd to me that you say the subject has caused a lot of grief for the US, yet the most recent article you provided was written 1 year after Bill Clinton took office.</p>

<p><strong>If this accusation were confirmed I would agree that it is definitely an alarming development. But, until proof is provided, I would recommend that you stop pretending that the accusation is a fact.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?</p>

<p>I asked you for evidence of a fact that you attempted to promote on this site.</p>

<p><strong>You provided me with three articles from 20 years ago, none of which provided any confirmation of said &quot;fact&quot;. The furthest any of them went towards providing confirmation is &quot;a report coming out later this week&quot;, with zero citation to that report.</strong></p>

<p>It isn&#39;t an attempt at denial or evasion. I asked you for sources for a reason. I asked you for sources so I could learn more and be provided with sources to back up your &quot;fact&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>If anyone reads those articles they can see that none of them provide any fact in the slightest. It&#39;s speculation and worry from 20 years ago, and considering that you weren&#39;t able to provide me with a more recent article, how can you say it has caused the US a lot of grief?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, of course, the US is troubled by accusations against Israeli officials from 20 years ago, even though those accusations were never confirmed and have not been updated since.</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s not denial. It&#39;s looking at an article objectively, word for word, and searching for citations that prove facts.</strong> Perhaps you have come across people who deny facts in the past, but this time you need to look in the mirror if you&#39;re searching for one.</p>

<p><strong>Realize that you posted three speculative articles from 20 years ago, and are using the accusations noted in them (which have still not been confirmed in any way) to convince yourself that they are fact.</strong></p>

<p>Your view on the situation is worrisome for the human race. That someone can read nothing but speculation, and because they have a dislike for the party involved, their mind turns that speculation into fact despite the lack of any confirmation of such.</p>

<p>But, go ahead. <strong>Continue to believe that I am attempting denial because I called you out one of your beliefs, and asked for evidence and was not given any. I&#39;d imagine it helps you move forward in life, believing speculation from 20 years ago as fact. I&#39;d imagine it makes you feel like your opinion isn&#39;t biased, despite how you failed to look at this situation objectively to any degree.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try being objective for once, it might help you.</p>

<p>If you dislike Israel, so be it. That&#39;s your right. But that shouldn&#39;t prevent you from attempting to look at information objectively and fairly.</p>

<p>And if it does, well than at least accept that your opinion on anything regarding Israel is bias and loses it&#39;s value. </p>

<p>You shouldn&#39;t accuse others of denial or evasion when you yourself form conclusions  based off of 20 year old worries that never came to fruition. Sounds to me like you&#39;ve already formed your opinion, and instead of allowing it to adjust based off of new information, you are attempting to adjust the information to fit into your belief system. That&#39;s a very dangerous action.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one thing to dislike a country or grouping of people, but another to let it stop you from viewing anything regarding that country or grouping of people with an objective mindset. And if you can&#39;t view it with an objective mindset, maybe you should stop running around making blanket statements and pretending that they are fact when they are far from it. You have some serious nerve.</p>

<p>Way to be, bud, way to be. Oh and thanks for the down-votes while I&#39;m doing research and providing factual evidence, and your only response is to throw smart-ass statements out there that have the same amount of backing as your &quot;factual&quot; claims: None. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess looking in the mirror is difficult? Maybe on reddit you are used to getting away with false claims because people up-vote what they like to hear, not what is actual truth. That&#39;s the main reason why outside of reddit, no one views this site as a credible source of news. (For example, a photograph of 5 Israeli&#39;s yelling at a Palestinian woman reaches the front page, yet 5 Israeli&#39;s being killed by a suicide bomber in Bulgaria is largely ignored.) People believe what they want to believe, and dismiss the rest. We are all guilty of it at some point.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s difficult when someone calls you out on a lie that you can&#39;t provide any proof of. Maybe it&#39;s difficult when someone opens your eyes to just how biased you are.</p>

<p>Instead of cursing others off, maybe you should question your own thought process. Instead of getting mad at me for calling you out, ask yourself why you are so keen on believing non-confirmed speculations? If I send you three articles like that, with lack of any confirmation, from 1993, stating that Iran &quot;definitely had nuclear weapons and was going to sell that information to Hamas&quot;, how would you react? Would it frustrate you if people believed it without any confirmation? Would it bother you to see so many people buying into these rumors despite any lack of evidence or proof? I&#39;d imagine so.</p>

<p>It can be a useful tool. Question yourself as to why your mind works a certain way, and how you can change it if it results in falling prey to misinformation. It&#39;s something I do quite often, and tends to help me tremendously.</p>

<p>Regardless, good luck, and hopefully that helps moving forward. Stop being mad at others for not buying into the same bullshit you do, and instead be angry at yourself for buying into it in the first place.</p>

<p>Shalom, and may you have a nice day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever. You can go on in denial about Israel all you want, and you can type out many page screeds in defense of Israel, but the fact is that the whole world knows it is a hateful apartheid state that is a danger to the world as well as US interests. Period. Go on screaming all you want, won&#39;t change a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Just wow.</p>

<p>So because you dislike the country in general that allows you to make shit up about them, and try to create your own reality that includes facts that are based off of assumptions from 20 years ago that haven&#39;t resulted in anything since then? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll continue pointing out lies and false information, and you continue making shit up in order to try to defend your belief systems.</p>

<p>I dislike you, since you made something up and tried to present it as fact, and when you were challenged on it you acted like a child and tried to defend your actions despite the fact that you had no information to do so. Does that mean I should just start making shit up about you, and spreading that information as fact? Should I listen to rumors about you and claim to people that they are facts, only to tell them to STFU when they call me out on my lies?</p>

<p>Talk about dangerous. People like you are a danger to the world. People who can&#39;t look at any event objectively and fairly and instead make sure up in order to convince themselves that they aren&#39;t biased. I get it, you like to make shit up and ignore actions that don&#39;t fit into your beliefs. You&#39;re the type of person that will ignore anything that you disagree with, and promote anything you agree with regardless of the truth behind the statement. </p>

<p>Just in general, you&#39;re a disgrace. You want to continue behaving this way, making shit up and posting false facts to try to prove a point, so be it. But it&#39;s time to stop pretending you have any objectivity in the matter, and it&#39;s time to stop pretending your opinion isn&#39;t anything more than that of a misinformed ideologue with questionable cognitive skills and judgement.  </p>

<p>In fact, your last statement just proved your inability to be objective when it comes to Israel. Enjoy your up-votes, enjoy your falsehoods, enjoy your biases, and enjoy telling people to STFU when they call you out for it. But, instead of looking in the mirror, and questioning why you lack the ability to be objective, just continue what you&#39;re doing, that&#39;s fine too. </p>

<p>Oh, and one last thing. For someone who talks about another party being a hateful state, your hatred is quite large as well. People like you, who promote falsehoods and misinformation, create more hate than anyone else. It&#39;s because of people like you that there is so much hate in this world. Enjoy your hypocrisy, and your up-votes to go with it.</p>

<p>Iran sees nuclear-armed nations like China, North Korea, and Pakistan being relatively free from Western intervention (yes, drone bombings in Pakistan, but they&#39;re being tolerated by the Pakistani military).

</blockquote>

<p>Because Iran&#39;s leaders have consistently said they want to destroy Israel.  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Muslim leader of Iran, as early as 2000 called Israel a &quot;cancerous tumor&quot; that should be removed from the region.  Just yesterday, he was quoted in international press saying &quot;the fake Zionist (regime) will disappear from the landscape of geography&quot;.  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has said &quot;Israel must be wiped off the map of the world and, god willing, we shall soon experience a world without Israel.&quot;  </p>
