       I don't even see how this could work on Earth with an atmosphere 10 times that of Mars.  The difference in gravity doesn't seem to make up for the difference in atmosphere.  So I'm trying to find a formula or a calculation or something that shows this is even remotely plausible.  Anyone have anything showing how this might work?

       Of course, you could always just ask the rover itself:

       That's my point.  It's basic physics and the numbers don't make sense.  Either the chute needs to be bigger, the mass less or the final velocity more.  Thier numbers don't make sense.

       Downvotes implying someones onto something? For fucks sake, maybe people just think that OP is an idiot?
      </p>
      <p>
       The MSL descent and landing involved a preposterous amount of different physical forces and counter-forces at play and it took years of theoretical modelling and engineering to solve problems involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course if your average redditor just googles away, uses a few general equations and tries to do the math, they will find "flaws" in the physics, but that is just because they won't understand or take in account the enormous complexity of the problem at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's why your average redditor does not calculate complex interplanetary landing processes using google and linear algebra 101 textbook, but the job is done by, you know - actual space agencies employing top science and engineering talent?

       I tend to think the fundamental physics of drag coefficients of a parachute should be included in those super complicated NASA calculations that no one could ever understand.  And the published mission profile, with respect to the parachute descent stage, doesn't make sense to me, hence the purpose of this post.

       Well I'm not sure about what you're thinking of but don't forget the last stage of the landing was done by the sky crane (rockets firing to slow down the craft extremely fast until it hits a certain alt. and then drops the rover).

       I'm only talking about the parachute descent stage.  The initial velocity when chutes were deployed was 3K MPH at 20K ft and backpack separation occurred at 145MPH at 4600 ft, and all that occurred in 1.8 minutes time.  There just isn't enough atmosphere to account for a descent rate that high.  Hell, there isn't enough atmosphere here on earth.  Do the math.  It doesn't work.

       Well the parachute generates about 65,000 pounds of drag. It gets deployed at mach 1.7 (578 m/s) at about 10km up and then after the parachute braking, the powered descent starts at 1.8km up at about 100 m/s.

       That's the point.  There isn't enough atmosphere at an altitude of 10km on mars to account for the decent rate the parachute produced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The less atmosphere the less effective the parachute is, and it doesn't add up.  The parachute would have to be bigger, way bigger than 71 feet to make it work with an atmospheric pressure of .0043 psi.  Or the mass would have to be less.  I'm not talking about the powered decent.  I don't see any issues with those calculations.

       My background is in electrical engineering and I'm also into amateur rocketry.  I do these kind of calculations regularly and the math is relatively straight forward.  Parachutes work by creating drag and they require an atmosphere (or air pressure) to do so.  It's simple physics really. This is why sky divers can't pull their chutes before 15K feet.  They won't open because the air is too thin.

       Rather than take you though a few pages worth of calculations and unit conversions (and admittedly, I know I have some sources of error and assumptions built into my calculations that I'd rather not get hung up on)...but think of it like this:  How big does a parachute on earth need to be for a sky diver?  20 ft maybe?  How much does a sky diver weigh?  200 lbs or so with equipment?  A sky diver experiences a  change in velocity of maybe 100 mph in the matter of 10 seconds or so after deploying the chute.  Right?  All seem reasonable?  OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the official story from NASA here is that a parachute roughly twice the size of a sky diver's chute, slowed an object 10 times the mass of a person down by over 1000 mph in an atmosphere 99% less dense than earth in a little over a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need a parachute that is orders of magnitude larger than a sky diver's chute (way more than double) just to account for the decrease in atmospheric density - since the less dense the air is the less effective a parachute is.  Think about it.  It doesn't make sense.

       You're right, I haven't. I'll go ahead and choose to ignore your patronizing tone, but you're not the first person to bring that up and and I've been trying to figure out why that would matter and how I would account for it.  If I didn't know my decent rate that would matter a lot, but I already know it.  I know initial velocity, final velocity and time, all provided by NASA. It should be a simple calculation from there.  So I don't see why the vector matters.  The vector only changes the horizontal distance traveled.  I don't see how it changes anything else and distance traveled isn't something I'm concerned about.  The vector doesn't change the fact that the atmosphere just isn't thick enough to account for the amount of drag produced in the amount of time it was supposed to be produced in.

       Explain to me why.  We have velocity, altitudes and time.  We know the descent rate, we know the change in velocity and the change in time.  We don't need distance.  Distance only changes the direction of the drag force, not the magnitude of it.  Basic physics.  And none of that increases the atmospheric pressure on Mars.  I don't think you understand the problem.

       Its pretty obvious.  Greater distance travelled means more total atmospheric volume dragging the chutes over a given time.  More particles colliding with the chute means more drag. This means deceleration at a rate you wouldn't get if you were ignoring distance, which you admit to doing.

       I agree with everything you just said.  My point is that it's already accounted for so calculating the distance isn't necessary.  Since, you know, Distance = time * velocity.  What about this basic principle are you not getting?

       Just as an aside, you're assertion that it takes '10 seconds or so' for a sky diver to slow down from 100 miles an hour is wrong, once the chute is fully deployed it takes merely two seconds. I would know, I've done it several times.

       Yeah, I know.  I know how to Google too.  I've been using D = sqrt( (8 m g) / (p r Cd v
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       ) ) and v = sqrt( (8 m g) / (p r Cd D
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       ) ) to try and calculate something that makes sense, but using the published mission parameters from NASA they just don't seem to add up.  I had to guess on the drag coefficient of NASA's chute, but other than that it seems like a relatively straight forward calculation.  I'm still trying to figure it out though.

       Hmm, so why does that matter?  The descent rate is still constant as is the effect of gravity.  Since we know initial velocity, final velocity, and time, as published by NASA, we know our decent rate. Falling perpendicularly should just change the vector of the velocity, not the magnitude.  From there it's just a simple calculation for the diameter of the chute or the mass of the rover.  Distance traveled doesn't change the calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see why or how you would account for horizontal distance traveled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another source of error is the atmospheric pressure won't be constant.  It gets thinner the higher up you are.  But I used surface pressure in my calculations, which is extremely conservative, and they still don't make sense.

       I'm not a rocket scientist but it would seem that a large amount of work would be done by drag as it transits through the atmosphere and as it travels horizontally as well as vertically the total distance increases allowing drag to dissipate more energy.
