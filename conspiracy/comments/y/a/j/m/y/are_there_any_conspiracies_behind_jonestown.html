       I've been reading a bit about this organization and it's striking how much pro-community and anti-government sentiment was present before the great calamity. Is there a chance that the government somehow guided the mass suicide to prevent the social uprising that was becoming manifest?

       The mass-suicide was organized by Jim Jones because families in the states were complaining to their senators and representatives about how they had lost contact with their loved ones and were worried. A senator, whose name escapes me right now, flew into Jonestown, was ambushed with gunfire from Jonestown's "enforcers" while the community was forced to drink the Kool-Aid. The residents were held against their will under a pavilion by armed guards. If you tried to leave you would be shot. However, some members did manage to escape.

       , who sounded like an interesting Representative,

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After the Watts Riots of 1965, then-Assemblyman Ryan took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the area. In 1970, he investigated the conditions of California prisons by being held, under a pseudonym, as an inmate in Folsom Prison, while presiding as chairman of the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ryan was also famous for vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and authored the Hughes-Ryan Amendment, passed in 1974. He was also an early critic of L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientology movement and of the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon. On November 3, 1977, Ryan read into the United States Congressional Record a testimony by John Gordon Clark about the health hazards connected with destructive cults. Ryan is the only U.S. Member of Congress killed in the line of duty.

       Just so I understand, are you saying that the US government had the Senator killed, poisoned hundreds of women and children, faked audio recordings of the poisonings with Jones voice on them throughout, and planted fake eye witnesses all because he was a critic of the CIA?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, how is Assange still alive? Or even any Democrat that has criticized the Patriot Act?

       I'm sorry, maybe I didn't make that clear. I was not connecting any dots between the Congressman's death and his past activities. I was merely commenting on the fact that this particular Reoresentative had a noteworthy time in office, in addition to but not necessarily related to his role in the Jonestown incident.

       I'm not trying to be rude in my responses but what evidence of a conspiracy is there besides the opening clause of a sentence that has the acronym CIA in it? There are people alive today that have escaped from Jonestown, even more ex-members who never went to South America, and audio recordings of the mass suicide.

       I'm not denying that or disagreeing with anything you are saying. I also have never heard evidence of a conspiracy. I was just adding to the conversation by contributing a little about the Congressman who you couldn't remember right off hand.

       Thank you for the info, but these are the kind of stories that make me raise a brow. The happenstance senator that "dies" trying to protect the people, the lack of evidence for community being held against their will...

       There could have been some sorts of political dimensions to the Jonestown story, as Jim Jones was heavily involved in politics in San Francisco. And the happenstance Senator, was the only Senator in the history of the US to be killed in the line of duty.

       I believe Jim Jones was supported materially and otherwise by the CIA. I don't believe it had anything to do with preventing social uprising.

       is a great video, although horrible quality. It's part 5 of a 6 part series, but it contains some interesting information about Jim Jones, and Jonestown.

        Jim Jones had CIA connections.  There was CIA at Jonestown before &amp; during the massacre.  Congressman Leo Ryan was killed there.  The massacre happened one day after damning testimony against the FBI during the House Select Committee on Assassinations hearings.  Key witness due to testify was sent to Jonestown; died.  MKUltra tactics in use at Jonestown.  Mysterious changing reports in the numbers of dead.

       Thank you for the info, but these are the kind of stories that make me raise a brow. The happenstance senator that "dies" trying to protect the people, the lack of evidence for community being held against their will...
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm not saying you are wrong and I thank you for telling me this salient side of the story. But I'm still not convinced...

       I don't have an opinion on they whys or deeper hows of Jonestown, but the Senator was
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Ryan">
        Leo Ryan
       </a>
       , who sounded like an interesting Representative,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After the Watts Riots of 1965, then-Assemblyman Ryan took a job as a substitute school teacher to investigate and document conditions in the area. In 1970, he investigated the conditions of California prisons by being held, under a pseudonym, as an inmate in Folsom Prison, while presiding as chairman of the Assembly committee that oversaw prison reform.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ryan was also famous for vocal criticism of the lack of Congressional oversight of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and authored the Hughes-Ryan Amendment, passed in 1974. He was also an early critic of L. Ron Hubbard and his Scientology movement and of the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon. On November 3, 1977, Ryan read into the United States Congressional Record a testimony by John Gordon Clark about the health hazards connected with destructive cults. Ryan is the only U.S. Member of Congress killed in the line of duty.
