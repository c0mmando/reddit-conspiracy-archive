        HAARP

       transmission facility in Gakona, Alaska is anything but your typical Air Force research station. HAARP stands for The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program, and in a nutshell its objective is to study the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere">
        Ionosphere
       </a>
       to further our knowledge of civilian and military communications, navigation, and weather/meteorology.  First operational in 1993, its primary purpose is to fire 3.6 Megawatt (3 million watts) pulses or streams of non-Ionizing radiation up into the Ionosphere- the thin shell of electrons and molecules right beneath the magnetosphere, where X-rays and UV rays are still strong enough to enter, but promptly get absorbed into the atmosphere. Scientists perturb the Ionosphere with these powerful radio waves, and study how to it reacts. This highly intense radiation can subsequently be ricocheted back down to the Earth’s surface and harnessed, leading many people to speculate on the extreme potential for wartime and climate-control applications of the facility.  Some of the
       <a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/haarp/faq.html">
        official listed experiments
       </a>
       include
       <em>
        ionospheric super heating, radio observations of meteors, the effect of ionospheric disturbances on GPS satellite signals, meteor shower impacts, plasma line observations,
       </em>
       and even
       <em>
        research on extraterrestrial HF radar echoes.

       <strong>
        The Good:
       </strong>
       What’s the value of studying the Ionosphere in this way? The thin Ionosphere is created by the sun’s radiation, comprised of both neutral gas, and charged particles known as ions and electrons (flashback to physics 101). These particles can distort, reflect, and absorb radio signals, and therefore effects civilian and military communications, navigation, surveillance and remote sensing systems. One example cited on
       <a href="http://www.haarp.alaska.edu/">
        the HAARP website
       </a>
       is that
       <em>
        “…AM broadcast programs, which in the daytime can be heard only within a few tens of miles from the station, at night sometimes can be heard hundreds of miles away, due to the change from poor daytime to good nighttime reflection from the ionosphere.”
       </em>
       Further, changes in the sun’s radiation output (solar flares) can cause large transient currents in electric power transmission grids, causing mass power outages. The HAARP website goes on,
       <em>
        “the continual growth in the number of civilian and military satellite systems whose performances can be affected by changes in ionosphere conditions stimulates research on characterizing and understanding those effects, whether they be natural (solar related) or the result of controlled local modification of the ionosphere, using ground HF transmitters (HAARP).”

      <p>
       <strong>
        The Bad:
       </strong>
       Due to the profundity of these experiments, the immense power of the radiation, the spiking trends in climate change and earthquakes, and the secretive nature of the facility, many conspiracy theorists and average joes are beginning to believe HAARP was designed and is being used for far more nefarious purposes than the government claims.
       <a href="http://www.nuclearno.ru/text.asp?12405">
        A Russian military journal
       </a>
       once warned that the ionospheric testing at HAARP would eventually cause an avalanche of electrons that could flip Earth’s magnetic poles:
       <a href="http://archive.is/aEmt">
        translated journal
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Moreover, the effects of this know-how (as published) cannot be controlled..." "...Even a single use of this weapon may result in so-called trigger effects which no one will be able to stop: Earthquakes, sudden cooling on the global scale, etc. In the opinion of Canadian scientist Rosalie Bertel, who is studying the effects of wars on the environment, intense disturbance of ionosphere may result in a release of huge masses of free electrons – so-called electron showers. For its part, this might result in the change of electric potential of the poles and ensuing shift of the magnetic pole of the Earth. Simply speaking, the planet will 'capsize.' So the location of the north pole will become uncertain"

        Nick Begich Jr.

       wrote similarly that this blasting of the Ionosphere with radiation would result with “…the sky would literally appear to burn.” The basis of these claims is that by super-heating the Ionosphere, large portions of the sky would basically become like a giant lens, greatly concentrating harmful radiation from the sun and completely obliterating the Ozone, leaving the planet a crispy hell. Additionally,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peztNH3Ksww">
        Jesse Ventura
       </a>
       , former Governor of Minnesota and ex pro-wrestler, is a prominent supporter of this theory and in his opinion, the military can

        “…knock planes out of the air with it, they control cloud movements and all that with it...”
       </em>
       He claims to have been completely denied access to any facilities when he went to visit the site, while the Air Force insists that annual summer tours for journalists and civilians do take place. Among other theories, HAARP has been accused of causing floods, droughts, hurricanes, devastating earthquakes,  major power outages, the downing of TWA Flight 800, the sudden appearance of Gulf War syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and even, among the wilder theories, global mind-control.

       <strong>
        My Take (and it's just that):
       </strong>
       In our current internet age, there's very little independent research that can be done to prove or disprove any of the intense theories surrounding the mysterious military base. Obviously one can't visit the site, and many of the so-called conspiracy theories contradict each other. However, taking a huge meta-cognitive step back, it's my opinion that the truth lies somewhere in the middle. We know our government doesn't always have our best interest at heart (to put it lightly), and often hides its operations from us, even with good intentions. I also feel safe in saying that global mind control is not taking place. My guess is that HAARP is exactly what the Air Force says it is, and mostly conducts university studies relatively safely. However, I would also fully expect our government to take
       <strong>
        <em>
         huge
        </em>
       </strong>
       risks for the sake of profit/control/intelligence, as its done historically, at risk to the environment. And then to keep those risks a secret. Just look at the current nuclear crisis we're in, or the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident">
        false-flag CIA operation
       </a>
       which brought America into the Vietnam War (the Gulf of Tonkin incident). My point is this- it's probably a little of both. The people at HAARP are probably split into two camps: 1.) the awesome scientists who run the show and tell the truth. 2.) the military MIB who show up at odd hours of the night every few months, dismiss all the scientists, and conduct risky geophysical experiments for the military.

       I saw I think on a youtube video that hinted at or suggested or said that HAARP can make clouds into certain shapes. What do you think of that? There is a point I'm just curious on your input before I say why...because its kind of weird.

        list I found
       </a>
       of chemtrail and weather modification patents owned by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. HAARP or not, someone's fucking with those clouds. The thing is though, clouds are miles below the ionosphere, and are made up of billions of tiny ice crystals which usually have no charge. I say usually because scientists don't yet know 100% why/how clouds build-up and release electricity during thunder/lighting storms. So, this discrepancy actually lends a lot of credibility to the theory that, either as an intention or result of HAARP experiments, the military could've figured out how clouds become electrified and are now conducting such experiments. My opinion is no, but there's certainly an argument there.

       Heres why I asked. I'm unfamiliar with the TWA flight 800 and HARRP but when I read that in your post hair on my neck stood up. From k-12 my school district was the school where a bunch of people (french class I think) on TWA were from. I was probably in 7 or 8th grade when it happened. Anyhow I fuck you not, the fucking day after that happened the whole town was ya know kinda fucked up over it and had like a ceremony at the high school and a cloud was over the school for a good bit of time that really really did look like an angel. Now i dont believe in god so I chalk it up to coincidence...still thats prolly all it is it just made me think. Sorry for spelling and shit I'm on my phone and it's a dick pain to type a lot.

        "A memorial is located on the grounds of Montoursville High School. It is a statue of an angel (sculpted by James Barnhill of Asheville, North Carolina) on a base engraved with the names of the 21 local victims and a brief history. The memorial is in a circular grove of 21 trees (one for each victim). The angel was chosen because a cloud seen above the high school on July 21, 1996, was thought by many onlookers to resemble an angel, with 21 small clouds at its feet."

       You're getting the idea, but I think it's necessary to look at the concept of weather modification more broadly. 
Perhaps HAARP is used only on the ionosphere but there are tens of facilities which are similar to HAARP worldwide plus smaller ELF/ULF transmitters stationed all throughout the country. 
First we must examine the compounds used in the persistent contrail aerosol program: compounds of barium an strontium are showing up in rainwater samples, researches of the overt cloud-seeding program believe these alkali earth metals act as a medium of conduction for signal propagation. As they spread out these give the stratospheric environment a slight charge, which could then be perturbed in such a way to drive or move pressure fronts.

        This provides a much better summary than I can muster at this time

       1) The Navy and the Air Force do not sink lot's of money into an experimental project without the consensus that it has weapons,communications, or defense capability. That is a gimme.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) While I see r/conspiracy always blaming HAARP for all the worlds ills. I must point out that even if it can be true. Why just the USA? Russia and China each have such a location and are experimenting.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Playing with the ionosphere even for experimentation just flat out pisses me off. This is the earths line of defense against cosmic radiation such as UV's. If we fuck this up, and destroy such. Then we are fucked as a species.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like an analogy of reasoning I use. Sorry if some of you don't like it. However science cannot prove God, nor can they disprove of such. They need tools to investigate such potential if one scientist chooses to do so. However in my view such a creator (the ultimate scientist) exists in another dimension of time and space. They only way such could be demonstrated to exist. Would be to develop the tools to measure God. If I did that, and opened up that time and space to this one. What do you think would happen? Ballgame over IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       A tool can build, but can equally tear down. It's all how you use it. HAARP is a tool, and the researchers better understand completely what they are opening up to explore. Cause if they are not careful then you can kiss our species and all others Aloha oe'.

       Hey man, thanks for the writeup. I agree with your speculation, I'm sure it's being used for more sinister operations than detailed on their website .
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one honestly believe it has been used for covert eco-terrorism. It has complete plausible deniability, you can't exactly prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I believe that a lot of Tesla's work was used in it's creation. I also believe that a substantial amount of power can be injected through the resonence phenomenon, basically like how an opera singer breaks glass by continually injecting the perfect frequency to build and build up power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an incredible radar loop taken from Australia, which to me is ALMOST proof of a weather weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to get your opinion on this:
       <a href="http://www.theweatherchaser.com/radar-loop/IDR173-broome/2010-01-21-21/2010-01-22-21">
        Incredible radar loop of anomaly causing lash flooding
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it looks like they broke the sky open, literally causing Australia's great flood in 2010. If you follow that storm, it literally converges directly on the middle of that gigantic EM burst. Like perfectly centered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, people will argue that the placement of these radar 'glitches' are obviously from the radar tower itself, because it is centered right over it, but if I were planning to do something, that's exactly where I would shoot - knowing full well that people would more easily say glitch than modification, its more plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/2011/01/huge-rings-appear-over-australia-is-haarp-involved/">
        Here's an article dealing with a lot of 'anomalies'
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dutchsinse">
        Dutchsinse
       </a>
       covers a lot of HAARP based weather fuckery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, check out this microwave spectrum loop of Hurricane Ophelia in 2005, this hurricane was expected to hit the coast of the Carolina's and clearly 'looks' like it is being tugged away onto the water. They can absolutely move clouds with this technology, so why not hurricanes?

       This one is a toss up. 5 months ago they said they worked there. Could be a casual shill or just an ignorant peon. The right hand doesn't know what the left is doing so it is possible they're just a clueless grunt. Either way, remain vigilant.

       I agree with you. Re-read this line from the end of what I wrote-
       <strong>
        <em>
         My guess is that HAARP is exactly what the Air Force says it is, and mostly conducts university studies relatively safely. However, I would also fully expect our government to take huge risks for the sake of profit/control/intelligence, as its done historically, at risk to the environment. And then to keep those risks a secret... The people at HAARP are probably split into two camps: 1.) the awesome scientists who run the show and tell the truth
        </em>
       </strong>
       (you, johntyboy)
       <strong>
        <em>
         2.) the military MIB who show up at odd hours of the night every few months, dismiss all the scientists, and conduct risky geophysical experiments for the military.
        </em>
       </strong>
       What would you say to the idea that these experiments could be conducted
       <em>
        behind the backs
       </em>
       of the phd students, who do genuine research?

       Thanks for this report! In your account, you're mostly addressing the heating of the ionosphere, among other experiments. You emphasize the
       <em>
        heaters
       </em>
       at EISCAT but I was under the impression that the facilities at HAARP and others conducted much more broadly ranging experiments, including
       <strong>
        magnetospheric amplification, radiowave interactions with space plasmas,
       </strong>
       as well as
       <strong>
        experiments which
        <em>
         greatly exceed
        </em>
        the normal electron gyrofrequency of electrons from the sun.
       </strong>
       These examples are all pulled off the
       <a href="http://europa.agu.org/">
        American Geophysical Union website
       </a>
       . Wouldn't these involve much more elaborate facilities, and a deeper knowledge base from which the theories are drawn?
I'm not one to believe in a remote-controlled function of these facilities myself, but surely there's more going on than a heater and radar, as you suggest. The listed experiments alone account for that, even if you yourself have never partaken in them. 
No need to keep on with this, I think it's safe to say our heels are dug.

       wait wait wait wait, so you're saying that you (a phd student) are able to be at the EISCAT facility under zero supervision?? The radar and heater staff 'head home??' Wouldn't those be the exact conditions under which a government (or anyone) could come in and use the instruments outside the awareness of the general staff? Or perhaps with the consent of the general staff? In my experience studying governments, if it can be done, and there's a certain profit to be gained, they'll do it.

       I believe you are stating as truth that it was impossible where you worked. But I am alone at work and the owner just walked in, messed around downstairs for a bit, and then left. Am I now going to ask him what he was doing? In the age of computers I highly doubt any government affiliates would need to be on site anyway to conduct tests or experiments. I mean, to play devils advocate, if they have a machine capable of changing the Earths natural processes then technology to run it by computer from remote locations seems very likely.

       Heres why I asked. I'm unfamiliar with the TWA flight 800 and HARRP but when I read that in your post hair on my neck stood up. From k-12 my school district was the school where a bunch of people (french class I think) on TWA were from. I was probably in 7 or 8th grade when it happened. Anyhow I fuck you not, the fucking day after that happened the whole town was ya know kinda fucked up over it and had like a ceremony at the high school and a cloud was over the school for a good bit of time that really really did look like an angel. Now i dont believe in god so I chalk it up to coincidence...still thats prolly all it is it just made me think. Sorry for spelling and shit I'm on my phone and it's a dick pain to type a lot.
