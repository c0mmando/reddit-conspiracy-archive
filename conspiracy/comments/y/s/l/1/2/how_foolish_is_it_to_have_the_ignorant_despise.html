    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in alternate theories which is why I follow the conspiracy discussion. The difference between my ideology and what I see a lot of on this sub are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alternate theories always have the burden of proof because they are less likely by default. Why? In almost all cases, alternate theories require improbable cover ups. May it be something silly like Zimmerman or even something huge like 9/11, a vast number of people would have to be completely aware and silent
In many cases, people who have been at their positions for their entire career.</li>
<li>Despite insufficient evidence, many people still believe and latch onto conspiracy theories, refusing to change their position even after evidence refutes their claim. If you were more consistent about weeding out the completely improbable conspiracies that don&#39;t just lack evidence (but defy evidence), people would take conspiracy theorists more seriously.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, about 1% of the population are affected by Paranoid Schizophrenia. That&#39;s over a million people in the United States alone. That&#39;s a lot of people coming up with wild ideas and correlations. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s smarter to take a logical approach before concluding the less likely alternate theory to be more likely simply because it&#39;s possible?</p>

<p>For if every possible scenario is inherently more likely than the publicly accepted story, consider that I&#39;m from the conspiracy theory community, sending this transmission back in time from 2036. It&#39;s very possible. Humans could never survive the trip, but we learned how to manipulate quarks (which actually ended up.existing independently from the flow of time) to inject packets into the Internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have a difficult time dealing with conspiracy.  Secret space programs and reptile people aside, it can be difficult accepting that your own government does not have your best interest.</p>

<p>Some people simply cannot accept that our government is bought and paid for by a relatively small circle of wealthy people.  The implications are simply too terrifying.</p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is let them say what they are going to say.  Honestly, who really cares?  These people just aren&#39;t going to get it.  They&#39;ve seen the evidence, and rejected it subconsciously before giving it a fair shake.  There&#39;s really nothing you can do.  Everybody has their own path.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Excuse me, sir, but I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s you and yours that tend to reject evidence without giving it a fair shake.  For example, I have rebuttals to arguments regarding secondary explosives in the twin towers that I have <em>never</em> heard a response to.  What if I told you that jet fuel burns much, much hotter if you add a bunch of liquid oxygen to the mix?  What if I told you that all commercial airliners carry large tanks of liquid oxygen that are fireproof, but not impact-proof and that could easily be broken open in the event of an impact with a large building?  What if I told you that steel doesn&#39;t just remain perfectly rigid until it melts, but instead softens up significantly, warps, and snaps apart before any part of it begins to melt?  Again, I have presented these points during debates with truthers and I have not once even received an attempt to refute them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible that fuel would burn much hotter, but the black smoke coming off the towers indicates cooling temperatures.</p>

<p>Even NIST was unable to replicate the damage done to WTC with fires burning for more than 2 hours.</p>

<p>What if I told you that in order for the building to fall like that, that every single steel support would have to be severed in an instant?</p>

<p>What about the subsequent explosions that sounded exactly like a controlled demolition? Even the firefighters that were there thought there were explosives in the buildings.</p>

<p>And what about WTC 7?</p>
