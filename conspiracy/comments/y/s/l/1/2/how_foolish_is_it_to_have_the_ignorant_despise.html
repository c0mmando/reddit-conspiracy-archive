       I'm interested in alternate theories which is why I follow the conspiracy discussion. The difference between my ideology and what I see a lot of on this sub are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Alternate theories always have the burden of proof because they are less likely by default. Why? In almost all cases, alternate theories require improbable cover ups. May it be something silly like Zimmerman or even something huge like 9/11, a vast number of people would have to be completely aware and silent
In many cases, people who have been at their positions for their entire career.
       </li>
       <li>
        Despite insufficient evidence, many people still believe and latch onto conspiracy theories, refusing to change their position even after evidence refutes their claim. If you were more consistent about weeding out the completely improbable conspiracies that don't just lack evidence (but defy evidence), people would take conspiracy theorists more seriously.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Finally, about 1% of the population are affected by Paranoid Schizophrenia. That's over a million people in the United States alone. That's a lot of people coming up with wild ideas and correlations. Don't you think it's smarter to take a logical approach before concluding the less likely alternate theory to be more likely simply because it's possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       For if every possible scenario is inherently more likely than the publicly accepted story, consider that I'm from the conspiracy theory community, sending this transmission back in time from 2036. It's very possible. Humans could never survive the trip, but we learned how to manipulate quarks (which actually ended up.existing independently from the flow of time) to inject packets into the Internet.

       People have a difficult time dealing with conspiracy.  Secret space programs and reptile people aside, it can be difficult accepting that your own government does not have your best interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people simply cannot accept that our government is bought and paid for by a relatively small circle of wealthy people.  The implications are simply too terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm trying to say is let them say what they are going to say.  Honestly, who really cares?  These people just aren't going to get it.  They've seen the evidence, and rejected it subconsciously before giving it a fair shake.  There's really nothing you can do.  Everybody has their own path.

       Excuse me, sir, but I've found that it's you and yours that tend to reject evidence without giving it a fair shake.  For example, I have rebuttals to arguments regarding secondary explosives in the twin towers that I have
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       heard a response to.  What if I told you that jet fuel burns much, much hotter if you add a bunch of liquid oxygen to the mix?  What if I told you that all commercial airliners carry large tanks of liquid oxygen that are fireproof, but not impact-proof and that could easily be broken open in the event of an impact with a large building?  What if I told you that steel doesn't just remain perfectly rigid until it melts, but instead softens up significantly, warps, and snaps apart before any part of it begins to melt?  Again, I have presented these points during debates with truthers and I have not once even received an attempt to refute them.

       It looks like another guy made a serious rebuttal about black smoke and NIST and stuff or something and I'm busy atm with work stuff, but I look forward to debating with him on that once I have the time because conspiratard or not, he's a proper science-minded gentleman unlike some of the closet Nazis all up in here.

       Depends on the theory the truther believes in, most of them think it was just the planes that brought down the towers but it was a rogue section of the government that masterminded the plan and set it in motion in the first place.

       It's possible that fuel would burn much hotter, but the black smoke coming off the towers indicates cooling temperatures.
      </p>

       Even NIST was unable to replicate the damage done to WTC with fires burning for more than 2 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I told you that in order for the building to fall like that, that every single steel support would have to be severed in an instant?

       What about the subsequent explosions that sounded exactly like a controlled demolition? Even the firefighters that were there thought there were explosives in the buildings.

       That would depend on how you define "possible".

       There are plenty of people on this sub who believe in the more esoteric conspiracies, for example chemtrails; most claims regarding which I wouldn't consider possible.

       What I always find funny is seeing conspiracy theorist use the tactics they usually reserve for skeptics on their fellow theorist who simply don't dive as deep down the rabbit hole as they do.  You might think 9/11 being an inside job is the eaisest thing in the world to see but the second you start bashing Lizardpeople, Chemtrails or the HAARP Earthquake/Tornado/Hurricane machine you start getting called a government shill or a victim of the mainstream media.

       The rate at which we eat our young here is incredible.  Just look for my posts on Syria, because I don't tow the "party line" about it all being a Mossad/CIA operation, I am targeted for downvotes.

       At that stage its not really the chemtrail theory, as far as I'm aware chemtrails is when planes drop chemicals on the population to make them more stupid or something along those lines, planes dropping chemicals into the sky to form rain clouds isn't effecting the population.

       What I always find funny is seeing conspiracy theorist use the tactics they usually reserve for skeptics on their fellow theorist who simply don't dive as deep down the rabbit hole as they do.  You might think 9/11 being an inside job is the eaisest thing in the world to see but the second you start bashing Lizardpeople, Chemtrails or the HAARP Earthquake/Tornado/Hurricane machine you start getting called a government shill or a victim of the mainstream media.

       The rate at which we eat our young here is incredible.  Just look for my posts on Syria, because I don't tow the "party line" about it all being a Mossad/CIA operation, I am targeted for downvotes.

       It looks like another guy made a serious rebuttal about black smoke and NIST and stuff or something and I'm busy atm with work stuff, but I look forward to debating with him on that once I have the time because conspiratard or not, he's a proper science-minded gentleman unlike some of the closet Nazis all up in here.
