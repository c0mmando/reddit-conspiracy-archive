        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all I am not stepping down, only taking a break. With that being said, I&#39;m sorry to have jumped the gun, I just acted in a moment of weakness (which some people have loved to point out.), and I&#39;m sorry for any unnecessary drama this may have caused. I was planning on this break for a few weeks now, and I am almost ready, but this was the result of frustration. This was brought about about by several personal issues. No one here is to blame, this is my journey and any bumps in the road are my own. I&#39;m sorry again for any problems or drama this may have caused anyone here.</p>

<p>Secondly, I am not supercede, or any other accounts. This is my one and only. I did not nominate supercede for the moderator position, but I did concede when sunshine-x propsed that he be promoted to mod status. I like supercede, and he has some great ideas. This guy seems like he can help a lot, and we need it. I&#39;m buried waist deep, and I need someone else to grab a shovel and me out. He seemed like as good a choice as any of our veteran users. I&#39;m sorry if this offends anyone that I approved of it so quickly, but like I said sunshine-x nominated him. I&#39;m tired. He has the energy to inject new life into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are a few people who feel like slandering me lately. Peace be with you. All of you. I love each and every last one of you, especially those who are and were the closest to me here. You are all meaningful, you have given meaning to my life when it had no meaning. You did that for me. I owe you everything. So I have given myself to you. All of you. A lot of you have supported me through thick and thin, and that is amazing. I never would have expected such an outpouring of love and respect. It gave me a new lease on life and helped me become the person I am today. </p>

<p>But like I said, I&#39;m tired. I need to take a break, and starting after I make this post, I&#39;m logging off for a week. Thank all of you who supported me, and thank everyone who challenged me. No one becomes stronger from being surrounded by yes men. I&#39;ll be back and rested, I promise.</p>

<p>Much love guys. I&#39;ll see you soon. ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I been here along time, and I just don&#39;t get what the big deal of being a mod is all about. I do, however, do not like it when mods delete relevant posts and ban users for just speaking their mind. To get rid of the shitbags and whatnots, just use the up/down arrows. In closing, I don&#39;t know you (although I do recognize your username and the red text, I want that by the way) and I did hear some drama based on you for a couple of months or so, but I didn&#39;t keep up with any of it because I&#39;m a grown ass man and I don&#39;t give a fuck about all this childish shit I see on here. I go to this sight more that any other ones on reddit, but I don&#39;t comment on here rarely. But whatever, good luck, don&#39;t let the man keep you don&#39;t, you&#39;re the best.</p>

<p>1) No, you won&#39;t, because this account is already slated for termination and you&#39;ll never know where I strike from next.</p>

<p>2) My post is still standing, because it wasn&#39;t included in the r/subredditdrama original post about all of this (I did make a comment, after the fact though, to make sure they didn&#39;t miss anything).</p>

<p>3) So, I&#39;m assuming based on 9000sins huge tantrum (inspired by me removing him from <em>my</em> subreddit), that it&#39;s 9000sins butt that&#39;s hurting, at the moment.</p>

<p>See?</p>

<p>That big crybaby threw this huge fit, because I didn&#39;t like him telling me how to run my <strong>private</strong> subreddit. Awwww... poor fucking baby.</p>

<p>You were trolling and harassing people.</p>

<p>Where is the proof of this or are you still making things up as you go?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You deserved whatever I said or did.</p>

<p>K, this kind of attitude makes me realize why you got hit by that car. Karma is a bitch isn&#39;t it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>9000sins is a tyrant and a drama queen.</p>

<p>He can say dumb things from time to time but he&#39;s pretty much right a lot of the time when I see him post here. The only question is why are you defending trolls bro?...</p>

<p>Are you paid off already by them?! /s</p>
