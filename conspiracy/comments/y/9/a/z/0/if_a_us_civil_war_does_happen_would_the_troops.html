    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m active duty, and I can tell you right now, that I would not fire on civilians if a civil war broke out. In all likelihood, I would defect and I know many, MANY fellow service members that would do the same. Now, that&#39;s not saying that when the time came, that they would follow through, but I know I would. I joined to serve and defend the constitution from enemy&#39;s foreign AND domestic. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the current US government is the biggest enemy to the constitution and the American people, and our rights and civil liberties. I would not hesitate to engage fellow service members that were just &quot;following orders&quot; and firing on innocent civilians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Family heritage, sense of contributing, responsibility, to defend and protect the things I hold dear. Its only after I joined, that I began to see the true nature of this government at work. I began to see just how much the rest of this world hates us, and I began to question why. The more I questioned, the more I learned. I started following politics closely, stopped relying on mainstream media to lie to me, and started thinking for myself. I stopped buying into the lies fed to me by our leaders. I&#39;d rather fight for the American people, than protect a corrupt government bought  and paid for by corporate and banking greed.</p>

The power hungry don&#39;t just jut out their wrists and willfully wait for a pair of handcuffs to wrap around them.  And as for infiltrators, you&#39;re more likely to get your infiltrators locked up and tossed into a dark, secluded hole.  The system keeps heavy track of its users and its only tightening by the day.  Your infiltrators may not stick out like sore thumbs to the common dude, but their digital signature sticks out sure enough.  Government don&#39;t trust nobody.  Not anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are absolutely right. However, if the President and/or officers appointed over me were to ever order the firing upon of innocent Americans, they would be traitors to the constitution and the American people. </p>

<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed- *****That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of those ends, it is Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security...</p>

<p>Seems pretty straight forward to me on where my loyalties lie If the government uses violence against its citizens to suppress a constitutionally protected act. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. The point I was trying to make is that, when the time comes, and it probably will, there will be those of us in uniform that will be down in the foxhole with you, fighting to protect you and your family. Just like there will be those of us in uniform just following orders. Most of us have seen enough bloodshed to haunt us for the rest of our lives. The last thing we want is to gun down people of our communities, our neighbors, our children&#39;s teachers. Most would rather commit suicide than commit atrocities against American civilians. It would feel like a betrayal that would be unbearable to handle. </p>

<p>Me and a buddy were sitting outside having a couple beers earlier tonight, and this topic came up. I asked him the simple question that the OP asked. His response? &quot;Why would I turn against the people that I joined to protect? If my brothers were trying to eliminate my family and friends, then they&#39;re not my brothers, they&#39;re my enemy.&quot;  He&#39;s an E-7, and that&#39;s the mentality a lot of us share, not all of us, but a good majority. If the government does turn against the American people, it will be with the aid of contractors and mercenaries. I don&#39;t see the military being the main ones you have to worry about. But that&#39;s just my opinion. Have a good night guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct about that. They will manipulate us into thinking we are protecting those we are actually fighting against. Only those of us that are smart enough to know the difference will see through the lies and stand up for what&#39;s right and just.

    <div class="md"><p>former soldier, and it would only be a matter of time before some dumbass got scared my a mob and let off a warning shot that lands in some kid&#39;s face. there are a lot of straight up sociopaths in the military now; ever since they dropped the enlistment standards at the height of the iraq war the ranks got flooded with felons, gang members (mostly of the racial sort), and former drug addicts (meth, not weed). Give anyone like that a big enough gun to stroke their ego and a few stripes to solidify their god complex and you&#39;ve got a problem. </p>

<p>It won&#39;t start in suburbia. it starts in places like anaheim. it&#39;ll be in center city disaster neighborhoods. it&#39;ll start with minorities and the poor, not the rich and white. but once the bullets start flying all bets are off. collateral damage is a bitch. in afghanistan civilian casualties are COMMON. let&#39;s not forget anyone male and walking is labeled as a MAM (military aged male). </p>

<p>it&#39;s not like the US military hasn&#39;t shot their own civilians before. </p>

<p>Expect the private contractors to play a big role. Those fucks have shot at US troops overseas. they do not play by rules of engagement. they do not give a fuck. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t, and I know many more soldiers who wouldn&#39;t shoot americans. If civil war breaks out there might be some kind of mass desertions from the military but only if a few high ranking officers lead them. </p>

<p>My guess is that the military will be tied up overseas while the police forces, CIA/FBI/NSA/DHS/ contractors what have you lead the way for civil war. the troops return home to a combat theater in progress and their training takes over. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve also seen some really caring and genuine people in the military, as well.  You could say the military attracts people from all walks of life.  Does the system try to program you? Of course it does.  Does it always take? No.  Does it take for a lot of the people in it? Probably to some degree.  When faced with working actively against Americans, would this programming be able to overcome any emotional inhibitions they would have about that?  Why I surely hope so but if it doesn&#39;t, do you want to be the dude yelling at a soldier, hoping that is the one out however many that may be on your side?</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Army</a></p>

<p>If the gov&#39;t and military are willing to use a force of 800 police, 1,000 military members and four tanks against 17,000 of their &quot;brothers&quot; (WW1 vets who were protesting) along with 20,000 of their supporters... on American soil, no less... then I have no doubt that the answer to your question is, sadly, yes.</p>

<p>And now I&#39;m pissy, dammit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard for me to personally weigh in on this since I&#39;ve never served. But here&#39;s my take. </p>

<p>There are two types of military people in my mind. Those that are proud to have served, and those that realized they made a mistake by signing up. </p>

<p>The first type of military person is the one who is easily influenced and was made to be given orders his/her whole life. These are loyal to the military/government folks who would die for those higher ups as they know their sacrifice is for God and Country. </p>

<p>The other type are the ones who didn&#39;t mind serving, but woke up and realized how fucked up being in the military is. I recall the former military folks who stood out during the rise of OWS. That big black guy who called out NYPD and made them look like fools. Then the poor kid over here in Oakland that was shot intentionally with a gas canister in the head, which turned out really bad for him. They were this other type that would pick and defend against their fellow man. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how many types there are on both sides. Some speculate the success of the military is related to Stockholm Syndrome. </p>

<p>Hard to say. I can only hope the ones who woke up, are smarter and more organized then the God and Country folks. </p>

They follow orders, because if they do not, they will be fired. They have families, people they take care of, and though they may be good people, it matters more to them to keep doing that job so that they can take care of their own.</p>

<p>Most of us know what this is like, and while I don&#39;t feel sympathy for the bad cops, or even for the good ones who don&#39;t stand up against their evil brethren, I do at least understand where they are coming from in not wanting to stand up to their higher ups.</p>

the blogger asked if his marines would shoot americans, and this guy said proudly &quot;they are not americans we would be shooting, they are targets&quot;. 
the next question was something like what about the marines that said they would help civilians if the time came.
and the guy gets all jumbled up, fists clenched and grunts &quot;not my marines!&quot;
pretty shitty if you ask me, but it could all just be some dudes bs story.</p>

It may not fully change them but it certainly makes me second guess their understanding of their duties. Ask them if they&#39;d fire on their own family if ordered to. It will always make them question how legitimate their <em>do as you&#39;re told at all times</em> outlook on their job is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s one Marine.  Unlike the Army, when a Marine makes up his mind, that&#39;s that.  Doesn&#39;t matter how popular the idea is or what the odds are.  Thankfully, as likely as a Marine is to not give a crap about the target that&#39;s in front of him, there&#39;s more than likely another that will run through fire to pull someone to safety.

    <div class="md"><p>Some people are speculating way too much about this issue, and just assume a civil war is a logical situation. In all reality a civil war will not happen because the American people are not radically divided to that point and I don&#39;t think they ever will be. IF a civil war did manage to happen, it would have to be between two sections of the US both with military and industrial capabilities. The country would literally have to be split down the middle for this to happen. Why would the west coast army fight the east coast army? Would that ever happen? NO. </p>

<p>Edit: What you are thinking of is an Insurgency forming in the United States. Which would be short lived and very unpopular. </p>

<p>But, I honestly believe that a lot of the young guys in the military today would follow orders and open fire if they were told that civilians were enemy combatants. I also think this about a lot of the young/new cops joining police forces.</p>

<p>The standards have gotten lower and lower for both police and military, it just wouldn&#39;t shock me if they turned on their own citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A meaningful Civil War in the US is incredibly unlikely in the next 50 years, too many world powers and institutions rely on the continued hegemony of the current US Government for their own success, any changes would come from within the system. But it&#39;s incredibly likely troops would shoot their own civilians. </p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m justfying the actions of any of these partisans but: Look at the whiskey rebellion, look at the Civil War, The Bonus Army, Waco, Ruby Ridge, they&#39;re always viewed as insurgents or dangerous criminals- a Just Cause for deadly force is a matter of perspective. </p>

<p>That said, if a partisan movement actually got off the ground before being crushed, political and military defections could be likely as they were in any civil war in the past, but if the time came, the issue wouldn&#39;t be as black and white as the states and federals randomly gunning down civilians, there would be some form of justification(&quot;terrorist&quot; &quot;violent mobs&quot; &quot;armed rebels&quot;) that many in law enforcement and the military may feel it&#39;s their duty to see through. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The State departments justification is shitty, however they do leave room for appeal(from the same NYT investigation).</p>

<p>That said there&#39;s no rational reason for the US army just to run around blowing shit up for the hell of it, we&#39;re not talking about comic book plots. Any killing of US citizens during a period of armed conflict, would go down and be percieved similar to the Civil War or something &quot;pre-emptive and provoked&quot;(allegedy) like Ruby Ridge standoff, like I said. </p>

<p>Even now in Afghanistan and Pakistan, if you look at the press releases, some form (albiet shakey) justification and background is given for each air-strike, the same procedure would be used if a &quot;terrorist&quot; group was targeted within the US boarders, though unlikely since they would be within the jurisdiction of the FBI and other Federal law enforcement agencies, who historically don&#39;t like to yield ground to the CIA. </p>

<p>In short, an armed conflict within the US would be a PR battle over which side could make a better case for their actions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Yes they would.</p>

<p>You can trust that the men who travel 10000 miles to fight with lethal force, because of some out of perspective idea of national threat, will do the very same to the people who threat to attack and secure what might be their own families home.</p>

<p>Never underestimate the power of a depression. People get absolutely fucking mad. The first movements, to the first victims, to the first battles, is a surprisingly short walk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How&#39;s it going, Squesh.  As you can tell by the handle I use, I&#39;m a war whore so I can answer with a little first hand knowledge on this topic.</p>

<p>A) If US troops are called into action against US civilians, they will engage them.  There will be plenty of defectors, some saboteurs, and probably plenty of infighting eventually but initially you&#39;re going to see a pretty solid and heavy concerted effort.  I wouldn&#39;t expect too much mercy or quarter.  And I wouldn&#39;t be worried about the infantry.  I&#39;d be worried about the interrogators.  They&#39;re going to break you or drive you bat-shit insane trying.  Their intel is going to rip apart your life to the very ends that it can be ripped apart and they&#39;ll find every single person you talk to on a regular basis and try to exploit them if they can&#39;t exploit you.  They will try to ferret out every last vestige of anything they could see as resistance to completing their mission.  And by and large, they will be successful. </p>

<p>B) No.  </p>

<p>C) Private security firms are already utilized overseas and domestically.  It would be a veritable field day if we had civil unrest to the likes where the government would call upon them in that capacity.  Money out the ears.  </p>

<p>Private security are not US military, by and large.  They may have been, at one point, but are a far different breed by the time you&#39;ll see them.  They are rotted from the inside out.  Many are hopped up on all sorts of stimulants and plenty of them love the &#39;roids.  They are sometimes better armed, small arms-wise, and better trained than conventional forces.  They are also paid much, much more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how the government could ever afford, simply financially, to maintain an active domestic US campaign against its own citizenry.  But if they are unconcerned about cost, they will utilize security firms to great effect because they are completely expendable.  If a security contractor dies, government loses nothing.  If a soldier dies, the government is out millions of dollars (on average).  You can see the weighted bonus on that.</p>

<p>Anyhow, hope I answered your question alright.</p>
