        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I thought I&#39;d share the reasons I&#39;m leaving the sub.</p>

<p>While at first, I thought it was great to meet a group of like-minded people online, I don&#39;t think that you guys are entirely sane. </p>

<p>Because there are 76K of you, I&#39;ll amend my statement.</p>

<p>There doesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of consciousness going beyond the knee-jerk reaction. I mean, I always thought it would at one point occur to everyone the possibility that some of their conspiracy theories were psychological projection.</p>

<p>IE, if I have trouble getting laid, it&#39;s not that the government has MKUltra&#39;ed every woman in my town, it&#39;s more likely that the problem is with me.</p>

<p>Not looking to the self as the cause of perception lends itself to all kinds of conspiracy theories. I used to embrace that, because it gave me a little perspective.</p>

<p>Lately, it&#39;s just gone over to the dark side. Some have said that the government has become more involved in the subreddit. I highly doubt it. But the sub does seem to be overrun with people looking for validations on their mental dispositions. </p>

<p>Chemtrails, Zionism, David Icke ... these are supposed to give us perspective on things. We were never meant to swallow these things whole! Hook, line, and sinker! </p>

<p>And the negativity! Good grief. Everyone downvoting all voices of reason and doubt because somehow <em>they</em> are now obviously agents of the government themselves. Paranoia on top of paranoia. Fear runs this sub now.</p>

<p>What can I say. It&#39;s just no fun anymore. It&#39;s become weird. I&#39;ll probably end up coming back after the sub has gone down to 20K or so.  Cheers!</p>

<p>EDIT: Wow. I&#39;m very surprised. I didn&#39;t know how right I was with my decision until I read all of your replies. Today I was called a &#39;disinformation artiste.&#39; Wow. <em>(Takes off foil hat and hands it to the grand wizard)</em> ... You guys have fun.</p>

<p>EDIT: Wrap it up. I&#39;m leaving. So stop replying. I&#39;ve downvoted my own post in order to conclude this painful yet enlightening process.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t think you guys are very logical, that&#39;s all. I mean, seriously. Zoom out on this thread here and just look at all the replies. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but none of them deal with my main bullet point which is that r/conspiracy is all about knee-jerk reaction.</p>

<p>In fact, the response to my post is a big &quot;fuck you&quot; from r/conspiracy. I kind of wanted a more rational approach to things.</p>

<p>My question is: Does this knee-jerk downvoting/condemnation reflect someone looking for truth?</p>

<p>I think maybe I underestimated the 4channess of reddit. &quot;Fuck you&quot; is how reddit says &quot;welcome to our sub&quot;</p>

<p>What has he done for the community besides create a place that nurtures some of the most foolish fools out there? 9k sins is probably <em>the</em> reason you have people calling others <em>shills</em> or <em>disinfo</em> agents for finding faults with the arguments they put forth.</p>

<p>Nothing about 9k sins promoted rational skepticism and reasoned discussion. 9k bought into the same sort of bias/fallacy that the media does. By thinking there is always two sides to the story he found a very convenient way to promote the side he felt was right. If the media told you that stuxnet had nothing to do Fukushima, the opposite must be true, right? </p>

<p>he doesn&#39;t know they exist either. It go&#39;s both ways. They are simply numbers.</p>

<p>When did anyone imply otherwise? You are the one suggesting he had a noticeable effect on the community. Your response seems to prove my point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What? You must be just another conspiratard, and this community is in opposition to your thoughts and beliefs. What are you even doing here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. I guess it&#39;s too much for you to consider a middle ground between a &quot;conspiratard&#39; and someone that thinks Eisenhower signed an agreement with the aliens. But then again, you don&#39;t seem like you think things through very much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason people call other peoples shills and disinfo agents is because of the consistency with which they enforce/defend the status quo. frostek for example, he&#39;s a fucking shill. Grapedinthemouth, hes a fucking shill, and most of their little vote gang. You&#39;re probably a shill. Lets solve this right now, was 9/11 an inside job?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s because the &quot;shills&quot; disagree with the current conspiracy being discussed. Very often they aren&#39;t even arguing <em>for</em> the status quo, rather they found faults in the arguments put fourth by the theorists. Apparently you think thats something a skeptical conspiracy theorist <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> do. But once again, this is consistent with how you demonstrate a lack of thought. 9/11 was an inside job! Apparently that&#39;s the only conspiracy or something? Do I pass your test now? But seriously - go look at my posting history and see what I&#39;ve written on that. Nice try on the &#39;credential fallacy&#39; though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pure bs, this is nothing more than a vague assertion with nothing to back it up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your post right here does. You suggest that anyone disagreeing with a conspiracy theory is advocating for the status quo. That&#39;s not the case and suggests you see the situation in a binary fashion - &quot;either they agree with me, or they are advocating for the status quo&quot;. That&#39;s not very rational nor skeptical. You - and the other shill callers - are terrible conspiracy theorists. You are not at all interested in discussing anything, rather you prefer to blindly reinforce your preconceived notions with likeminded gents. Fuck you and your cabal of stupidity. </p>

<p>You already said I was &quot;probably a shill&quot; so you are just full of shit.</p>

<p>Here is a quote where you do that exact thing (circle jerk with your friends).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re probably a shill. </p>

<p>What you don&#39;t seem to understand, is that the consequences of openly excepting potential disinformation agents with open arms into this subreddit, far outweighs the consequences of applying a label to someone. There&#39;s no comparison.</p>

<p>Really? You think that automatically assuming anyone who disagrees is a shill makes more sense than having a rational discussion??</p>

<p>Just what was that he has done?</p>

<p>You have such a narrow world view. Pro Jew? Because it&#39;s either pro jew or anti jew, right? </p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s Christians in the &quot;banking sector&quot;, but there&#39;s far more Jews. </p>

<p>Yeah? You sure about that?</p>

<p>The JIDF will do so.</p>

<p>Yet they haven&#39;t contacted me!</p>

<p>Mark my words: within the next few years we will either lose all semiautomatics, including shotguns, or, all firearms in totality.</p>

<p>I have a bet with someone who claimed they would be gone by february. If you&#39;d like to pick a date I&#39;d be glad to bet you as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gosh, I simply can&#39;t read anymore. You&#39;re so self righteous, sarcastic, and belittling. You really think you have the world by the balls, and that your just so clever. Disgusting.</p>

<p>I guess I should be like you and ignorantly circle-jerk specious arguments. I definitely don&#39;t have the world by the balls - however a lot of the folk in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are definitely easy targets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just has to be dealt with maturely. There are some conspiracies that have very sound, logical arguments for them and others that are completely batshit wack-o. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people that subscribe to conspiracies for the wrong reasons and they seem to make up a majority of &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</p>

<p>I used to listen to Alex Jones a lot, but stopped when I realized that he thinks literally EVERYTHING is a conspiracy when many things can be chalked up to people acting in their own self interest rather than the interests of a group of conspirators. </p>

<p>For most things, I go for stupidity/ignorance/self interest over conspiracy but Kennedy and 9/11 are two that conspiracy is blatantly obvious.</p>

<p>The one that&#39;s been irking me the most is this shit about the Batman Massacre and Scopolamine. Scopolamine has been extremely sensationalized by vice, yet people buy into it &quot;hook, line and sinker&quot; with no critical thought or research into Scopolamine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I did see &quot;what in the world are they spraying.&quot;</p>

<p>My complaint isn&#39;t about chemtrails, but r/conspiracy&#39;s handling of them.</p>

<p>And if you zoom out on this thread, you&#39;ll read a bunch of 4-chan-like statements that I didn&#39;t anticipate on reddit. I would describe r/conspiracy&#39;s reaction to my post as a frenzied bloodthirsty attack.</p>

<p>I think if I were physically in a room with everyone in this thread, it would be a veritable fight club.</p>

<p>My point over and over again, this sub is way too negative. And cynical. And it&#39;s actually a bit violent, as much as the internet permits.</p>

<p>Regarding Chemtrails, I know everything you said, but it still needs work. 1) you need a whistleblower. 2) you need a theory as to why they would spray barium and strontium 3) you need motive. I still haven&#39;t heard anything like a motive.</p>

<p>Chemtrails are my primary bullet-point example because the people that embraced the theory did so without answering the above three questions. Then they sort of attack me for trying to engage the issues as I see them. I don&#39;t come here to argue: I come to discuss.</p>

<p>Rather, I <em>didn&#39;t</em> come here to argue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did under other user handles. I can see how that would be confusing.</p>

<p>My take on 9/11 was that it was an internal struggle. Shadow government vs. Good Guy Government.</p>

<p>I believe that GWB didn&#39;t know shit. He was a figurehead. Obama may think he&#39;s President, but he&#39;s also a figurehead, and it could have just as easily happened to him. </p>

<p>I think that the last &quot;true&quot; president was Kennedy. Obama&#39;s a liar. Romney wishes he were as good a liar. They&#39;re both scumbags. They&#39;re both in someone&#39;s pocket. Both parties are under control. You saw how Ron Paul was forcibly muscled out of the American consciousness. Not so subtly. Unfortunately, Paul let the allegations of racism get under his skin, and succumbed to the &quot;company he keeps&quot; argument (we&#39;d all be in trouble then). It was old hat political shenanigans. But it worked. That and controlling the media. Ron Paul, if nothing else, was evidence that the media is being manipulated. Anyway!</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear that a missile hit the Pentagon. I don&#39;t know how that&#39;s even in dispute. Flight 93 was destined for WTC 7, but was shot down by &quot;Good Guy Govt.&quot; Why they didn&#39;t admit to it, I don&#39;t know, but many say that the government could never admit to killing civilians, even in the name of saving other civilians.</p>

<p>Is Osama bin Laden real? You bet. No doubt about it. Attack on the USS Cole. Now is Al Qaeda real? That&#39;s more questionable. I would say yes, but not nearly in the form presented.</p>

<p>Did the towers succumb to fire? Good grief. How is this even still a question? I&#39;ve had tons of arguments about this, from an engineering point of view. There&#39;s tons of documentaries featuring architects, designers, engineers. Good grief. You want to talk about evidence?</p>

<p>I think that 9/11 tested each American&#39;s willingness to think and act as an individual. And for the most part, what the average American did was derogatorily slandered as being a &quot;sheeple.&quot; Most Americans were unwilling to face facts. They lacked the courage needed to stand up.</p>

<p>I can understand it. You see, the elites are trying to build a caste system. The ancient hindus classified and qualified different stages of human evolution towards the Godhead. The Indians bastardized it early on. Brahmins on one end and untouchables on the other -- hardly resembles what was described in the Upanishads.</p>

<p>What the elites are working towards ... The &quot;devil&#39;s&quot; version (for lack of a better word) is similar. The caste system means that if you play by their rules, you can move up to a better caste. Everyone is expected to play ... and 99% of people <em>do</em> play. If you&#39;ve ever seen &quot;Master Chef&quot; or &quot;So you think you can dance&quot;, these are people who are willing to do <em>anything</em> to move up to a better caste.</p>

<p>Cops, politicians, military men and women, TV and movie producers ... all are trying to move up the caste. If you don&#39;t play, your position in the caste is threatened. Carol Quigley wrote about a group whose intent was to control global finance. Look at what is happening in the world today and tell me if they failed. Yet money has only the value we give it. And if you&#39;re dancing like a jackass on TV for a few million dollars of fiat currency ... you&#39;ve really sold your soul, no metaphor.</p>

<p>9/11 was the first real test of our individual characters. I believe there are other tests coming, because from the perspective of the elites, there is still too much freedom. There is still too much liberty. The drums of war are beating. What they want is ... what I think r/conspiracy is lately: frenzy. No clear thinking. No rational thought. They want to turn us into animals that react ... the way they want us to!</p>

<p>9/11 happened, and whatever opinion we have, we should accept it and move on. The reason I say that is because there are other things happening. If you didn&#39;t see black hands working in the shadows for 9/11, just open your eyes to what is happening in Syria. Watch how war machine moves in Syria and Iran.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to rely on 9/11 to see what&#39;s going on. That&#39;s the amazing thing ... you can see it in UFO&#39;s, you can see it in Kennedy, you can see it in Assange, and Manning, the Financial Crisis ... it&#39;s everywhere. World War 3 has already begun. </p>

<p>I believe that everyone on Earth already knows this at some level. Subconsciously, we&#39;ve all acquiesced to either be controlled or to rebel against control. I think that December 21, 2012 is sort of a deadline for picking which side you&#39;re on. (Let&#39;s be honest, the Mayans were extraordinary astronomers). I think there&#39;s no more sitting on the fence watching the war, and come 12/22/2012, you&#39;re either going to be on one side or another.</p>

<p>Thank you for asking me this simple question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read Kevin Phillips&#39;s &quot;American Dynasty&quot; about the Bush&#39;s. I can see your point. </p>

<p>But the look on his face the morning of 9/11 is pretty priceless. I&#39;d ask, how could someone know, but look so flummoxed? He didn&#39;t know whether to take a shit or go blind.</p>

<p>[That book, by the way, is a must-read. If I ever expected to see people morph into lizards a-la Icke, it would be the Bushes. And John Perkins has some not-so-nice things to say about them, too. The sequel to &quot;Confessions of an Economic Hitman&quot; (I forget the sequel&#39;s title).]</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand these accusations of trumpeting. I thought of it as leaving feedback. If you wanted people to come to your sub, you might like to know what people are looking for there.</p>

<p>This post .. I pretty much thought that one or two people would see it, downvote it and move on. My obligation for feedback to reddit would have been fulfilled. I was unaware of a rash of people leaving the sub... last I heard was 9000sins.</p>

<p>If you zoom out, and read the whole thread, you can see more easily why I&#39;m leaving. Most people with rational, measured responses have negative upvotes. People with knee-jerk emotional (Sith) reactions have +4 to +10 upvotes. </p>

<p>I was also kind of hoping someone would tip me off to another sub. That didn&#39;t happen. r/UFO&#39;s it is, I guess ... We&#39;ll see if I miss this sub or not. I only left today.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean anything personal by it.</p>

Too many people jump on the bandwagon of this or that conspiracy and believe it only becuase another like minded conspiracy theorist brought it to their attention.  There are some one this sub that are great and seem to do a little bit more fact checking and use a bit more reasoning then others, however there are way too many people on here who have no clue as to how the world works so they use a bunch of out there theories to try and make some sense of things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. The biggest peeve I have is r/conspiracy&#39;s lack of self-reflection. The &quot;conspiracies: are here by our choice. I mean, all of us. Obama is President because we all agreed. We outnumber these elites by 99% to 1%. The only way they can control us ... is if we let them.</p>

<p>And everyone who doesn&#39;t agree with them is a &quot;sheeple&quot;, ie, an enemy as well. They&#39;ve already won. Divide an conquer. Illusions of superiority prevent us from uniting. (I certainly don&#39;t any longer see my self reflection in a sub that&#39;s cynical, paranoid, and irrational. Even warning the sub about what it&#39;s becoming is massively unpopular.)</p>

<p>We need to stop the name calling and unite under one banner. So the people telling me, &quot;Don&#39;t let the door hit you in the ass on your way out&quot; are basically confirming my decision to leave. They never had any intention of joining forces with me to reclaim our freedoms. They just wanted to come here and bitch about life and not do anything about it.</p>

<p>I had old web pages on Free Yellow and a couple other free webpage builders that I had lost the passwords to. Some of those even went out of business but for some reason my pages all remained up. They were all political pages criticizing the government and links to articles and news stories, going back to 1997 when I was collecting stuff on Clinton.</p>

<p>I had hundreds of links there and I used those for references, but about four or five months ago they finally disappeared.</p>

<p>Now Demonoid has been shut down and <a href="http://www.geekosystem.com/google-takedowns-way-up/" title="Google Takedown Requests Up 1,137% Since 2011">Google Takedown Requests Up 1,137% Since 2011</a></p>

<p>They are trying to seize control of the one thing they fear the most and places like this are one of their problem childs.</p>

<p>I went to blogger in 2006 and all they have to do is shut that down and I loose everything I&#39;ve collected for the past 6 years too</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too bad.</p>

<p>There has been an inundation by trolls. I got trolled by an r/conspiratard earlier today. I didn&#39;t check his backlog comments until <em>after</em> I realized he was a dipshit. His name is &quot; hotakyuu&quot;, by the by so don&#39;t get locked into a &quot;discussion&quot; with this guy. He&#39;s an energy suck. Always check the backlogs of people who sound like trolls and don&#39;t fucking feed the trolls. I violated this rule by replying to him at all so I&#39;m a complete hypocrit and I know it. I&#39;m only saying that we should be mindful not to waste our energy on r/conspiratard trolls who will never get anything out of the conversation other than the depletion of your energy / time / life.</p>

<p>That said, if I let all the assholes dictate where I go then they win. </p>

<p>I&#39;m staying. They&#39;ll get bored before me. The only reason they&#39;re here is to be assholes. Some might be paid and some might not. Those that are doing it for free will simply stop. Those who are getting paid mean that we&#39;re having an effect. That is to say, we&#39;re worth a financial investment because we&#39;re not subservient monkeys. </p>

<p>Do what you like, but I&#39;m staying. There might be some anti-semitic assholes and fairy-god-princess in here, but that&#39;s par for the course. All groups have dumb-asses in them and all you can really do is ignore them and support those who really do care.</p>

<p>Cheers, though.</p>

<p>I hope you find a better place to chill.</p>

<p>Hell, link to it and I might join.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I searched wikipedia and it states, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism">Zionism</a> is actually a modern political movement of the 20th century, that advocates for Jewish national interests.</p>

<p>The movement was eventually successful in establishing Israel on May 14, 1948 (5 Iyyar 5708 in the Hebrew calendar), as the homeland for the Jewish people.</p>

<p>The key part being: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, I appreciate the hard work and constant digging people do into this stuff. I don&#39;t think the subreddit should change either. Without it, you couldn&#39;t find the truth, but so much of it is just pointless reposts. There&#39;s almost as many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts per hour (Maybe like, 60%) as there are <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. There&#39;s not that many &quot;new&quot; conspiracies worth talking about on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Eventually, the desire to find &quot;truth&quot; turns into outright paranoia and people accusing other people of being shills. Do you think this helps the truth get told when half the community is attacking each other on a daily basis? Agree on the facts, disagree with the inconsistencies, but don&#39;t start attacking your fellow community members for some paranoid shit. If that&#39;s the standard way information disseminates and you truly believe in the illuminato/nwo stuff, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s what &quot;they&quot; want? Don&#39;t you think &quot;they&quot; want to be able to just say &quot;Wow look a shill&quot; if anything comes out? If enough people accuse and discredit someone with ad hominem attacks, their whole point will be thrown out. Stop attacking the person and instead attack the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just went and looked at some of his comments... specifically chemtrails which seems to be one of his sticking points.</p>

<p>In there he basically says that the claim of definitive proof, isn&#39;t proof, and even says what proof would be (collecting an air sample and getting it tested).</p>

<p>That&#39;s not baseless, and it offers a means of saying, yeah... perhaps we do need to get a little more evidence.</p>

<p>In it, I didn&#39;t see him dismissing what happened, only saying that it doesn&#39;t fit the standard of &#39;proof&#39;.  And honestly it didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>But even, lets say, you&#39;re 100% accurate on your assessment of him, then he makes a good sparring partner, and keeps you on your game.</p>

<p>I see too many people in this sub that are more hung up on being accepted, than finding out if they&#39;re right.  It makes the place look ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>collecting an air sample and getting it tested</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has already been done countless times, with the same results which support the need for an official investigation.</p>

<p>Now, if both of you are implying the impossible task of flying an aircraft behind a plane that is suspected of chemtrailing, you are both ignorant of FAA regulations and safety.  When is the last time you have ever witnessed an aircraft flying through the contrail of another?</p>

<p>A good sparring partner doesn&#39;t cop out and feign leaving, or attempt to conflate Zionism with chemtrailing and reptilians.  His position is not supported by evidence, but his insistence of the lack thereof, in the face of said evidence.  That is the definition of not only a baseless denial, but that of willful ignorance.</p>

<p>&quot;Sheeple&quot; are your greatest untapped asset in the war on the elite. How on Earth can you guys do anything without the help of the people you call &quot;Sheeple&quot;? Ohhhh, it&#39;s not about doing anything. No one&#39;s here to do anything but circle jerk.</p>

<p>Just what was that he has done?</p>

<p>You have such a narrow world view. Pro Jew? Because it&#39;s either pro jew or anti jew, right? </p>

<p>Sure, there&#39;s Christians in the &quot;banking sector&quot;, but there&#39;s far more Jews. </p>

<p>Yeah? You sure about that?</p>

<p>The JIDF will do so.</p>

<p>Yet they haven&#39;t contacted me!</p>

<p>Mark my words: within the next few years we will either lose all semiautomatics, including shotguns, or, all firearms in totality.</p>

<p>I have a bet with someone who claimed they would be gone by february. If you&#39;d like to pick a date I&#39;d be glad to bet you as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gosh, I simply can&#39;t read anymore. You&#39;re so self righteous, sarcastic, and belittling. You really think you have the world by the balls, and that your just so clever. Disgusting.</p>

<p>I guess I should be like you and ignorantly circle-jerk specious arguments. I definitely don&#39;t have the world by the balls - however a lot of the folk in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are definitely easy targets. </p>

<p>No, I have an alarm set to contact the guy I made a bet with. What does it matter what account I contact him from anyway?</p>

<p>Seeing as you couldn&#39;t tell (even though it was in my post history), my last name was tiredoflibs. A real surprise, huh?</p>

<p>Do you have a point to make? Because short of that I don&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong</p>
