       I read Gizmodo, unfortunately. It started years ago as a tech blog that kept me up to date on computers ant networking hardware along with cool new tech toys and whatnot. Lately (after they were purchased by a media conglomerate) they have been pusing war mongering, at least twice a week now there are articles about military weaponry and two days ago they published an article stating that the author did not believe humans were capable of owning guns..

       this is a prime example of corporate controlled media attempting to sway the public.

       This is bullshit.'

       EDIT II: Gawker is the media conglomerate, they were not purchased by anyone else, I was mistaken. This still does not free them from my accusations, only that a certain part of what I said was incorrect and id hate to see people get the wrong info because of me

       and here is what the editor in chief has to say about guns
joemfbrown ‏@joemfbrown
Guns need to go. My objection is not moral; they're just a technology that is too advanced for most people [1]

       UPDATE/EDIT:
I posted what you see below as the first 3 comments on this article. Within 10 minutes they were removed by the author, i reposted them and sent an email to the entire writing staff and editors. Here are the comments that Giz thought were dangerous
      </p>
      <p>
       "Did Giz not just publish an article saying that we humans are not advanced enough to properly control/own guns? Why the fuck is Giz pushing all this military weaponry on its readers, the same people that giz says should not own guns. So its OK to give our military (People who have been trained to KILL) all the weapons they want, but dont let us have any way of protecting our.... anything. Good job Giz, you guys are clearly looking out for your readers, I guess this is what happens when a blog gets purchased by a large media company, the message of said blog is for sale, and apparently someone who loves the military budget, but hates giving guns to civilians has deep pockets.... "
      </p>
      <p>
       "Quote from the article "Unfortunately, guns are real. And for some reason, we're not willing to admit that, even though they've been around a while, they are too advanced for humans to use safely.""
      </p>
      <p>
       "Plus we spent a BILLION DOLLARS to make this gun, does that not sound insane to anyone else.... we cant find any space in the budget to.....
      </p>
      <p>
       provide health care to anyone, provide a decent education that enforces critical thinking provide interest free loans to students provide a whole bunch of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time some polotician says "WE NEED TO CUT 200Millon" from some public health or education program, why does no one send them to projects like this to get there money. Let the army hold baking sales and fund raisers to provide it with extra capital to build new toys. "
      </p>
      <p>
       "I used to love coming here, but between the giz #Warmongering and their apparent hatred of our constitutional rights its silly for people to come here wanting to read about tech, they keep getting all of these shitty articles, im never going to buy, nor would i ever want to buy one of these killing tools that the military has gotten so good at spending money on. WHy are they advertising it to us, these same people that two days ago this blog says should not own guns, does that not seem wrong to you? "
      </p>
      <p>
       These comments were apparently too crazy, so fuck em, I reposted them just now and fully expect to have them removed yet again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also sent an email to all of there staff pointing out how ridiculous this all is. Lets see if they have the cojones to respond with anything more than "Fuck you dont read out blog"

       I just want to correct you that there is no free stuff. Its always at cost, question is who pays for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the government provided the service, it means you and others pay for it through taxes and when even taxes can't pay for it, debt is formed.

       This was one persons response and my response to them, what do you all think?
      </p>
      <p>
       person - We have had the crows for about 8 years now...it saves lives. A few of my buddies have been shot using the turret and id much rather spend money to not see that again. Im a medic and deploying again and id rather deal with a little more money issues in the great ocean of debt than see more of my friends injured or killed. They are your fellow Americans doing a job you are unfit or didn't want to do. A necessary evil
      </p>
      <p>
       Me- What job? protecting oil fields on the other side of the planet? I appreciate that you lost countless years of your life in "The Service" but don't try and make me feel like any less of an American simply because im questioning whether we need to spend a billion dollars to improve a product that we shouldn't be using, in a place we shouldnt even be in in the first place. If someone ever wants to start a real war against the USA, id consider enlisting, but what the government and military are currently doing is not for our best interests. Im sorry your friends were injured, but are you there to defend America or American corporate interests?
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont want to hurt peoples feelings, but we've got to draw a line somewhere.

       I can't believe the mass of people are ignorant to how blatant propaganda is today, "Bomber ready to rock Iran" That just makes me sick, words can not describe whats its like to watch the U.S become Nazi Germany 2.0, and feel helpless to curb enough ignorance to make a difference.

       Young Americans forget that "Iran" is made up of people, people who have lives and dreams and thoughts and hopes. Instead they just see it as a nation of terrorists that need to be executed by any means.

       Age really shouldn't be a factor, the internet is a good source that the newer generations are actually starting to use to get real history not the feel good history that you learn in k-12. I actually want to learn from history and our mistakes, I wasn't alive during Vietnam, but, I know that our reasons for going in and staying in for so long were complete and utter bullshit, its sad how many older generations have been conditioned to forget the Daniel Ellsberg documents and the gulf of tonkin charade that got us in there in the first place. Try not to look at age but, at the availability/intensity of information/history/propaganda at specific times.

       This happens in ALL media. ALL of it sold to the highest bidder. Consolidation into few hands makes it easier to control the narrative. They and their ilk are predators, carving up society into bite-sized morsels, because, you know, easier to chew... All with our consent.  Brilliant.

       There isn't nothing that shows "pro military spending" in that article. All it is stating about money is how much the company was giving for the contract to build these new gunner technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anti gun article wasn't very anti gun at all. It was talking about a study that a university did and the only thing he added to it was "Regardless of why it's the case, it's another great reason to clamp down on the availability of firearms. Or to stock up" but that doesn't mean hes saying "Take away everyone's guns now" not even close to it.

       They shape the view of many many Americans, consciously or not. The man at the helm thinks its a great idea to ban all guns, this comes out in the articles, they can not flat out say it, but they use the fact that people think they are smarter then they actually are, its like the beginning level of a video game, they want you to make the little jumps in logic because they are easy, and if you come up with the conclusion yourself its much stronger than being told something flat out.
