       I think it would benefit for newcomers to have places they can check out that provide information on Zionism influence over the media and politics. Perhaps we can make a list of politicians, media C.E.Os and other influential figures who appear to have Zionism influence over their positions. I have been doing searches myself, but haven't found nothing actually legit yet (maybe I'm using the wrong search words).
      </p>
      <p>
       I only offer this suggestion because it gets a little annoying reading some of these threads of people claiming Zionism influence, but there's no information or history to explain the certain institutions have Zionism influence over them. Thus, a Zionism influence/ 101 guide would benefit more people to understand how this group plays a role in various political and media groups.

        Zionism:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       An international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel.

       <strong>
        Smokingmansboss commentary on these terms
       </strong>
       : "From these two definitions, Zionism becomes a portrait of a modern iteration of manifest destiny. It is then apparent that the Zionists not only believe that Palestine is rightfully Israel by decree of the god, I Am, it is widely believed to be an ultimate goal; the final abode of God's elect; a Utopia; the promised land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any Atheist worth his or her (pillar of) salt should see the detriment in allowing a religious belief to preside over the foreign policy of multiple nations. On these grounds, if you can then illuminate a shadowy hierarchy of self-proclaimed Zionists in banking, media, and powerful foreign relations committees, you might be able to paint a clear picture without the cries of antisemitism. It is NOT racist to say that the decree of a god should not be a factor in foreign relations; especially when you consider it has become a principal factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important aspect is the legitimate purchase of land by the Zionists from about 1840 to 1948.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine">
        This wiki article
       </a>
       explains a lot of it in detail. However, the sources of some claims should be noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be noted that, in 1947, the Jewish holdings in Palestine amounted to ~463,000 acres, or ~723 sq. miles. Today, the state of Israel is claimed to be between 8,000 - 8,500 sq. miles. That ~7,500 sq. mile difference was taken by force and bolstered by the diaspora."

       Religion will not be eliminated. It may be unified and replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religion plays a key role in captivating the language, morality and philosophical idealism of a people. From a population control perspective, it's important for the masses to believe in the relief of suffering (savior/afterlife), the ease of guilt (repentance/forgiveness/punishment), etc... Meanwhile, it's beneficial for people to believe they are NOT the savior (lowly, supernatural origin; sinless lifestyle; otherworldly wisdom; prophecy) and that a code or law of morality is the path to a fulfilling afterlife (Mosaic law; Sharia law; etc...).
      </p>
      <p>
       Without these provisions, as some religious will illogically argue, there is no morality. There is no "reason" to be good to others. I say this only true if you're greedy, a sociopath, and/or have a very low IQ (for instance, a person who is retarded may not know an act is reprehensible out of naivety).
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall one other aspect of religion as highlighted by the writings of Sigmund Freud. He described his perspective on spirituality in the context of his Atheism. It was something along the lines of his mind being surrounded by cold darkness where the yearning for spiritual satisfaction is a pinhole of warm light beckoning him to reach out. He goes on to say that the yearning is innate in the human psyche. He also believed religion to be a "side-effect" of the expansion of the human psyche and that standardized, organized religion was a cause of detriment to the continued stability and advancement of human psyche.

      <p>
       Sorry I needed to expand a little on what I said. All current forms of religion will be challenged and destroyed and their holdings returned to the nations. This will be spearheaded by the UN most likely in response to some kind of event that is based out of religious circles. What follows will most likely be as you say, a unified belief or system that will try to take the place of religions but now with an updated set of rules/laws. Just about anything can take this place, an obsession with technology/H+ would be a good candidate for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, a faked alien encounter would be a good platform to step into the abolishing of religions.

       Thanks for providing some sources Xanaxinator, I putted them on the first post (just in case any peeps only look at that post and bounce). Just curious if who owns the MSM and Hollywood studios is a book or documentary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully if there's more peeps who are willing to provide sources we can get this thread moved over to the non-reddit resources section of this sub-reddit. Again appreciate the help xanaxinator.

       Generally I'm critical of those who shout Zionist.  All i ever get are 120 min long youtube links saying "watch this!  Your mind will change".  If I'm not sold on the cause I'm not going to waste hours on it.

       As a skeptic, if it's true this is what you should do:
      </p>
      <p>
       Give a couple quick, easy to digest, well cited examples, that can be linked back to something reputable.  Then slowly lead into the less established but implied things.  When I get linked back to a tirade on a blog where the "home" link is the "all seeing eye" i'm going to roll my eyes and go "yeah no bias here".
      </p>
      <p>
       Whet the skeptics appetite with the small understandable stuff before going off the deep end with the NWO, controls all media, bits.

       GovDisinfoAgent as a student of Philosophy, I agree with your skepticism points. Definitely, we should not have anything leading up to reptiles, aliens, or NWO (because even if they exists, there's no empirical evidence to back it up.) These sources are more trying to provide the empirical evidence needed to make a claim that there's Zionism influence occurring in a certain given group. I shall be keeping my eyes out for the example sources you recommended. Thanks for the feedback.

       Oh true, I shouldn't have implied that was the logical direction.  Hell many good conspiracy theories have crazy offshoots, or people who take things too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, a primer is the best idea.  I saw you referenced a book to read in your post but that goes back to the whole thing of "i'm not going to take that kind of time to read a book on a topic i think is a little crazy."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think part of the problem is the well has been poisoned (intentionally or unintentionally) by extreme opinions jumping on zionists as evil and children of satan, when there may be very valid critisims that are less extremist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's the whole argument of "well if you're not going to take the time to learn, you're just a puppet/sheep".  Possibly, but most people are that way, and without good marketing (nothing huge, just something like an easy primer to whet an apatite) it'll always be that way.  If you go around calling us sheep, we'll dismiss you.  At one time you felt the same way we did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed I said "you" a few time, I mean the royal you as in people who support your position, not you specifically.

       No worries Space Dragon, I'm not asking anyone specifically to provide such a source, but if they can it will be appreciated. However, I would like us to examine the (online) sources that people post in relation to the zionists' influence on certain conspiracies such as

        this one

       posted a few weeks ago on here concerning 9/11. Personally, since it's written by a PhD professor it has certain credibility, but I would like to see if others agree with me on that decision before posting it as a legit source.

       It seems that "Dr." Sabrosky is either not whom he claims or his credentials have been called into question since he started blaming 9/11 on Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sabrosky">
        His wikipedia article
       </a>
       cites several questionable sources. Even his credentials are marked "[citation needed]". From the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Sabrosky&amp;amp;action=history">
        revision history of the article
       </a>
       , I see that the original article was created by an
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Pashute">
        Orthodox Jew
       </a>
       who very clearly renounced Sabrosky's credentials. It was then edited by a few anons and a few conspiracy theorists whose accounts have been deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point in writing this isn't to refute his writing. I just don't think you'd want to refer to him as providing concrete evidence of Zionist influence without also providing documentation of his credentials, military service, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.facebook.com/alan.sabrosky.9?sk=info">
        This could be his actual facebook?
       </a>
       If someone has a secure dummy account, we might be able to contact him and alert him to his wiki article and further interests.

       Smokingmansboss thank you very much, for your check-up on the article. This is what I'm talking about folks: we double check the sources anyone shall list when possible. I in no way took your claims as a refute to Sobrosky's article, but rather a verification of his credentials and it seems after reading his wiki, I'm suspicious of his background as well. So for now, I'll leave his article on the
       <strong>
        needs confirmination of being legit
       </strong>
       section until we can verify his history and military credentials. If we don't find any, I shall remove him from the lists. I am also adding a Zionism 101 audio recordings by
       <a href="http://pragmaticwitness.com/zionism-101-essential-information-by-charles-giuliani/">
        Charles Giuliani
       </a>
       on the same list as well. I haven't had time yet to listen to his recordings, but intend to hear by tonight.

       Not sure, if we can consider David Duke as a legit source Kevin, the man has a bias towards racial realism in general, plus he denies that the Holocaust actually occurred...sounds a little too extreme to be considered a good video to use, but thanks for supplying it.

       I really like this idea. Though, I think you will find that it is difficult to separate between racism, politics, religion and nationalism. This is because the Jewish people have been complicit in the "schmearing" of their name which has caused a great deal of obscurity. Here is my suggestion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Start with fundamental principles and definitions of Zion, Zionism and the role a powerful Zionist force might play in geopolitics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zion:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         (Political) The modern Jewish nation
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (Political) Israel as the national home of the Jewish people
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (Christianity / Ecclesiastical Terms) Christianity heaven regarded as the city of God and the final abode of his elect
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (Sociology) Any form of social organization, way of life, or life after death regarded as an ultimate goal
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (Christianity / Ecclesiastical Terms) A religious community or its site, regarded as chosen by God and under his special protection
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       -Collins English Dictionary (Merriam-Webster's is similar)
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism:
      </p>
      <p>
       An international movement originally for the establishment of a Jewish national or religious community in Palestine and later for the support of modern Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Merriam-Webster's
      </p>
      <p>
       From these two definitions, Zionism becomes a portrait of a modern iteration of manifest destiny. It is then apparent that the Zionists not only believe that Palestine is rightfully Israel by decree of the god, I Am, it is widely believed to be an ultimate goal; the final abode of God's elect; a Utopia; the promised land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any Atheist worth his or her (pillar of) salt should see the detriment in allowing a religious belief to preside over the foreign policy of multiple nations. On these grounds, if you can then illuminate a shadowy hierarchy of self-proclaimed Zionists in banking, media, and powerful foreign relations committees, you might be able to paint a clear picture without the cries of antisemitism. It is NOT racist to say that the decree of a god should not be a factor in foreign relations; especially when you consider it has become a principal factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important aspect is the legitimate purchase of land by the Zionists from about 1840 to 1948.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_land_purchase_in_Palestine">
        This wiki article
       </a>
       explains a lot of it in detail. However, the sources of some claims should be noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should also be noted that, in 1947, the Jewish holdings in Palestine amounted to ~463,000 acres, or ~723 sq. miles. Today, the state of Israel is claimed to be between 8,000 - 8,500 sq. miles. That ~7,500 sq. mile difference was taken by force and bolstered by the diaspora.

       Thanks for the tip smokingmansboss, I think for now, if it's okay with you, I'll use what you just posted up and put it on the beginning post. At least until I can find more sources that explain further about Zionism and it's motives.

       Thanks Sailer for listing all of these I shall add the links up in a new section called Legit Articles. Majority of these articles show a good amount of empirical evidence of how Jewish influence occurs in the media and politics. Again, I appreciate the help!
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone else has questions about Sailer's articles on being legit speak up and I shall put them on the
       <strong>
        needs confirmination
       </strong>
       list instead.
