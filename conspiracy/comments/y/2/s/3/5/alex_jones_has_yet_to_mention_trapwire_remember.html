       He has very few virtues. Why do you think he hasn't even mentioned trapwire? They posted a link to the RT article on infowars, and then immediately removed it from their frontpage.

       I get all that. Why has he not even mentioned it though? He's done six hours of radio as well as his "nightly news" thing w/o even saying the word. Do you think Stratfor being HQ'd in Austin might have something to do with it? I'm sure Alex enjoys being a country millionaire. I'm also sure Fred Burton (Stratfor's CEO) and Alex aren't strangers, there aren't a lot of private golf clubs priced to keep the commoners out in Austin.

       Because he is a tool of the elite. Notice Bill Cooper said the things he did and was murdered for it. Alex Jones says just as much shit and is still alive. He is a fear-monger who spreads hyped up information Bout non pressing issues.

       You may get downvoted to oblivion for stating the obvious.  Bill Cooper had more patriotism in his little pinky than Alex Jones will ever know.  Amazing that even the sheople who have "woken up" are still sheople.

       well to be honest it hasn't gotten viral since last night and he may have not seen it yet, he only had a radio show in the early afternoon on Friday. I have a feeling he will cover it on the Sunday show.

       I guess, but Anon and co. were tweeting about following the Trap Wire story on Thursday, which would have given more sufficient time to be ready for the story. At least in my opinion, I know there's only 24 hours in a day, I just figured whatever he would have had scheduled would pale in comparison to that leak.

       Of course. I don't blindly hate AJ like most do. I think he's changed
       <em>
        a lot

       over the years, so I just disagree with a lot of the sensationalism and just ego he brings to the table.

       yeah he has that sensationalist streak for sure.  But I think that it is calculated.  His job more or less is to shake people out of their trance.  Which I believe requires him to over-do it.  The people that are already awake are sick of the screaming and sensationalism, i like Alan Watt a lot better he is easy to listen to.  But Jones is to get people in the door to being awake and some people are just so engrained into their way of thinking they need someone who is freaking out to make them look into things just to see what the hoopla is about.  Honestly that is what got me into it. I heard him and I was like whoa what is this guy on about?  Then i started my journey down the rabbit hole

       I get that idea, maybe I just wish he'd just tone it down a notch or two, instead of just being

       boisterous, if that makes sense.

       oh yeah, i understand.  My gripe is the Youngjevity products that he keeps pushing, that shit is like $60 per container at the cheapest!  I understand he is trying to make money because he is hiring people or whatever but damn, those are the worst days when he has some Doctor on talking about how great it is... has anyone even gotten results from it?

       I have had great results with BTT and it's only $45 a container after shipping when buying 3 or more at a time. That's a very comparable price to any multi vitamin/mineral complex of its same quality and ingredients. YMMV

       Correct. So what? Not everyone takes a multi. How is this any different than a sports talk show shilling a fat loss supplement that costs more than BTT?  AJ has an operation that requires ad revenue just like any other syndicated show. big whoop.

       Alex Jones is nothing but a Zionist shill. He is the Fox News of the "conspiracy" movement without the credibility (and we all know what precious little of THAT there is at Fox!) He is bought and paid for by the Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider: Alex Jones’ flagship radio station, KLBJ AM, in Austin, Texas, is owned by Emmis Communications, a media conglomerate based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The founder, chairman, president, and CEO of Emmis Communications is the dual Israeli citizen Zionist Jew Jeffrey H. Smulyan. Jones' "handler" is his Jewish wife Kelly Rebecca Nichols. In fact, Alex Jones and his Jewish wife and children all qualify for Israeli citizenship under Israel’s “Law of Return”!
      </p>
      <p>
       I trust this guy about as much as I trust Bibi Netanyahu. NOTHING that he reports cannot be gleaned from other, more credible sources. Trust me, I know. I was his biggest supporter and listener until I wondered to myself "WHY does he give the Jews/Israelis a free pass in everything from their complicity in 9/11 to the USS Liberty murders?" Then I researched it all...now it makes perfect sense.

       He was saying they were recording all calls before it was publicly admitted, he was pointing out they were spying on everyone everywhere in real time constantly almost a decade ago.  He was blowing the whistle that all your new appliances would spy on you years before it was publicly admitted.  This "revelation" by zionist shill wikileaks is fucking SELF EVIDENT to anyone who's been paying as much attention as the Infowars crew has.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of us are so deep in this information that a "revelation" like this is blasé.  Just because "Anonymous" are a bunch of "newfags" when it comes to the Orwellian surveillance state and were blown away by this information, doesn't mean the rest of us were.

       He says he has big balls. He says it a lot, almost every day, in many different ways. He's always bragging about how tough he is, and how fearless he is, but he's really gutless. He won't step out of line on the smallest detail because he's afraid the law would come down on him. When the police stop him for a traffic stop, he practically shits his pants. You can tell this by listening between the lines when he brags about how tough he was.

       Nobody knows.  The video says he is a scientist at some secret NASA program, but I wasn't able to find anything about him online other than a Google profile that doesn't say much

       Trapwire is just a commercial security / surveillance product. The fact that some of the employees in the company used to work for the CIA is nothing, it was just a selling point for the company, just like the fitness programs designed by "former Navy SEAL xyz".
      </p>
      <p>
       Without going in to it too much (and I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons), the product isn't even that good. It's main selling point is as a "cover your ass" for a checkbox on the insurance forms.

       Now, if you want to get into something interesting, look at the companies Abraxas has bought in the past couple of years.  Hint, Infonex Internet.

       Actually, it looks like the company doesn't exist anymore.  Looks like it was bought up already.

       AJ is a giant joke. I realized that as soon as his voice goes into "!DRAMA!" mode. i.e. When he's actually addressing some NWO figure as if they were sitting right next to him in his guttural voice telling them how "we will drag (them) to hell" and such. So, in short: fuck Alex Jones, and his websites. And any admin on his websites. And his sheepish supporters.

       He says he has big balls. He says it a lot, almost every day, in many different ways. He's always bragging about how tough he is, and how fearless he is, but he's really gutless. He won't step out of line on the smallest detail because he's afraid the law would come down on him. When the police stop him for a traffic stop, he practically shits his pants. You can tell this by listening between the lines when he brags about how tough he was.
