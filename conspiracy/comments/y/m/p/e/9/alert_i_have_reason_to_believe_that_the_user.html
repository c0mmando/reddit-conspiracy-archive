        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I suspect it has happened in the last 2 or 3 days, possibly within the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Check the drastic change in his comment and submission history in the last couple days.</p>

<p>The last &quot;clearly him&quot; input was his comment &quot;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yk28q/why_shouldnt_we_work_for_the_government_or_join/c5wae6j">Because they don&#39;t give a f*ck about you.</a>&quot; &lt;-- We know he never swears, and would - when quoting Carlin - self-censor. We got that much. And, it is in the true spirit of our known and respected community member, ImJA.</p>

<p>We also know that he would <strong>never</strong> ignore a direct request to verify his identity (even if it were a pithy remark). But, that&#39;s <strong>exactly</strong> what happened in his latest comment here...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ym9ab/bigfoot/c5wuimt">http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ym9ab/bigfoot/c5wuimt</a></p>

<p>He posted a link to a video about bigfoot (of all things) with another bigfoot link in a comment below it.</p>

<p>He was directly asked if his account had been compromised, by someone whom he knows and who is known by this community.</p>

<p>Instead of responding, he edited his comment and added yet another video.</p>

<p>^ this is <strong>not</strong> the behavior of the person I have known for the last year. The person operating this account is a fraud.</p>

<p>Additionally, it was only a few days ago that he claimed that he would abandon the account if Julian Assange made it to Ecuador, and queried if he could sell it <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/yar63/okay_guys_we_have_become_infested_in_the_last_few/c5tvfr7">here</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Julian Assange has made it to Ecuador, but I do know that this ain&#39;t normal behavior for <a href="/u/ImJulianAssange">/u/ImJulianAssange</a>.</p>

<p>So, ImJulianAssange. I&#39;m calling you out. Whoever you are, you need to make a public statement - speak - let us read your words.</p>

<p>There&#39;s ONE WORD you could say that would change my mind, and only the real ImJulianAssange would know what it is.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I stand by this assertion: <a href="/u/ImJulianAssange">/u/ImJulianAssange</a> has been compromised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God knows if imjulianassange is still under control of whoever it was that <em>was</em> controlling the account .  But in the past i.e weeks or months ago , I&#39;ve seen imjulianassange comment that he is not Julian Assange.  His explanation for the choice of username was as a show of support for julian assange similar to the &#39;i&#39;m Spartacus&#39; scene in I spartucus.  Also I believe he mentioned it was also a kind of affirmation that they may be able to silence or &#39;get to&#39; assange but another would arise in his place.</p>

<p>Assange <strong>did</strong> get asylum from the Ecuador embassy in the past couple days, so that may be what he meant by &quot;makes it to Ecuador&quot; (i.e., granted asylum).</p>

<p>Correct. I think we&#39;re all aware of that (at least the long-time members of this subreddit are).</p>

<p>My point of clarification was that he did make that mention about abandoning the account based on the fate of the real Julian Assange. And, I think he <em>meant</em> &quot;granted asylum&quot;, not necessarily &quot;transported from the UK to Ecuador&quot;. So, the fact that Julian is still in the UK, inside the Ecuador embassy is irrelevant - Julian was granted asylum in this last few days (since ImJA made that comment about selling).</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re on the same page here. Just having difficultly expressing it clearly (I&#39;m still not sure if I&#39;ve said it right, but I think my point is there).</p>

<p>And: you moved the goalpost.  First statement: &quot;racist&quot;.  Second statement &quot;racially focused&quot;.</p>

<p>No, ElPatoFisura.  I have no interest in <em>interjecting</em> in r/NoLibsWatch.

<p>No, I&#39;m not afraid of what words you use for anything.  As for &quot;unquestionably&quot;, please point out three instances of something posted there that argues that Jews are genetically/racially/ethnically superior to any other group.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t speak for my &quot;fellow &#39;Nazi-hunters&#39; &quot;.  As for myself (and this may involve some thought that is of more depth than I have seen from you), there are people that post things in White Pride that are racist.  And there are people that post things there that aren&#39;t racist.  I haven&#39;t checked on the contents of White Pride for some time now, and things may have changed, so are you suggesting that everyone that posts in White Pride is racist?</p>

<p>So you think racist is anything about an ethnic group (which is not the same thing as a race)?  Very inventive redefinition.  Redefining words to suit your fancy is like changing the rules of a game in the middle of it.  Racism is the belief that someone or some group is inherently inferior to another not for any behavior or belief, but due to genetics/ethnic origin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your citation to the hueypriest quote is your submission to r/NoLibsWatch? How about the link to the actual reply, Patito? (May I call you &quot;Patito&quot;?) You certainly haven&#39;t been shy about posting private message links before. I am not saying you are misrepresenting things, but proving the truth of your assertion by citing a statement you made is like someone proving that someone else is a shill by offering up a &quot;shill list&quot; that they made as evidence.</p>

<p>That pancake &quot;effigy&quot; has nothing to do with Rachel Corrie, as has been explained <em>numerous</em> times over the past few months. That was created the day that a White Nationalist was banned from Digg. It is an albino (you can&#39;t get whiter than that) sticking out her tongue at the people that were lamenting that user having been banned.  (BANA is a disbanded white nationalist organization that several Digg users were associated with.)</p>

<p>At this point in the pancake discussion, you usually post that BJ Novak nodding GIF that&#39;s part of your repertoire. You know you want to do it. And you know we&#39;re expecting it from you. So do it. Relieve the anticipatory tension and give us the GIF, Patito!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Stuxnet is made to interfere with the entire Philips SCADA system. SCADA is used for MANY things; the most common things being fluid control. Stuxnet does its damage through misvalving, mispumping (running pumping systems at slower or faster speeds than spec), fluid misrouting, deactivation or super-activation of heating/cooling systems, over or under-injection of reactants or gases, overpressurization, and, of course, fudging motor control. Stuxnet is super evil in exactly the <em>way</em> it does this...it can run autonomously or be run thru Mossad &quot;backdoors&quot; and worse yet...it can spoof all SCADA monitoring systems so that operators have no idea anything is amiss. </p>

<p>Until something blows up.</p>

<p>Yes, Stuxnet affects centrifuges, mainly by spinning them out of spec and balance with the wrong amount of fluids in them. But the Israelis made it do OH so much more. I know SCADA pretty well and Stuxnet affects EVERY ASPECT of its control most likely.</p>

<p>More proof that whenever Zionists are involved, things go &quot;boom&quot; before too long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,</p>

<p>Stuxnet is made to compromise a system with the Phillips SCADA software on it. Once it does that it runs a series of operations.</p>

<p>What you are saying is dumb on it&#39;s face - that a system manipulating a SCADA controller can manipulate anything the SCADA controller can. Yeah, that&#39;s obvious. It kinda comes with the territory of manipulating the SCADA system.  However, stuxnet only <em>contains</em> the code to perform a certain type of action with the SCADA system. </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t contain code to do whatever the mossad wants whenever the mossad wants it.</p>

<p><strong>So short of showing me the code where stuxnet can execute remote payloads (difficult considering the air gap SCADA systems exist within), you don&#39;t know what you are talking about.</strong> You might know about SCADA, but you clearly don&#39;t know about stuxnet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, or a completely different virus could have been written too. </p>

<p>Of course, what also could have happened was an earthquake. </p>

<p>Given that these viruses always become publicly available due to the nature of how they spread - the lack of such a virus is indicative of the fact that it doesn&#39;t exist. Furthermore, even if modules can be added, you haven&#39;t suggested what could be manipulated in order to create the fukushima situation. </p>

<p>The answer to that is of course the earth, because it was an earthquake that caused fukushima. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he suggested that stuxnet <em>caused</em> fukishima (and we only have your word on that ) I tend to agree with you.  But surely any such suspicion must relate to the severity of the crisis somehow being related to the stuxnet.</p>

<p>i.e earthquake happened , and the stuxnet did something else to make the situation worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that that would be completely baseless speculation.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t enrich uranium at fukushima. That&#39;s what stuxnet fucked with. Uranium enriching centrifuges. </p>

<p>So without answering the question - what could have stuxnet done to to make it worse - it&#39;s a pointless conversation. It&#39;s really ridiculous. Stuxnet isn&#39;t the only virus in the world that messed with PLCs, siemens or otherwise. Any serious hacker could write one from scratch - what made stuxnet interesting was that it was a very well written virus combined with a very well written payload. The payload being a tested series of operations that when executed by the PLC would leave the centrifuge physically inoperable. </p>

<p>So what are you suggesting: that the earthquake happened and an instance of the actual stuxnet virus exacerbated the problem? That&#39;s impossible because stuxnet doesn&#39;t contain the code to do that. </p>

<p>Are you suggesting that: The earthquake happened and a custom written virus targetting fukushima operations exacerbated the problem? </p>

<p>I&#39;m ruling that one out due to Occam&#39;s razor. No such virus has been seen. No action that the virus could take to cause the problem described is known. And at this point - it wouldn&#39;t be stuxnet anyway. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand the line of questioning. And it isn&#39;t a terrible idea that a virus that fucks with nuclear stuff could have fucked with nuclear stuff at the nuclear situation in Fukushima. But with a little knowledge you can realize that this scenario is implausible.</p>

<p>This is always an option when software is being used. Which is why the suggestion is kinda ridiculous, in the end. You might as well ask that question anytime anything involving a computer happens.</p>

<p>Cyberwarfare is a real thing, but what happened at fukushima doesn&#39;t fit the bill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m uncertain. However, I should also add this (feel free to peruse our respective comment histories - his being less full of recent comments than mine, so his will be easier to find)</p>

<p>When he commented about selling his account, I commented that I hoped he&#39;d keep me apprised or let me know or whatever.</p>

<p>He PM&#39;d me (almost immediately) his real name and email address. I sent him an email a couple days ago, but never got a response (double-checked before posting this comment). </p>

<p>Anyway... getting to the point... his name is somewhat ethnic. And the ethnicity of the guy who shouted at me matched that ethnicity.</p>

<p>So, the more I think about it, the more I&#39;m beginning to think I did hear from him and that, perhaps antinuclearenergy is, indeed, in contact with him and relayed that I was seeking a specific single word.</p>

<p>The real question is - If this is the case, how did he know when and where he would pass me on my way home? And why would he travel 2000 miles for this. Something serious is happening in the world. I&#39;m just scratching my head in bewilderment at all that has transpired in the last five days.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should have read my link. The story goes like this...</p>

<p>1) Every time the troll invasions became insufferable (in conjunction with the now convicted and [virtually] executed stalkertroll crackiswhackexcept), I&#39;d delete my account and leave the internet for a month or two before coming back with a new username.</p>

<p>2) Every time I made a new username, I did one of two things: a) notified everyone via a post, or b) notified... IamJulianAssange (ImJulianAssange&#39;s previous username) via comment, as a courtesy, simply because he had been kind to me once.</p>

<p>Then about a year ago (not quite, but getting close), illuminatedwax came under pressure to add mods and make this a more moderated subreddit (it had been 4 <strong>inactive</strong> accounts moderating for a long time, and the trollery had become rampant). This resulted in the Ambiversive scandal (painting the place pale blue - lots of pastels with esoteric symbols and shit). The community blew a gasket, illuminatedwax took a different approach: self-nomination and voting, with him having the final say.</p>

<p>So, This community voted to elect mods. I got elected. illuminatedwax had the final decision. illuminatedwax selected me (Username_Tokin). (including the current crew plus 2 others - one who decided to appear in this discussion thread, btw).</p>

<p>Trolls (like yourself and others) invaded and a couple of them decided to make my stay miserable. So, I obliged them and resigned (deleted another fucking kickass username, fuck) and had recently created this (HT) account as a backup in case things turned sour as a mod - which they did, as I said.</p>

<p>The mods, however, unanimously wanted me back due to some internal bickering (the 2 mods now no longer with us). I created ContheorySpiracist specifically for that. Once all of those were finally resolved, I started taking heat for my transparency practices (notifying shadowbanned users of their shadowbanned status). (Oh, yeah. I&#39;m also the creator of the r/uncensorship subreddit - a cooperative project with sunshine-x) It became apparent that I was being targeted by trolls again, so I resigned again. The moderator job doesn&#39;t pay well enough. Sorry.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Autocoprophage was unfortunate enough to step up and challenge my credibility in this community, not knowing I was a former mod... and ended up proving pretty much everything I&#39;ve said in this comment, going all the way back to the crackiswhack stalking crap.</p>

<p>All of the long-time members here have seen my AMAs (several on several topics) which give detail about my history in Law Enforcement Technology and my unfortunate five-year (<strong>pro se</strong>) legal battle with a corrupt DA.</p>

<p>Now, again. I ask you the only remaining important question: Who are <em>you</em>, <a href="/u/greenw40">/u/greenw40</a>? You&#39;re obviously an antagonist. Your behavior reeks of the stench of r/conspiratard, but... it&#39;s like it&#39;s amplified 40 fold.</p>

<p>It helped every time. crackiswhackexcept isn&#39;t very smart. just annoying. I ditched him for about 3 months worth of peace and quiet every time.</p>

<p>The last time I ditched him, I did it permanently. But he had become addicted to trolling (like so many others in r/conspiratard) and, more relevant, to <strong>stalking</strong> (<em>which it appears you&#39;re kind of leaning toward these days - targeting the most outspoken community leaders here</em>).</p>

<p>So, when I ditched him the last time, he started stalking someone else. That&#39;s when this entire community caught him... with me getting to be a moderator and watch his demise unfold before my very eyes. It was pure heaven, I might add. Seeing this community bury my personal stalker and torch his corpse in a blaze of virtual revelry. We were all happy to see him go.</p>

<p>No, I made up my mind after hearing the same shit being posted over and over again and getting upvotes.  The same bad science used to try and convince people that the WTC was taken down by bombs, that HAARP was causing earthquakes, and that we are all being poisoned by airplane exhaust.  The same insane theories about pop stars being under the control of the devil and occult magic.  If you can get past all that shit and the overt racism against Jews, there are actually some inciteful articles about government corruption, invasion of privacy, etc.</p>

<p>The Bible as a source? Yeah... no. Sorry, not a Christian, and the Bible has been proven time and time again to be historically inaccurate. Nevermind the fact that I could give two shits what &quot;God&quot; has to say about anything. /athiest</p>
