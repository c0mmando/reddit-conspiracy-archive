<p>On top of this, do we have any more info on the Libor Scandal? So far I keep seeing the occasional article about arrests in the financial world, but to me it seems like fall guys, set up by ceos and other big wigs to divert attention... Thoughts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, let me see if I get this right... </p>

<p>The theory is: </p>

<p>Based on past events:</p>

<ul>
<li>NM Rothschild&#39;s quote, immediately prior to the war of 1812, in response to Congress not renewing the bank&#39;s charter</li>
</ul>

<p>and present events:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Auditing the fed</p></li>
<li><p>Arming an array of government agencies</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That history is repeating itself?</p>

<p>Bracing for civil war?</p>

<p>Too many young hotheads think it&#39;s about armed conflict. This ain&#39;t Call of Duty. We want peace and individual liberty. Isn&#39;t that the highest goal?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let someone else sort through this, but it appears - at first glance- that the scenario goes like this...</p>

<p>The Fed Audit was in motion as early as 2009, but took a while to build momentum. Nonetheless, it passed the house in July of this year. It appears to be stalled in the Senate now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, it appears that the LIBOR scandal broke (appeared in the news) shortly before the ammunition purchases began (which, in turn, began shortly before the house vote).</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a cursory glance. I didn&#39;t actually lay out any dates for comparison.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t even mention Robert Holmes. (Sorry, couldn&#39;t resist.)</p>

<p>EDITS: Some clarifications in my summary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, some source that can explain how we supposedly know this. Real quotes come from somewhere--a speech, a letter, a diary, a newspaper article. So far, I can&#39;t find this quote before 1990, and nowhere is there any hint of where it originally came from. That&#39;s 179 years after it was supposedly said/written. It seems likely that it&#39;s fake.</p>

<p>The web sites that have this quote imply that the British started the War of 1812. <a href="http://rense.com/general86/enemy.htm">For example</a>: “1812: Backed by Rothschild money and Nathan Mayer Rothschilds orders, the British declare war on the United States. The Rothschild&#39;s plan was to cause the United States to build up such a debt in fighting this war, that they would have to surrender to the Rothschilds and allow the charter for the Rothschild owned First Bank of the United States to be renewed.”</p>

<p>But, the British didn&#39;t start the war.</p>
