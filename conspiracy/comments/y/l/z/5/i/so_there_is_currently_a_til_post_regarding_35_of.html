<p>Normally, 100 times a year, fighters are scrambled when odd circumstances arise regarding planes in the air.  On 09/11/01, FOUR large passenger jetliners turned off their transponders, and <em>not one fighter scrambled</em> until far too late.  And then, they flew at less than maximum speed on a roundabout course.</p>

The idea they didnt stop or know about 9/11 should scream treason. How are you americans not grabing your guns and shoooting your polititions for treason?

    <div class="md"><p>We dont grab our guns because we can help no one as dead men. At least that is my reason, there are many people who have appeared to be threats to the US government lately being put away indefinitely at the least. Martyr&#39;s in America never make it to the news, they only pop up on <a href="/r/consiparcy">/r/consiparcy</a> and websites of the same type. As long as anyone who puts credit into these types of conspiracies is considered a paranoid tinfoil hat wielding anarchist we are not considered dangerous to the nation. Would you die to be remember as a radical lunatic or live and try to find a way to fix it? The US is already in the hands of people who deal strictly in lead, an overthrow by people who push thier agendas the same way doesnt seem like much of a change to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Constitution has no provision for a standing army. In the event that the US were invaded a militia would need to be called forth. This is set down in the Militia Act of 1792 but it&#39;s roots come years earlier in Common Law and more specifically the British Militia Act of 1757. This called for all able bodied males to be able to form a militia. Also bear in mind that during that time &quot;The people&quot; Specifically meant men. </p>

<p>So there you have it. The second amendment means that the right of free men to keep and bare arms is needed because they would likely have to form a militia and take up arms against an invading nations forces because there would be no standing army to do so.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite simple and with all due respect to Penn Gillette, the (now) commonly held view that it is to defend ourselves from government tyranny, is a latter day interpretation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people don&#39;t care- even if they are aware. They have bills to pay, shit to buy and people to impress. The system is brilliantly set up that the PTB can get away with 9/11 in front of the world thanks to the help of their controlled media. Too long has passed for anything to ever be done about it. The cover-up involves too many sold out participants and nobody wants to speak the truth when their livelihood depends on them keeping their mouth shut. It is disillusioning and unfortunate but humans, in general, suck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From a strictly skeptical, rational point of view:</p>

<p>Read The Looming Tower, by Lawrence Wright. Its a remarkably researched, unimpeachable piece of hard-nosed journalism. It deals in inarguable facts. It is very difficult to read it and not get the very real impression that the CIA was up to some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We dont grab our guns because we can help no one as dead men. At least that is my reason, there are many people who have appeared to be threats to the US government lately being put away indefinitely at the least. Martyr&#39;s in America never make it to the news, they only pop up on <a href="/r/consiparcy">/r/consiparcy</a> and websites of the same type. As long as anyone who puts credit into these types of conspiracies is considered a paranoid tinfoil hat wielding anarchist we are not considered dangerous to the nation. Would you die to be remember as a radical lunatic or live and try to find a way to fix it? The US is already in the hands of people who deal strictly in lead, an overthrow by people who push thier agendas the same way doesnt seem like much of a change to me.</p>
