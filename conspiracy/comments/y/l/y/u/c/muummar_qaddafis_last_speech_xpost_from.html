      <p>
       In the name of Allah, the ...beneficent, the merciful...
      </p>
      <p>
       For 40 years, or was it longer, I can't remember, I did all I could to give people houses, hospitals, schools, and when they were hungry, I gave them food. I even made Benghazi into farmland from the desert, I stood up to attacks from that cowboy Ronald Reagan, when he killed my adopted orphaned daughter, he was trying to kill me, instead he killed that poor innocent child. Then I helped my brothers and sisters from Africa with money for the African Union.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did all I could to help people Understand the concept of real democracy, where people's committees ran our country. But that was never enough, as some told me, even people who had 10 room homes, new suits and furniture, were never satisfied, as selfish as they were they wanted more. They told Americans and other visitors, that they needed "democracy" and "freedom" never realizing it was a cut throat system, where the biggest dog eats the rest, but they were enchanted with those words, never realizing that in America, there was no free medicine, no free hospitals, no free housing, no free education and no free food, except when people had to beg or go to long lines to get soup.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, no matter what I did, it was never enough for some, but for others, they knew I was the son of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the only true Arab and Muslim leader we've had since Salah-al-Deen, when he claimed the Suez Canal for his people, as I claimed Libya, for my people, it was his footsteps I tried to follow, to keep my people free from colonial domination - from thieves who would steal from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I am under attack by the biggest force in military history, my little African son, Obama wants to kill me, to take away the freedom of our country, to take away our free housing, our free medicine, our free education, our free food, and replace it with American style thievery, called "capitalism" ,but all of us in the Third World know what that means, it means corporations run the countries, run the world, and the people suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, there is no alternative for me, I must make my stand, and if Allah wishes, I shall die by following His path, the path that has made our country rich with farmland, with food and health, and even allowed us to help our African and Arab brothers and sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not wish to die, but if it comes to that, to save this land, my people, all the thousands who are all my children, then so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let this testament be my voice to the world, that I stood up to crusader attacks of NATO, stood up to cruelty, stoop up to betrayal, stood up to the West and its colonialist ambitions, and that I stood with my African brothers, my true Arab and Muslim brothers, as a beacon of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       When others were building castles, I lived in a modest house, and in a tent. I never forgot my youth in Sirte, I did not spend our national treasury foolishly, and like Salah-al-Deen, our great Muslim leader, who rescued Jerusalem for Islam, I took little for myself...
      </p>
      <p>
       In the West, some have called me "mad", "crazy", but they know the truth yet continue to lie, they know that our land is independent and free, not in the colonial grip, that my vision, my path, is, and has been clear and for my people and that I will fight to my last breath to keep us free, may Allah almighty help us to remain faithful and free.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Mu'ummar Qaddafi.

       Libya is the top-ranked country in Africa in terms of the human development index and in terms of health care ranked by the World Health Organization. He's likely right that the transformation of Libya into a client state of the US will cause Libya to fall in these indexes.

       Gadaffi was a remarkable guy. He liked to play the Islam card for political reasons but he, like Sadam Hussein, was basically secular in his approach to government. Gadaffi seemed a combination of earnest socialist, having modernized the country and wrested it from a monarchy, and machiavellian back room dealer. Gadaffi seemed to do well in the terror economy when it was still profitable. At one point he sponsored Abu Nidal, an extraordinarily brutal, mercenary, and financially successful international terrorist (Nidal is about as loathesome a human being as you can get, although, like Gadaffi, his survival instincts were extraordinary).

       When debating the injustice of the intervention in Libya, I always bring up the UN's own documents where many countries voiced their own opinions on the situation in the country. I encourage you to dive into this document, it highlights the hypocrisies of UN intervention.

       It would be easy to test your claim.  Just take your pebble to the nearest cancer treatment center.  If it works then will determine why.  If you have no such pebble then you clearly are indulging yourself in a wholly useless and irrelevant fantasy, avoiding the topic at hand and my comment.

       Qaddafi's claims have been shown to be truthful over and over again.  Nobody has ever proved that they were false.  He spoke as he lived - truthfully - and you have done nothing to demonstrate otherwise.

       First step: define capitalism and then wonder where the hell it is. You do not have capitalist system, far from it. It is a form of fascism, or corporatism with socialized losses.  Last breath of capitalism in US, was taken in 1913 before FED act.

       LOL. I wish. The West and the USA don't have capitalism, most have private central banks combined with Keynesian economics that are opposite to capitalism and free market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism is based on real money like gold or silver, savings and supply and demand, not on fake money, private central banks, controlled money supply and artificially set interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a real capitalist system the money wouldn't be able to get only in one hand, as then the whole supply would become rares, it would be deflation, meaning money has more value and people can buy more with less, that is the beauty of real money, it gains value, but even just a lot of money going to few corporations would inform the people that there is a problem and they may choose to start buying from the competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus you have savings, so even if say there was some form of crisis, it can only last for so long, because when too much capital is accumulated in terms of savings, banks would be forced to lower interest rates, as loaning out money would be way more profitable for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we don't even have "C" from capitalism. We have a crony-monopoly-private-fake money-economy.

       But you are right, in real capitalism it would be much harder to create and hold a monopoly, but even if that was the case it would be because they offered the best products/services, not because government helped them by either giving them unfair tax advantages or unfair contract advantage or destroying competition through messy tax systems, too much regulations or various bureaucratic obstacles.

       You are absolutely right my friend, they would actually be a lot smaller. Imagine if the US army didn't invade all those middle eastern and African countries to give the oil to Exxon and other big oil corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of having 6 dominant oil companies, we would have had probably 60. Instead of having 6 banks that choke the oil sales with speculation, we would have had 60 that weren't able to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I'd say Exxon would either have been a lot smaller or the same, but at least it would have been because of customers buying Exxon oil and not because of government.

       And your point is? Maybe you should look at history, and culture, and economics. Maybe you should look at how those systems structure themselves for growth. Maybe you'd realize the systems assemble themselves in such a fashion because power, when faced with losing power, will choose to keep it. Or put another way, only a moron would live under the guideline you suggest when faced with power.

      <p>
       We can't change history and we are here now, so unless you have a suggestion on how to move on from

       In my opinion, a system that prevents regulations on corporations prevents any checks on corporate growth. Oh how naive you are to trust them to behave. At least under government, people have the chance to vote real politicians in. In your alternative, there is no hope.

       Do you think corporations eat people? I mean China is the most regulated economy in the world, its all centralized, how many times have Chinese products have killed people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Many smaller 3rd world countries have no regulations at all for businesses, I don't see their people getting destroyed by corporations. I don't see monopolies forming and the dozen monopolies there are, are all because of government selling tax payers build telecommunications and electricity systems and selling it off for pennies on the dollar to just one company.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I was a business owner a while back, I didn't want to kill people with my products, I didn't want to have the worst quality products, I wanted best quality, because best quality means other business owners buy from me and sell my products to thousands of customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wanted my products cheaper so that I can make more profit for my self, in turn helping myself and the consumer with lower prices and there was so much competition that you couldn't raise the price.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, businesses/corporations don't eat people and governments don't protect you from corporations, they protect corporations from you asshole!

       Your naiveté is amusing, but you are completely ignorant of actions of corporations in modern times. It's nice that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       don't want to cut costs at any expense, but many corporations do. It's when a corporation becomes so large that it can cut corners yet hide the evidence at the same time that you should be concerned about. It's also such an example that you completely avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it's ridiculous to compare the actions
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       have taken as a business owner to the actions that a powerful business
       <em>
        cartel

       would take. It defies logic, really.

       Question is how did they become a "powerful business cartel". I'd bet they had government help, either huge tax breaks while everyone else payed 30-50% on average, regulations that restricts competition or they just had big fat government contracts to live off, until they became a monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again how is Intel for example cutting corners? I mean its not really a monopoly, but it has over 78% market share in desktop sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is Toyota cutting corners, they are not a monopoly, guess they haven't had any government help, but they have 43% global market share, why aren't they cutting corners?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just name the scary monopoly and I'll inform you. I'd bet my apartment that you can't find many that have not had some form of government help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thing is they rarely happen in a free market, pure capitalist economy, they only happen in a crony-capitalist economy, because government gives them special interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       You admitted yourself in your post as well: "

       My point exactly, governments
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       protect you from corporations, they protect corporations from you. Its not about we need better people or better programs or better laws, it never works that way, it always, always serves the corporations.

       The best way to defend against big corporations is to get government out of that business, to not be able to choose winners and losers.

       Once again, I'm not sure how naive you are. Perhaps I should invite intel to dump their chemical waste on your property, or maybe right next to it. I'm not sure what you think government assistance has to do with disposing of that waste. If it was up to the libertarian system they'd be dumping it on poor Africans. Hahaha, poor Africans.

       Yes, when citizens let their government become co-opted by corporations in front of their very eyes - that is the result. Last I checked, we voted for our representatives and could kick them out if we so decided. In a libertarian system, you sever business regulation from the representative feedback loop. Now you might be foolish enough to believe that the market functionality can have the same limiting effect, I don't. The market definitely provides for focus, even some robustness, maybe even a little stability, but it does not top limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's an aside. Because you disingenuously interpreted my sarcasm towards the Chinese system as some sort of exclamation of that being a working representative government that limits corporations. Please, you are going to have to try harder than that. That wasn't even a functional rhetorical maneuver. It was really just you backflipping around to try and make a 'point'.

       Find me just 1 example where the government didn't create a monopoly and actually protected consumers from a corporation just 1 time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, the government mustn't have created any monopoly or even duopoly and where it protected people just once in all of history from some corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you don't understand that its the free market that protect you, but sometimes accidents do happen and that is different than someone intentionally trying to hurt you as you so often put it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, do not name me accidents, like some McDonalds food poisoning where after being sued they are forced to pay millions to the families, so again you only need a court system to punish them for carelessness or stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if government wanted to protect you it couldn't. They can literally have inspections every day and still miss someone putting poison in his products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time they actually do protect such people like MFGlobal, Wells Fargo for laundering 370 billions drug money, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the time they do stage false flags, once in a while a bigger one like 9/11, most of the time if not all of the time CIA runs the drugs, most of the time they entrap, frame or outside judicial review imprison people, most of the time they torture people, etc... and THAT is government at its core.

       Well, the fault of this probably lies within your own cynical views of the government. Which is something the corporatists would want, given their ultimate goal would be a complete dissolution of any representative form of government. Yeah, I know it's tough, but its up to you to make your government (better). In my city and state, my government is genuinely interested in protecting me. Yes, I disagree with some of their methods - which is why I intend to vote for politicians that agree on those points.

       You just don't understand the basics, that is why you have this delusion about government. Because what we have now is not free market, its not capitalism, its a private monstrosity that governments have singed you on to. Do you understand?
