       TO be deported a month later? I remember reading about it in the mainstream news a day or two after 9/11/01. I really would like to know that the deal was with that. I think Israel knew about the attacks and didn't warn us, hell people in our government knew enough about em. I knew someone who had a friend who worked at Logan airport that told me a few months prior to the event that sometthign big was going down with terrorism. Boy was he right! So there was definitely chatter about it .
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Mossad if they did not plan or finance it, they sure as hell knew about it in detail to the time it was going to happen. I heard they had connections to Mohummad Atta alsa but havn't researched that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please give me any information you have on this matter. Thank you

       Thanks, I should have worded my post better. Althoguh technically true since all zionists are jews, and of course not all jews are zionists.

       Thank you. I saw a good movie about Zionism from an Israeli Director. Ther documentary was called Defamed or Defamation I believe. It shows clearly that not all jews approve of what the Zionists are doing in their collective name.
      </p>
      <p>
       One example I did not like from that video was Abe Foxman of the ADL telling the President of Ukraine to play down any mention of the Holodomor.

       Technically, yes. I have never been to temple, never bar mitzvah'ed etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I usually don't tell anyone because I do not really identify with the culture and am very quick to point out issues involving Jewish collusion (or any other group that needs to be called out). Why Jews are seemingly behind all of the evil going on the world is beyond me. America has turned into a Zionist puppet-state right in front of our eyes...and all within my short lifetime!
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, I'm an equal-opportunity bullshit detector! :-) And I'm particularly critical of what Zionists (Jews and Gentiles) are up to these days. Nobody likes a bully.

       Precisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty much considered "Goyim" by my actions and the few Jewish families that we associate with amazingly DO understand my "causes" and concerns. I don't know (and would never associate with) any "Israel-firsters." The average Jew sees what is going on and doesn't like it but stays silent. Tribal cohesion? I don't know. It makes no sense--that's why I
       <strong>
        speak up!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I truly believe that Zionism is going to cause a very abrupt and terrible paradigm shift in the US--then the entire world. My main concern is that the "rank-and-file" Jew, who is usually not aligned with the evil Zionist "causes" is eventually going to be persecuted for what these evil people are trying to pull off. You can see that the US right now in MANY ways parallels what was going on in pre-WWII Germany--same game, different players. All of us in the "99%"--Jewish or Goyim--are going to suffer directly from what the US Zionists/neocons are pulling off right now. Quite a few players in both the GWB and Obama administrations are dual-citizens...how the
       <em>
        hell
       </em>
       can you trust someone in the US that both holds power
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       allegiance to another country?? It is terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, the interesting thing (may you live in
       <em>
        interesting
       </em>
       times, hehe) is that in the US we are seeing history being made. We are descending to a broke third-world police state and things are not getting better. Now that ben-Shalom Bernanke has decided to inject even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       funny money into this failing economy...we are gonna see a total currency collapse. It is very scary! We are living in Jewish times and it is causing a financial (and moral) collapse. How much clearer does this need to be before people wake the hell up? NO one group should control as many important institutions for information dissemination! Makes it hard to learn the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the giant wall of text but I am passionate about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: Scary shit going down. Why does it seem that Zionists are behind it all?

       The zionists got the USA into WWI when germany was about to offer a ceasefire in 1916. Sucks! Britain promised em palestine back then, but the WWI may have ended early with a return to all original borders. Then no WWII either..

       Supposedly there were warnings from the Israelis that "something big" was going to happen involving the phony terror group invented by the Zionist Jews ("Al Qaeda"--meaning "the toilet"--haha, good joke Mossad!)
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course there were the Odigo instant messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange that, statistically, at least 400 Israelis should have died that day. Bush reported on 9/11 that over 150 died. In actuality, THREE Israelis lost their lives. That is some
       <em>
        crazy
       </em>
       luck, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, many rank-and-file Jews died when the towers were demolished. This was a conspiracy headed by Israelis and American/Israeli Zionist dual citizens. Saying that it was done "by the Jews" is inaccurate and unfair IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also remember the Jewish man in the cemetery heard the attack being discussed in Hebrew months before it happened. He reported these men and what they said to the FBI
       <em>
        twice
       </em>
       and was dismissed both times.

        Sources also said that even if the men [five Israelis] were spies, there is no evidence to conclude they had advance knowledge of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. The investigation, at the end of the day, after all the polygraphs, all of the field work, all the cross-checking, the intelligence work, concluded that they probably did not have advance knowledge of 9/11," Cannistraro noted.

       There are a lot of claims being thrown around here. If you are truly interested in the truth and not just slinging mud, the Wikipedia 9/11 advanced knowledge page on Israel and its sources are a good place to start researching.

       It seems to me that having a camera set up and focused on buildings that were about to be blown up and then celebrating when the planes hit the building
       <em>
        an hour later
       </em>
       is pretty indicative of guilt. Maybe its just me...

       Wikipedia is whitewashed 24/7 by many Jewish/Zionist groups such as the JIDF and the ADL. Nothing on there in relation to Zionists, Judaism or Israel is even close to balanced and accurate. Its laughable.
