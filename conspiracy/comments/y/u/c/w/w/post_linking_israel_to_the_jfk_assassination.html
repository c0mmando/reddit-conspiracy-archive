       The first image is how the post appears while I am logged onto my account; the second is how it appears to everyone else, ie: deleted.

      <p>
       Peculiar timing, to say the least.

       Do links to books on Amazon auto-delete?  If so, that would explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <del>
        Edit2: The Amazon link does not appear to be the culprit, I've posted a link to a cookbook in the comments, and it remains.
       </del>

      <p>
       Edit3:  Thanks for the response from a mod, and thanks to everyone for clearing this up.  It appears that one of the links was caught in a spam filter.  Mystery solved, it would appear.

       The only reason I can think of is because the amazon link that was posted had a affiliate extension, I believe there is a auto-delete function on these.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:
       <strong>
        I just tried it a amazon link with affiliate extension and it got deleted right away. Just try it yourself.

       amazon links are detected by the spam filter in comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       There once was a moderator here named ContheorySpiracist who was very diligent and thorough in his modqueue responsibilities and he would always inform people why their comments were caught in the spam filter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment, above, will eventually get detected by the filter (the "spam in comments" filter does not happen realtime like the submissions filter; it runs a few hours behind).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mechanical__Squirrel either has no clue what they are talking about, or is deliberately spewing lies to rouse the torches and pitchforks against the moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for this is that pretty much
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       amazon link goes to someone selling something. &lt;-- that is spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other urls which get caught in this same (slower, retroactive) process - mainly URL shortener links (bit.ly, tinyurl.com, etc.).

       Oh i see now.  No the conspiracy mods aren't in the business of censoring JFK conspiracy theories.  You should probably message them and ask them why your post was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean think about it objectively.  They allow 9/11 conspiracy theories, reptilian theories, and all sorts of out there shit.  JFK stuff is quaint and old school in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=jfk&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on">
        at the list of JFK post that haven't been deleted
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Use critical thinking before you go pointing fingers.

       If a mod did not delete those select posts, then who did?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you link me to another thread that deals with the Israeli connection, aside from the Dawson video posted today (NOT the fake JFK quote)?
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there are new mods here.  Some haven't been around long and would not have had the ability to censor posts of this nature in the past, and likely wouldn't care about ancient threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've messaged two mods, I'm sure they will get back to me when they have the time.

       Maybe you should have waited until they got back to you before you go crying conspiracy.

      <p>
       It could be a variety of things, maybe there's been spam on that particular link and the admins have instituted an anti-spam policy for that content, maybe the mods don't like you.  It's not like anti-israel sentiments are suppressed here, outside of voting.

       Well of course, but that's spam, and reddit has pretty strict anti-spam policies, many of which are automated.  It's like when Yahoo blocked all references to OWS emails linking to a certain site, it wasn't because they were trying to suppress OWS emails, it was because the sender wasn't following the double opt-in method for email marketing.

       If it was marked as spam it wouldn't show up to him and be deleted to the public. That's the result of a very specific action as a moderator. It's sad how hard you're trying to defend people you don't know. They could very easily be guilty of censorship and not in on a global conspiracy, but you're acting as if accusing the brand new moderator who was picked seemingly randomly is a crime. They can answer for themselves, you really don't need to get so abrasive and try to change the topic of conversation from the fact that it was clearly removed by a moderator..

       Admin removals, even by automated processes appear the same way.  It's the very foundation of their antispam policy, so the spammers don't know their spam has been removed.

       Yes it would, that's why they should have checked with the moderators before posting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a comment posted at roughly midnight EST, and the response was 1am EST on a saturday/sunday, chances are most mods were asleep, so he'll probably get a response in 6-10 hours.  People forget modding is basically a volunteer gig.

       Guys... do you really think that the mods are working with TPTB? Like I feel that it is so far-fetched for a government agent (or whoever it would be) to contact a redditor and some how convince him (especially a redditor on the CONSPIRACY section) to edit and censor this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can believe though, is that there are backdoors into reddit's server that are being accessed by government officials. Think about it:
Isn't Reddit owned by a corporation?
Many websites, including some sketchy ones, will allow people access to admin files, or user info.

       That said, if you haven't looked into 'hasbara' or Cass Sunstein, you really should.

       Here is a link for the latter:

        http://www.salon.com/2010/01/15/sunstein_2/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Sunstein advocates that the Government’s stealth infiltration should be accomplished by sending covert agents into “chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups.”  He also proposes that the Government make secret payments to so-called “independent” credible voices to bolster the Government’s messaging (on the ground that those who don’t believe government sources will be more inclined to listen to those who appear independent while secretly acting on behalf of the Government).   This program would target those advocating false “conspiracy theories,” which they define to mean: “an attempt to explain an event or practice by reference to the machinations of powerful people, who have also managed to conceal their role.”
