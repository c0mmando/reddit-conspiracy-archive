        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The power&#39;s that be would have you believe that I am a terrorist or at the very least an enemy of the state why? Because I am willing to stand up for you and your&#39;s. I am willing to give my last breath to defend the constitution and the great men&#39;s ideas from which it was born. Thomas Jefferson said </p>

<p>“The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.
Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now.
I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it.”</p>

<p>“Laws that forbid the carrying of arms...disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.”
I consider my self a patriot. Attempting to inform the public of the tyranny set forth by our government. He also went further on to say:</p>

<p>“What country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance?</p>

<p>The spirit of resistance to government is so valuable on certain occasions that I wish it to be always kept alive. It will often be exercised when wrong, but better so than not to be exercised at all.
The majority, oppressing an individual, is guilty of a crime, abuses its strength, and by acting on the law of the strongest breaks up the foundations of society.
When wrongs are pressed because it is believed they will be borne, resistance becomes morality.
Were we directed from Washington when to sow and when to reap, we should soon want bread.
The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg.
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.
God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion. The people cannot be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented, in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions, it is lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty.... And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from time to time, that this people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to the facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.”</p>

<p>I understand that this man was not with out his faults but we would not be here if it was not for men like this. I watched a video on you tube I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTxU4Vj4NWg">link</a></p>

<p>This is a real United States marine telling us that we have brothers in arms inside the military and that they will stand rifle to rifle with us when the time comes. At the end of the video he quotes his father&#39;s last words to him before he left for basic training, I pass these words to you now in hopes that they have the profound impact on you they had on me “Keep you&#39;re chin up, you&#39;re head down, Gods speed, and Semper Fidelis”, which means always faithful in Latin. It is the marine core motto and one that is not claiming allegiance to the government but to the Constitution. They take an oath before joining which states:</p>

<p>“ Enlistment Oath.— Each person enlisting in an armed force shall take the following oath:
&#39;I, XXXXXXXXXX, do solemnly swear  that I will support and defend the Constitution of the united states of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.&#39;”</p>

<p>This is not the whole oath as it varies from branch to branch of the armed forces. Some go on to swear allegiance to there commanding officers and the President of the United States. This I left out because if our President is the one who is endangering the constitution, they are sworn to protect then the last bit becomes moot.</p>

<p>I am appalled at how bad things have gotten. I wish to god people would of seen this coming besides the founding fathers. They put clauses in the Constitution to protect us from these things and we change them or ignore them. I point to the Second Amendment of the Bill of Rights which states: </p>

<p>“A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you but to me that sounds like something to protect us from our governing bodies. Considering a militia is by the people for the people like our government is suppose to be .</p>

<p>I believe that they will attempt to disarm us, and if you want to let them win: give them your guns. However, if you&#39;re like me load that gun and tell them to come and get it. I refuse to lay down to the tyranny we have experienced these past years and I don&#39;t point to one administration, they are all equally guilty and so are we for believing we had a choice who runs this country.</p>

<p>By now you&#39;re probably asking so who is pulling the strings? Its a small group of corporations. To find their names just read Forbes magazine top 500 richest. </p>

<p>I beg you open you&#39;re eyes, stand up for what&#39;s right because I&#39;m telling you now. If things don&#39;t change my children and your children will pay the price. They will grow up in a world much like today only worse where the dollar is the bottom line and corporations will no longer hide the atrocities they commit because they wont have to. The people will sign away right after right in the name of freedom As we all have seen before: </p>

<p>“Those who will give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither libert nor safety”. Benjamin Franklin</p>

<p>We have already given up so much and I fear it may be to late to avoid the blood shed coming. I know that writing this will put me on the FEMA lists and I for one dare them to come after me. I may lose my life but you will never take my freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Liberty has never come from the government.  Liberty has always come from the subjects of it.  The history of liberty is a history of resistance.&quot;  ~Woodrow Wilson</p>

<p>&quot;We must be free not because we claim freedom, but because we practice it.&quot; ~William Faulkner</p>

<p>What <strong>They</strong> don&#39;t want us to realize, is that <strong>We</strong> are the majority.  Our Nation&#39;s resolve is like a willow, flexible, able to move freely with the winds of thought and change, but like everything else, there will be a breaking point.  NDAA, HR 347, Iran, Syria, Immoral Banking Practices, Rising Taxation (without benefit to the Citizens), Corporations are People, Erosion of Privacy, these heavy society weights are strapped to <strong>EVERY</strong> citizen, regardless of Race, Political Believes, Age, Gender, Religion, these injustices effect <strong>ALL</strong> of us.  </p>

<p>Conservative or Liberal, Christian or Muslim (or Atheist), Young or Old, we are <strong>ALL</strong> loosing our Freedom, and we smell it in the air.</p>

<p><strong>They</strong> don&#39;t have a fucking chance!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately they stand a good chance. Because those of us with our eyes open are still a minority. Don&#39;t get me wrong our ranks grow everyday and sooner or later we will be the majority. Before that happens i believe the powers that be will launch a full scale war against us. On every public forum lying and perverting the truth to turn the American people against us. </p>

<p>we will face imprisonment, being tried as terrorists, and even death at the hands of our so called government. In our hearts we know we stand for something beautiful and true, and would accept this fate with dignity and have no remorse in doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not much Im from Alabama but I talked to a few families who were there for it and they said besides police and some government agencies &quot;fema&quot; there was a lot of white vans like news station vans but with no channel decals on them but nothing about gun confiscation. I did hear stories of people who survived katrina (even seen afterwards) vanished. most of them were big drug dealers with lots of firepower. A few of them were seen talking to the guys in the vans. Now this last part it completely here say from a crack head no less but he said 3 dealers that had been seen after the storm was all over and they were moving people to the super dome. But they were found with a hole right were the neck connects to the skull, but all 3 were ruled as a drowning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do know the national guard was there to &quot;help&quot; the cops were basically shooting first and asking later. A bunch of lines were crossed. Really we put cops into a warzone and they panicked. I&#39;m sure some people did shoot at cops but most of them were protecting their homes. From what I can tell if you were swimming with your valuables, they assumed you were looting. But think how the people felt everything the owned was underwater, you lost family members and had to shoot 2 guys for trying to steal your tv. Now this cop is yelling at you to drop your gun or he&#39;ll shoot. Who wouldn&#39;t tell him to go fuck himself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those people make me mad, just because we are soldiers doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t think for our selves. When I went to war I did some dirty shit but it wasn&#39;t because I was ordered to, it was more about revenge for my friends getting killed. Believe me an American with a gun is a civilian! Not a threat to America!<br/>
  But they will threaten the soldiers with death if they refuse the orders, but when current soldiers and ex soldiers stand against each other the true character of both will come out. Only about 20% would actually fire on American civilians, and it would be out of fear.<br/>
  One last thing, out of all the ex military people I know. We will take a bullet before we stood still and watch American civilians take one. Don&#39;t believe me? The day it happens stand behind me.<br/>

However, I think we are almost all powerless with the militarization of most, if not at all, police departments, in conjunction with the Constitution virtually having almost no meaning for us regular citizens.
