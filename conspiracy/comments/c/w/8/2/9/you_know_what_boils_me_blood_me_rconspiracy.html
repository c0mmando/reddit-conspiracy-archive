    <div class="md"><p>I know, have you seen the film &quot;Killing Room&quot;?  It&#39;s a really fucked up film. <strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong> the general premise is, 5 people sign up to d0 a test for $500 bucks that they found in a newspaper.  Once blindfolded and brought to some unknown location, they find them selves in a all white room with a table and 5 chairs (all screwed to the floor).  The main &quot;scientist&quot; comes in and kills the only girl in the room by shooting her in the face... this is in the first 5 minutes.  The rest of the film is them breaking these people down by systematically killing them off till they end up with one person who has been broken down to nothing.  This whole thing is ran by the CIA to break people down and then re-program them to be suicide bombers.  They then send them to the middle east to blow them selves up and what ever target.  Its fucked to watch, but the idea is interesting.</p>

It turns out that there is a secret group called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_300">The Committee of 300</a>. Now if their goals are the same as these others group, it would make sense to up the number of Persians from ~10, 000 to 5.2 million, making it seem as though they (elite) are fighting the common man.</p>
