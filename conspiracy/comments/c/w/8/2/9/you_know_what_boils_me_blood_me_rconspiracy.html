       It was just Chelsea Clinton's wedding. But apparently "everyone" is talking about it because "Oprah" and "Obama" aren't invited in addition to there being a no-fly zone over the area where the ceremony is being held.

       You're seriously saying that Chelsea Clinton's wedding is what?  Planned by mysterious overlords who have somehow hinted at this momentous occasion by using the date in an episode of

       I really don't know if the actors know whats up, but it seems like people come in and due predictive programming.  You (if you don't already) might want to listen to

        Alan Watts

       If you recall the plot, that corrupt corrupt defense contractor was secretly making WMD's for some country other than the US. These WMD's were to be used against the US to provoke massive retaliation against a Muslim country that was regarded as enemy of the country for whom these weapons were being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though viewers aren't told which country these WMD's were being made for, can you guess what Mel Gibson had in mind?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Who was the country that this weapon was secretly being made for?
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          What Muslim country was going to be blamed when the weapon was used against America?
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If you're not sure, think about what Gibson was hinting at when Craven has this exchange with a corrupt Senator(who was obviously modeled after John Kerry):

       I know, have you seen the film "Killing Room"?  It's a really fucked up film.
       <strong>
        SPOILER ALERT
       </strong>
       the general premise is, 5 people sign up to d0 a test for $500 bucks that they found in a newspaper.  Once blindfolded and brought to some unknown location, they find them selves in a all white room with a table and 5 chairs (all screwed to the floor).  The main "scientist" comes in and kills the only girl in the room by shooting her in the face... this is in the first 5 minutes.  The rest of the film is them breaking these people down by systematically killing them off till they end up with one person who has been broken down to nothing.  This whole thing is ran by the CIA to break people down and then re-program them to be suicide bombers.  They then send them to the middle east to blow them selves up and what ever target.  Its fucked to watch, but the idea is interesting.

       Or for example, the movie
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_%28film%29">
        300
       </a>
       . I heard after it came out the numbers were off. That also bothered me. I don't think the producers changed the numbers without a purpose. It turns out that there is a secret group called
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_300">
        The Committee of 300
       </a>
       . Now if their goals are the same as these others group, it would make sense to up the number of Persians from ~10, 000 to 5.2 million, making it seem as though they (elite) are fighting the common man.

       As opposed to accepting that these dates and their respective events are just coincidences? Hardly.

       neo's license IS a crazy coincidence, i'll admit that, but it's only a crazy coincidence because 9/11 was such a significant event. Chelsea Clinton's wedding however, is a completely insignificant event - especially to memorialize in a 15 year old simpsons episode. I would think they'd be more concerned about venue bookings, weather, etc, than to sync it with a date from a split second in a simpson's episode from 15 years ago just to hope that someone would notice and they could get a good chuckle out of it.
      </p>

       as time goes on more future dates from old movies and TV are going to pass - some of them are going to have significant events. this doesn't mean it was planned.

       what a coincidence! The Matrix itself is full of allegorical meaning. For example, the main character's name, Neo Anderson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neo is a word, a prefix signaling something "new",
Anderson breaks apart into Ander Son, Ander(or andre) is the Greek word for "man", and you all know what Son means. Neo Anderson means "New Son of Man".

       CAPITAL CITY USA
9/11/01
..in a movie which is a perfect analogy for the insane society that we we're actually living in(minus the whole machine takeover,) released in 1999. pretty sure it's not confirmation bias, the natural aristocracy love these little jokes on the blind public, it's in the nature of the psychopath to mock their victim.

       There are other movies too. I just can't think of them at the moment. Do I think that high level people in Hollywood are let in things before they happen? Yes, I do.

       If you recall the plot, that corrupt corrupt defense contractor was secretly making WMD's for some country other than the US. These WMD's were to be used against the US to provoke massive retaliation against a Muslim country that was regarded as enemy of the country for whom these weapons were being made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though viewers aren't told which country these WMD's were being made for, can you guess what Mel Gibson had in mind?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Who was the country that this weapon was secretly being made for?
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          What Muslim country was going to be blamed when the weapon was used against America?
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If you're not sure, think about what Gibson was hinting at when Craven has this exchange with a corrupt Senator(who was obviously modeled after John Kerry):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         Well you had better decide whether you're hanging on the cross or banging in the nails.
        </em>
