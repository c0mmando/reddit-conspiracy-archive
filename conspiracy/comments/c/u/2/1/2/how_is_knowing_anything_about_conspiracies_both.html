        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve recently been looking through some conspiracy theories (e.g., chemtrails, Bilderberg Group, New World Order, etc.) and everything sounds so convincing. So, how do you know what to believe? Not just that, but how is knowing about these conspiracies going to change anything? Has it changed your life? For me, it has changed my perspective on certain things. However, it seems like everything is out of my control. Out of the control any of us have and it&#39;s disheartening to know that. Essentially, what are we supposed to do if these theories have even 1/100th of truth to them? This is an honest question from a teen who just wants to get some insight on what others think about conspiracies. What can I do to, if anything, protect myself and others from fallacies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Changing your perspective is the most important real effect.  This allows you (and me and anyone who knows it) to interpret political information in a more rational sense.  Changing your perception is changing your life.</p>

<p>What to believe is a much tougher question.  You have to sort through pranky hoaxes, intentional disinformation and most of all, irresponsibly drawn conclusions in order to find good information.  Just look for corroborating evidence and maintain skepticism of all viewpoints until the truth is obvious.</p>

<p>As far as being able to change anything, you&#39;re largely right; you can&#39;t.  Still, it has allowed me to predict many political outcomes long before they are the popular consensus (for example picking Kerry as the nominee and loser immediately upon the announcements of the 6-7 major candidates in &#39;03; picking the month of the beginning of the Iraq War 8 months ahead when there was still public debate about whether we would invade; picking the nominees and the winner in &#39;08 before the primaries had started; etc.).  Also, it allows one to better plan for future events.  If I&#39;d known this stuff in &#39;92, I could have told you that NAFTA was a given, and that Perot had no chance.  This is mainly important for investment, but otherwise, at least it makes you look prescient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can ...</p>

<p>Start to get healthy food (avoid hfcs, sugar, flour). Avoid fluor (destroys teeth, dumbs down). Disbelieve and challenge your doctor (he is after your $$$ not your health). Avoid unnecesary vaccines (flu-shot).</p>

<p>Know you bank or investment broker are after your money. They will sell you deals where they gain 1$ on every 1000$ you loose. They are not helping you, they are scamming you. </p>

<p>Prepare for mass extinction. The bilderberg idea of getting rid of 80% of population is about right. We, as a species, would profit. Now, either they poison us to death (DU in irak), or some nasty bacteria/virus will do the job. Try to get as few poison as you can. Diversify your offspring genetically for better immune resistance.</p>

<p>When buying a house, look for enough land to grow some food, better rural (low population density) then inner city. Have enough weapons / ammo ready. </p>

<p>My dad has talked about this before too. There was an earlier post that talked about the New World Order being a good thing, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/csb0s/i_believe_we_should_have_a_new_world_order/">here&#39;s the link</a> which I thought was completely absurd...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no need to be fearful.. knowing, being prepared and thinking positively is the best thing you can do. This is a major plus of being awake - being prepared to face what may come when other people might be blindsided and filled with fear - but don&#39;t let it control your life. Take steps to have a game plan (store up foods, think about planting your own food, water, warm clothes whatever you feel is necessary to get by) and... live your life in the mean time. Don&#39;t get overwhelmed, the fact that you are researching and willing to take steps in the right direction puts you far ahead of the game than a lot of people out there. If you let the fear of what may happen take away your enjoyment of living in the moment in your life, then there would BE no point of living, so don&#39;t live in fear just be practical. </p>

<p>Well, with all the stories in the press, tv, radio etc about how crappy bottled water is, I wasn&#39;t sure if your weren&#39;t just having a little joke.
Especially when you said &#39;water store&#39;, definitely sounded like a joke. </p>

<p>Anyway, bottled water; about half is from tap water that may or may not have had some sort of filtering, there are no regulations pertaining to what it should or should not contain, it is also in bpa containing plastic that causes all kinds of problems for humans and other life.  (you&#39;ll have to look that one up since that&#39;s a long list of issues).
The other half of the bottled water out there may or may not be spring water that may or may not be contaminated with who knows what.</p>

<p>Sir William Drummond of Logiealmond (ca. 1770-1828) was a
Scottish diplomat and Member of Parliament, poet and philosopher.
He wrote the book, Oedipus Judaicus (1811), now considered a
classic in Bible scholarship.</p>

of the Bible appeared to contain nothing but a collection of self contradictory
stories about a small and insignificant race of people.
So he decided to prove that there was an alternative way to interpret
the Bible using the science of comparative linguistics. Drummond interpreted passages from
the Book of Genesis and the Book of Joshua, and explained how the Bible conveyed various
truths in an allegorical fashion. Drummond suggested that the writers of the Old Testament;
“…follow the example of all the East, in blending in their narratives real with fictitious events and
involving important lessons to mankind whether in morals, or in science, under the guise of
recorded fact.”</p>

<p>Another thing to look at is the Gnostic Gospels discovered in 1945</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some good answers here between seeing the impending disasters beforehand (the recent financial crisis was very obvious well in advance to most conspiracy people),  the hope that critical mass will be reached when enough people are paying attention, a healthy skeptisism of our &#39;leaders&#39;, and generally seeing the world through a new view, which can be very fullfilling.</p>

<p>However I think the best thing about being &#39;awakened&#39; is that truth is in itself a reward.  When you realize something about the world you didn&#39;t know before, it can have a very uplifting effect.  Unfortunately it can also have many terrifying effects as well, but that&#39;s part of truth...knowing the bad side as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel you. I try to research every side of the stories we are told on a daily basis. For instance, you will find alternate theories about the oil spill. Deciding whether you believe them or not is one thing. But I have come to the realization that it does not matter what we believe. We are small and things will continue on no matter what you believe. However, this is not to deter you. Keep investigating, because while you will be uncertain on certain conspiracies, you can find some strong truth in the 9/11 and JFK &quot;conspiracies&quot;, for starters. </p>

<p>The truth will set you free. While it might not be as liberating as one might hope, it is better to be aware of it instead of living blind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking some good questions.  Something that is really worth asking yourself is: what kind of evidence do you require in order to believe that something, which you were not physically present to observe, is true?  Some people will accept someone else&#39;s word at face value, while others need an almost impossible level of evidence to believe anything.  Is it possible to even know the truth and, if so, what level of evidence do you require in order to believe it?  Aim at satisfying that.  Keep an open mind and consider all possibilities until sufficient evidence amounts to allow you to reach a conclusion.  Some things you may have to leave undecided, because good evidence can be scarce.</p>

<p>For me, learning about the conspiracy has been like correctly identifying a leak in my roof before it destroys the entire ceiling.  Many people would consider having a leaky roof as bad news, but they&#39;d be forgetting the value of such knowledge in saving their entire house.   Similarly, I think that the conspiracy has laid some very subtle yet deadly traps for unsuspecting people - yes, there are physical threats, but more important in my mind are fallacies of thought which lead people to destruction.  When you research the conspiracy, you begin to be able to identify some of the driving ideas behind them, and can therefore resist them more effectively.</p>

<p>For me, the ultimate course of action is fleeting.  Some think that they can keep themselves safe by merely modifying their investment portfolio; others may sell everything to go live off the grid somewhere in South America.  For now I&#39;m staying where I am, because perhaps there are some people in my life who might heed what I say, if I were to point out that spot on their ceiling.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t look at it this way. In most of the conspiracies that I&#39;ve read into, I&#39;ve just being using my instincts, hoping it would be enough to allow me to know what&#39;s true or not. I&#39;ll keep this in mind though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using your instincts is all you really can do so if you learn discernment and to listen to your gut instinct, that&#39;s pretty much all you can do. You&#39;re on the right track! If you keep going in the direction your instincts tells you to go in your research, it will lead you to what you want/need to know. At this point in my research, I&#39;ve come to the realization that like you said, you can&#39;t change other people or what they are doing, but since the outside world is a projection of your own mind (like the Matrix), changing your perspective DOES change your world. It may sound wishy washy, but that simple idea seems to be everywhere if you listen closely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best thing you can do is just keep searching for the truth. I am very hesitant to believe anything unless it&#39;s coming straight from a declassified (or leaked) government document, and or from the testimony of someone who is actually &quot;in the field&quot; (ie current/former government employee, military personnel, scientists, etc.) If i&#39;m going to take a story seriously it&#39;s going to need some damn good sources.</p>

<p>If you want to hear some crazy/mindblowing testimony from high ranking military personell regarding UFO&#39;s, zero point energy, etc than watch this collection of interviews: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6552475158249898710#">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6552475158249898710#</a></p>

<p>Also read this interview with Adam Trombly, a scientist who&#39;s inventions have been gagged (ie hidden from the public) for many years: <a href="http://spiritofmaat.com/archive/feb2/trombly.htm">http://spiritofmaat.com/archive/feb2/trombly.htm</a></p>

<p>The government (or rather the military/insustrial complex run by the fossil fuel industry, which CONTROLS the government) has been covering up the discovery of zero point energy systems pioneered by famed inventor Nikola Tesla, as well as various other technologies recovered (including similar zero-point energy systems) from crashed UFO&#39;s throughout recent history. This has been an ongoing cover-up for DECADES, but don&#39;t take my word for it. Hear the story straight from the horse&#39;s mouth, hear it from the testimony of high ranking military personnel/scientists in the links above. It definitely sounds crazy, but the testimony is there, believe it or don&#39;t</p>
