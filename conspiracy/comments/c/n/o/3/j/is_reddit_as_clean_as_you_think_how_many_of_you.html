    <div class="md"><p>you fuckers are truly in the dark. All moderately public forums are full of shills. What they seek to do is <em>not</em> obfuscate the illegitimacy of the government, but provide contrast wherein it can be assumed the reinforcement of that legitimacy is the agenda, allowing conclusions the legitimacy is fraudulent to be drawn by <em>individuals,</em> absent of observable proof, absent, in many cases, of direct encouragement.</p>

<p>what I mean is, you&#39;re <em>supposed</em> to distrust the system. It&#39;s so obvious! It&#39;s fucking sensationalized! It&#39;s mainstream! Look at the tea parties! Look at the false basis responsible for the Iraq war in plain sight and the doubt it helps cast on America&#39;s current agenda in the region, especially concerning Iran and its nuclear powers! Look at Israel&#39;s blatant unjustifiability on top of that! Look at things like the oil spill, the healthcare bill, the swine flu, the bailouts, <em>distinctly</em> implying corruption, <em>distinctly</em> implying the government is complicit or inept as things unfold unfavorably, while <em>distinctly</em> illustrating the inability of the public to do a fucking thing about it! Holy shit, man, you guys are <em>way</em> the fuck behind. You guys are <em>toddlers.</em></p>

<p>do <em>not</em> be surprised when the new world appears to save us from the old! It <em>will</em> happen, <em>trust</em> me. But first, everyone has to be <em>desperate</em> as <em>fuck</em> for it, and that will only happen via a complete and thorough vilification of the old world, a comprehensive and observable failure of the old world. That is what is happening.</p>

<p>if I am wrong, why are conclusions so easily drawn with basis that could be hidden did the agenda truly wish to operate in secret? I&#39;m <em>not</em> wrong. It is black and white.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, and current events continue to affirm this viewpoint. This sounds like something I would write, the second paragraph really speaks to me.</p>

<p>The world is wrought with corruption. I feel that people (in the United States at least) are distracted by bullshit political trivialities, sideshows.  What we say, what we want, who we vote for does not matter. We have very little control, its more of an illusion. People don&#39;t get it, or they get it and don&#39;t like to talk about it.</p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s incredibly easy to manipulate average Americans. People are too distracted by Dancing with the Stars and American Idol, you know, important things.</p>

<p>I guess the biggest issue, why people don&#39;t see what&#39;s going on, is because they chronically underestimate the evil people are capable of, the dishonesty, coercion, brutality. And how smart they are, always that. There are people pulling strings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>reddit isn&#39;t clean at all.  it can be a cesspool of misinformation posted by fringe groups trying curb sheeple&#39;s opinions.</p>

<p>recently, there were a few news stories i&#39;ve followed with some interest.  the israeli floatilla thing was a joke on reddit.  many of the popular posts were made from fringe &#39;media&#39; and it was interesting to me that for every propaganda message from one side the other came back.  if you only read 4-5 articles, i&#39;m convinced that many people could be on either side of the issue.  fuk both sides for not even attempting to report anything unbiased.</p>

<p>when the g20 was in toronto the other week... again reddit was inundated with spammers trying to curb opinion on the issue by linking fringe articles.... or sensationalized content that was as useful to a discussion as an asshole on your elbow.  the problem is they come in packs and use the downvote/upvote to promote their cause.  then it&#39;s popular to get their message out to thousands of people.  it&#39;s all games.</p>

<p>reddit would be a much better place if fuktards didn&#39;t come here to do a soapbox stand - (on either side of an issue).</p>

<p>tl,dr - reddit&#39;s voting system encourages propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just look at what Cass Sunstein has written. </p>

<p>Sunstein&#39;s &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; paper, written in 2008, deals with the infiltration of chat rooms as well as social and other group meetings, whether online or in person. Their definition of &quot;false conspiracy theories&quot; is those theories that suggest that powerful people have been directly involved in certain affairs and have managed to keep their role in these affairs &quot;secret&quot; from the public&#39;s eye.</p>

<ul>
<li>Actual live people</li>
<li>Accounts that are operated via scripts across diverse IPs that can mass downvote/upvote both submissions and comments</li>

<p>The upvote campaigns that occur quickly can get a submission on the front page. Similarly, when people downvote it (as many did the &quot;Coincidence&quot; thread) they can immediately upvote to counteract it and create more activity, which also factors in the reddit algorithm for the front page.</p>

<p>But above all for the DoD and the like, it can&#39;t be fishy activity. It&#39;s subtle, but you notice it if you know what to look for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, Cointelpro and groups linked to the government/ CIA infiltrate all groups, you can see it when within an hour a conspiracy related video has over 200 comments saying it&#39;s &#39;crazy&#39; or &#39;stupid&#39;, no matter how much evidence is presented. They are the one&#39;s who infiltrate groups that start with good intentions to fight the elite and they are the first one&#39;s to say &quot;Let&#39;s saw off this shotgun&quot; or &quot;Let&#39;s go bomb the IRS building&quot; and tarnishes the groups reputation forever after. There are people who&#39;s entire job is to troll social sites to spread disinfo and disparage any real conspiracy info until you can&#39;t tall what&#39;s true or not and that&#39;s the point. There is no reason to believe Reddit is the exception.</p>

<p>EDIT: A thought just occured to me too.. sometimes I see threads in AskReddit that are basically opinion polls that make me a little wary. An example (not a very good one) is &quot;Hey Reddit, what was your first car?&quot; The top comment was be careful because this is a common security question for online accounts and could be used to phish info for identity theft. I wish I could think of some of the worse ones I&#39;ve seen (I know I&#39;ve seen a few that raised my concern but there&#39;s so much crap on reddit, it&#39;s hard to remember), but you get the picture and these are often very popular. The questions can seem fairly innocuous, but just like opinion polls on CNN or FoxNews they can be a goldmine for government programs because they A. can be used to sway opinion and B. be used to see how well the programming/ propaganda is working. Anyways, just a thought.</p>
