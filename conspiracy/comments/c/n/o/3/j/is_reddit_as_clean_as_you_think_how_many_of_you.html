       I'm sure reddit is monitored. I'm also sure that there are a lot of PR agency people hired by the government to shill for pro-government positions. Think of it as establishment SEO.

       If we actually succeeded in a "takedown" of an individual, such as a cop who participated in a botched raid, I'm sure we would get a rash of agents provocateur telling us we ought to burn police cars and suggesting when and where to do it.

       Just look at this link that was proudly featured on the front page for over a day now. It had 200 upvotes in about a half an hour after it was posted and it's entirely aimed at delegitimizing the "conspiracy theorists" and 9/11 truth.

       And of course, you have known shills like Fountainhead then posting this in subreddits like r/911_truth
      </p>

       Was that first post anything but a joke? I just thought it was a joke on how outlandish conspiracy theories can be sometimes, I didn't think it expressed any opinion on whether we have the truth about 9/11 or not.

       I think that's the point.. they've made 9/11 truth into a joke along with any other conspiracy that make us question the status quo. It may not seem like much but this kind of 'joking' is everywhere and it subconsciously preys on the weak and encourages them to keep inside the box or be labeled a 'crazy tinfoil hatter'.

       Yes, but to people who are on the fence or even completely ignorant of the facts or even theories of 9/11 truth, it's just a joke that let's them feel safe in their little cocoon of safety among the majority of stupid.

       you fuckers are truly in the dark. All moderately public forums are full of shills. What they seek to do is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       obfuscate the illegitimacy of the government, but provide contrast wherein it can be assumed the reinforcement of that legitimacy is the agenda, allowing conclusions the legitimacy is fraudulent to be drawn by
       <em>
        individuals,

       I agree, and current events continue to affirm this viewpoint. This sounds like something I would write, the second paragraph really speaks to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is wrought with corruption. I feel that people (in the United States at least) are distracted by bullshit political trivialities, sideshows.  What we say, what we want, who we vote for does not matter. We have very little control, its more of an illusion. People don't get it, or they get it and don't like to talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it's incredibly easy to manipulate average Americans. People are too distracted by Dancing with the Stars and American Idol, you know, important things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the biggest issue, why people don't see what's going on, is because they chronically underestimate the evil people are capable of, the dishonesty, coercion, brutality. And how smart they are, always that. There are people pulling strings.

       If I was in Government I would be foolish not to use whatever sources of information was available.....and im sure there are lots of ways of 'trolling' to get people of certain viewpoints to come out of the woodwork.

       yes but this affects the whole perception of truth, because it simply kills any reference. as humans, we are hard-wired to assume that the people we speak to do not lie, at least as long as we don't lie to them :)

       reddit isn't clean at all.  it can be a cesspool of misinformation posted by fringe groups trying curb sheeple's opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       recently, there were a few news stories i've followed with some interest.  the israeli floatilla thing was a joke on reddit.  many of the popular posts were made from fringe 'media' and it was interesting to me that for every propaganda message from one side the other came back.  if you only read 4-5 articles, i'm convinced that many people could be on either side of the issue.  fuk both sides for not even attempting to report anything unbiased.
      </p>
      <p>
       when the g20 was in toronto the other week... again reddit was inundated with spammers trying to curb opinion on the issue by linking fringe articles.... or sensationalized content that was as useful to a discussion as an asshole on your elbow.  the problem is they come in packs and use the downvote/upvote to promote their cause.  then it's popular to get their message out to thousands of people.  it's all games.
      </p>
      <p>
       reddit would be a much better place if fuktards didn't come here to do a soapbox stand - (on either side of an issue).
      </p>
      <p>
       tl,dr - reddit's voting system encourages propaganda.

       while true, it only does so because the most active, say, 20% of Reddit's population is ready to or already believes in said propaganda, and gets their daily news from these "fringe" sources. the other 80% (myself induced), just browse the front page, see these articles, and think, "they (the OPs)  be retarded". and then we go about our lives, getting our news from the mainstream.

       Just look at what Cass Sunstein has written.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sunstein's "conspiracy theory" paper, written in 2008, deals with the infiltration of chat rooms as well as social and other group meetings, whether online or in person. Their definition of "false conspiracy theories" is those theories that suggest that powerful people have been directly involved in certain affairs and have managed to keep their role in these affairs "secret" from the public's eye.

       While I'm sure this is the case, most of the reasons people hate the US are valid. It is not stuff like the bickering Sarah Palin does at Obama constantly. We have innocent people being tortured, innocent people being killed, innocent people losing their loved ones and everything they've ever had. Why? Because getting rid of excess material and fighting in war has been proven to profit the industries involved.

       I think the number of normal people who are misguided by the mainstream media into believing untrue things far outweighs the number of actual paid shills. Though we do have admissions from sources such as DHS and Israel that they are, in fact, paying "agents" to address "public relations issues" online.

       What information are you basing your opinion on? Have you ever looked at the vote scores? Take the "Coincidence" thread in

       discusses in this thread: almost 8,000 total votes at a 4:3 ratio to keep it on the front page... 8,000 "people" voted...

       They have two major accounts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Actual live people
       </li>
       <li>
        Accounts that are operated via scripts across diverse IPs that can mass downvote/upvote both submissions and comments
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The upvote campaigns that occur quickly can get a submission on the front page. Similarly, when people downvote it (as many did the "Coincidence" thread) they can immediately upvote to counteract it and create more activity, which also factors in the reddit algorithm for the front page.
      </p>
      <p>
       But above all for the DoD and the like, it can't be fishy activity. It's subtle, but you notice it if you know what to look for.

       Sometimes it helps not to assume the people who do these things think anything like you or me or a seemingly rational person. They've been controlling things for a long time and they do have the money, resources and time to devote to shills crawling the internet to spread disinfo.

       Yes, but anyone crazy enough to be employed in such a scheme would be crazy enough to blab. Do we know any blogs kept by psycho right wingers that have talked about getting paid per comment or anything? I doubt they've got a warehouse full of air force recruits with some workstations, but if you know anything you'd like to share, please do.

       That's a good point. They don't want us to focus on the in your face tyranny such as if we grew the wrong vegetation in our backyard we would get guns pointed in our face. If we refuse to give up half our income (taxation) to Bush or Obama so they can divert it to Halliburton or Goldman Sachs we get guns pointed in our face.
      </p>

       Perhaps reality is so harsh that we try to distract ourselves from it by focusing on the needles in the haystack.

       It's a certainty at this point they won't be able to get a movie out by 2012 when the colonization goes down, assuming of course they're still on schedule and that our stage three multiverse dimensions progress through time in a roughly similar manner, which given the fictional nature of the xfilesverse, is unlikely at best.

       Hmm, this brought an interesting observation to mind. Agents have more freedom to openly interview citizens, with their consent, on the internet in anonymus chatrooms and forums than they would if everyone was required to id themselves with real world names.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a psychological viewpoint what better way to study someone or a group than through a series of dialog with that target via the masquerade ball that the internet is today and recording your observations.

       Yea, Cointelpro and groups linked to the government/ CIA infiltrate all groups, you can see it when within an hour a conspiracy related video has over 200 comments saying it's 'crazy' or 'stupid', no matter how much evidence is presented. They are the one's who infiltrate groups that start with good intentions to fight the elite and they are the first one's to say "Let's saw off this shotgun" or "Let's go bomb the IRS building" and tarnishes the groups reputation forever after. There are people who's entire job is to troll social sites to spread disinfo and disparage any real conspiracy info until you can't tall what's true or not and that's the point. There is no reason to believe Reddit is the exception.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: A thought just occured to me too.. sometimes I see threads in AskReddit that are basically opinion polls that make me a little wary. An example (not a very good one) is "Hey Reddit, what was your first car?" The top comment was be careful because this is a common security question for online accounts and could be used to phish info for identity theft. I wish I could think of some of the worse ones I've seen (I know I've seen a few that raised my concern but there's so much crap on reddit, it's hard to remember), but you get the picture and these are often very popular. The questions can seem fairly innocuous, but just like opinion polls on CNN or FoxNews they can be a goldmine for government programs because they A. can be used to sway opinion and B. be used to see how well the programming/ propaganda is working. Anyways, just a thought.

       my associates and I are compiling a list of known provocateurs and adjutors on this subreddit (I don't trust
       <a href="/r/shill">
        /r/shill
       </a>
       ). it'd be nearly impossible to do on the entirety of reddit, IMO. there's just too many of them.

       This is truly preposterous suggestion, and I for one take great offense to the mere mention of this unsupported and ludicrous hypothesis.

        Agents have more freedom to openly interview citizens, with their consent, on the internet in anonymus chatrooms and forums than they would if everyone was required to id themselves with real world names.

        From a psychological viewpoint what better way to study someone or a group than through a series of dialog with that target via the masquerade ball that the internet is today and recording your observations.

       Because reddit gets 280m pageviews a day, and its much more likely that there's a dozen agents of the sort that concern you, not eight thousand or even five hundred.
