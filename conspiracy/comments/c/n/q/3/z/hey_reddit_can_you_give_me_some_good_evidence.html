<li>&quot;Depopulation should be the highest priority of US foreign policy towards the Third World&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Reduction of the rate of population in these states is a matter of vital US national security&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;The US economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less-developed countries. That fact gives the US enhanced interests in the political, economic and social stability of the supplying countries. Wherever a lessening of population can increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes relevant to resources, supplies and the economic interest of the United States&quot;.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have observed very little evidence to this claim, but I&#39;ve personally come to the same conclusion just reasoning logically. If you look at resource availability on planet, balanced against our rate of consumption of said resources, as well as the rate at which we are destroying the biosphere (we don&#39;t even know how it works, much less have any clue how to undo damage), it becomes clear that there is a good chance we will never get off this rock, because we will fuck it up too badly before developing the necessary high technologies. 
Given those circumstances, if I was in control of enough energy that I was able to guide the human civilization to some extent (like the so-called elite), and assuming I wanted to see it get off this rock and spread through the galaxy, I too would be thinking about how to reduce the population by 80-90% or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all the evidence I need. If given the power and opportunity, I would remove 80% of the world&#39;s population. Being that I am, by all accounts, a functioning member of society with no documented mental defect, and no hatred for any specific group of people; it isn&#39;t hard to imagine people with wealth and power might realize society can maintain it&#39;s level of technology, increase it&#39;s quality of life, and insure future survival, simply by reducing the current population to a level that is sustainable for the planet as well as beneficial to human existence</p>

<p>More simply, just read the news today about <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/news/92/280/USDA_Reports_Food_Shortages:_Wall_Street_Caught_Off_Guard_by_Severity.html">food shortages</a> even here in the US.  The rest of the world has it much worse, since terminator seeds are being imposed on farmers in Africa, India, etc and then priced so high the next season that they can&#39;t afford to reseed and end up committing suicide.  Vaccination programs often leave the unwitting recipients sterile.  Western-owned ships around the horn of Africa use fishing techniques that leave the sea bare and replace it with toxic waste.  When the pirates then start hijacking them to protect their waters, the US Navy steps in to protect the plunder and dumping.  Genocides go unnoticed even as US companies supply the dictators with all the armaments they need and western banks finance the regimes.  I can go on but it&#39;s time for dinner so that&#39;s all for now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But see, there&#39;s the problem. This is all happening, and it&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s a big step to go on to claim it&#39;s done to get rid of most of us. What if they just dump Fluoride in the water because it&#39;s a waste-product they need to get rid of? Now Aspartame is very dangerous, and there are plenty of alternatives, but it&#39;s still a big step to claim it&#39;s specifically meant to kill us all. The terminator seeds just seem an attempt by Monsanto to keep people dependent on their seeds, and thus to be able to continually make money. It&#39;s very evil, but it really seems to be a profit motive. The vaccination programs have caused sterility yes, but has this happened on a large scale? I see no evidence that millions have been sterilized. A lot of this can be explained through simple greed as well. I find it hard to find any evidence of a higher motive behind all of these incidents. If there is an overarching goal behind all of this, there has to be evidence of that, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are sooo many ways they are doing it besides outright slaughter, but if you want to go that route, look at all the constant warrantless wars they wage. Who&#39;s fighting these wars? The population. And even if there was a good reason for whatever disagreement there is, how would killing each other en masse solve it? War as a means for conflict resolution itself is a conditioned reality that does what the elite love to do most: kill two birds with one stone! It&#39;s a great money making racket (as well as obtaining resources from the country they are fighting) AND killing off lot&#39;s of people (especially civilians, they love collateral damage).</p>

<p>Another favored method is slow death. They poison the water (Fluoride is the most common, but there is a slew of chemicals they put in the water), they poison our food (aspartame, pretty every unpronounceable you&#39;ve seen on the back of a food label) they poison the skies (chemtrails, all transportation which isn&#39;t necessary considering they have lot&#39;s of free energy devices), they poison the air (both chemically and with electromagnetics), and they poison the mind (TV, movies, music, the education system, politics, hate, seperation, denial etc). The mind one is the worst of all. They don&#39;t need to kill us if we all just want to kill ourselves! Also, I&#39;m thinking of something that is the equivalent of a lie of ommission. They kill by keeping technology and healing from us by keeping us ignorant of what we are and how true healing happens. The healthcare system as a whole is abysmal. They seek to make money from Pharmaceuticals, which treat not cure and barely even that. Those &#39;side effects&#39; that zip by at the end of commercials for prescription drugs are not side effects, they are the effects of the drug. They have so many, it&#39;s almost as if the thing the drug is ACTUALLY supposed to do is the side effect. And if you think this is all accidental or unconnected, check out theyrule.net, it&#39;s basically the Six Degrees of Seperation for the Boards of Directors for all the major corporations that rule our world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First- define &quot;the elite&quot;.  Who are we talking about, The Rotschilds, Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Barack Obama, the Bohemian Grove?  What makes an &quot;elite&quot;?</p>

<p>Almost anyone who is smart enough to achieve a place in society that would be considered &quot;elite&quot;, is also smart enough to realize that whatever passing fancy they might have in clearing out South America or something so that they can have it all to themselves, is simply foolish.  The level of risk vs. payoff for such a venture is simply not worth it.  Even if you decided you want to, how much traction are you going to get by trying to collect a cabal of elites to execute such a plan.  The bigger a conspiracy, the more likely someone is going to spill the beans.</p>

<p>Or maybe you&#39;re talking about some sort of elite &quot;secret masters of the world&quot; type elite?  Illuminati or something.  Why wouldn&#39;t they exert their influence to reduce population in a sensible manner?  Why would they have let the situation get so out of control in the first place?  If they&#39;re so powerful, then why is the world so fucked up already?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that there aren&#39;t isolated groups or individuals in the world that probably would like to remove a large number of people from the earth.  I just don&#39;t think that they&#39;re the &quot;elites&quot;, as we think of them.  Probably more like a cult or insane scientist or something.  </p>

<li><p>An Individual vaguely perceives something is wrong in his/her life. This
takes the form of fatigue at trying to &quot;keep up&quot; with real or imaginary
crisis, encroachment of government into every aspect of life, increasing
taxation and so on.  Sometimes it takes the loss of work and the realization
that the safety net they contributed to has a gaping hole in the middle.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual discovers that justice is a joke and that all control
mechanisms go up like a pyramid, taking their property, taxes etc. with it.
This wealth then is distributed to &quot;help bail-out&quot; or &quot;prop-up&quot; &quot;failing&quot;
transnational corporations. Left-overs are channeled via Overseas
Developement Corporations to &quot;developing nations,&quot; where the loot is
pocketed by front-men and their beaurocrats. Crumbs filter down to social
services, which, after being guzzled by directors and staff, leave little for
the needy except bundles of forms, in triplicate, of course.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual looks around for others already exposing &quot;the
conspiracy.&quot;  These established champions inform him which &quot;conspiracy&quot; books to read. Having then done so, the individual begins to &quot;expose&quot; the
corruption, first to friends, then when friendless, he either publishes what
he has gleaned or becomes paranoid and withdraws from society
altogether.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Why does the waking-up process fail to spread quickly through society?</p>

<p><strong>1. He is terribly naive. He believes the massive corruption &quot;just happened&quot;
to begin in his own lifetime, otherwise mummy or daddy or teacher would
have warned him. It does not occur to him that his Parents, teachers etc.
were as conditioned as he was.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Most people do not wish to know. They, like farm animals, have been
domesticated. Wild animals (original) have natural instincts of self-preservation. They sense the evil intentions of predators and they survive
by trusting their instincts. Wild herds do not &quot;hang around&quot; when one or
more members drops dead. Specially bred sheep do.</p></li>
<li><p>Pavlovian conditioning/response indoctrination has been fed to every
individual, through schooling. The media then takes over. Peoples’
opinions are simply sound-bites from news, talk-shows or quotes from
glossy magazines.</p></li>
<li><p>Trust replaces the instinct of self-preservation. It over-rides memory
and logic. Controllers and shepherds encourage trust.</p></li>

<p>There is a critical mass of population that challenges the system of control.   A loose metaphor would be a critical mass of brain cells generating consciousness.   To prevent that critical mass it is logical to destroy agents (people) within the system to avoid an erasure of the status quo.     A <em>manageable</em> level of population is desirable to the elite.  </p>
