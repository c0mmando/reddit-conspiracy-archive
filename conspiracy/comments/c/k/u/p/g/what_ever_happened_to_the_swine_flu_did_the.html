<p>It remains very difficult, however, for the basic, individual personal consumer (like me) to know who to trust when.  This stems from very clear indications that news media and government agencies both operate with agendas other than truthful dissemination of important information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have (independent from you) thought of that conspiracy myself....</p>

<p>when 2 people think the same thing, does that make it even more plausible?</p>

<p>§edit§ i found it a little suspicious when the drug companies were absolved of all responsibility of possible negative effects of the vaccinations, supposedly due to there being &quot;not enough time to effectively study the vaccine&quot; due to demand. I found a WHO report stating just that, but i just can&#39;t find it again on my puter...will keep searching, but maybe someone else has it?</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> <a href="http://wikileaks.org/wiki/WHO:_Observations_on_Vaccine_Production_Technologies_and_Factors_Potentially_Influencing_Pandemic_Influenza_Vaccine_Choices_in_Developing_Countries,_2009">here is the WHO report</a>.  it&#39;s a long read, and repulsive at times, but it is oh-so-worth it!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1997, Donald Rumsfeld was appointed Chairman of the Board of Gilead Sciences, a company which a year earlier had developed ‘Tamiflu’, originally a drug for AIDS and later marketed as a vaccine for H5N1 avian flu. Upon becoming US Defence Secretary in 2001, he ordered $1 billion worth of Tamiflu to be bought and injected into US soldiers as a ‘precaution’. At the time, Rumsfeld was the principal stockholder of Gilead Sciences. Worse still, it later emerged that Tamiflu was not even effective as a H5N1 vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>tl;dr--shame on you, but here you go: Tamiflu=AIDS drug, later marketed as a flu vaccine. Rumsfeld ran the company that developed Tamiflu, then when appointed as Defence Secretary, injected soldiers with $1billion worth of Tamiflu. Later, turns out <strong>Tamiflu doesn&#39;t even work on the fricken flu!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even financial news networks like Bloomberg eventually reported that the swine flu epidemic was over exaggerated and the risk was nowhere near what the media was reporting.  Of course they came out and said this after swine flu related stock trading died down.  The word &quot;epidemic&quot; was redefined in recent years by the CDC and no longer needs to be used lightly.  </p>

<p>There are many doctors and nurses that refuse to take the shot because of the ingredients in the vaccine.  That reminds me of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYzXGk4XrGA#t=0m42s">this video</a>.  I don&#39;t like Alex Jones as much as I used to but he still has his moments, especially when he works with Jesse Ventura.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about the Flue is that the pandemics hit so far apart that we tend to forget how bad they are. The last big one came along right at the end of World War One and in two months it killed more people than had died during the war. Healthy people woke up and got the flue and died before sunset. It put the fear of god into the C.D.C. and they tend to react when the threat of another pandemic appears, as it recently did. I don’t fault them for wasting a couple hundred million every thirty years or so. When the next pandemic hits, and it may do so in our lifetime, you won’t hear people complaining there was too much vaccine on hand.</p>

FTFY.</p>

<p>You see, that&#39;s how flu vectors tend to operate. They hit hard and fast, and then a few months down the road pretty well everyone is immune, dead, or lucky to have never come into contact with it.
Swine flu was notable mostly because of whom it hit the hardest, viz. younger people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did anyone, before responding, consider the idea of actually getting some information? First off, Influenza season pretty much ends by summer and officially it runs from <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/update.htm#totalcases?s_cid=cs_074">Oct to May.</a> This is how it always works, not some special rule set up to fool you. Second, some <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates_2009_h1n1.htm">61 million</a> got sick from H1N1, 275,000 hospitalized, and some 12,000 killed. Third, did it ever occur to anyone here that if the vaccination program was successful, then the outbreak would be smaller? To put that another way, that we did not hear quite as much about how terrible H1N1 was was <em>because</em> people got vaccinated. </p>

<p>Influenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in the deaths of between &amp;250,000 and 500,000 people every year,[7] up to millions in some pandemic years. On average 41,400 people died each year in the United States between 1979 and 2001 from influenza</p>
