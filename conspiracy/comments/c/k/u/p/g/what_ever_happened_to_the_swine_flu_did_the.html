       The WHO changed the definition of
       <em>
        pandemic
       </em>
       to remove "a large number of deaths". (see wikipedia article on pandemic for refs)
      </p>
      <p>
       The world's governments had contractual obligations to buy vaccines from drug companies when a pandemic was declared.

       Drug companies got rich; governments got owned.

       The governments did not get owned, they were doing what they have been doing for some time now. Taking taxpayer dollars and giving it to huge corporations while they continue to cut infrastructure spending. When is the last time the government did something that benefited the people more than a corporation?

       I'd bet all my money that those governments (esp. US) planned this out with the companies by  - i don't know - lobbyists to pass some bill as you mentioned or the conspicuous stocks many bureaucrats have.

       It remains very difficult, however, for the basic, individual personal consumer (like me) to know who to trust when.  This stems from very clear indications that news media and government agencies both operate with agendas other than truthful dissemination of important information.

      </p>
      <p>
       when 2 people think the same thing, does that make it even more plausible?
      </p>
      <p>
       §edit§ i found it a little suspicious when the drug companies were absolved of all responsibility of possible negative effects of the vaccinations, supposedly due to there being "not enough time to effectively study the vaccine" due to demand. I found a WHO report stating just that, but i just can't find it again on my puter...will keep searching, but maybe someone else has it?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1997, Donald Rumsfeld was appointed Chairman of the Board of Gilead Sciences, a company which a year earlier had developed ‘Tamiflu’, originally a drug for AIDS and later marketed as a vaccine for H5N1 avian flu. Upon becoming US Defence Secretary in 2001, he ordered $1 billion worth of Tamiflu to be bought and injected into US soldiers as a ‘precaution’. At the time, Rumsfeld was the principal stockholder of Gilead Sciences. Worse still, it later emerged that Tamiflu was not even effective as a H5N1 vaccine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       tl;dr--shame on you, but here you go: Tamiflu=AIDS drug, later marketed as a flu vaccine. Rumsfeld ran the company that developed Tamiflu, then when appointed as Defence Secretary, injected soldiers with $1billion worth of Tamiflu. Later, turns out
       <strong>
        Tamiflu doesn't even work on the fricken flu!

       Wow, just wow!!!  Tamiflu is not, I repeat, is NOT a vaccine.  It has never been a vaccine.  It will never be a vaccine.  It is an anti-viral treatment found to shorten the duration of the flu.

       you know i was watching an episode of Saturday Night Live from the 2nd season (1976) yesterday and Chevy Chase was talking about swine flu and asking the same question on Weekend Update. The clip could be aired now and branded as new and no one would be able to tell that he's talking about 34 years ago....except that he looks so much younger that is

       Even financial news networks like Bloomberg eventually reported that the swine flu epidemic was over exaggerated and the risk was nowhere near what the media was reporting.  Of course they came out and said this after swine flu related stock trading died down.  The word "epidemic" was redefined in recent years by the CDC and no longer needs to be used lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many doctors and nurses that refuse to take the shot because of the ingredients in the vaccine.  That reminds me of

       It's making the loop. Like all of the other overly inflated epidemics, and manufactured ones for that matter, the assholes in charge used "swine flu" to scare us into vaccinations. It was a scare back in the 1970s too. I remember it from when I was a kid.

       The thing about the Flue is that the pandemics hit so far apart that we tend to forget how bad they are. The last big one came along right at the end of World War One and in two months it killed more people than had died during the war. Healthy people woke up and got the flue and died before sunset. It put the fear of god into the C.D.C. and they tend to react when the threat of another pandemic appears, as it recently did. I don’t fault them for wasting a couple hundred million every thirty years or so. When the next pandemic hits, and it may do so in our lifetime, you won’t hear people complaining there was too much vaccine on hand.

       The masses threatened to rebel over the "required" vaccinations, and the threat failed to materialize because it was just as much bullshit as the "power vacuum" that would supposedly develop if we abandoned Afghanistan.

       There was already a power vacuum created in Afghanistan in the early 90s when the Russians left. The direct results from that was the creation of the Taliban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now originally the Taliban was created to help the people of Afghanistan fight the territorial warlords (created by no governing force; Russians) but obviously it was eventually turned into what it is today.

       In a nutshell... it turned out it wasn't that bad of a flu.  You got and then you got over it.  The media reported
       <em>
        you're all gonna die!!!
       </em>
       when in reality it was more like
       <em>
        Your're all gonna sneeze... and feel crappy for a day.. then you'll be fine
       </em>
       unless you're old or pregnant or young... which by the way the regular flu kills just as equally well.

       i seem to remember being subjected to scare tactics to not take the vaccine (fema camps, fema coffins, immediate onset of autism, etc...).  none of that seems to have happened, either.  i agree that WHO overstated the pandemic, but i think many of those warning against the vaccine also overstated some of their positions.

       its also not flu season anymore. Even though H1N1 is not a "seasonal flu" it still does not spread as readily outside of flu season. Also it was always influenza, which, though dangerous, was never much of a threat to otherwise healthy people. Nor was it claimed to be by the WHO. People just flip the fuck out whenever a new disease starts killing people (eg: monkey pox, bird flu, SARS, mad cow etc)

       I think people weren't buying into it  fast enough so that particular depopulation plan failed. Plan B, the Corexit sprayed in the gulf comes back down and poisons people and vegetation instead. It's much more widespread and more involuntary. :)

       What ever happened to last year's flu? Did the pharmaceutical companies make enough money from the scare and just abandon the subject?
FTFY.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, that's how flu vectors tend to operate. They hit hard and fast, and then a few months down the road pretty well everyone is immune, dead, or lucky to have never come into contact with it.
Swine flu was notable mostly because of whom it hit the hardest, viz. younger people.

       The H1N1 scare occurred at a very convenient time to quench the possibility of civll unrest and disorder.    The Status Quo financially and politically was undergoing a major upheaval.   If I were a government, I could not think of a better time to pull out a drill practice.

       I would think that if they were running a scam off the swine flu hysteria, they would keep milking it until it died on it's own, rather than stop it before they've got all the money they can.

       Did anyone, before responding, consider the idea of actually getting some information? First off, Influenza season pretty much ends by summer and officially it runs from

        Oct to May.

       This is how it always works, not some special rule set up to fool you. Second, some

        61 million
       </a>
       got sick from H1N1, 275,000 hospitalized, and some 12,000 killed. Third, did it ever occur to anyone here that if the vaccination program was successful, then the outbreak would be smaller? To put that another way, that we did not hear quite as much about how terrible H1N1 was was

       Influenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in the deaths of between &amp;250,000 and 500,000 people every year,[7] up to millions in some pandemic years. On average 41,400 people died each year in the United States between 1979 and 2001 from influenza

       You would be amazed at how many people in this subreddit told me that influenza was not deadly, that the whole idea was made up. Yes, it looks like H1N1 did not hit as hard as feared. In part because they did react to the hot spots. But information, yours and mine, are our friend. I got some data, you got some data, we can look at the real world. The rest of the people who responded here did so by assuming the evil conspiracy and asserting that the evidence fit. 12K deaths is not as bad as 41K, but neither is it a nothing to ignore.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         You unwrap Christmas gifts very carefully, so you can save and reuse the wrapping (and especially those bows) next year.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You only buy Christmas cards after Christmas, when they are 50% off.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When there is a sale on toilet paper, you buy 100 rolls and store them in your closet or in the bedroom of an adult child who has moved out.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You have a vinyl table cloth on your kitchen table.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your stove is covered with aluminum foil.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Your kitchen has a sticky film of grease over it.
