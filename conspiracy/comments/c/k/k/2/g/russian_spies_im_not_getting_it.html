       This whole thing sounds a bit ridiculous to me. If anyone here has a better grasp of what's going on I would really appreciate some insight. Why are they calling them spies, what exactly were they spying on? Nothing in the news is giving me any real info.

       If anything, the lack of an attention-span in the American public will move the attention elsewhere on its own.

       Russia hasn't denied these guys, and the timing of the arrests was allegedly due to the financier leaving the country.

       There are literally tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of 'couples' in the USA who do for Israel what these Russians are alleged to have been doing for Russia.

       Hell, if any country wants information about the USA and its 'secrets', it can get all it wants, and more, right here at reddit and at other web sites.

       No kidding. Who needs to be spies like this when you have the internet forums and places like reddit. Nowadays to be real spy you have to infiltrate a highly secure environment that guards very high priority information/technology/intelligence or groups. Anything else is pretty laughable if you have an internet connection.

       Now that I think about it.  Trying to influence american policy and politics is well within the rights of a legal immigrant.  And even getting to government secrets could be considered investigative reporting and/or whistleblowing.

       Well it's probably much different in Israel's case since information flows much more freely between the US and Israel between regular citizens, they wouldn't need spies for the purpose of infiltrating American society.

       I'm just pointing out what is true.  I'm not really interested in judging or condemning anyone.  Hell, I myself am constantly telling people in the USA how good the beer is in Belgium, right down to which city each brand is brewed in.  Then there's the chocolate.  Same thing.  And you don't see the Belgian government (whatever that means these days) coming after me for giving away information that could undermine Belgium's national security.  Of course not.

       I suppose this sounds more like it. Although it seems like the only thing these people could have spied on were their neighbors and r/conspiracy.  I don't know if my expectations were too high but I thought the KGB had more sophisticated ways of collecting intelligence.

       No. These just had a careless operative who accidentally exposed the rest of his cell. There are undoubtedly more experienced, careful, intelligent, powerful spies still out there.

       There are all kinds of spies out there and there always will be. That's why I think that if they are discovered it makes more sense to build long term relationships with them, to gain intelligence and leverage instead of jailing them, unless there are other motives or threats.

       Rather than feed them disinformation to send back to Russia, or try to flip them into double agents, they were arrested. Either they were unflippable, they were cut loose by Russia, the Russians figured out they were getting disinformation and changed their actions forcing the FBI to act, or there was more direct threat.  Revealing them for political reasons during a time of "amicable behavior" between Russia and the US doesn't make a lot of sense.

       I didn't mean it had to be just political, but in this case I am suspicious about the timing. Can't they at least time when they reveal them? "Amicable behavior" doesn't really mean anything in politics where all interaction is driven by agenda.

       Interesting. It's the simple common behavior that we take for granted that they are so divorced from. I usually think of spying in terms of gaining intelligence on elite crowds, but your comment made me realize that it's just as important to have a grasp on what goes on in common daily life.

       If you liked that your gonna love this. I don't know how much you know about the cold war but, The Foreign Office was riddled with double agents. So was the KGB. The elites on both sides all knew each other very very well. Contrary to popular belief there where mega rich people in the USSR, not just party hierachy. They spied on their own common people just as much as they spied on other countries. Why? Because elites are, as you say divorced from common daily life. Irrespective of which side they outwardly represent.

       This is what actually immediately came as a question into my mind after I posted my reply to your last comment. Then I wondered, what would be the best way to spy on everyone without drawing any suspicions and without having to hire any actual spies, and I answered, set up a multinational corporation!
      </p>
      <p>
       I already know you say it's PR BS, but what do you suspect is the reason behind this sudden upheaval of Russian spies?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: After further consideration, I think this could have been done in jest, to make Obama look bad, or some higher ups just don't want an amicable relationship with Russia for whatever political reasons.

       Firstly , efficiency does not come into intel or counterintel. It's irrelevent.
Secondly, in intel , black is white, left is right, up is down. I person can go crazy looking at the wheres and why fores of intel operations. I will skip all the obvious motives and just pick out a couple of juicy ones cause I like them. USA and Russia are closer than you think, intel ops do bridge huge gaps in knowledge. Spooks often just as valuable to both sides. Therefore giving these people up as it appears they where by fumbling, aids cooperation. Second theory and this is gonna be a strech for the uninitiated, Russia are protecting someone, they got people much higher that could have sacrificed them to take off any heat.

        “The FBI must have been clapping its collective hands when it discovered the primitive radio techniques the Russians were using: high-speed ‘burst transmissions,’” writes SpyTalk’s Jeff Stein. “The Cold War-era technique requires the sending party to record a coded Morse code message on a tape, then shoot it through the air in a millisecond. They were easy picking for the FBI, once it knew where to listen.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to the FBI, bugs in the spies’ homes picked up “the irregular electronic clicking sounds associated with the receipt of coded radio transmissions.”

       You set it all up and send out your agents in the 80s/early 90s.  After that it's not so easy to change the fieldcraft in use -- and not worth it if they are low-value assets.

       Well it's probably much different in Israel's case since information flows much more freely between the US and Israel between regular citizens, they wouldn't need spies for the purpose of infiltrating American society.

       No kidding. Who needs to be spies like this when you have the internet forums and places like reddit. Nowadays to be real spy you have to infiltrate a highly secure environment that guards very high priority information/technology/intelligence or groups. Anything else is pretty laughable if you have an internet connection.
