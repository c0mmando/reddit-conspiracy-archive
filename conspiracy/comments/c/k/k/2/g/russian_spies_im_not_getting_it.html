    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just pointing out what is true.  I&#39;m not really interested in judging or condemning anyone.  Hell, I myself am constantly telling people in the USA how good the beer is in Belgium, right down to which city each brand is brewed in.  Then there&#39;s the chocolate.  Same thing.  And you don&#39;t see the Belgian government (whatever that means these days) coming after me for giving away information that could undermine Belgium&#39;s national security.  Of course not.  </p>

<p>And if I want to send $10 to my niece in Gaza, that should be OK, right?  But, hell no.  That would make me a traitor, according to <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2010/06/rep-sherman-prosecute-u-s-citizens-involved-with-gaza-flotilla.html">some US lawmakers</a> (who happen to be Jewish).</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mean it had to be just political, but in this case I am suspicious about the timing. Can&#39;t they at least time when they reveal them? &quot;Amicable behavior&quot; doesn&#39;t really mean anything in politics where all interaction is driven by agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you liked that your gonna love this. I don&#39;t know how much you know about the cold war but, The Foreign Office was riddled with double agents. So was the KGB. The elites on both sides all knew each other very very well. Contrary to popular belief there where mega rich people in the USSR, not just party hierachy. They spied on their own common people just as much as they spied on other countries. Why? Because elites are, as you say divorced from common daily life.

<blockquote>

<p>This is what actually immediately came as a question into my mind after I posted my reply to your last comment. Then I wondered, what would be the best way to spy on everyone without drawing any suspicions and without having to hire any actual spies, and I answered, set up a multinational corporation!</p>

<p>I already know you say it&#39;s PR BS, but what do you suspect is the reason behind this sudden upheaval of Russian spies? </p>

<p>edit: After further consideration, I think this could have been done in jest, to make Obama look bad, or some higher ups just don&#39;t want an amicable relationship with Russia for whatever political reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly , efficiency does not come into intel or counterintel. It&#39;s irrelevent.
Secondly, in intel , black is white, left is right, up is down. I person can go crazy looking at the wheres and why fores of intel operations. I will skip all the obvious motives and just pick out a couple of juicy ones cause I like them. USA and Russia are closer than you think, intel ops do bridge huge gaps in knowledge. Spooks often just as valuable to both sides. Therefore giving these people up as it appears they where by fumbling, aids cooperation. Second theory and this is gonna be a strech for the uninitiated, Russia are protecting someone, they got people much higher that could have sacrificed them to take off any heat. </p>

<p>“The FBI must have been clapping its collective hands when it discovered the primitive radio techniques the Russians were using: high-speed ‘burst transmissions,’” writes SpyTalk’s Jeff Stein. “The Cold War-era technique requires the sending party to record a coded Morse code message on a tape, then shoot it through the air in a millisecond. They were easy picking for the FBI, once it knew where to listen.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the FBI, bugs in the spies’ homes picked up “the irregular electronic clicking sounds associated with the receipt of coded radio transmissions.”</p>
