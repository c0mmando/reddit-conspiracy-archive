<p>Dear fake environment forum new right wing nut censor moderators,</p>

<p>Thank you for proving the point. No, I will not kiss your ass.</p>

<p>How about this? You kiss my ass and apologize since you have now admitted doing exactly what I suspected you of doing - censoring stories and not allowing redditors to up vote or down on their own and doing so even more unless you &quot;liked&quot; the person.</p>

<p>If you are lucky i will post to your censored fake environment forum but until then i will continue to draw the readers attention to your censorship and I will post stories to nonemail censored forums until no one believes that the fake environment forum you run is a real forum at all. It is just a fake distraction run to maintain the appearance of breaking real stories while in fact blocking the most important ones. You are the fox news of environmental news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I&#39;ve had the almost same discussion with qgyh2 in WorldNews where he is also a moderator. In that case they wanted to censor stories critical to Israel.</p>

<p>I was also told that there is a spam filter, but that is actually not true, they just hide behind that. They have a ban list where they can put you.</p>

<p>The best thing you can do is to write to one or more of the admins, not the moderators. I have written to hueypriest which is a nice guy. I think we have enough on qgyh2 to throw him out now.</p>

<p>this whole moderation thing is NOT how it used to be before it was sold to Conde Naste.</p>

<p>anyone could post anything easily and the crowd quickly ranked stories.</p>

<p>even now there are still afew places that moderators let people be cleared to post without censoring or email registration - like conspiracy (thanks )</p>

<p>Half of these posts complain about your spamming, blatant violation of rediquette, sockpuppeting (even whole dialogues between alt-accounts) etc.</p>

<p>Maybe we don&#39;t get the whole story here? My guess: The spam filter caught your submission (happens all the time, just message the mods without sounding like a dick), you got paranoid and immediately accused the mods of censorship.</p>

<p>edit: The incident i am referring to happened about 10 months ago. Georedd created a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/98ays/looks_like_the_hacks_are_downvoting_georedd_in_a/c0bs2rg">sockpuppet account</a> (purpleduck2) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9pwjh/one_of_the_best_comments_on_the_problem_of/">to promote his own ramblings</a>. With that account he now opened a new subreddit where he apparently <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/environmentnoemail/comments/cjzl0/thank_you_this_is_so_needed_look_at_the_hassle_i/">talks to himself</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually it isn&#39;t &quot;their reddit&quot;</p>

<p>this is not yahoogroups.
or at least it USED to not be.</p>

<p>It clearly is evolving into a less convenient from of yahoogroups.</p>

<p>reddit WAS about unlimited story linking that were then voted up or down by the readers - not premoderatoed or censored.</p>

<p>it is why reddit got so popular and why the posting rate is going down and popularitiy is dropping so rapdily.
i suspect conde Naste will have successfully killed it as any true outlet for uncensored citizen posting within the year.</p>

<p>it will appear to still be there but the same kind of expose content will not be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First lesson of the internet: Never fight with the mods. It&#39;s pointless and annoys the mods. Always be superpolite to them. You can&#39;t MAKE them do anything. Except make what you post disappear. </p>

<p>On a sidenote to any admin who cares. Sometimes the spam filter is being used to censor more than spam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the spam filter is a pretty oversensitive piece of software and doesn&#39;t catch just spam. i submit quite a lot to <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> and almost every fourth story gets caught, even from well known domains like bbc.co.uk or spiegel.de. a nice little message to the moderators <em>always</em> cleared it up. one mod told me that it&#39;s been accepted as necessary that non-spam has to be set free by the mods again (so that the spam filter software doesn&#39;t become toothless by trying to avoid all false positives). so don&#39;t assume conspiracy right away and contact the mods. </p>
