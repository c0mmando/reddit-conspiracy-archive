       Dear fake environment forum new right wing nut censor moderators,
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for proving the point. No, I will not kiss your ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this? You kiss my ass and apologize since you have now admitted doing exactly what I suspected you of doing - censoring stories and not allowing redditors to up vote or down on their own and doing so even more unless you "liked" the person.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are lucky i will post to your censored fake environment forum but until then i will continue to draw the readers attention to your censorship and I will post stories to nonemail censored forums until no one believes that the fake environment forum you run is a real forum at all. It is just a fake distraction run to maintain the appearance of breaking real stories while in fact blocking the most important ones. You are the fox news of environmental news.

       Interesting. I've had the almost same discussion with qgyh2 in WorldNews where he is also a moderator. In that case they wanted to censor stories critical to Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was also told that there is a spam filter, but that is actually not true, they just hide behind that. They have a ban list where they can put you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing you can do is to write to one or more of the admins, not the moderators. I have written to hueypriest which is a nice guy. I think we have enough on qgyh2 to throw him out now.

       well only recently.

       this whole moderation thing is NOT how it used to be before it was sold to Conde Naste.

      <p>
       anyone could post anything easily and the crowd quickly ranked stories.

       even now there are still afew places that moderators let people be cleared to post without censoring or email registration - like conspiracy (thanks )

       I was trying to say that in the context of "importance" dubstep is not a high level. Therefore would not be subject to such shenanigans. But since i'm claiming this about reddit i feel my argument is pointless.

       You can read on new. It allows you to get a raw feed, before it's censored. True, you can't get what you think is interesting out to a lot of people anymore. But you can stay informed yourself.

       sure take a look at how much the reddit communtiy hated my health industry postings. They hated it so much that they voted them to the all time top ten list of net upvotes and total upvotes  (where it was promptly censored and no longer appears in all time top ten even those  entries with far fewer votes appear there)

       actually it isn't "their reddit"

       this is not yahoogroups.
or at least it USED to not be.

       It clearly is evolving into a less convenient from of yahoogroups.

       reddit WAS about unlimited story linking that were then voted up or down by the readers - not premoderatoed or censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is why reddit got so popular and why the posting rate is going down and popularitiy is dropping so rapdily.
i suspect conde Naste will have successfully killed it as any true outlet for uncensored citizen posting within the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       it will appear to still be there but the same kind of expose content will not be.
      </p>

       f non of this matters to you then you don't understand what reddit was or the importance of uncensored posting.

       the spam filter is a pretty oversensitive piece of software and doesn't catch just spam. i submit quite a lot to
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and almost every fourth story gets caught, even from well known domains like bbc.co.uk or spiegel.de. a nice little message to the moderators
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       cleared it up. one mod told me that it's been accepted as necessary that non-spam has to be set free by the mods again (so that the spam filter software doesn't become toothless by trying to avoid all false positives). so don't assume conspiracy right away and contact the mods.
