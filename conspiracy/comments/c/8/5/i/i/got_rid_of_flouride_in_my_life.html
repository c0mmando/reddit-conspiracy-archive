       Very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually knew a fellow (many years deceased) who worked as a metallurgist for some of these big aluminum and steel producers. He loved to talk about the fluoride issue. He'd laugh about it and say that "of course fluoride is good for you! It better be, because there's no way to get rid of it." That is to say that he knew that fluoride pollution was a byproduct of the aluminum industry and that they manufactured this idea that somehow fluoride is good for you because there wasn't any way to get rid of the pollution the industry was causing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't know that fluoride was also a byproduct of atomic weapon production, but that also puts some things into perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of disturbing that after so many decades this isn't common knowledge. Such is the death grip of industry on the hearts and minds of the American public.

       up to a certain dose it's an essential mineral, causing caries when lacking. to put it in drinking water is a very blunt approach to provide a supply for the population and can lead to overdosage with several bad side effects.
a better approach are either supplements in pill form, especially at an early age or as additive for salt.

       I would think that the amount in toothpaste would we more than ample. I imagine that it still gets absorbed to your bloodstream that way, but I can't say that for sure. According to
       <a href="http://www.vitamins-nutrition.org/vitamins/fluoride.html">
        this
       </a>
       (which has some interesting facts, btw) salt, calcium and magnesium will bind to fluoride and block the absorption of it in our bodies. Either way, it seems that most of the studies that have been done on fluoride were done before it was added to toothpaste. Very small children have a difficult time with toothpaste, of course, but they also have baby teeth. It isn't really necessary to keep those teeth flawless. They are going to fall out and be replaced by adult teeth at some point!

       Fluoride is fine topically (ie in toothpaste), in water it is bad.  A by product of phosphate fertilizer manufacturing and/or metal smelting, what goes in our water is 90% of the time, literally an industrial waste.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is little benefit to consuming it (as far as I can tell).  Check cavity levels by country and cross reference by use of fluoride or not.. I dare you to find a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also worth noting, it is basically only english speaking countries that fluoridate.

       Toothpaste is not topical.  There is significant sublingual and oral ingestion of the chemical through the use of toothpaste.

       Perhaps.  I don't actually know for sure what amount of fluoride we typically absorb.  I have done a lot of meta-research into the dangers of chronic fluoride exposure, and have no come across anything that supports the 'sublingual' part of your statement, though it wouldn't surprise me either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride is highly active and quick to bond.  It really likes the hydroxy-apatite your teeth and bones are made of, which not coincidentally is how it makes your teeth harder (and therefore less prone to decay from the acid which is a byproduct of the bacteria growing in your mouth).
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there is something like 2000x as much fluoride in toothpaste as there is in water, and you are bound to swallow a tiny bit of it at least.. but I think that in fluoridated areas the exposure you receive from
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the water you drink which is fluoridated
       </li>
       <li>
        everything cooked in or with the fluoridated water
       </li>
       <li>
        everything grown with fluoridated water
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       far surpasses the exposure from toothpaste that you aren't swallowing.

       You may have a different definition of 'virtually the whole western world' but although fluoridated salt is done in lieu of water in some countries, many western countries don't fluoridate at all:

      <p>
       Austria has never implemented fluoridation.

      <p>
       Czech Republic
Fluoridated in the past, no longer fluoridates, fluoridated salt is availble.

       The truth is that fluoride has a long shady history as a toxic chemical that goes all the way back to the Manhattan Project. Declassified documents show that scientists like the Manhattan Project's chief toxicologist Harold Hodge were ordered to cover up the dangers of toxins like fluoride in order to prevent lawsuits against the Pentagon and military contractors. Later Harold Hodge was a leading promoter of fluoride and appeared in education films in a white smock spelling out on a blackboard that fluoride is both safe and effective in preventing tooth cavities. The research to support such claims came from scientists like Gerald Cox of the Mellon Institute, who also argued on behalf of asbestos, and Robert Kehoe of the Ketting Laboratory, who also defended lead. Such "science for hire" was financed by corporations, and the skewed findings were used as ammunition for the Fluorine Lawyers Committee of litigators who defended the industry in lawsuits. Dr. Leonard Weinstein of Cornell University said in 1983: "Certainly there has been more litigation on alleged damage to agriculture by fluoride than all other pollutants combined." "

       Low levels of fluoride does cause headaches in some people....but even if you avoid the toothpaste and water almost everything you buy at the grocery store was processed with fluoridated water and is full of fluoride. Hell, the hydroponic tomatoes were probably grown with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've distilled my water for years, but since I still eat things made with fluoridated water, it only helps part of the problem. If only we could get it out of our food.

       You should also know that if you're in a fluoridated area, there is really nothing you can do to avoid it.  That bread you're eating, that rice, that pasta, that pizza, etc etc etc.. all has fluoride from the water used to make it.

       I used non-fluoride tooth paste for about 10 years and my teeth never rotted (any more than they hadn't already). The last 5 years I've been to the dentist, he compliments on the lack of plaque on my teeth and proper mainenance, despite the fact I only brush once a day. I'm not saying fluoride doesn't prevent against rotting teeth but it doesn't help as much as you would think.

       It's long term rotting. Like if you never used fluoride in your tooth paste, your teeth would be looking pretty bad at age 40.

       Your teeth are made of apatite (lol) which is Ca10(PO4)6 and either two (OH) or two F. When you drink water among many other things, the your teeth (apatite) are dominated by OH. When you brush your teeth  you replace the OH with F and that makes your teeth more resistant to the acids produced in your mouth and the acids that may get up from your stomach. I've done the calculations in thermodynamics. It's true.

       How are teeth made of EITHER one thing or the other? Because fluoridation replaces the natural elements of your teeth? Besides, you're probably talking about CALCIUM Fluoride, which is found naturally, while the fluoride found in fluoridated water and toothpaste is SODIUM fluoride, found in aluminium and fertilizer factory smoke stack scrubbers, and uranium centrifuges. There is no correlation between fluoridated water and dental carries.

       I didn't say that. Teeth are not homogeneous. You should learn about "ion exchange" because you seem to be lacking in knowledge about that subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sodium fluoride is broken down, the whole NaF is not put into the chemical equation of your teeth. It makes no sense that you point out that it is SODIUM fluoride as you spit out the Ca and the Na anyways because they are both broken down in your mouth. The F goes into your teeth

       Perhaps.  I don't actually know for sure what amount of fluoride we typically absorb.  I have done a lot of meta-research into the dangers of chronic fluoride exposure, and have no come across anything that supports the 'sublingual' part of your statement, though it wouldn't surprise me either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride is highly active and quick to bond.  It really likes the hydroxy-apatite your teeth and bones are made of, which not coincidentally is how it makes your teeth harder (and therefore less prone to decay from the acid which is a byproduct of the bacteria growing in your mouth).
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there is something like 2000x as much fluoride in toothpaste as there is in water, and you are bound to swallow a tiny bit of it at least.. but I think that in fluoridated areas the exposure you receive from
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the water you drink which is fluoridated
       </li>
       <li>
        everything cooked in or with the fluoridated water
       </li>
       <li>
        everything grown with fluoridated water
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       far surpasses the exposure from toothpaste that you aren't swallowing.
