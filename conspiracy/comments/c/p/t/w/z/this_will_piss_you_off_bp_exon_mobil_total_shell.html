        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is for people in Europe &amp; USA. Without these three companies you wouldn&#39;t have cheap petrol readily avaliable alongside highways/roads. Thus meaning you wouldn&#39;t get anywhere. The high corporation tax they pay and the tax charged on top of the produced price funds many projects in their repsective nations. Health, Security, etc would need to be cut back if they were ever to disappear. They employ hundreds of thousands of people, who pay tax and consume in their respective nations. Pension funds receive dividends/income from these companies and rely on their share price for growth. The whole economy would come to a crashing halt if restrictions were placed on these companies.</p>

<p>Now before the liberal environmental nuts go crazy and start banging on about the gulf spill let me make thing one clear. Oil is natural. Yes it will kill alot in the short term but if you go up to Alaska where Exon Mobilses last spill was life has returned to normal because oil is bio degradable. The victims are getting paid. If not then governments will force those companies to pay. </p>

<p>SO ALL IN ALL MY CONCLUSION IS OUR LIVES WOULD BE MUCH THE POORER/ THRID WORLD STANDARD IF EVER WE WERE TO LOOSE THESE OIL COMPANIES. REMEMBER THAT NEXT TIME YOU POST SOME RIDICULOUS ARTICLE ON BP&#39;S NEW SUPERWEAPON ETC ETC. </p>

<p>I WILL ENJOY THE HARRASSMENT. CO2 is not a pollutant it breeds life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;moral&quot; ? By that logic, it&#39;s moral if i shoot lots of people while at the same time providing jobs, healthcare and giving money to charity. (No, i&#39;m not saying BP etc. kill people, merely using it as an example of moral != bad actions being countered by good actions.)</p>

<p>Besides which, cheap petrol, employment, pension funds and the economy have little if nothing to do with morality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they do have something to do with morality. If we didn&#39;t burn fossil fuels in order to transport food around countries, have electricity, keep your house warm then you would be living in poverty. Access to fossil fuels is neccessary at this moment in history to keep humans alive. </p>

<p>Cheap Petrol - that allows goods to moved around the country, fresh food etc.</p>

<p>Employment - keeps people active, provides them with income which they spend, drags them out of poverty, in turn creates thousands more jobs for people who supply their lifestyle.</p>

<p>Pension Funds - I don&#39;t own a pension fund, i have never got turned on by the idea of giving my money to someone else to manage but their are plenty of people who do - this ultimately props up the stock market, whether you like it or not. But mainly it provides an income for old people - this is key as if they didn&#39;t have this income then you and i will be paying for their care and living costs - bash the price of BP shares and you bash the pensions - bash the dividend and you bash the pensioners - i don&#39;t like it but it is a FUCKING FACT!</p>

<p>Economy - the economy is not moral i never send it was - some parts of it are some are not - but this is too big a subject to cover.</p>

<p>BP is moral it allows us to get on with our daily lives - yes we should invest in alternative engery etc etc but we are - YOU CALL THEM SCUMBAGS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OFF AND THE CARS STOP MOVING AND PLANES DONT FLY - i know i&#39;ll send the world population to you</p>

</blockquote>

<p>What? Where did that come from? I don&#39;t recall calling them scumbads, merely that you cannot call their actions &#39;moral&#39;. Stop inferring and start reading. </p>

<p>As for the rest, again what you stated is not morality. It might be the only way we can live at the moment, but that doesn&#39;t make it moral. What moral, exactly, is being taught here? Use every scrap of resource and pollute the earth so humanity can carry on living its unsustainable and, some would say, decedant lifestyle? All you have stated is how things are, and have offered no actual (tho you may have thought you have) case for why the current state is moral. </p>

<p>Pensions do provide for old people, it&#39;s a clever system which was needed as life expectancy grew longer and longer. It&#39;s not moral. However, it is IMmoral to take the pensions away from those people unless a suitable alternative can be found. Which is what i believe you were trying to argue in the sentence which ended with a capitalised &#39;fucking&#39;. </p>

<p>Cheap petrol indeed moves things not only around the country but around the world. Still it is not moral, it is business. I cannot imagine that even if petrol was completely free that they would willing move the goods if it wasn&#39;t profitable. </p>

<p>Employment. Yes, i must agree with you here. I do believe that the ideal of providing employment is moral, for the resaons you stated. However it highly depends on who is providing the jobs. Was Enron moral for hiking up the price of electricity by creating artificial rolling blackouts in California during the height of summer merely because they employed people? </p>

<p>What you seem to be dancing around is a large &#39;ends justify the means&#39; argument. Using that you can argue just about anything, even such things as mass depopulation so that we may &#39;maintain our current lifestyle&#39;. </p>

<p>Just to reiterate: I am not saying anything more than debating your use of the word &#39;moral&#39;. Every fact you have stated, to the best of my knowledge, is correct. They do provide us with x, y and z necessary to our current lifestyles. This does not make them moral. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree, they are the main opponents of better fuel efficiency and have a vested interest in oil so alternative power sources like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Oz-Hydrogen-Dual-Fuel-Cell/dp/B001ERE568">WATER</a> or Cold Fusion are widely available but not used. If it weren&#39;t for these scumbags we&#39;d be living in a Utopian society with cheap energy let alone the Gulf Coast Disaster.</p>

<p>Think of oil as a drug and The Globalists as the dealer, they <strong>WANT</strong> us to consume as much energy and devastate the earth in the path of fueling our energy goals and bring us to the brink to then say that humanity needs to be saved and drastic measures need to be taken to save the planet and use that as an excuse to treat us like animals. A Utopian society could be achieved if we used many of the alternative energies making use of carbon taxes an idea of the past.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you have ever seen <strong>The Day the Earth Stood Still</strong> you might remember this conversation:</p>

<p>Professor: <em>&quot;There must be alternatives. You must have some technology that can solve our problem.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Klaatu:* &quot;The problem is not technology. The problem is you. You lack the will to change.&quot;*</p>

<p>Professor: <em>&quot;Then help us change...&quot;</em></p>

<p>Klaatu: <em>&quot;I cannot change your nature. You treat the world as you treat eachother.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Professor: <em>&quot;But every civilization reaches a crisis point eventually. [...] Only when your world was threatened 
with destruction that you became what you are now.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Klaatu: <em>&quot;Yes.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Professor: <em>&quot;Well, that&#39;s where we are. You say we&#39;re on the brink of destruction, and you are right. But it&#39;s only on the brink that people find the will to change. Only at the precipice do we evolve.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>utopian society - how do you think one will live in a utopian society? You can never have the perfect society as there is always room for improvement. Oil is one of the cheapest forms of energy, that is why we use it and pump it on a grand scale - 85 million barrels a day - do you not think that if cold fusion and water power etc was discovered people would be using it now? the richest country in the world will be the one who discovers this miracle. You call them scumbags - maybe the boards of those companies are but the hundreds of thousands who work for them are not. The board members are like politicans you have to be evil and a lying bastard when your at the top, you wouldn&#39;t of got their any other way. </p>

<p>Gulf coast is a disaster, but if it wasn&#39;t for BP then you would be on a bike or a horse. There are a billion people without electricity or means of adequate transport. If you are willing to give up all those luxuries you take for granted by getting rid of this &#39;evil&#39; &#39;scumbag&#39; companies then fair enough but me as an individual I want those luxuries and want my family to have those luxuries too. </p>

<p>So yea BP is a moral company end of!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if you got the memo, but <em>energy is free</em> - it comes from the sky, even grows on trees.  More work has been put into metering it than evolving the harvesting of it.  Yes, it might take some work to convert it into usable form, but energy is everywhere.  Burning fuel is what cavemen did and we&#39;re still doing it - because you can easily meter it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how do you plan on paying for all the materials, labour, shipping costs, needed to extract it, convert it and have it nicely pumped to your home or gas station?</p>

<p>You have to pay for the fuel and no one is going to do it without a profit, it wouldn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Cavemen did burn fuel, but they went out and gathered the wood, stored it, dried it, then a load of them sat around getting fires started, then some chap had to keep it going. I think this is what we call labour. And ultimately as labour is taking time away from you, the person doing the labour would like something in return. In the caveman&#39;s existence that would be survival - he does his labour and he is warm and can cook food on it. His life expenctancy goes as he isn&#39;t eating raw meat and freezing his balls off. </p>

<p>BP does this for us everyday. So we pay BP a sum of money for the privillege. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure every corporation should be paying tax. Just because oil companies also do doesn&#39;t make them any more moral.</p>

<p>They employ hundreds of thousands of people, who pay tax...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this assuming that a renewable energy wont employ hundreds of thousands of people?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Oil maybe natural and biodegradable but our fabricated extraction of the oil is an unnatural process. The mistake was BP fault not a natural occurrence from earth.</p>

<p>Yeah just like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill#Litigation_and_cleanup_costs">Exxon paid with the Valdez oil spill lol.</a> </p>

<p>Just because you get some money doesn&#39;t make everything rainbows and roses. To some people money isn&#39;t their ideal solution. Also how will they support themselves before they get paid?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...OUR LIVES WOULD BE MUCH THE POORER/ THRID WORLD STANDARD IF EVER WE WERE TO LOOSE THESE OIL COMPANIES</p>

<p>This is probably very true but it begs to ask another question. Maybe our lives are <em>too dependant</em> on oil? Losing those companies would be bad but shouldn&#39;t we be decreasing our dependency on them before these corporations have us at their mercy? (or maybe they already do?)</p>

<p>no doubt they made a massive error in the gulf but it is just human error - i&#39;m damm sure if they could of gone back in time to stop this from happening they would - it has cost them 2.5 billion so far and have put asside 10 billion to cover the damages - that&#39;s alot of moolaaa</p>

<p>unfortuanately for the people affected by it yes you are right money doesn&#39;t sove anything but if they wish to live in a country with all the benefits oil bring then society has to take the rough with the smooth</p>

<p>our lives are dependent on oil no doubt but show me the alternative! we should spend the 18 billion, the uk government spends every year on reducing co2 emmisions (which is bollocks), on alternative energy research that is the key to getting mankind off oil - but that won&#39;t happen in my lifetime </p>

<p>Oil companies are moral because they support our livestyle and allow us to get on with our lives happily. One major spill doesn&#39;t deflect from the key role they play in society.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall I said I support removing all oil company jobs like you said but anyways ignoring that and the fact that an alternative energy source can create new jobs I have trouble understanding your point.</p>

<p>How can you perceive losing our dependency on oil and leaving people without a job as being a negative effect, yet people losing jobs in the gulf and getting sick you dismiss as a neutral inevitable circumstance?</p>

<p>It seams rather contradicting! </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think what you&#39;re trying to say is that oil companies shouldn&#39;t be considered evil just because of the gulf oil spill as they still play a large role in society supporting our lifestyles.</p>

<p>It is true that we would lose our quality of life if these oil companies no longer existed and because they have the ability to change our lifestyle they gain vast amounts of power. </p>

<p>It seams from what you have written that you defend these oil companies having this huge influence on our lifestyle and you see oil companies having good morals to allow us to live this way.</p>

<p>Ideally we want to decrease our dependancy on oil so that these companies will lose their power over holding together our lifestyle and also if one of these companies fucks up again we don&#39;t all crash with them.</p>

<p>The problem as some see it in this subreddit (in which i think your topic is referring to) is that a corporation shouldn&#39;t have this much influence on our lifestyle and being profit driven they may not make decisions that favour humanity and nature but instead their wallets. So some may see these corporations negatively rather then some awesome company as you seam to put it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re right--it <em>does</em> p1ss me off...</p>

<p>how foolish does one have to be to <em>not</em> see that Big Energy has <em>stifled</em> and <em>thwarted</em> alternative energies--simply to implement a nefariously monopolized bottom-line and artificial, Conspiratorial scarcity...artificial and Conspiratorial because a dependence on current forms carbon fuels, for example, is based on lying, cheating and even <em>killing</em>through the very thwarting mentioned above...</p>

<p>And with regard to your statements of the victims being paid....thats a joke.  Clearly you live nowhere near the gulf coast, and have no effing clue what is really going on down here.  Shame on you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it better to bitch and moan or contribute ideas mannerly? It&#39;s not your fault you&#39;d be out of a job it&#39;d be your companies dependencies fault, in this case the oil industry. What everyone is talking about is not a overnight solution, no one is stupid enough to think it&#39;ll work that way everything that is being done is being invested into and researched at the moment, you both act like there&#39;s gonna be a switch and everything you know will gone..I mean chill out, we are talking about preventing shit like this from happening again in the future and by the time a pure oil dependent-less world is established you may be in a different job, either way its YOUR responsibility to take your skills elsewhere, not societies shift in how they feel about a particular companies service to look after you. Honestly go get another job lined up if you&#39;re so afraid of the &quot;sudden&quot; loss of your job over the span of years and announcements in the adaption of new energy sources.</p>

<p>And so I get from each of your reasonings that all of a sudden there are now &quot;evil enviournmentalists?&quot; Many people and companies throughout the decades have pushed for new energy sources but once they were established they were crushed under the thumb of the oil industry through lobbying and bribes, destroying the electric car in the 80&#39;s (Google &quot;who killed the electric car&quot;) and hiding known hydrogen fueled cars that we had even in the 60&#39;s (Jay Leno I believe has it in his collection) This shit is not new.</p>

<p>And for this OP to say &quot;meh its no biggie guys oil is biodegradable, ill lose my job if we get rid of it.&quot; I am at a loss of words but can only say that I and hundreds of thousands of people will lose their fucking home because of this, this is not a &quot;it&#39;ll go away&quot; situation, the magnitude of this catastrophe is so that not even IBM computer simulations can predict the spread and the sheer devastation this will cause when it hits the Gulf Stream coast, killing water supplies, animals, and industrial services, the list goes on. No more will I be able to go the the everglades and enjoy the  unique natural swamp marvel that is only known to this continent (goodbye Florida Panther, and the Florida Alligator, blue heron etc) No more will we be able to grow food because the oil will flow down the everglades destroying all farms if it were to touch the aquifiers.And lets just say a year later every state close to the east coast that has a fishing industry will fail, not before people get sick from eating contaminated fish. And wouldnt you know that the gulf stream shoots out to Britain, so that&#39;ll be interesting when the island is surround on all sides with oil in 2 years. So hey, make sure to come back in 2 years and tell us how great those new oil rigs you&#39;ve invested into in the gulf are going, cause honestly despite all I&#39;ve said, both of you obliviously think that is the only solution and think that the alternative is a sudden night/day solution that would shut down society in less than a minute..I cannot fathom who would want to prevent the process of making our future oil dependent-less with something as catastrophic as this happening, and the reasoning being completely selfish. </p>

<p>You&#39;d both certainly make great lobbyist for big oil, and whats sad is that even when the last drop of freshwater hits this soil I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if both of you grinned at the sight.</p>

<p>tl;dr : Read it you lazy bastard.</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s exactly what you are doing. And unfortunately you are unable to see that you are also &quot;fucking&quot; yourself, your &#39;MISSIS&#39;, and any offspring you may have now or in the future. Please look up the meaning of the word moral, then try to apply it to what you said above. </p>
