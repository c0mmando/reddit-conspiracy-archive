    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, this race card bullshit is a really tough hurdle to overcome.  It&#39;s as if these people just don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible for a black politician to be corrupt just like any white politician.  Which is, ironically, quite racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree. I once saw a video of a guy who drove/parked a car better after smoking weed than he did sober. When asked what he was thinking, he said he was a little more paranoid about his actions and thus made a greater effort to pay attention to what he was doing. </p>

<p>It was one of those popular car TV series in the UK like Top Track or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have started thinking like you just in the past couple of years, and I have a question....do you continue to vote? I&#39;m in a bit of a quagmire over the whole voting thing, as I do believe as you, Left vs. Right is nothing but a distraction. I&#39;m thinking, vote for Independants...? It may be the only way to get out of the rut, but unfortunately, trying to get 50 people to agree on something is damn near impossible, let alone 350 million.... :-/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess, but the paleoconservative element kind of annoys me, to be honest. There are people here (and in the wider truth movement) who consider any form of progress toward socialism to be an insidious conspiracy, when it&#39;s actually the opposite that&#39;s the case. These are the same kind of people who killed JFK, who proudly protest with FOX News on the Koch family dime while waving yellow flags, who quietly approve of our government&#39;s conspiracies against leftist governments. How many times have you heard Alex Jones talk about our many coup d&#39;etat of leftist leaders? Now that you think of it, you&#39;ve never heard him talk about them, have you? Exactly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. But see that&#39;s a cultural thing, since this whole thing basically started out among rednecks in Texas. When these folks talk about false flag terror, they&#39;ll mention Operation Ajax. What they won&#39;t mention is how we funded right wing terrorists to blow up buildings and make it look like the communists did it, so the communists wouldn&#39;t be elected. In the Netherlands, the last remnants of socialism are now disappearing. Same in Greece. But then you shouldn&#39;t listen to Alex Jones anyway. How many times have you heard him talk about Israel? Israel nuked Gaza, but you don&#39;t hear him talk about it. He forgot about it after the war was over, because he couldn&#39;t get attention with it anymore. Rense on the other hand never forgot and keeps people updated on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh come on, really.... You&#39;re going to say that there&#39;s nothing in this sub reddit that is factual?</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of shit, no doubt, but you&#39;re being absolutely ridiculous if you&#39;re going to claim that there&#39;s no truth to be found on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>Just like with anything, you have to be <em>discerning</em>. </p>
