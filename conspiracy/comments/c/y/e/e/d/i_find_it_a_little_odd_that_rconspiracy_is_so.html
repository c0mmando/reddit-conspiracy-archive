       The media is largely Jewish owned and run.  Still, your premise that /conspiracy focuses on Jews is just a reflection of recent, largely retarded attribution of world events to Jews.
      </p>

       Back in the day (2 years ago), /conspiracy largely dealt with problems and sought to find their source.  Now it is far more dominated by "Teh Joos did it!"

       It has to do with evangelicals fascination with end times.  Ever read the left behind series?  I think evangelicals want a full on war in the middle east because they believe it will bring about the return of jesus.

       many believe in this end times stuff and most of it is put there to scare people or condition there minds. what those Evangelical believe in has no merit and i don't mean facts or documents but with my self or my spirit or my higher self at all, can u honestly believe that all this evolution or all this beauty was made to be lost or just go boom at one time? I think it is fear that drives them not love and they should turn there ways around and get in touch with themselves.

       I remember that i was a very loving being, full of joy... now being born here at this time i know i have choosen to forget it again but there is good reason to that and if you have some spare time then you should check out goerge kavassilas on youtube, i reccomend his 2008 talk. he is not like anyone else you will ever know of yet. There is a very special reason why you are all here and you will find out very soon. and after you watch his video which is full of real wisdom then just think to yourself if he says is going to happen then you have been informed and you have gained power in your discernment and you will not be in the dark when things get interesting vey soon like in a year from now :)

       most of my worry comes from some articles I read about extreme catholics and evangelicals getting african countries to condemn homosexuality.  These people are part of our government and create policy based on their beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The part that really gets to me is that there is a whole group of senators and congressmen that live in the same house and work together to further their goals. they call it "the family".  It just scares me.

       it's a small organised group of white nationalists who have specifically targeted this subreddit (probably because they have found the other subreddits to be quite unreceptive to their message)

       Wait other reddit's don't blame jews for everything?  Well if they weren't so ignorant maybe they'd be more receptive to the facts right?  Jews did 9/11 right?  right?  Oh, right, you don't believe that.  sorry.

       Seriously?  :(  Why?  I wish we could hang out or something. We are both people.  I'd just like to get to know you, talk with you. we may never agree but i'd at least like you to understand my point of view.

       you really need documents? take into consideration some things like oh i don't know the overall population of the planet and then take into consideration the amount of people you are really referring too.
      </p>
      <p>
       you dont need documents only your powers of deduction honestly! you only took notice of this because those you are speaking of are loud and stubbern and straight away jump to that conclusion... everyone has there finger in the pie not only the jew's or eva's and im sorry if you may not understand but you must look at the larger picture and broaden your perception. I have never thought it was many who are concerned with the jew's or eva's ( i apologies for the short terms it makes it easier to summarize myself) or more one then the other. We definitely have many people trying to point the finger for the current state of things within our world but that is just natural due to fear and it is only fear. im not saying its fear as in that person is scared of those other people but rather there actions or consequences of there actions onto other people or the world. To me both parties seem crazy but only because of my beliefs, I cant fathom how someone can believe in either one ( my parents tried to raise me Catholic ). To me personally we are all family but we are divided and that is a very bad thing makes us vulnerable much more, some people label themselves and give away there sovereignty much too easily be it religion or guru's or whatever the list goes on. One thing that does not change is that we are a race of human beings on a planet and we are make no mistake a young race coming into a greater community, we all don't share the same level of wisdom or responsibility when we should, so there are going to be times when you say wtf? I honestly believe people watch too much hollywood or poor T.V that has too much misinformation even the internet that they are not able to look past and understand that it is crap. I beleive you will enjoy Watching Goerge Kavassilas on you tube his 2008 presentation. i think this should open your mind and heart to a greater view of us and our planet and all those who are here right now going through this crazy time. try to open your mind and take in the BIG picture, hold the world in your mind and take it in, realize where you are and what is going on, take a step back and look at it all.

       Really, you could make this point about all fundamentalist extremists: Zionists, evangelicals, Muslims, Hindu--all fundamentalists are dangerous.

       isn't concerned with all fundamentalist extremists.  Just jews and zionists.  But please provide some counter evidence.
