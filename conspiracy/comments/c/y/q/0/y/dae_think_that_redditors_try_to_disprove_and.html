<p>Most people simply cannot accept evidence that challenges their beliefs so strongly.<br/>
Everyone knows there are criminals but most people assume that others think like they do.<br/>
But, as we know, people who rise to positions of great power, did not do so by way of a winning, empathic personality.                          </p>

<p>Most people believe in a government that protects, and cannot fathom the level of machiavellian self-interest that accompanies political and financial leaders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my quote from below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>r/conspiracy is a community bound by nothing but a common abandonment of critical thinking. From reptilian fans to truthers, their only unifying feature is unreasonable thought. It is a cloistered environment for protecting bad ideas from correction. Submitting here is equivalent to saying &quot;I value confirmation over understanding&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because r/conspiracy exist as a safe-haven for poor thought it is perfectly reasonable to be dismissive of its submissions as &quot;bad faith&quot; appeals for debate. If the submitter were genuinely looking for reasonable discussion then they have many specialist commuunities to which they can take their submission. Instead, an r/conspiracy submitter argues from a platform that declares their disinterest in arriving at a more precise understanding of reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;it is perfectly reasonable to be dismissive&quot;</p>

<p>You are really good at proving other people&#39;s points.</p>

<p>This is a specialist community.  Just because, like the rest of Reddit, it is increasingly filled with idiotic submissions, does not mean that by laying out generalized insults, you have done anything other than to be rude.</p>

<p>&quot;an r/conspiracy submitter argues from a platform that declares their disinterest in arriving at a more precise understanding of reality.&quot;</p>

<p>No, a good /conspiracy submitter/commenter sees an interconnected series of truths that are not easy to fully assimilate.  You see nothing but inane chatter, which is your, and society&#39;s loss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t consider a bad faith argument worthy of dismissal then perhaps the word has no use for you. If any claim, no matter how baseless or incoherent, is worth your full efforts refuting, even when the speaker is immune to argument, then you possess a stubbornness that will enable you to waste as much time as you please. Instead, I assert that when an individual declares their position as aligned with a community that values mystery over understanding, and demonstrates no mechanism for organising good information from bad, that its reasonable to dismiss their invitation to argue on those terms.</p>

<p>Every submitter to r/conspiracy declares an alignment to the conspiracy theorist community- an invitation to argue within the discourse of that community is an invitation worth rejecting. Every submitter to r/conspiracy is welcome to discuss any topic of their choosing on the wider Reddit, making use of the incredible cognitive resources of its specialist communities to better inform themselves. If they had a genuine interest in anything more than inane chatter then they would make use of these resources- but they submit to r/conspiracy, knowing full-well what its speciality is.</p>

<p>BS.  Back up that assertion.</p>

<p>&quot;a community that values mystery over understanding&quot;</p>

<p>Now I see.  You lack even the beginning of wisdom.  &quot;I do not know.&quot; is not an sign of ignorance; it is a sign of the ability to learn.  discussing facts and the questions they raise is not stupid; it is the manner in which humanity ideally functions.</p>

<p>&quot;demonstrates no mechanism for organising good information from bad&quot;</p>

<p>I readily admit the weaknesses of the conspiracy community.  What you describe here equally applies to all media, politics, history, economics etc.</p>

<p>&quot;Every submitter to r/conspiracy declares an alignment to the conspiracy theorist community&quot;</p>

<p>No.  To the skeptic community.  The community that doesn&#39;t take bad information on good faith.</p>

<p>&quot;an invitation to argue within the discourse of that community is an invitation worth rejecting&quot;</p>

<p>But insulting that community without basis is enticing, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>The rest of your post is just more of the same baseless insult (&quot;you guys don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about&quot;), so I won&#39;t bother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t kid yourself that this is r/sceptic. The only qualifications for a conspiracy theory is that something is vague, unfalsifiable, or paranoid. Which of the 9/11 truth scenarios doesn&#39;t belong in this subreddit? Bush did it? There were no hijackers? It was the Jews? The planes were holograms?</p>

<p>No, they all qualify. And those theories would belong in this subreddit if they involved reptilians, the Illuminati, mass hypnosis, or divine intervention. r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t know the meaning of scepticism- it displays its complete credulity with every thoughtless idea that meets the zero-altitude standards of the definition.</p>

<p>Those are the standards which every r/conspiracy post invites a dialogue on. Those are the standards worth rejecting. The community shares no position on any of its pet topics- it bears a standard that fetishises the unknown and the vaguely threatening. A genuine interest in truth is, at best, a peripheral concern.</p>

<p>Call yourself a holocaust revisionist and you can retain the claim to skepticism- David Irving would be the example. However, once you&#39;ve called yourself a conspiracy theorist, you&#39;ve announced a surrender of your discriminating faculties and a willingness to believe anything. It&#39;s your choice how you identify yourself, but don&#39;t act indignant when people are dismissive of a group whose binding trait is credulity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now you&#39;re attacking credentials?  What&#39;s the qualification for posting in /science?</p>

<p>You really don&#39;t get the fundamental aspect of asking a question.  Those scenarios all belong here because, however stupid the underlying assumptions, asking questions is the way in which we learn.  If someone posts &quot;lizard-people run the earth&quot;, the hope is that they will be given a lot of good <em>information</em> about why they don&#39;t.  I someone posts something reasonable, there will be a discussion of it.  Deride all you want, you are just proving the OP right.</p>

<p>Credulity is not something to be derided.  Ignorance sometimes is.  Closed-mindedness always is.</p>

<p>Yes, let&#39;s all reject dialogue, offer no support for our opinions and happily dance around assured of our own rectitude.  Nice attitude.</p>

<p>&quot;A genuine interest in truth is, at best, a peripheral concern.&quot;</p>

<p>This is getting so hypocritical I can&#39;t stand it.  You&#39;re saying &quot;I don&#39;t need to listen to what you have to say, because I seek the truth.&quot;  Do you get how backwards that is?  You don&#39;t need to look at information that you know is wrong?  Christians don&#39;t need to look at evolutionary theory.  Health insurance supporters don&#39;t need to look at reform.  Flat earthers don&#39;t need to look at a globe.</p>

<p>Oh, great, conflating conspiracy theorists with holocaust deniers.  Now you&#39;ve crossed the line into propaganda and defamation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/conspiracy is a community bound by nothing but a common abandonment of critical thinking. From reptilian fans to truthers, their only unifying feature is unreasonable thought. It is a cloistered environment for protecting bad ideas from correction. Submitting here is equivalent to saying &quot;I value confirmation over understanding&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not extrapolating from a minority to arrive at the judgement. I&#39;m saying &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is a blanket term (which this community rallies around) whose only criteria for qualification is that the theory be vague, unfalsifiable, or paranoid. The community has no stance on any of its favourite topics, it has no principles- only fetishes of threat and mystery for its own sake. Rally around such primal urges if you wish, but don&#39;t expect wider respect for it. Have some self-respect and throw off such a debasing moniker.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your definition of the term conspiracy theory is incorrect, unfortunately I doubt it would be possible to alter your perception on that issue. You are either an idiot or a troll, probably the latter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The community has no stance....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You attempt to demean the community without proof of your allegations - of course that would be impossible, as not only is it absurd and incorrect but intentionally insightful and therefor probably not sincere. </p>

<p>If you had been an observer of the community and not a troll, you would notice that there is a great deal of honest investigation that the users here commit to. For example the COREXIT scandal that broke recently was first posted here weeks before it hit the front page of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, this occurs frequently here. </p>

<p>We rally around skepticism of the government primarily, but the views and opinions of the community as a whole tend to vary. &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; has gained significant positive cultural capital in the last three decades due to mistrust of the governments but also the power structure of the world at large.</p>

<p>This subreddit is a joke. If anyone wanted their submission taken seriously and discussed in a rational forum then they could submit it in any other subreddit- /politics, /libertarian, /science, /trees. Posting under /conspiracy is equivalent to hanging a &quot;Leave brains at front&quot; sign on the door of a town hall. This subreddit is /circlejerk in a funny hat.</p>

<p>Typical Hasbara propaganda.</p>
