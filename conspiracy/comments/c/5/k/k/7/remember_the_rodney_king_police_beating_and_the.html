    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s has to do with the conditioning of the masses. It&#39;s a process where the government or entity in power herds the masses in the direction they want. The first thing that is done is you slowly starve the masses of critical  unbiased information. You get them to trust the source first and rely on this source, then funnel the public by providing them only the information you want them to hear. The lack of coverage of certain types of events is part of this. The next thing that is done is to demonize those that stand up and do something about what they don&#39;t like. This is done by showing only the wrong that happens , and so you&#39;ll find that peaceful protests don&#39;t get shown, only the destructive riots. Most people don&#39;t want to be destructive so that automatically will rule out protests because the media would have painted protests in a negative light. </p>

<p>What they also do is group people and pit those people against each other. You&#39;ll find that people no longer want to have an individual opinion based on their own ideas, they want an opinion based on a group, so that they don&#39;t have to defend their ideas on their own, they can get the group to defend them. People are no longer informed enough to stand up for themselves so that is why they turn to the group. So you&#39;ll find groups forming up that blend their ideologies. Liberals and Conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, everyone gets grouped and if you don&#39;t have a group, you are left out by yourself and you don&#39;t get counted. The sad thing is the people don&#39;t realize that the groups sometimes serve the same purpose, just from a different direction. The days where a person sat on the fence because they needed convincing are over. </p>

<p>The other thing that I have noticed is providing distractions. Every time they don&#39;t want you to focus on something too much, they&#39;ll provide a distraction, Brittany Spears or Lindsay Lohan will shave their head, or find a lesbo friend, or someone will release their &quot;private home video&quot; and the masses will lap it up. The more they get  you to zone out in front of the TV and in others lives, the better it is for them because you spend all that time in someone Else&#39;s life and forget about your own for a bit. The less you think about your world, the less chance there is that you&#39;ll be unhappy and uneasy as a nation. Just as a parent doesn&#39;t want to deal with a child and sits them in front the TV, so does the ruling elite baby sit the masses with their TV shows and movies. </p>

<p>Fear plays a part in this also. Create an atmosphere where a person is constantly not sure of what is going to happen next. Have things go wrong and continue to go and the person will be so preoccupied with just having to live and make it through the day that they lose focus on everything else. The Terror alert system is designed to do just that. Every time they change it , they get a persons mind racing. What do they know that they had to change the status, what&#39;s going to happen. If you&#39;ve been to an airport lately you&#39;ll notice that they have the warning showing or on the speaker system often. Keep everyone jumpy. Just like a herd of sheep afraid a wolf is going to attack any minute and clump together following the front sheep, you see people act the same way. People don&#39;t question the warnings and reasons behind them and just follow.</p>

<p>Repetition is also an important practice that they use. If you want someone to believe something you are saying, repeat it enough and they will accept it as truth. Bush was good at this, he kept bombarding the public to a point that became the  norm. People got brainwashed so effectively that they don&#39;t know what happened to them, and don&#39;t remember what or why they had the certain opinion before. It becomes a blur. Mention WMD enough and people will think that there are WMD&#39;s. Mention Nuclear enough and it will stick to a point people will remember it. Not only will they remember it, but they also won&#39;t initially know what it was in reference to and automatically associate it with the worst. </p>

<p>Preserve the ideologies in name to suppress the people. They want democracy and say that they are free, fine, let them vote  and give them choices we want and make it seem like they are making a difference when in fact they are entering the same house but from a different door. Freedom, exists in the limitations and boundaries they want you exist in. Choices exist from their catalog and for the purpose of providing you options so that you can say that you made your own choice. It&#39;s like picking jelly beans from a jar with different flavors, but in the end they are all Jelly Belly. </p>

Are you concerned enough to lend a hand to them and teach them to think for themselves? Are you willing to share and sacrifice some of your time in laying the ground work of knowledge? When you look back in time and have done nothing , will you have let people down? It all depends on you and what part you are willing to play.....</p>

<p>Well, more accurately, they play the left-right game with the &quot;tea-baggers&quot; (I hate that childish term), and nullifying tendency to protest in the process.  How? Simple- nobody wants to be associated with them, though the core of the movement is in fact focused on many of the right things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...I&#39;m just  gonna go ahead and call you on the old &quot;Burning down your own buildings is pretty retarded&quot;.</p>

<p>I defy you to show me one person who <em>burned down their own building</em>. A moment of examination shows this talk for what it is .</p>

<p>That was a ghetto uprising. People are not in ghettos and confinement by choice. To assign them ownership of the prison they inhabit? Equating this to responsibility for their &quot;own&quot; situation . LOL ! Is an animal &quot;retarded&quot; for destroying <em>it&#39;s own</em> cage?  Clever , but no cigar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yes, they are in the ghetto by their own (bad) decisions. </p>

<p>Nothing keeps them from getting a bus ticket and moving somewhere else. </p>

<p>When you burn down buildings in your community, you are burning down your own buildings. If I burn down the local grocery store, I would consider that &quot;me burning down my own grocer&quot; </p>

<p>The ghetto as a cage? Get real. Even minimum wage workers can afford a bus ticket to nearly anywhere in the country and are capable of moving elsewhere and starting over. </p>

<p>To claim helplessness is a myth. It may be learned helplessness, but that is because they have chosen to fail to help themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, lets do the math. Say they have a job making 400/week (10/hour, 2.5 above min wage). Thats 20k a year about. </p>

<p>They can move out on that, if they want their children to grow up in a safer area.  At that wage you are usually eligible for food stamps. So thats another 200 bucks a month. So that totals out to be closer to 25000.  Thats well above the poverty line. That is a level where it is totally possible to move &#39;out da hood.&#39;</p>

<p>That bar is set so fucking low you have to actively try to avoid all personal responsibility to not &#39;be capable&#39; to move out of the hood.</p>

<p>Add to that all of the scholarships and other grants available for minorities and the disadvantaged, not to mention the availability of social workers to guide you through the process. </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t accept that the bar is set so absurdly high that those who actively make it their goal to leave the hood behind, can&#39;t do it. </p>

<p>Yes they have more factors, drugs, bad &#39;friends&#39;, other legal issues, poor schools, being surrounded by people without business connections, being in food deserts. Yes, there are factors that can&#39;t ignored. </p>

<p>There are a lot of things available to balance out the bad stuff. Yes it doesn&#39;t do it completely, but there are a lot of resources available and that can help those who take advantage of it.</p>

<p>I am a firm believer in the human spirit and I also believe it exists in the ghetto. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent question, one I often ask myself.</p>

<p>I think part of the answer is that people are acting, but it no longer gets wide-band reporting like it used to.</p>

<p>Still, there are no south-central style riots, and nothing like the million man marches of yore, or even the college-quad sit (and smoke) in of the late 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is consumerism-induced complacancy, perhaps it is recognition (or denial) of citizen powerlessness.</p>

<p>Perhaps also the dissemination of the information is not nearly as widespread as we think it is.  Does your mom/neighbor/secretary/etc. know what&#39;s going on?</p>

<p>The bigger question in my mind is--what actions would be helpful?  The big-time revolutions of the recent past have seemed to have little lasting effect, or have they?  Perhaps this is success.</p>

<p>I read that and went, &quot;Wait, what happened to Detroit?&quot;, so I hit up Wikipedia. It turns out that Chicago doesn&#39;t even make the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_by_intentional_homicide#2000s_by_rate_per_100.2C000">top 25</a> in terms of homicide per capita.</p>

<p>Note that I&#39;m not trying to refute the spirit of your post, I just saw that statement and it made me curious who the real &quot;winners&quot; were.</p>

<p>edit: I just scrolled up a little bit and read the &quot;homicide by volume&quot; chart.  The latest numbers are from 2007, but holy shit there&#39;s a lot of killing going on in Brazil.  12of the top 25 cities are located there, and by my count 23,117 people were victims of &quot;intentionally homicide&quot; that year.

Ever been to a metal show?...  hundreds/thousands of pissed off people that would sooner drink the blood of dick cheney than let him breathe one more time or get away with another of their dimes.  All waiting...</p>

<p>It got a bit &quot;real&quot; during Katrina.   3 days is all it took for primal instincts of survival to brush away the tenets of civilized society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, my thought is the Rodney King Riots had less to do about outrage than it did as an excuse to go batshiat crazy, wreck shit, hurt people, and steal stuff. </p>

<p>Riots are usually all about that. They may start as an honest to goodness movement full of outraged people, but it seems to most always turn into people who want free electronics.</p>

<p>I do condone people getting together en masse, piling into the streets to protest, but how does smashing windows or burning down some hard working mom and pop&#39;s convenience store prove anything? It just proves that we are douchebags that deserve what we get. There&#39;s no honor in rioting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If your asking about racism outright racism slowly died away and was replaced with a quieted racism that is only whispered amongst ones own skin color. And that&#39;s with everyone, every group is secretly racist toward the other group.  </p>

<p>But as for riots: Riots only happen when you have nothing to lose. People in this thread are acting like government is somehow magically dumbing down an entire society and subtly subduing them into never critically thinking or reacting so therefore they never riot. </p>

<p>You are idiots for believing this. The truth is capitalism and the American society provides a pretty good standard living espeically amongst the most populous middle class. People arent brainwashed they are just happy and willingly remain ignorant to keep that happiness. Ignorance is bliss/ ignorance is strength . The fact of the matter is most people or just stupid to begin with and remain stupid happily the government has nothing to do with it. Do want to know why? Its not that government is keeping people down rather government does little to nothing for the people. You know whats that is called? </p>

<p>Freedom. </p>

<p>The government (for the most part) tries and stay out of peoples business as much as possible good or bad. As individualist society you can only rise by the hard work of your own hands, you arent going to be carried by others. </p>

<p>But I digress...Let me ask you: If you guys want riots, you want to smash the government apart, whats preventing you from doing so?</p>

<p>Exactly, your lives are too good to needlessly go to jail like a common criminal. And you need to ask yourself if you are living a pretty good life is everything all that bad? Instead arent you in fact buying into the fear and paranoia of others? Or perhaps you are just bored with your cozy lifestyle and want to play revolutionary or something? </p>

<p>I bet there are few here who may have actual grievances but not many.  The truth is if you look past silly partisan arguments that America is the worst place under the leader ship of the other side, life in America is in fact extremely good compared to the rest of the world. Hell if you are using a computer you are in fact far better off than billions of others.</p>

<p>So let me ask you: What are you really complaining about? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rage fatigue.</p>

<p>Sorry, better answer:</p>

<p>There is no project to keep the people docile.  The apathy that we feel is felt at every level of our system.  Look at the way our politicians and our captains of industry behave and tell me they give any more of a shit than anyone else.</p>

<p>Our civilization has been in steep decline for the past hundred years, but this was the year it dropped off the cliff.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s comforting to think that there is an all-powerful (albeit evil) entity that controls our destinies.  This is a fantasy invented to mask an even more terrifying reality.  The truth is there are no controllers.  There are no parents.  There is no class of people that <em>rules</em> in any but the most superficial sense.  It&#39;s all chaos and darkness from top to bottom, inside and out, through and through.</p>

<p>And that means there is no monster standing between you and happiness.  No death star that you can destroy to make everything all right again.  It means there is simply nothing, malevolent or benign, that stands between you and the abyss.  There is only the abyss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Police beatings weren&#39;t rare back then nor was it a huge secret. What was <em>different</em> about the Rodney King case was that it was caught on tape and publicized, which shoved into peoples faces what they could previously dismiss as background noise.

    <div class="md"><p>Good post. </p>

<p>As far as your criticism (from that post) that we&#39;re just venting on the internet and whatnot:</p>

<p>I have a philosophy that the best way to change society is through the spread of ideas.  And the internet is a great way to do that.  I believe through that, you can effect change in society, <em>naturally</em>and organically, rather than violently at the point of a gun. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what I said in response to that post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not looking for rioting myself and really don&#39;t wish to see that happen. What I do want to see is thinking and engaged citizens that are aware of the aforementioned problems- and are willing to act upon constructive solutions (like voting with your dollar).</p>

<p>Most people aren&#39;t even recognizing or acknowledging the real problems (or rather, the real culprit, which is primarily government), which is of course a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the verdict that led the riots, not the beating itself.  The trial was televised (or at least a lot of it was reported and broadcast).</p>

<p>I was in LA during the riots.  Everyone was waiting for the justice system to work. When the cops were all acquitted (after the trial had been moved to Simi Valley) ... well that&#39;s what got everyone rioting.</p>

<p>Still, apparently very few people actually rioted.  Mostly people looted televisions and clothes.  Not the most effective protest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the point is- the public was talking about it.  They were debating.   Those who weren&#39;t rioting weren&#39;t necessarily supporting the decision nor keeping quiet about it, which I&#39;m sure you realize.</p>

<p>Though you do bring up a good point:  The fact that it was televised.</p>

<p>The crucial thing that seems to be overlooked about the powerful effect of TV on shaping the minds of the people watching it is not only is a narrow spectrum of preselected messages being pumped, but the selection of what material to acknowledge existence of by covering it to begin with is crucial to shaping the distorted worldview of its consumers. </p>

<p>i.e. if it&#39;s not on TV, it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>I&#39;d think Youtube would have more of an impact, but perhaps the authoritative nature of TV might be the deciding factor here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the time.  It was the only thing on TV.  Like the OJ trial, it was on every channel.  Now people don&#39;t even watch TV.  There&#39;s YouTube and there are (more and better) video games and DVDs and torrents and Facebook, etc.</p>

<p>It was captured on a video camera... that was a fairly new phenomenon.  Is this really happening out there?  How often?  </p>

<p>The Rodney King story was also a long story.  We had longer attention spans.  It played out over many, many months and EVERYONE was glued to their TVs when the verdicts were read (like with OJ).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh..  how exactly do you justify that?  </p>

<p>He deserved to be arrested and charged with driving under the influence,  but beaten severely by 5 (I think) cops is not justified.  We won&#39;t live in a police state, their jobs are to arrest, the justice system is meant to punish them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your point?  I&#39;m clearly not supporting rioting, and I&#39;m pointing out there was at least public dialog and outrage (not necessarily involving rioting).  </p>

<p>I appreciate the constructive criticism btw :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But if you look at the streets it wasn&#39;t about Rodney King,
It&#39;s bout this fucked up situation and these fucked up police.
It&#39;s about coming up and staying on top
and screamin&#39; 187 on a mother fuckin&#39; cop.
It&#39;s not written on the paper it&#39;s on the wall.
National guard??! </p>
