       I know there is no correlation and folks come from all over the spectrum but I'm curious to get a very general break down.  My experience was always with right leaning 9/11 web sites but that was years ago and I know there are also left leaning sites as well.  So, what is it?

       just because you aren't a democrat or republican doesn't mean there isn't a political concept, group, or philosophy that at least gets close to describing/representing what you believe to be governmental best-practices.

       I guess the closest label to describe myself would be libertarian, because I strongly support liberty, but I support liberty so much that most people would consider me an anarchist.  I don't like labels, they are used for conformity which I also despise.  Unlike most people I don't believe government is even necessary, right now it seems like it is nessesary because of all the problems in the world but the second we decide to fix the world it will be fixed (without government).  I believe that the decision to fix the world is coming very soon, in fact it's already began but it's a slow process at first.  When this global shift of consciousness is complete we will not need any government, at least not anything close what we know as government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all responsible collectively for everything that happens in this world.  We are all part of the same consciousness but we experience our "life" subjectively.  We literally create everything in this world, for proof of this look into the "measurement problem".  This is the most hidden of hidden knowledge, because once we understand that it is us that is in control we can make the decision to change our reality.  Once humanity decides to live in a love based reality we will start living in a love based reality, as opposed to our current fear based "reality".

      </p>
      <p>
       Thats not exactly true.  I weight issues... for instance, with health care, I would have been happy with eithor going completely socialized or completely free market (basicly getting rid of the insuance companies).  Its hard to deside so I look for the greater good in each aspect.  On the Socialized aspect, we would be able to hold our government's feet to the fire, while on the free market side, we would have force to doctors to drive down by competition.  My paradigm was broken a long time ago, and I thought I was a libertarian... and evetually that was even broken to the point that I can see that aspects of both sides.  The only problem with this, is that when you have the MSM start to even try to look at an issue with both sides of the coin, you end up with a fascist healthcare bill(and... once again, I mean mussolini fascism)... like the one we got

       i guess for some people, you're right. but i think a lot of people do lean more towards one belief than the other. some think socialism is the devil, while others think a completely free market is the devil. i haven't met all that many people who could go either way. but maybe that's just because they are being brainwashed by the left-right paradigm game. i don't think so, though. i think pure capitalism is evil as hell.

       You can still play the game.. Here's how I've done it for the last 32 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vote 3rd party if you can. Doesn't matter if they're the Communist Party or the Libertarian Party. Just vote to screw up the 2 party system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise vote to throw the current incumbent bastard out of office. Doesn't matter who. He's been there long enough. Time to go!
      </p>

       If there's no choice, the one guy on the ballot doesn't get my vote. Let him go into office knowing only his family and associates voted for him.

       Ha! I like your style. I wish Joe Average would do this. It seems pretty much impossible to talk people, who are committed to it, out of the two-party thing though. It's like trying to convince an addict to put down the needle, a Scientologist to see a shrink, or a Muslim to eat some bacon.

       Agorist libertarian - keep government local and restricted things like libraries and a fire dept.  When you have secretive organations like the cia and pentagon run without public oversight or budget limitations, you will certainly also get expoitation of power.  There was thermite at ground zero, and that is undeniable fact.  I don't have any answers but i know bullshit when i see it.

       i like the idea of a federal government vs. local government in some ways. i hate how if i cross a county, state, or other essentially arbitrary border, i have to worry about laws changing. i think we should be able to agree on a set of laws and make them federal (though enforced at least primarily locally, though it's nice to have the FBI when you need them), while keeping things we disagree on (abortion, marijuana, etc.) in the local law books.
      </p>
      <p>
       i also think laws should be more black and white, and shouldn't allow for "officer interpretation" in any way. officer testimony should never be treated as fact, which it essentially is these days. if the only evidence a cop has is his/her word, he/she shouldn't be able to make a case.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, there should be little or no difference between judges. i hate how the outcome of trials depends on the judge you get. wtf kind of legal system is that? i guess that's what appeals are for, though...
      </p>
      <p>
       which leads me to: why the hell do we need lawyers? the legal system appears to think that if you're not in poverty, you should be able to afford a lawyer. but i don't understand why anyone should ever need a lawyer, or even be allowed to have a lawyer, really. the whole system just seems like its rigged for rich people who have nothing better to do than wank around in court all day, while everyone else loses.
      </p>
      <p>
       i agree, i think far more -unbiased- oversight is needed for CIA/pentagon/etc.

       That test reported me as a Liberal (90%  personal, 30% economic)
      </p>
      <p>
       Moral Politics puts me as a fairly centrist Social Democrat (-1 on Moral Order, .5 on Moral Rules) although I used to score Capital Democrat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strangely, Political Compass just reported me as a leftist libertarian in the first time I've ever strayed below the 0 mark on their social order line (-2.38 economic, -2.87 social).

       I think you'll find a mixed bag. I used to consider myself a leftist, and I am on a lot of issues like pro-science, pro-choice, and I'm an atheist, but I'd be considered a right winger for my stances on pro-gun rights and economic conservatism (I'm totally against the modern banking system).

       911, OKC, Katrina, and all of the rest of this shit they have pulled aside, I am done with voting.  It clearly makes no difference, even on the local levels, whom is in office.  Every politician is owned by someone or some corporation.  None of them give a shit about us and do everything possible to fuck us over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really think Obama is different that Bush II, you need your head examined.  Period.  Same if you governor or mayor of your city changes.  Makes ZERO difference.  You'll find the same crew of money grubbing mother fuckers behind them all.
      </p>
      <p>
       By not voting, I am not giving creditability to a broken system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come up to Northeast Ohio and I will show you pissed off BLACK WOMEN who were angry Hillary did not become president, and NEO is RACIST, big time.  No shit.  I am not making that up.  In the same region, I show the same mayor and city councils who get reelected over and over again while the Plain Dealer keeps reporting single digit approval ratings.  I think Ohio invented rigged elections long before Bush II came along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voting is total waste of god damn time.  All I can do is not bother so when the check comes due, I can have a clear conscience that I had nothing to do with any of this shit.

       I'm of the opinion that we could have some kind of techno-cratic utopia where technology is fully utilized for the benefit of mankind as a whole. Pretty much like zeitgeist or one of many sci fi novels that deal with the subject.

       i'm a left-leaning socialist or commie or something, i guess. or at least more that than a right-wing let-businesses-rape-the-planet-for-the-lulz-at-the-expense-of-its-worker-slaves and let-govt-do-whatever-it-wants-behind-closed-doors-and-in-the-pocket-of-the-businesses fascist. i don't see why some people should be billionaires while others are in poverty. i think there needs to, at the very least, be more of a fair distribution of wealth. no one needs 50 million dollars. no one. let alone 50 billion.

       i never vote republican or democrat. people who do are usually morons imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       i voted nader last election. i live in kucinich territory and am proud of that. only problem is, because i live in kucinich territory, i live in ohio. it was easy to vote nader when i lived in maryland, but now i'm actually going to have to think twice, since my vote "actually counts" now... do i vote my heart and risk the republicans winning? as much as i hate both repubs and dems, i really do think democrats do at least a slightly better job.

       Go green or die! - Terrence Mckenna
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say I'm in the "I no longer a give a fuck" boat. I used to vote for the green party until i found out that the leader of the green party of Canada is in bed with oil companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Green party of Canada grew some balls I'd vote green, donate money, campaign, volunteer.. ect... Fuck the left right paradigm.
