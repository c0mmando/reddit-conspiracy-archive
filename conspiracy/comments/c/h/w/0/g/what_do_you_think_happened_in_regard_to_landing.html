    <div class="md"><p>The only issue I would take with this has to do with the laser ranging.  I&#39;m not sure of the physics of it, but it has been suggested that you could get a laser ranging reading with no reflector, just from reflecting off the moon&#39;s surface.  This seems at least somewhat feasible because the wiki article lists a successful test in 1962, though they don&#39;t specify what the target was in the experiment.</p>

<p>Alternately, an unmanned mission could have ejected a reflector onto, or landed it on, the moon, though this would greatly increase the complexity of the cover up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html">This</a> piece is long, but easily the most comprehensive refutation I have read.  I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m 100% sure we didn&#39;t go, but the technical challenges, slapdash methods and PR friendliness of the whole affair (all well addressed in this series) make me highly suspicious that we didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also, no humans are going to set foot on the moon before 2030.  How could technology advance so little (actually apparently gone far backwards) in that regard, while advancing so far in every relevant field?  [Edit:]  We allegedly made it in 8-9 years from the original inception of the program <em>in the &#39;60s</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t the space race against the Soviet Union to motivate.  The USA lost the race to put an satellite into orbit, then the race to put a man in orbit.  They sure as hell weren&#39;t going to lose the race to the moon, and they were willing to take a lot of risks to do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that we easily lost those races and many others, like first EVA, really doesn&#39;t <em>support</em> our accomplishing something that they never did.  Rather the opposite, and I don&#39;t buy that the Soviets just said &quot;Oh we give up&quot;, because they didn&#39;t get there first (we still launched satellites and learned about EVA&#39;s which were much less successful than our &quot;good old American moxy&quot;-based miracle of a program.  I can understand less funding making it slower, but not on that scale after that much time.</p>

<p>&quot;they were willing to take a lot of risks to do so.&quot;</p>

<p>And yet never a single death or even injury during the take-off or space portions of the program.  The number of technical difficulties that were essentially not realistically addressed, like the need for more than just Saturn-5&#39;s or the untested throttleable LEM thruster (the first with that capability) make this narrative look pretty much like propaganda about American exceptionalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Losing those races was part of the incentive that garnered the support needed to undertake this mission.  Also being able to say &#39;If our rockets can make it to the moon, making it to Moscow would be like a walk in the park&#39;.  </p>

<p>It still doesn&#39;t change the fact that there were launches of rocket into orbit, then unmanned missions around the moon, then actual unmanned landings on the moon, then manned orbits around the moon, then manned landings on the moon.  It wasn&#39;t like they suddenly did it with no build up, it was an intense period of engineering, development and refinement of what they had learned, combined with vast resources being given to the project.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not American, I see the moon landings as being as much human exceptionalism as anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EVA&#39;s didn&#39;t help us hit Moscow, or do anything but advance space science but we did those things.  You haven&#39;t addressed why the Soviets never sent a man.</p>

<p>All the intermediate challenges you list were done by the Soviets and were within our capabilities (often barely) at the time.</p>

<p>It does nothing to address why its so impossible to get back in less than 60 years after the original landings (impossible as in we need equipment that we haven&#39;t developed).  Why do the uncompleted moon-equipped space suits weigh about 70% more?  Why are they going to take 5 times as long and tens of times as much money to develop?  Why are they, this time, being manufacture by a defense contractor, instead of Playtex?  This is the tip of the iceberg (look closely at the LEM specs or the useless lunar rover).</p>

<p>China is eagerly pushing ahead in their space program; they also will not be there before 2030.  Is there nothing there of interest?  Is there only insignificant prestige involved?</p>

<p>I understand the circumstantial points you are making.  They were enough to assuage my doubts for most of my life.  However, they do nothing to address the technical leaps of faith required.  Its a lot to ask to suggest you read the whole series I linked to.  I certainly don&#39;t blame you if you don&#39;t want to, but it was enough to seriously tip my opinion, because of its logical, provable evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It won&#39;t alter American&#39;s perceptions of their nation because there is little convincing evidence, and it will never get a fair hearing.&quot;</p>

<p>Two issues here; the first part is your own opinion for which you offer no support.  The second part may well be true, but it doesn&#39;t mean that learning about it isn&#39;t informative or that fighting for it to get a fair hearing isn&#39;t meaningful.</p>

<p>&quot;Discussing conspiracy theories which look crazy doesn&#39;t actually help anybody very much&quot;</p>

<p>It helps those discussing it to understand the issue better through the exchange of information, and assuming its true, it helps anyone who&#39;s eyes can be opened to said conspiracies.</p>

<p>If you want evidence, particularly of the technical impossibilities, the link from my first comment is long, but good.  It is based primarily on news stories from the era, books and biographies but also work by skeptics, and those who refute them.  There is also a lot of photographic analysis (largely unrelated to the shaky arguments people have with the most famous pictures) as the author is a professional photographer.</p>

<p>What now?  Building a set and filming guys walking around it costs a tiny fraction of what the moon landings allegedly did.</p>

<p>&quot;that&#39;s actually a LOW estimate for how much that would have cost to fake back in the late 60&#39;s...&quot;</p>

<p>Given that that&#39;s more money than has been earned in human history (even adjusted for inflation), you&#39;re just making figures up.  Are you really saying that building a set and having guys hop around would&#39;ve cost more than the moon landings allegedly did?  The government wasn&#39;t even a few years ahead of Hollywood who were able to reproduce such imagery very shortly afterward (a lot more shortly than 60 years)?  </p>

<p>You make movies?  Well try including some of your relevant expertise on why it would be more expensive to film a scene with passable special effects than it would be to send many, many people about 1000 times further than humans have been sent before or since and return every one uninjured.</p>

<p>No, there are plenty of reasons to suspect the lunar landings were nothing more than cold war propaganda, only because those many reasons exist.  The recent stories only make the original story seem more absurd.</p>

<p>What is it this, Jeopardy?  Are you unable to extract meaning from what I asked?  Let&#39;s try again.  Why is it that although this event happened within living memory, nobody involved has stepped forward to say &#39;we faked it&#39;.</p>

<p>You can call whatever you like nonsensical, it doesn&#39;t modify reality.</p>

<p><em>This review is from: We Never Went to the Moon: America&#39;s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle (Paperback)</em></p>

<p><em>The late great Carl Sagan - America&#39;s most famous and popular Astronomer ever - knew that the alleged Apollo missions were a hoax.</em></p>

<p><em>Too honest a man to ever promote the lie - note how in his lifetime he never mentioned it - he stated in one of his last interviews that it was basically a cold war exercise.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;how on Earth do you explain the $500 quadrillion worth of special effects videos then?!?!?&quot;</p>

<p>What now?  Building a set and filming guys walking around it costs a tiny fraction of what the moon landings allegedly did.</p>

<p>&quot;that&#39;s actually a LOW estimate for how much that would have cost to fake back in the late 60&#39;s...&quot;</p>

<p>Given that that&#39;s more money than has been earned in human history (even adjusted for inflation), you&#39;re just making figures up.  Are you really saying that building a set and having guys hop around would&#39;ve cost more than the moon landings allegedly did?  The government wasn&#39;t even a few years ahead of Hollywood who were able to reproduce such imagery very shortly afterward (a lot more shortly than 60 years)?  </p>

<p>You make movies?  Well try including some of your relevant expertise on why it would be more expensive to film a scene with passable special effects than it would be to send many, many people about 1000 times further than humans have been sent before or since and return every one uninjured.</p>
