        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I must pull this off in a way no one could possibly suspect.  First I have determined that chemical attack is the most viable option for large scale human and economic damage.  I need a dispersal method for the chemical and this would ideally be using localized weather systems.  Now, let&#39;s see..  I need a way to get enough of this toxin into the air so that it rains down on a large part of the US population decimating all life.  The millions of gallons of my deadly chemical (I&#39;ll call it corexit) needs to be dispersed into warm waters in the gulf, and during hurricane season as well to increase the odds of a deadly strike.  If I can get a hurricane to do the dispersal that would be the real jackpot!  In any case excluding a hurricane my corexit will evaporate and rain down all over the Eastern US, at a toxicity level of 2.6ppm it will cause mass destruction!  Ok, hmmm.. well, I can&#39;t just dump millions of gallons of corexit into the gulf without getting noticed.  Ha, I have it! I can claim corexit is an oil dispersant and then cause a massive oil leak on a rig in the gulf.  Then I&#39;ll convince the US they must use my corexit!  Even better I&#39;ll ensure the leak is 1 mile down so it can not be repaired, this will give me up to a year of injecting my corexit into the gulf.  The leak will also provide cover as a huge distraction, they won&#39;t even notice the corexit hahahaha... Cackles and strokes Mr. Bigglesworth  .....Ah forget it, this could never work right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Substance and style. This is probably the single most perceptive hypothetical re the BP spill you&#39;ll ever read. </p>

<p>Guy&#39;s a genius; invites you to think about the real potential consequences of dispersant raining after a hurricane. Not through malicious enterprise, but due to sheer ineptitude and rushed decisions designed for maximum potential spin cover. </p>

<p>I mean really, inject butt loads of toxic chemical dispersant directly into a well head gushing what, 3mil gallons a day. This keeps the oil in suspension so the majority of it doesn&#39;t surface. Oil company&#39;s happy, visible slicks are minimized, pr in action. </p>

<p>So most of the oil doesn&#39;t surface, but now it&#39;s micronised with massive surface area, ready for maximum impact upon organic life. They just fucked up the coastal economies of three states, not to mention the entire gulf aquatic ecosystem is going to die. We&#39;re not talking about overfishing a species or two here, you&#39;ll be lucky to have starfish in that gulf by the time this thing&#39;s over.</p>

<p>How ironic would it be to take it to the next step. Some months from now Hurricane BP rears it&#39;s ugly head. People even say it&#39;s part of a general trend in changing weather patterns attributed to the general overuse of fossil fuels. Of which BP is a world class supplier.</p>

<p>As it gathers strength due to unusually high summer temperatures over the gulf (some people even speculate that recent oil slicks have darkened the surface, increasing oceanic heat absorption) it starts to draw heavily on the polluted waters.</p>

<p>Hurrican BP passes, not to much dammage. Nobody notices too much at first, until a few college girls go bald, a lot of pets start to go missing and then then people really start to understand the consequences of the orange rain as the death tolls mount and new symptoms are reported daily.</p>

<p>The hospitals can&#39;t cope, class action lawsuits are put forward, like those caught in the Bhopal disaster did. But justice is slow, if at all for the little man in the US. More concerned with feeding the prison/industrial complex with new slave labour.</p>

<p>What does it take you to get angry America. BP&#39;s actions, at every step of the way are nothing short of inexcusable. Even now your paltry response is not enough to make them Flinch. Do you not think it&#39;s easy to plug a hole. It&#39;s only hard when you are more concerned with capturing the oil for later sale, then you are with preventing the ecodisaster.</p>

<p>Look at the figures, BP&#39;s a company, out to make money, looking to mitigate dammage. Reputational dammange, financial dammage, dammage to BP. Unless your politicans find their teech and raise the paltry dammages cap above BP&#39;s daily profit margin&#39;s you&#39;re not going to see anything happen other then whats in BP&#39;s best interest.</p>

<p>Even as the ecologial equivilent of 2001 unfolds before your very eyes. Massive dammage, beyond the unthinkable, so unmanageable nobody even has a game plan that can feasably be scaled up and sound like it was there all along.</p>

<p>The rest of the world watching on with a wry smile as America once again trips over it&#39;s own clumsy feet, at least until they realize we&#39;re all part of a global economy of which America is the single largest player. Until they remember that some how this will flow on through economic trickle down and fuck up their day sometime.</p>

<p>Substance and style. This was originally going to be a snarky comment about ignoring substance due to style, I have to smoke less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satirically providing a perspective can be risky, but only if the people you are joking about are fascist and evil.</p>

<p>The only reason someone would get in trouble for making a comment like that is if the OP&#39;s intent was truly in question or confusing in nature. You may believe it was in bad taste, but that is not a crime. This post was not confusing.</p>

<p>I would NOT suggest to others that they FEAR the &quot;MONSTER&quot; who could POSSIBLY interpret your point of view incorrectly. It is very important to stand up for and share your perspective, thoughts and feelings with others. If you do not believe this, why are you on reddit at all?</p>

<p>We are the people that make up our government, and WE have the power to change what is wrong. If we do not discuss these possibilities, we will always be taken advantage of by those who are not afraid to make you bend to their will. Not everyone is truly as concerned with keeping our liberties in tact and the long term welfare of our population and planet like you and I.</p>
