    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. You don&#39;t just &quot;Discover&quot; massive mineral deposits, geologists pretty much know what kind of terrain and rock types contain these deposits by geo-mapping the areas first and all this is done way before they go physically looking for them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely.  And like as pointed out in another reply, somewhere (I think) 90% of the world&#39;s heroin is produced there from Afghan opium.  I live in a relatively southern state on the east coast.  Not necessarily &quot;Deep South&quot;, but, everyone that lives here lives &quot;a southern life&quot; if I had to generalize everyone.  Well, in the Southeast and as far up as Kentucky and West Virginia and New York I understand, I&#39;m pretty sure.  We have many, many opiate addicts.  Which stem from people that worked in coal mines and such back breaking work, or in asbestos ridden building in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.  And are now dying, and the doctors around here know everyone at least a little and feel guilty if they don&#39;t prescribe some painkillers to help these guys that got dealt a shitty hand in life.  Or their sons or relatives of people like this and they can easily steal them from them.  Or the older people or whoever getting the scripts is unemployed and sells the pills because of the huge profit.  In West Virginia, a 80mg Oxycontin pill, the &quot;Real OC&#39;s&quot; with &quot;OC&quot; on one side, &quot;80&quot; on the other, I mean. The brand name OC&#39;s go for $100 normally.  Friends and relatives can sometimes get em for $90 or $80, but usually never cheaper than $75.  Generics are cheaper.  Generics that don&#39;t have a OC on &#39;em, but still have the same mg&#39;s of Oxycodone.</p>

<p>Why am I including this in my reply?  Because, I&#39;m a recovering opiate addict that&#39;s been on Methadone outpatient treatment for 5 months, opiate clean besides Methadone I might add (FINALLY! :D) after the past 5 years.  Well, i&#39;m including all this just to make the point when I started getting bad on Oxy&#39;s and needing em daily, they were cheap, in around late &#39;04 or &#39;05.  Around &#39;06 or &#39;07 people from West Virginia began moving elsewhere and they brought the prices with them.  Prices skyrocket in a year, basically forcing someone who was addicted, using 120-160 mg of Oxycodone a day, to spend a small fortune, and I probably could&#39;ve bought a nice house with all the money I spent since &#39;05.  Think at LEAST $60 a day since 2004 or so.  So, there you go.  </p>

<p>Well, the main point of all this is to show to everyone the HUGE (and relatively hidden) epidemic of opiate/heroin addiction.  When you&#39;re spending that much on one pill, you tend to wanna get the most for your money.  Hell, any drug addict buys the longest and best high he can get for his money.  I found heroin in 2006 about 30 minutes away, mind you it&#39;s been in the city capital around 2 hours away and maybe in another metropolis an hour away on a state line sort of like Kansas City, MO and KS.  Two states share it, but mostly the gangs have taken over except for banks and corporations and people working in those building.  Heroin began flooding the streets and VERY much cheaper than oxy&#39;s.  It&#39;s now everywhere, even making it&#39;s way into my small town (yes, you would probably call it a &#39;Mayberry&#39; town) if you visited.  Heroin in a town resembling Andy&#39;s Griffith&#39;s district?!  No!  Well, YES!</p>

<p>To cut to the end, I started shooting heroin, and my life went into a downward spiral.  I was going to college trying to decide in majoring in Psychology or Law.  I&#39;ve shot up with college kids, rich parents (their kids usually have no idea, some shoot up with them though), a prominent and locally known doctor in our town and the adjoining ones.  A lawyer, and countless middle class people, that went from vicodins, percocet&#39;s and oxy&#39;s to heroin to either save money on buying them or to help the pain they have because the pills at the pharmacy without a prescription are insane.  (I&#39;ve seen at least a $600 bill for 60 Oxycontin 80mg&#39;s.  Imagine 120.)  So, the WHOLE point i&#39;m trying to reach here is basically just like in Vietnam, they had the US troops addicted to heroin or opium overseas.  They came back strung out, alot ended up homeless but the main point is, if you tell a drug addict the only way to get his drug is to do this or that, even go into the jungle and hunt countless soldiers, for no reason, he will.  Vietnam, Iran-Contra, now Operations &quot;Iraqi Freedom&quot;and &quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot; (nice names, eh?) the CIA/US government has hand their hands in smuggling ADDICTIVE drugs into the states and allowing the infantry troops and other ground troops (you don&#39;t think general shoot heroin do you? No, they have scotch for them :)) access to heroin in countless wars and freely on the streets.  Sure, local police lock them up but in 2 hours at the most there&#39;s another guy in the same spot replacing him and the drug he has.  Keep the American people focused on other things that they feel is way more important, and do your business quietly, and everyone works.  Well, it has since 1913 when the Federal Reserve Act was voted on in Congress, hasn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>TL;DR: former heroin addict explains how he thinks the CIA/US Government has a hand in bringing in at least SOME of Afghanistan&#39;s heroin because of sudden abundance and great strength everywhere since around &#39;05 or &#39;06.  </p>

<p>Edit: Sorry so long guys.  :(, I just feel strongly on this subject.  Although, I could be wrong and my tinfoil hat is showing, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and Iran-Contra proved the Government smuggling drugs for profits and MANY say/think of the HOMELESS, drug addict Vietnam Vets that at the least commanding officers were way to lenient letting troops shoot heroin, to &quot;relieve stress&quot;.  At the least, smoke pot.  But a potentially drug that can/has kill people if you withdrawal cold turkey after a long/high addiction.  </p>

<p>Hope everyone doesn&#39;t just downvote this because I included the part of me being a former heroin addict.  Former and in outpatient rehab the key parts around there.  Happy thinking guys and help wake up the AMERICAN PEOPLE.  Can politicians since Richard Nixon honestly say that this is the vision they interpreted from the Founding Fathers and Declaration of Independence?  If they say they can, they should be tried and convicted for Treason and Perjury.</p>

<p>Edit:  I added (I think) in front of 90% of world&#39;s heroin, to stop the guys who will dismiss because that number could be off by 10-20%.  Look at the big picture, not errors that don&#39;t affect the outcomes (if true) of what&#39;s stated and MORE that has to be going on behind the scene.  Added the price of the 80mg OC in West Virginia.  Didn&#39;t notice I had left it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I wrote out a long ass reply, as long as the first reply.  I don&#39;t feel like typing it all out, it took around 45 minutes the first time.  Basically, thank you, most people are misinformed about the methadone clinics out there.  They think that addicts use the methadone clinic and suboxone as a alternative addiction.  A different drug, another addiction.  While that&#39;s temporarily true, I guess, suboxone and methadone clinic&#39;s main goal is to get you to feel normal on a consistent dose and to get you used to feeling the same everyday and not getting high.  Once you feel you can be a member of society without drugs, they bring you down slowly, so when you finally do get off it, you have minimal if ANY withdrawals.  Once you get to 5mg, you goto 2.5mg.  Then 1mg, then .5 if you want those also.  Then even .25mg if you think you need it.</p>

<p>It takes every addict/person different times.  Some people it takes 6 months, some people take a year, some people 3 months, some people I know were on it 3 years.  It depends on many variables, but mostly how long your addiction lasted, how bad your addiction was (how much you were doing) and how much of an &#39;addictive personality&#39; you have. But over time, everyone in the program gets off everything completely.  Plus the methadone clinics drug test their patients so they&#39;re not using methadone and other drugs just to get high.  </p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself &quot;Oh, look at this heroin addict trying to justify what he did and what he&#39;s doing now to supposedly try and get off this stuff.  He probably just gets high on the methadone because it&#39;s cheaper and legal.&quot;<br/>
Well, I say think that if you want, but the only reason I typed up this stuff so long, is that talking/writing about my addiction and my past addiction and my thoughts on drug addicts and addiction in general help me stay off the drugs altogether.  I don&#39;t have any withdrawal, but I do still occasionally have the urge to get high every now and then and talking to someone or sitting here writing about it and reminding myself all the horrible things I was going through at that time just because of that drug I want right then, makes me realize that the urge will pass and I don&#39;t need the stuff and it&#39;s definitely not worth the temporary high for the long-lasting if not life-long pain it causes.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, read up on methadone clinics, they pay the DEA and IRS high taxes to operate, WAY higher than any other local business.  If the DEA shuts them down, which they will for any SMALL, MINISCULE mistake, sometimes just a few typos of how many dollars was collected that month, claiming people taking money from the company, etc.  So, when they close because of the DEA or because of the propaganda the DEA/U.S. government spreads, the drug addicts are hung out to dry, the day they don&#39;t accept their money, there is no help finding another clinic, there is no temporary clinic and no prescriptions (which are the easiest way to help these addicts temporarily until they can get on a waiting list and into another clinic in another town) are given out.  So the addict 99.99% of the time goes back to drugs, that are being either smuggled in from Afghanistan or the painkillers that are legal to be prescribed.  This benefits in the end the U.S. government who in the end, protect the opium/heroin trade in Afghanistan and help bring it in, and collect tax-free revenue from this to be spread among the people involved, as no one else really knows, including other low government officials.  Or, the big pharmaceutical companies that make the painkillers.  The person with the prescription ends up selling more pills, so he asks the doctor for an increase, which eventually will end up driving demand for these drugs up, and if anyone knows economics the basic &quot;Supply &amp; Demand&quot; &#39;law&#39; applies here.  Drives the demand up, so they raise the price on the drug, which people end up paying because they can make more on the street.  The BILLIONS &amp; BILLIONS of dollars these pharmaceuticals make then in turn lobby Senators &amp; House Members and any other politician that has any kind of meaningful influence in the passing of bills and laws.  Lobbying in D.C. now means, to anyone who has paid attention to ANYTHING this Government has done since the late 60&#39;s early 70&#39;s, KNOW lobbying in D.C. is just representatives of corporations/industries they&#39;re in.  They pay these influential people in the legislature or senate to put up a 1,000 page bill or something of the sort that sounds good, and they know MOST people won&#39;t read all this.  They build a nice box around it, make the bill sound good and like it&#39;s a basic bill and somewhere in the middle, 2 pages give or take includes the law or bill that benefits that industry, which in turns gives the corporations leniency in the law, or helps them keep making poison, that is basically heroin.  Like Adderall is a form of amphetamine, these opiates are just a form of heroin.  Just a barely different chemical makeup.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m done with this short essay (?) the other thing I wrote gave me the message &quot;this is too long (max: 10000)&quot; that I got for the first time since i&#39;ve been registered here.  I didn&#39;t know they even had that, because I&#39;ve seen long replies alot on here, on hot topic subjects.  And sorry I turned a part of this thread into a thread about the U.S.A. Government smuggling drugs into it&#39;s citizens to keep them from paying attention to the things they do.  Of course this could all be paranoid thoughts, because of all the things i&#39;ve seen the government do, that has been confirmed from records and reports (MK-ULTRA, just to name one, the one&#39;s that are the worst, the public probably don&#39;t and will not EVER know about as long as the system stays the same).  If it&#39;s all untrue and any high-ranking and/or influential person in the government doesn&#39;t condone/help in the smuggling of drugs in the U.S. or take money from the pharmaceutical company to turn a blind eye to all the abuse these drugs have.  There is about the same, if not more abuse from legal prescription drugs as there is from illegal drugs like marijuana, cocaine, etc.  So, if everything is just a paranoid ranting of a former heroin addict, take my writing with a grain of salt.  But, if ANY of this writing helps wake up an American as to what the Government has done and the way the system has been for a long time, and how corrupt it is starting around the Fed. Reserve Act in 1913 and how it will NOT change unless the system changes.  Then my 5 years of heroin/oxy addiction and all this time writing this is worth it.  Change doesn&#39;t happen without first knowledge and inspiration.  Help inform the people you know personally and care about!   </p>

<p>P.S. This is probably the two longest replies I&#39;ll write for a while on reddit.  Hope if anything it provided some fellow /conspiracy/ guys some thought provoking paragraphs, as many of you guys do for me!</p>

<p>So, so far you have called me a few names (ouchies - please no more)
and then attempted to chide me for using a certain word and then
said it takes one to know one blah, blah, blah. All I see is someone who thinks he is staring himself in the mirror and doesn&#39;t like what he sees while all I am doing is holding the mirror for you.  Ugly isn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What, is that your poor attempt of a psychoanalytic analysis of me? Since we are playing that game. You first corrected me because I used the wrong form of &quot;your.&quot; After I commented on one of your posts with a misspelling  to prove what a hypocrite you are, you tried to insult me by saying I should take remedial classes in &quot;comprehension&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot; which might I add, are the same thing you retard (seems like you need remedial classes). Then you continue to use the word &quot;dismiss&quot; like some over zealous douche bag nerd that feels the need to use the word on &quot;tards like you&quot;. Then you make the mistake of using the word &quot;chide&quot; (who uses the word chide anyways you douche) which means to scold one with. I believe you were looking for the word mock (fail). So my analysis of you is that you are some know-it-all nerd who sits in his moms basement beating off to 4chan posts who feels the need to correct everyone and posting your shitty opinions to prove to yourself and everyone that you are the smartest and most superior nerd on the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  Except for the average american&#39;s who don&#39;t know about the information out there because of Fox News and CNN saying all things of the sort are &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; and are just insane.  They say the people that help with these websites that have information about Iran-Contra, MK-Ultra and other Government wrong-doing&#39;s to their own people are the ones who say the Will Smith movie &quot;M.I.B.&quot; is basically true and go around referring to &quot;The Matrix&quot; as things that are alive and extremely real.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we need to get things like this into the front page of reddit and other social networking sites so that people who just visit the reddit news and don&#39;t know about all the subreddit&#39;s can read the information and make up their mind for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, whatever sinister implications aside, I think it has the potential to turn a country that has been hard-scrabble into one that can do well.</p>

<p>In an ideal world (which, unfortunately, this one is not), it could give a lot of people jobs and structure and safety and security.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/world/asia/14minerals.html">NYT</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The value of the newly discovered mineral deposits dwarfs the size of Afghanistan’s existing war-bedraggled economy, which is based largely on opium production and narcotics trafficking as well as aid from the United States and other industrialized countries. <em>Afghanistan’s gross domestic product is only about $12 billion.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they could be looking at $1,000,000,000,000 in minerals now. (Or more as the US dollar declines, think about it.) Only time will tell if it&#39;s used well, but at least it&#39;s some kind of start.</p>

<p>Give people jobs, give people livelihoods. Remember that they don&#39;t have to make $50,000 a year to have a decent career. Just more than they&#39;re making now.</p>

<p>Right now, it appears they&#39;re making $450-750 a year per capita. Anything that raises that potentially leads to a better life.</p>
