       The truth always comes out in the end. A top official admitted on his deathbed that the JFK assassination was an inside job. Eventually a higher up with nothing to lose will confess. The MSM can't control the population like they used to. Will this be a turning point, an end to statism, where a more accountable/freedom based society emerges?

       Most likely with their usual bovine indifference. They will look up from their grazing for a few seconds with a blank look, then continue consuming until death.

       It's human nature to get involved or upset only when something affects you directly. Not when a mystery is solved from 10-20 years ago. It would have no immediate affect on the general population. Hence, there might be a small ripple from the families of the 3,000 dead. Something like "hey! that ain't right...but whatcha gonna do?" only to be followed by a big fat nothing.

       That is not true. Maybe you. I boycott the Media. Have not paid a cable bill since 2002. I got rid of my XM in 2006. I have all of my wealth in gold and silver. I support people like Ron Paul and Peter Schiff. I have a sub reddit to help in the infowar and speak the truth everywhere I go. I do my part the best I know how. Anything I can do against the system, I do. My current goal is to move out in the middle of nowhere and live off the land.

       Get mad. Get informed and involved. Boycott the mainstream media. Run for office and educate others in the process, like Ron Paul. Eventually, bring people to justice. Looking the other way only emboldens these people to do more. Especially us men. We are suppose to protect the women and children. It is not stupid. The amount of people awake and getting involved is growing. We do not need everyone to fix things. Just a dedicate few, just like our founding fathers and mothers. In the end, let it not be said we did nothing.

       What I find so startling is that people can know that 9/11 was a staged event, yet they won't even understand the broader implications of it at all.  It should be obvious to anyone with a brain that the Iraq War and The Afghanistan War were both contingent on the event of 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically, people will push the emotional stress of knowing about 9.11 into their subconscious.  And then they'll go back to being idiots.

       alright, what do you do when faced with that information?  did you stop the government when you finally found out?  begin forming an underground network to take down 'the man'?

      <p>
       even with 'the truth' out there, what the hell is there to do?  those responsible still have all the cards and can sway the opinion of the masses easily with disinformation and other propaganda.  there really isn't any starting points other than "well don't trust the govt anymore!" and i'm not sure i know anyone that does trust them to be honest.

       You acquire Wisdom.  I have no interest in trying to save anyone else.  I'm only concerned with my own knowledge.  No need to be pessimistic about it.  What do you do when you find out about the BP oil spill?  Why do you read the news when you can't do anything about it?  Why were you interested in dinosaurs when you were a child?

       A friend of mine made this journey recently.  It led to a bout of drinking and self destructiveness which, although not unprecedented, was pretty much a direct result of his becoming hopeless about the way the world was going.  I'd hate to see this even partly mirrored on an American/global basis; things could get very messy.  That's why I think it's crucial we spend more time exploring how we can get our countries back from the plutocrats who run them for their own amusement and enrichment currently.

       Agreed.  The first material step is to depower their "war machine".   I don't mean the DoD,  but The Media.   I'm stunned, stunned that anyone still rents a movie or owns a TV,  those monthly checks you write to The Cartel are all they need to enslave us forever.  It's trading with the Enemy in a most literal sense.

       For sure.  I was just watching a short documentary called Media and Globalization which covered the role of the indie media, and for example, how the police in Italy raided their offices in Genoa during the G8 meeting there, brutalizing indie journalists and smashing computers, stealing hard drives etc. because they showed the full extent of police violence against demonstrators.  Shocking.

       Cognitive dissonance. People won't react because they'll think the confession was false rather than accepting an unbelievable truth. For example, after the Warren Commission proposed the magic bullet, there was a Congressional investigation that concluded that Oswald did not act alone. Likewise with the Gulf of Tonkin incident and even the war in Iraq.

       The 'war against terrorism' is a case in point. Everyone and their dog knows it's based on a fallacy but do we do anything about it. No, we (the majority) readily digest whatever propaganda is being diseminated at the time.

       I don't know if he could disagree.  More than any other president before
him, I think Bush was the most controlled figure head/puppet of any other president in recent history - he was
       <em>
        placed
       </em>
       in the office by the people around him and
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       were the ones telling
       <em>
        him
       </em>
       what to say and do.  Let's face it, Bush is a man of modest intellect - I don't think he acted stupid - he really is.

       You're overestimating the power and profundity of the White House. Like all presidents, Bush is far, far below the level of those who organized 9/11. He knows that the fate of Kennedy awaits any who challenge the Jewish Establishment or their machinations. If you recall, Kennedy was killed for threatening the Federal Reserve, the private property of the Jewish mafia.

       Kennedy refused to carry out operation Northwoods. He said no. And that might be one of the reasons they killed him. But all that means is that Bush is such a coward he wouldn't risk anything, not even with the SS protecting him.

       Where did I say he gets a free pass?  I said he was stupid not innocent.  What exactly is your problem?  I think we are of the same mind here and that you simply believe Bush made more of these decisions himself than I believe.  He was told what to say and did.  He still has to be accountable because he accepted the office and took the oath despite being an imbicile.  If you want to discuss this further why not take it up with someone who disagrees with you?

       That's an interesting question. I think the fact that these monsters have not been brought to justice has caused many Americans to lose confidence in their government. If they were arrested, tried, convicted and punished, and the constitution restored, I think it would stabilize everything. It is knowing and seeing how they escape punishment that has embittered the American people.

       I assume you're talking about Hunt right?  Yep that sure caused a stir.  People were talking about in line at the supermarket.  The nightly news was abuzz for weeks demanding a new investigation and the release of all still classified evidence.  I thought there might actually be an armed revolution over it.

       We'll have another 10 years of terrible eagle macros except now they'll have "9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JERB" emblazoned on them. No-one will actually do anything constructive or protest as they will be far too busy posting these macros repeatedly on Facebook with their "REPOST IF YOU LOVE AMERICA, IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE AN ILLEGAL FAGNIT!" statuses.

       What everymn said. 
After 47 years, the JFK assassination is still considered a 'mystery'. Lots of people claim they knew a guy who knew a guy who was there, but nobody will ever conclusively know what happened. Nor will Roswell, Bigfoot, the Loch Ness monster or the cancellation of Firefly ever be understood by the common people. 
911 will forever be a conspiracy theory.

       The majority of Americans are stupid and honestly, do not care.  If Emperor Bush II came out tomorrow and said "we purposefully carried 911 to engineer two wars to secure energy resources in the middle east and to prevent China direct access to Iran" all he has to add is "because god told me to" and all will be well.  Hell, fucktard Xitians would be DEFENDING the staged attacks.

       911 was a Jewish operation.  On top of the damning physical, factual and circumstantial evidence  -- 911 bears the signature of unique Jewish arrogance,  especially knowing that Jewish media in America would cover for them.

       That is not true. Maybe you. I boycott the Media. Have not paid a cable bill since 2002. I got rid of my XM in 2006. I have all of my wealth in gold and silver. I support people like Ron Paul and Peter Schiff. I have a sub reddit to help in the infowar and speak the truth everywhere I go. I do my part the best I know how. Anything I can do against the system, I do. My current goal is to move out in the middle of nowhere and live off the land.
