    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t &quot;financial mess&quot; the reason banks got control over The Fed in 1913? Now they essentially &quot;own&quot; America because they use the Income Tax as collateral for their bond sales (no coincidence the Income Tax was born in 1913 as well.) I think Americans are big enough debt slaves already but it&#39;s easy to see how international banksters would want to &quot;scale-up&quot; their market to control the world. It&#39;s blatantly obvious that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing. Imagine if your job entailed loaning out money to people where you &quot;make-up&quot; 90% of the money you &quot;give away&quot; and get someone&#39;s house as collateral. We&#39;re all idiots to be conned this way - big time. Now &quot;The Banksters&quot; are gearing up to con the world. The Only way to prevent this is to follow the US Constitution but precedent is lost and it seems already too late (I vote Tea Party anyway!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would sure like this to be taught in schools...this is where the dumbing down starts via FedKontrolled &quot;Testing&quot; (States hostage to FedSubsidyDollars via DOE). But again, precedent is long set and I think it&#39;s way too late to clue-in the masses. Too many people are MSM brainwashed. (I vote for a &quot;Reddit Leaning&quot; Cable Channel anyway!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rate at which the US is wantonly inflating its currency seems so incredibly irresponsible, so apparent what the ultimate outcome will be, that one can only assume it&#39;s being <em>allowed</em> to continue on that course for a reason.  And that could very well suggest a future <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis">Hegelian event</a>, as you suggest.  Many believe the 1907 crash was engineered and used as an excuse to usher in the Federal Reserve system.  </p>

<p>If a regional currency is their goal (like the rumored Amero as some suggest), the only way to really get America to accept it would be to destroy the dollar first. And if the US continues on its present course, that could very easily happen and in the not too distant future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow and South America?  I think that they will probably be given their own South American dealy.  I was living in Central America for a year and that is even on the outskirts of North America as far as I felt.  I really doubt that culturally or economically South America can be lumped in with the North.  Ya know it gets real skinny in Central America around Panama and you can&#39;t really cross by land into Columbia unless you are Rambo.  So that means there is a huge cultural divergence there.  Basically you should think of North and South America as two different large islands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think most banks are invited in the scheme of things to come, generally speaking.  It&#39;s more like a small group of narcissistic sociopaths with the financial and political muscle to topple just about every financial institution out there and their desire to position themselves as the only center of finance in the world.  Why skim through world currencies, risk your neck manipulating the market (gold, oil, dollars, etc.), engage in modern forms of counterfeiting (that no longer require printing money) and have bureaucrats collecting chump taxes that are hard to keep track of and are often easily avoided when you can just tax the whole fucking planet directly in the form of interest and make up rules as needed along the way.   I&#39;m not saying this for-sport-ego-feeding-frenzy is what they&#39;ll get because it always ends in a disaster with compromises of every sort and infighting amongst themselves, not to mention a few million dead/hungry/homeless motherfuckers (or perhaps future billions) along the way if their abomination can&#39;t get off the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure the Anglo-American New World Order guys want to print money to all end and they may even succeed in completely shackling Europe and North America.  I&#39;m in China at the moment and at the bank they sport huge bars of gold right behind glass. There are movements in the East pushing towards much more gold.  They have increased reserve requirements of banks to try to ease real estate prices downwards and the only culturally acceptable investment left now is gold.  They will be buying gold.</p>

<p>Soo, if the West is going to play their game then they will be able to just lay waste to everything and possibly start an prison planet over there.  I look at it this way, the West is in general better in quality of life but is getting worse at a tremendous rate while over here things are just ok and getting better at a moderate rate.</p>

<p>[afterthought] The rapidly expanding middle class over here will insist on having more power someday in the future.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Europe is having problems right now because they have one currency--when one country is struggling, they all feel it. This is probably better than a single country spiraling down the toilet like Zimbabwe but still it isn&#39;t desirable to have a single form of currency for the whole world. For starters it would but the money changers out of business--why would they want to do that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, i suspect it is more a function of unbridled greed.  </p>

<p>particularly considering the fact that the crisis has brought the closest thing to a world currency--the euro--and the economies of its member states to the brink of collapse, on top of dragging down international markets.  shared currencies result in entire continents--or worlds--to pay the price for any and all irresponsible behavior on the part of individual members states.  minimal upside, massive downside, and the entire world is watching it unfold.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit of a dubious comparison to make in the first place, but the Euro-zone does involve multiple nation states, whereas the US Dollar doesn&#39;t.  that being said, of course, the Dollar is a de facto second currency used in many places (e.g. here in Vietnam) and up until recently largely had a stranglehold in terms of oil transactions.  Indeed, as regards the latter, some believe the Gulf Wars have been partly about Sadaam Hussain&#39;s threat to start charging in Euros rather than Dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand it was not purely about using Euros but about not exclusively using dollars.  This would have opened up the possibility of large customers using their own currencies.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that the Iranian oil bourse in that little free port island that they have really got going.  I&#39;d be interested in someone telling me otherwise.  That is a complicated thing to setup and probably wasn&#39;t helped much by us.</p>

<p>I understand that many people feel that countries are more significant than &quot;states&quot; and that it is more important to know the top leaders of countries than the governors of &quot;states&quot; that have much larger economic activity.  That said it brings up the question of whether culture diversity or economic activity is more significant in the context of global currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  Your tone reminds me of the few occasions when I have said things with a straight face that I knew to be really crazy to get a reaction out of people.</p>

<p>ps.  If you are serious I&#39;m pretty sure that you haven&#39;t traveled much outside of your country because if you had I think that you would appreciate the cultural variance that nationalism produces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rate at which the US is wantonly inflating its currency seems so incredibly irresponsible, so apparent what the ultimate outcome will be, that one can only assume it&#39;s being <em>allowed</em> to continue on that course for a reason.  And that could very well suggest a future <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis">Hegelian event</a>, as you suggest.  Many believe the 1907 crash was engineered and used as an excuse to usher in the Federal Reserve system.  </p>

<p>If a regional currency is their goal (like the rumored Amero as some suggest), the only way to really get America to accept it would be to destroy the dollar first. And if the US continues on its present course, that could very easily happen and in the not too distant future. </p>
