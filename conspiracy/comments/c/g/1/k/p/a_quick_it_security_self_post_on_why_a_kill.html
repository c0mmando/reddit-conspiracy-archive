        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you do some quick checking on wikipedia and other sources, you&#39;ll quickly learn the internet (then called arpanet) was purposefully designed to be a &quot;packet switching&quot; system.  What does that mean?  In a nutshell, if the Russians ever nuked a city in the US, the internet would still be up and running.  Most networks up until that point were built around a &quot;token ring&quot; or &quot;non switched&quot;, which meant if a node went down, a lot of times the network went down with it.</p>

<p>In fact, ever noticed a web site go down?  Of course you have.  It happens every day.  Thanks to packet switching, the rest of the internet doesn&#39;t go with it, or at least the segment that site was on.</p>

<p>Now the people who are proposing this legislation either a) truly do not understand how the internet works or b) using bullshit reasons to get it passed.</p>

<p>Right now, at this very minute, worms, bots, spyware, and viruses are transversing all over the internet.  RIGHT NOW.  Conficker has been the most noticeable, but older worms like &quot;iloveyou&quot; are still out there.  They claim these types of attacks are the reason for this law.  Well if that is the case, they have had countless excuses over the past 15 years to pass this.  China hacking Google earlier this year could have been spun that way.  That attack compromised almost all of Gmail, allowing the Chinese full access to those servers and since Google is distributed (data centers all over the PLANET), why wasn&#39;t a &quot;shutdown&quot; demanded?  The president could have in theory ordered all China and North Korean traffic blocked to the US and Google servers to restrict the compromise.  But that is NOT the purpose of this law.</p>

<p>I could honestly go on and on with example after example but we all know the reason for this and that is control information from the people.  I suspect the next &quot;911&quot; that happens, the internet will be &quot;shut down&quot; to &quot;protect it&quot;.</p>

<p>Call your Reps...they are LYING to you about this law and the purpose for it.</p>

<p>EDIT: Fixed some grammar and I am a IT Security Analyst for a major company.</p>

<p>EDIT2:  I believe the best defense against this problem is for people to educate themselves on how DNS works and set up their own nameservers.  This will allow people to continue surfing if the govt orders the ISPs to disable the ISP nameservers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true.  There are about 11 or 12 core DNS servers.  But a lot of ISPs are not &quot;immediate updaters&quot; (for lack of a better term) and could take days to update their DNS to match.  That is why domain name sellers put in the fine print &quot;could take up to 72 hours&quot; to propagate.</p>

<p>Then there are people like me who manage their own. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was referring to the US DNS servers.  But you are correct.  Many countries now host root nameservers to prevent the US from shutting down their web access.</p>

<p>Now if they can only get ICANN out of the dirty mitts of the US government.</p>

<p>The US govt DIRECTLY controls 11 or 12 or so of the US root nameservers.  I assume can could get control of the ones the telecoms/ISPs manage.</p>

<p>A number of the Internet root nameservers are implemented as clusters of hosts using anycast addressing. The C, F, I, J, K, L and M servers exist in multiple locations on different continents, using anycast address announcements to provide a decentralized service. This has accelerated the deployment of physical (rather than logical) root servers <strong>outside the United States</strong>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  All it takes it flooding your servers with 0.0.0.0 to <a href="http://www.nowhere.com">www.nowhere.com</a> and Bind takes over propagating out to the world.  It will still be possible to navigate with IP addresses, but if you know how and where sites are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be possible if every WAN and backbone router had some sort of standardised take-down protocol built into them that overrode the routers forwarding protocols and shut them down, but this would never happen and anyway you&#39;d be creating a hackers holy grail.

    <div class="md"><p>There actually is, you disable the gateway router IP, then the router stops routing traffic.  But you are correct.  There is no way to mass order that do and with how paranoid companies are today, most do NOT enable automatic updates to any of their hardware, software, or deploy patches.  Instead they test patches &amp; updates in test environments to see what will happen.</p>

<p>It is be cost prohibitive and the vendors would have to agree to implement it.</p>

<p>This is just <em>another</em> story on a kill switch for the internet.  I do doubt it will get passed, like the last few times I think they tried to attach some language to a spending bill or some shit, but I am not too concerned.</p>
