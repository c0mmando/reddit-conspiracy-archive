       Something is very fishy &amp; it doesn't speak well for the stability of our system when a mistake like that can totally buttfuck the market. These markets aren't durable.

       Regardless of the circumstances, the takeaway from this is that the entire stock market is now quite obviously nothing but smoke and mirrors.  For a while, there were ZERO buyers for several stocks that the program trades were trying to unload, meaning they couldn't be sold at any price and revealing that there are no actual PEOPLE making trades anymore... it's all just a game of two-card monty between automated programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, Accenture dropped from $42 to 1 cent in the span of 2 minutes and
       <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2010/05/06/dont-feel-bad-accenture-these-stocks-fell-to-under-a-penny/">
        Exelon, Sam Adams and a handful of others sunk to basically zero
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that the type of market you want to sink your life savings into?  Moreover, even if you short the market knowing this will probably happen again someday soon, now they're stepping in to cancel trades so you can't profit from it.  The powers that be are pulling out all the stops to keep this market afloat, and events like this temporarily lift the curtain... WILL YOU PAY ATTENTION or will you believe the "oh, it was some fat-fingered nimrod at Citi" cover story?

       Get your money out and buy some fookin gold &amp; silver, people!  This isn't an money-making investment tip, it's a dire warning that the global economic house of cards is on the verge of tumbling down and when it does, REAL money will be the ONLY money accepted.

       I don't think this one is a "conspiracy" in the definition of conspiracy.  I think this is just proof that people are paying attention more.  That the economy built upon smoke and mirrors, and gravity will eventually win.

      <p>
       My analogy is like a scene in the greatest movie ever "Time Bandits" in which  when using a rope to repel, they run out of rope to climb down.  So they cut the rope at the top to get to the bottom.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Several market participants cited speculation that a trader at Citigroup had erroneously placed an order for at least $16 billion in E-Mini contracts -- stock market index futures contracts that trade on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Globex trading platform.
       </p>
       <p>
        But a source familiar with the situation said Citigroup had traded a total of just $9 billion of the E-Mini contracts, adding that that amounted to less than 3 percent of the $319 billion traded on the E-Mini on Thursday.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's still speculation on Citibank's involvement. Also, the populist amendment in question failed 61 to 33 last night and was a long-shot to begin with since the day my senator drafted it.
