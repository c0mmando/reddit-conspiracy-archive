    <div class="md"><p>OK, here&#39;s the deal.  </p>

<p>Tesla and Westinghouse had <em>just</em> wired all of NYC for electricity. Tesla had created the hydro-electric power plant at Niagara Falls. </p>

<p>He goes to Colorado for a rest and to do some experiments, comes up with the Magnifying Transmitter which broadcasts electricity (with way less loss than transmitting power through powerlines) and then comes back to NYC to build Wardenclyffe tower to do just that.</p>

<p>The technology was proven. It was demonstrated at the World&#39;s Fair.  It works just fine . . . </p>

<p>But he needs investors to finish the tower and start mass producing the equpiment to receive the power on devices . . . and his financiers (including JP Morgan) said . . . . &quot;What do you mean give electricity away for free . . . how the hell are we going to charge for that?&quot;</p>

<p>And stop funding him and start calling him a kook.</p>

<p>You can go verify all of this.  There are magazine articles showing a toy ship he demonstrated that he controlled using his wireless power transmission solution.  It had no batteries, no gas engine.  The power came from the transmitter to drive the onboard electric motor.</p>

<p>Finally . . . people who haven&#39;t researched the matter think he was sending power like radio waves.  He wasn&#39;t.  Go look at his research at Colorado Springs and into his work with transformers . . . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was also trying to transmit energy through the earth itself, he claims he was getting echoes from his waves he was pumping into the earth, and that it acted like a huge conductor of sorts. He theorized they were bouncing off the other side of the earth or something.</p>

<p>I got a book of his patents and colorado notes and i remember him writing its inefficient to transmit electricity via the atmosphere unless at high altitudes... when i get home i&#39;ll find the patent number if anyones interested.</p>

<p>All matter <em>is/once was/will be</em> energy.</p>

<p>That is known.</p>

<p>The problem is how to change it back into usable energy, the people at LHC are going to find out that the higgs boson isn&#39;t going to be a defined &quot;particle&quot;, it&#39;s a concept.  The concept of an alternate form of Logic.  Where there isn&#39;t just &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; but variations and degrees of both, including &quot;boolean truths&quot; being, both, neither, or the negative of their sum.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to get that deep into it, because of course I would be labeled a kook and a <em>dumbass</em> but the truth isn&#39;t dependent on your belief (or mine for that matter) so I really couldn&#39;t give a fuck less :)</p>

<p>You&#39;ll see soon enough, and if not, then none of us will be around anyway so it doesn&#39;t matter. </p>

<p>Remember Einstein? he had a pretty simple equation he was working on but never completed:  E=mc<sup>2.</sup></p>

<p>Yeah, as with all equations mc<sup>2=E</sup> is also true.  How do you get mass to that velocity? And then what happens? Hmm...</p>

<p>And there&#39;s the straw man!  Did I say that?  No.</p>

<p>Can one &quot;create&quot; energy?  Not to my knowledge.  Does &quot;nobody&quot; know the second law applies only to closed systems?  I would <em>hope</em> your physics teacher thought to mention that minor detail, but even if he didn&#39;t it&#39;s common knowledge with Tesla fans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are issues . . . </p>

<p>For one thing, you can&#39;t conduct this research in secret or quietly.  Tesla coils screw with radio reception, and the larger they are, the more they do it.  Also, you need receivers. </p>

<p>Also, you need a source of power to &quot;step up&quot;.  In a sense its like when you play a piano key and the near by cello thrums along.  They are on the same frequency. </p>

<p>Only you aren&#39;t using sound . . . you are using electromagnetic (NOT RADIO -- magnetic) oscillations.</p>

<p>SO, you need a huge power source, hopefully continuous, to set up the oscillations . . . and you need to get the receivers deployed.</p>

<p>Its not trivial, and it&#39;s not &quot;secret&quot;. </p>

<p>TED had a presentation on it.
<a href="http://blog.ted.com/2009/08/wireless_electr.php">http://blog.ted.com/2009/08/wireless_electr.php</a></p>

<p>Nuclear power can be metered and it can be controlled.  If you invest billions to develop something like that, you get your money back.  Doesn&#39;t happen with wireless power.  </p>

<p>And, seriously, it is very destabilizing.  Imagine Darfur . . . with power. Imagine Afghanistan with power. Imagine Iraq with power.  Infinite power world wide.</p>

<p>Tesla was right. You can use this shit to make electrial shields -- so a plane or missile that crosses a threshhold detonates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just asked a physicist friend of mine yesterday. He said tesla&#39;s idea is based on induction, and that we can broadcast power wirelessly pretty easily, and to a degree our power lines to wirelessly broadcast very small amounts of electricity - he then showed me a picture online of a guy holding a fluorescent bulb in his hand under some power lines - it was lit up.</p>

<p>he said the main problem with broadcasting electricity across huge areas like that is that 1) it&#39;s very inefficient - we would lose most of the power we broadcast and we just don&#39;t generate enough yet to make it feasible, and 2) as strong as it would have to be, it would likely hurt any biological thing in its path</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tesla reported that the power loss was actually very low when power was broadcast along the earth&#39;s resonant frequency, which makes sense. </p>

<p>Its a bit of a hard thing for you or I to test . . . </p>

<p>Since Tesla could make ball lighting, and developed most of the technologies we use today (from generators/turbines/the Radio (the supreme court ruled <em>against</em> marconi and in favor of Tesla) . . . and since Tesla was at the very top of his game when he worked in Colorado Springs (having just turned Niagara Falls into a hydro-electric power plant for New York City), there&#39;s virtually no chance he was wrong about the Magnifying Transmitter.

<p>Furthermore he demonstrated the technology in multiple applications.  It works, well, without much power loss at all.  We don&#39;t use it. </p>

<p>Its probably for the best.  Because really, his notion of making power available worldwide, for free, would be quite destabilizing.  </p>

<p>As he pointed out, the technology can be weaponized to create electromagnetic shields that kill warheads (planes, tanks, cars etc) that pass through it.  How&#39;s that going to be a good thing when we&#39;re waging all these wars?</p>

<p>:)</p>

<p>N.</p>

<p>PS:  My favorite Tesla trick is when he attached what amounts to a vibrator to a vertical steel beam in one of his buildings.  He tuned it to the beams resonant frequency and left it running.  Before long it was having a big impact on neighboring buildings.

    <div class="md"><p>I read a conspiracy theory that said the Titanic was switched with its damaged sister shortly before it was to set sail. The boat was sunk on purpose. This was at the time The Federal Reserve was trying to get itself set up.

<p>First, the documentaries are mostly factual (read: rigorous).  Second, Tesla&#39;s patents are available all over these interwebs, and they are superbly rigorous, <em>if you can read them</em>.  Hardly &quot;pseudo-science&quot;, nor did the USPTO think so.  Thirdly, there are some user comments here that are spot on accurate - reflecting a <em>working</em> knowledge of some of Tesla&#39;s core concepts.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume you&#39;re not trolling.  If so, any link herein is a valid lead to more information.  If it is an understanding of Tesla&#39;s patents you want, starting with Wardenclyffe (and, of course, the patents/experiments that got it funded in the first place) is as good a place as any.  As <strong>nfulton</strong> correctly said: &quot;The technology was proven. It was demonstrated at the World&#39;s Fair. It works just fine.&quot;</p>

<p>And that was 100-odd years ago.  Ed Gray, Gabriel Kron, Tom Bearden, John Bedini... many <em>many</em> people understand the phenomena and have reproduced the results.</p>

<p>YMMV.</p>

<p>Pal, this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  One of the most common tactics of trolls is to draw honest people into long drawn out debates - with no intention of actually learning anything, and every intention of nitpicking minutae, primarily as a <em>time suck</em>.  As many here, <em>certainly</em> if they have a working knowledge of Tesla, have been around the block a few times, it really should be no surprise that they no longer take the bait.</p>

<p>The information is one google search away.  You seem to be unable to find Google?  Or is it that you don&#39;t know what a search engine is?  Or is it that you&#39;re just fucking wasting my time with dumb questions and silly dissembling?</p>

<p>Be well.</p>

<p>What is it that I&#39;m even supposed to be looking for?  Is it really a time suck to give a 2 sentence overview of what we&#39;re even talking about?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not asking for a research paper with citations, I&#39;m asking for a quick explanation of what&#39;s even being discussed.  Each reply in this post has an entirely different interpretation of what it is that&#39;s being discussed.  Rather than bitching at me for wasting your time wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just write a sentence or two describing this apparent invention?</p>

<p>Tesla left the bone right there, please do a little research on your own, mmm-kay?</p>

<p>One thing he was doing was causing &quot;electro-radiant events&quot; and transforming the resultant electro-static potential in the tuned receiving coil into traditional voltage.  That should be <em>more</em> than enough of a hint for you to get searching.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The patent and copyright systems encourage original thought and creative development. I will agree that they could use modifications, but they are very useful and serve an important purpose, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Also I was being rather sarcastic in that initial post. I mean, is this guy still alive? If he has filed for patents, and they <em>work</em>, I would assume he has demonstrated them to potential investment partners (including the government). If that is the case, how has this device never been produced or even seen the light of day? It leaves me very skeptical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s still alive, no one has been able to track him down since the videos surfaced, there was a member on a forum who was allegedly communicating with him through e-mail in 2006, but I have never seen any conclusive evidence that it was really Steven Mark, and the e-mails that were posted seem a little fishy to me, so the forum member may be posting disinfo, so the only thing I really have to go on is the videos &amp; Jack Durbin&#39;s story .  </p>

<p>Steven Mark has indeed shown his invention to many potential investors, you can see them in some of the videos, but he refused to turn over any of his prototypes so the investors could independently verify that the TPU really does what he claims, so most of the investors refused to invest,
I think Mr Durbin said that Steven was afraid the investors would steal his invention, so he never let the prototypes out of his sight, even Mr Durbin was never allowed to get a look inside the device or see any schematics/drawings etc .</p>

<p>apparently, his lawyer bought up the device prototypes &amp; plans and started a company called U.E.C. (the logo is on the later videos), no one has been able to find the company either.</p>

<p>And no one has heard from Steven Mark or U.E.C. ever since .</p>

<p>Keep in mind, as I&#39;m sure you are well aware, this device could literally change the world overnight, and there are alot of very powerful people, with very very deep pockets who would not want this device to ever see the light of day .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going to throw this out there.</p>

<p>Clearly there&#39;s a few people in this thread who have a working conceptual knowledge of Tesla&#39;s radiant energy work.  Yay.  Would y&#39;all be interested in starting <a href="/r/freeenergy">/r/freeenergy</a> or something?  I <em>cannot</em> be the admin, tho I could possibly be a mod (I may not understand reddit mods well btw) - I have too many pots cooking right now to add another one, especially one I would care deeply about.  My general feeds give me plenty of material to <em>submit</em> however, some of which may be new to you, as I hope some of your stuff would be new to me.</p>

<p>Any interest?</p>

<p>Point #1: one pot I&#39;m cooking is uncensored information engines, which bears on this idea in that it <em>will</em> be trolled, and mods should be selected w/ some care to prevent cointelpro style tactics.</p>

<p>Point #2: It might be worth calling it <a href="/r/teslatech">/r/teslatech</a>, or something designed to <em>limit</em> posts to a subset of the genre.  Otherwise you leave yourself open for a lot of spam and disinfo.  Tesla&#39;s &quot;radiant energy&quot; work alone is an entire cosmology, in a sense.  It hardly limits serious students, yet provides a clear line in the sand for deleting nonsense.</p>

<p>Point #3: as per above I&#39;d advise NOT picking between applied vs theoretical - two sides of the same coin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really think it was a conspiracy. Tesla did power all the florescent lighting in his laboratory using wireless electricity. This is an easily re-creatable experiment. You can get a florescent light bulb (the tube kind not the new compacts) and hold it near an electric field and it will light up. The problem with this system is power transmission. Things like florescent lights don&#39;t use a lot of power, that&#39;s why all the environmentalist want people to switch to them. Your standard 120V (240 for Europeans) wall socket can output 10 to 20 amps usually, with all the sockets in you house plus the major appliances is a few hundred amps just to your house.  Air does not transmit current well at all, so in order to do this you need a very high voltage and a step down transformer on the receiving end (converts voltage to current).
All and All it&#39;s just not feasible to transmit <em>power</em>, not just voltage, in large supply across long distances. A few research labs are trying to solve this problem using lasers and things like that. So far the best results have been lighting a few LED&#39;s a few hundred feet apart.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A tower to transmit power through the air would be incredibly wasteful, since the vast majority of the power wouldn&#39;t hit a receiver.  Radio stations consume thousands of watts to tickle a few electrons in each receiver antenna.<br/>
Also, if you put up a tall enough tower with a wire on it, you do get a deadly charge of electrical build up, but it&#39;s not enough <em>power</em> to do anything useful except disrupt someones nervous system.  Think of the shock you get when you slide your feet on carpet, then try shocking yourself with a light bulb between your hand and the grounded object.  Maybe a small florescent light would flash briefly?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Air dissipates electric energy much more quickly than do wires. You&#39;d lose efficiency simply trying to send energy this way, even if the receiver and source are tuned to a precise resonance. The source would have to waste significant energy simply sending it to a receiver. And &#39;free energy&#39; would be minuscule and unable to meet most power needs. The technology would probably be expensive to develop and distribute with little return in investment. But you&#39;re welcome to build a system if you&#39;d like. No one will stop you.</p>

It would be a huge worldwide conspiracy to cover that kind of technology up since it&#39;s been decades and thousands if not millions of scientists have better knowledge about the world now than Tesla did. All he found out was that the ionosphere has energy, to actually harness it just seems very unrealistic. As I said he missed out on decades of breakthroughs, and something that big would require in depth knowledge of more than just electromagnetism and rudimentary engineering. </p>

<p>he said the main problem with broadcasting electricity across huge areas like that is that 1) it&#39;s very inefficient - we would lose most of the power we broadcast and we just don&#39;t generate enough yet to make it feasible, and 2) as strong as it would have to be, it would likely hurt any biological thing in its path</p>
