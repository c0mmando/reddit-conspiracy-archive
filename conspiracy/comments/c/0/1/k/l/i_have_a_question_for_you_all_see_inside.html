        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, here on the conspiracy thread, we have a lot of information. We have some good stuff, some shill stuff, some random stuff, and some kooks. </p>

<p>First, how do we filter out the shills, the disinformants, and disregard the kooky bastards (that think everything - no matter what - that involves the gov&#39;t is a terrible thing)?</p>

<p>Second, I see a whole lot of info here, but not a lot of what to do. What does one do to get out of the system, <strong>or</strong> actually start exposing shit - I mean, yes there are quite a few leaks in the government (mostly on the beaurocratic level), but really - how much of the CIA/NSA shit is actually out there, exposed, readable - I mean recent shit...not stuff from the 60&#39;s about JFK, I&#39;m talking Cheney connections to Halliburton with connections to CIA, or CIA economic hitmen...how do we start to stem the vastly overpowered CIA? </p>

<p>What does the NSA actually do - I mean really - besides an echelon program/data mining, <em>what the fuck goes on in there</em>? </p>

<p><em>Is</em> there a means in which to start to unravel their powergrip on the US?</p>

<p>Is there a place that we can aggregate data - concrete indisputable data?</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to start with getting more than 5 frames of the pentagon plane from 9/11...<em>why have we still not seen any of the surrounding facilities footage?!</em></p>

<p>I suppose in order to quell my rambling mind, I&#39;ll just ask:</p>

<p>Alright, we know theres some shady shit going on. What does one do? The whole &quot;spread the word&quot; vibe just isn&#39;t cutting it for me...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about we start doing some <em>real</em> research?  We could start submitting Freedom of Information requests based on good, solid leads.  We could make an organization chart of power interests around the globe.  Start finding out who owns who then offer up a searchable database like wikileaks.  Start putting the pieces together and temporarily filling in the shadowy gaps.  We could give each &quot;part of the puzzle&quot; a rank or score based on how well it&#39;s been corroborated.  Eventually, we might be able to determine high probabilities of conspiracies at work.  After all, we know there are conspiracies at the small, personal level.  We know large conspiracies in the past have been proven true.  There almost HAS to be current large conspiracies at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NSA probably does generally what it was always intended to do - only much more of it - which is collect data, decrypt it when needed and analyze it and of course protect the government from other people who&#39;re doing the same sort of thing.  I&#39;d guess that these days they can tap anything anywhere.   I doubt they are up to all sorts of shady shit, that&#39;s usually going to be done by much more secret agencies, ones that don&#39;t have three letter names ... ones that have no letter names.  One exception might be blackmail - with so much information it would probably not be out of the realm of likelihood for blackmail to occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been labeled a &quot;shill&quot; in the past for doing nothing more than playing the devil&#39;s advocate in some cases. There&#39;s things I believe, there&#39;s things to me that don&#39;t seem right, but sometimes there are people&#39;s rationales that seem <em>totally</em> far-fetched.</p>

<p>Who knows though - they could be the ones that are &quot;most right&quot;.  </p>
