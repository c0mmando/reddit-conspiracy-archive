       So, here on the conspiracy thread, we have a lot of information. We have some good stuff, some shill stuff, some random stuff, and some kooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, how do we filter out the shills, the disinformants, and disregard the kooky bastards (that think everything - no matter what - that involves the gov't is a terrible thing)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I see a whole lot of info here, but not a lot of what to do. What does one do to get out of the system,
       <strong>
        or
       </strong>
       actually start exposing shit - I mean, yes there are quite a few leaks in the government (mostly on the beaurocratic level), but really - how much of the CIA/NSA shit is actually out there, exposed, readable - I mean recent shit...not stuff from the 60's about JFK, I'm talking Cheney connections to Halliburton with connections to CIA, or CIA economic hitmen...how do we start to stem the vastly overpowered CIA?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does the NSA actually do - I mean really - besides an echelon program/data mining,
       <em>
        what the fuck goes on in there
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Is
       </em>
       there a means in which to start to unravel their powergrip on the US?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a place that we can aggregate data - concrete indisputable data?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to start with getting more than 5 frames of the pentagon plane from 9/11...
       <em>
        why have we still not seen any of the surrounding facilities footage?!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose in order to quell my rambling mind, I'll just ask:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alright, we know theres some shady shit going on. What does one do? The whole "spread the word" vibe just isn't cutting it for me...

       How about we start doing some
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       research?  We could start submitting Freedom of Information requests based on good, solid leads.  We could make an organization chart of power interests around the globe.  Start finding out who owns who then offer up a searchable database like wikileaks.  Start putting the pieces together and temporarily filling in the shadowy gaps.  We could give each "part of the puzzle" a rank or score based on how well it's been corroborated.  Eventually, we might be able to determine high probabilities of conspiracies at work.  After all, we know there are conspiracies at the small, personal level.  We know large conspiracies in the past have been proven true.  There almost HAS to be current large conspiracies at work.

       That doesn't sound like a bad idea actually.  there's plenty of evidence to connect dots, plenty of money trails to follow and plenty of material to examine.  but there needs to be a current examination and corroboration of it.  is there some sort collaborative website that offers a way for people to contribute to a flow chart type arrangement? possibly set up a place to upload material for review.  It wouldn't take long with a few decently read and committed people to have a fairly detailed picture.

       They have a live site with data from data.gov (yeah, boring) that shows how to use their tools to uncover fraud with subcontractors on KBR projects:

       And for more fun, they have a training version that takes you through the first WTC bombing:

       Giving away ideas on how to filter out this stuff would be well intentioned, indeed.   But consider for a moment that there are certain elements here who'd love nothing more than to get their hands on these filtering methods in order to manipulate public opinion.  All I'm saying is inform others,  share and discuss your findings, but for the love of whatever you hold sacred don't hand over all the keys to a bunch of soulless beurocratic/private think tanks who don't give a fuck about you.

       Right. I'm sure they can and

        would

       sway people with the same system, I'm just trying to figure out what to do - because we all know there's some shit going down, but can't do anything about it - and that's what I'm trying to come with ideas as to how to fix that.

       The NSA probably does generally what it was always intended to do - only much more of it - which is collect data, decrypt it when needed and analyze it and of course protect the government from other people who're doing the same sort of thing.  I'd guess that these days they can tap anything anywhere.   I doubt they are up to all sorts of shady shit, that's usually going to be done by much more secret agencies, ones that don't have three letter names ... ones that have no letter names.  One exception might be blackmail - with so much information it would probably not be out of the realm of likelihood for blackmail to occur.

       Yeah, reddit already filters information through stealth bans, etc. Beyond an upvote/downvote, I don't want a bunch of anonymous people with unknown agendas determining what information or idea has merit and what doesn't. The MSM does that enough already.

       To really effect change, you have to either operate outside or on the fringe of all social constructs - like they do - or inundate people with information through the media - like they do.

       Don't take this the wrong way, but you're being lazy.  The only way to get to the truth is with work.  There's one thing you can be sure of: if there's a short cut to the truth, it's probably a lie.

       How so? I'm more asking what to do about it - how to get started - yes there were some questions I had regarding events, but I think you're under the impression that I want to know it all right here right now - Yes, I do, but that's not going to happen. I fully expect that not to happen. WHAT WORK do I do to get going on it? not, what truth is available? catch my drift?
