We are not just Whores for power and oil, but killer whores with hate and fear in our hearts. We are human scum, and that is how history will judge us. No redeeming social value. Just whores. Get out of our way, or we&#39;ll kill you. Who does vote for these dishonest shitheads? Who among us can be happy and proud of having all this innocent blood on our hands? Who are these swine? These flag-sucking half-wits who get fleeced and fooled by stupid little rich kids like George Bush? They are the same ones who wanted to have Muhammad Ali locked up for refusing to kill gooks. They speak for all that is cruel and stupid and vicious in the American character. They are the racists and hate mongers among us; they are the Ku Klux Klan. I piss down the throats of these Nazis. And I am too old to worry about whether they like it or not. Fuck them.     -Hunter S. Thompson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do we do now? - Mr. Change got elected by promising to change all that and now he&#39;s just like Bush.  We need to pull our troops out of all the wars and most of the countries we are in and turn a deaf ear to all the neo-cons who will call us isolationists. Our true enemies are the arms companies and their lobbyists who must keep us in a constant state of war in order for their shareholders to profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How? Does any body have a solid plan? Or even the start of an idea, other than just pull them out of the war.
I don&#39;t have a plan, I have no idea where to even start, besided the usual write my congressman, or protest, and boycott.
Our govornment has become an unstopbable beast, that no military in the world could take down.
The only thing that would maybe stop this, is if the world would place a world wide imbargo on the USA. That would wake up the people real fast. It would have to be the World verse the USA. As selfish as our gate keepers have become they would use nukes on any country that got involved, because of course they&#39;re the bad guys.
Hey, it&#39;s the start of a plan...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well if you are awake to the fact that the left right paradigm is, well...a paradigm then keep going and realize if your peon brain can think this it theirs already has.  Smoke screen upon some screen, layer upon layer the game is rigged.  The table is tilted and all that good shit.
Eventually you look around you and see very few like you and then realized you are fucked (strength in numbers,etc.) and just say fuck it, &quot;I&#39;m going to live my life until I can&#39;t any more and then I&#39;ll deal with the shit because I have too, because it will have taken over and all we can do is wait for it&quot;.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s where I am and despite how it sounds, I&#39;m okay with it.  Just trying to find my way further down the road.  I&#39;ll eventually come to the it, what ever that means for me (we are all on our own road) and that will be that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair that&#39;s a bit overly dramatic. As a non-American I can say that I&#39;ve met many Americans, and even some of my family are American. Most of them have been educated, articulate and some were well informed. So it&#39;s clearly not the whole nation that is bad. But, the most ignorant, racist, and uninformed people I have ever met were also from the States. My conclusion is that <em>some</em> of the people in America are &quot;Nazi Monsters&quot;, and that the real problem is not the people, but the Engine of America (if you will). It&#39;s the multitude corrupt systems that prey on the uninformed and actively create fear, doubt and ignorance. Lobbyists, Banks, and a wholly unregulated media monster that has created an environment where healthy debate, thoughtfulness and even common human decency are nearly impossible. So while it&#39;s true that America looks like a terrible nation to the rest of the world, Americans are some of it&#39;s hardest hit victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mr. Change is a corporate whore, just like all the others.  We haven&#39;t had a real voice for the people since they shot JFK in the face.  Corporate control of the media, the election process, and our very minds to some extent has completely strangled the dream of democracy and led us directly into fascism.  I fear a bloody war against Viacom and News Corp is really the only solution, and our populace is too fat, drugged, and stupid to know how or why to undergo such an endeavor.  So instead I wait for our increasingly obese and useless population to eventually get taken over by some other power: The Chinese, maybe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are all very disillusioned about who wins in real life and keeps winning in real life. And mainly its not the governments fault for when bad things happen: its the people.</p>

<p>It was very easy to blame the Nazis after ww2 why? Because then you didn&#39;t need to blame the people who put the Nazis into power and kept them there. The people want and the government simply provides. The government isn&#39;t the Nazi monster, the people are by simply being complacent. </p>

<p>You see they allow the nazi monster to exist because its convenient for them. They can oppose in speech and still reap all the benefits. YOU reap all the benefits from them even as you say you would piss down thier throarts. They way the system is set up is no matter what you do you are going to support these people. You can type a thousand words in dissent but as soon as you pay that sales tax on something you have just help the cause once more. </p>

<p>I personally could care less about the government being a monster: Every government over every nation has committed some atrocity and it will never end. There is no pure and peaceful nation or some shit like the media wants to believe. Don&#39;t believe in ideals and fantasies, believe in what works. I think America is doing a fine job more or less in doing just that and will continue to do so. </p>

<p>Though beyond me you really need to examine a system that is no different than any other system on earth. You think America is special but its not every fucking nation has fuck ups in it doing dubious shit for the good of the nation. </p>

<p>By my estimate the only way to fix these problems is simply time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been there, but now I have a whole different perspective.  IMHO the way things are ran right now are as close to perfect as possible.  How else can we control these crazy fucks?  Would you give your five year old a loaded gun?  There is a remedy through knowledge of the law, it&#39;s up to us to find it.  By the time we find it we should be intelligent enough to not be a danger to the public.  After all, the information is very dangerous in the wrong hands.  Are you ready to exercise your right of self determination?</p>
