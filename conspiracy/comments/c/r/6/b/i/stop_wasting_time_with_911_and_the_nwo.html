       The paradigm shift that needs to happen is a transformation from fear to love.  Suspect any outlet which makes you afraid, because this is all part of the pyramid of control.  We live in a top down power system that makes humans either flourish in narcissism or decay in disillusionment.  The current system is all about
       <strong>
        fear
       </strong>
       , vanity, authoritarianism, bipartisanship, and toxic growth.  These are the main systems of control, there are many more.   The real change is love and peace, which promotes unity and cooperation.  The first step is awareness and spreading a positive message to people about a new system.  One without a central banking apparatus controlled by a handful of men operating outside of democratic control.  The entire system that we're up against operates on a system of fear.  If you're afraid please realize that everything will be ok with or without you or this country or this civilization or this planet.  We need to have a positive outlook on life and a willingness to smile and look people in the eye and really mean it and help them if needed.  If this meme spread the systems of control would start to disintegrate.  Once humanity stops being afraid, it can start really getting to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first big change I think about is a new
       <strong>
        open source
       </strong>
       electronic government monitored by anyone subscribed to the repository.  I suppose it's called a technocracy.  A completely open system that can still be backwards compatible so that grandma can still vote in her local church.  For the rest of us with technology, "evoting" has eliminated the middle man.  We can use the app on most devices and get all the facts, along with dissenting opinion.  Together we can make our own opinions, and our digitally signed hyper-secure votes are all processed by an open source system which can fully analyze and verify all the traffic, down to the bit.  The collective consciousness can finally be fully realized.  We need a real time system that offers a variety of options in a new media kind of way controlled by its own opennes, not by any corporation or agency.  Ask anyone in this country and they will agree that the special interest groups are deviating the democratic process, at the least.  We now have the technology to fix that and a host of other middle man issues.  You are the voter.  You are the vote.   I think commercial advertising should be eliminated, but I guess we can vote on that on our portable device of choice.  Maybe we'll vote to end all corporate media in one swoop.  This is the power that the owners of the matrix really fear and despise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans need to realize what the systems of control are, and a public agency has to monitor this.  We also need to be keenly aware of the distractions which constantly infect our minds like infotoxins.  Marketing, advertising, corporate news; all only promote either fear or narcissism.  "Be afraid of this or buy that because it will make you less afraid."  The rest of the time is distractions from the real, waking life.  All of the distractions promote narcissism.  Famous athletes and celebrities are just vainglory distractions which offer no real benefit to humanity.  While you may become inspired by one, the daily onslaught of the media system only provides you with fear that you will never be as opulent or prosperous or beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to stop indulging ourselves and our ideas.  Let's start loving our combined culture and our species and our planet.  Our unique, beautiful ecosystem is of paramount importance.  This has nothing to do with taxing carbon and setting up bureaucracies to control it or setting up a global totalitarian government.  Things have to become more localized and stabilized.  Sustainability is the key to survival, not allegiance to a central method of control through a constantly growing debt system.  We have to find a way to live in harmony with Earth, and the
       <strong>
        current money system
       </strong>
       isn't going to work anymore.  It hasn't been able to handle our current problems and it won't be able to handle the problems of the future.  Ultimately, we need to liberate mankind from jobs which can be automated and pursue our educational and artistic passions to explore the universe and solve all of mankind's problems.  This concept goes well beyond any preconceived notion of capitalism vs communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one can do it alone.  I hope the internet can find a way.

       What song is that from?  I couldn't agree more with that message.  It is about a personal change that each person has to commit to.  I haven't driven a car in 7 years, I only use public transit, I try to eat as much natural food as possible.  I don't own a television or a radio.  These are simple things that anyone can do to start their own personal journey to awakening.

       you aren't the only one who thinks this way. your numbers are larger than you ever imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
       while preparing the replacement system of self-governance, the open/free model needs to be extended to all aspects of the current system. EDS/HP/Compaq can swallow a competitor whole, but they cannot compete with 30,000 small corporations offering a product based on open standards with razor-thin profit margins. not even Google can compete.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anonymous has taught us that none of us are as cruel and horrible as all of us. it is the weapon we have made out of our collective imperfections, creating a technological mycellium to replace the current system and it's masters. as they'd put it, "when you see it, you'll shit bricks."
      </p>
      <p>
       it's already in process, and it cannot be stopped.  their capstone is in the process of being replaced with the top tier of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. You can smell the fear in their attempts at controlling the damage already caused.

       The hippies tried that back in the 60's.  It scarred the hell out of the establishment. It was a movement of people that didn't want "things".  Needless to say, it did not maintain traction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I my humble opinion, if you want to change the world, you need to change your own life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live how you want the the world to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop watching TV, and movies.  Fill your life with the influences that you want to imbibe.  Think the thoughts that you want to be thinking. Not the thoughts put in your head by the media and the grapevine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: IMHO, voting is bullshit, (although I do vote).  But, as a famous man once said, "It is not who votes that counts, but,... who counts the vote."  and "If voting worked, it would be illegal."

      <p>
       Movies I'll watch now and then but I'm selective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watched Inception the other day. It's about creating your own reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very conspiracy oriented film that I'll probably self.conspiracy soon.

       Exactly.. this is what I do.. I rarely go to the movie and don't watch actual TV, I pick and choose what I want to watch. I've noticed more and more the shows and movies I choose to watch have some underlying themes of metaphysics, creating your own reality, conspiracy, time travel, etc. that relates to my interests and research. Inception was one of those few movies I went to the movies to see and I thought it was brilliant, I saw it twice!

       yes, the Hippies scared the shit out of them. their Laurel Canyon invention went too far, and they lost control of it.

       this time, we have anonymity and flashmob mentality. our communication is encrypted; unbreakable and unmonitorable. we understand the internet on a much deeper level than they do. The livestock is starting to become smarter than the farmers. Nothing in their manuals covered this problem, so they're trying everything in the book at once. Panic is fun to see in your master's eye, right before his throat is cut.

       Exactly.  It's about a personal change first and foremost.  The second step is waving the flag and helping other people to realize their own inner beauty, to reject what the matrix is constantly hammering into their brains.

       The hippie movement in the 60's didn't scare the hell out of the establishment, it was created by them and therefore destroyed by them too. The fact that the hippies rose and fell was a false paradigm anyway so using their fall as an excuse not to try at all is pretty nihilistic.

       I've had some good luck lately with simply being positive.  Smiling at people, loving my family, being grateful.  Once I realized that all I really need to do is love, and be loved, it got a lot easier for me.  The author Dannion Brinkley's near death experience book "Secrets from the Light" for some reason literally flipped that switch in me, and I understood.

       A switch flipped for me too, and I think it's happening to a growing number of people.  My own personal experience was just talking to this girl who enjoyed my dj set at a club a couple weeks ago.  She told me that all I have to do is share my energy with other people, and I could receive an unlimited amount of positivity.  So far it's working unbelievably well.  Strangers smile at me all the time now and just start talking to me on the bus.  It's like somehow they know.  There is some kind of global consciousness that is finally waking up, I don't really understand how this system works but I'm going to keep on truckin because it feels amazing.  The era of fear is over.

       We ARE actually in complete control.  Nothing gets done without the people to run the machine.  If we were informed and all on the same page, we would stop participating and they would have no power.

       "They" are anyone having a good life, anyone distracted by Mtv, football scores, or TMZ, anyone earning a lot of money or coasting through life, anyone depressed enough to feel hopeless.  "They" are many of us.  The problem old governments had was totally crushing most people into slavery.  This government has figured out that if you keep most people moderately happy, you can do whatever the fuck you want and only a few people will cry about it at a time.  Those people can be demonized, marginalized and otherwise cast aside.  This government will need a huge amount of people to stop them, and those people have to be willing to throw away "The American Dream" as it has been taught to them.

       Well stated and cited.  I guess what I mean by this country's contribution to "bread and circuses" is the absolute entrenchment of those industries: sports, entertainment, paparazzi, fake news, etc.

       That's the fear talking.  Once awareness is a reality, only one thing needs to change to start the ball rolling for huge changes and we all know it's the central banking system.  If our species can't make this one change then we're most likely just going to die off.  Not that I'm afraid of that either :)

Always with these fake-ass videos of bad guys condemning America. 5 different Osama characters. A pudgy white "jihadi" who can't follow his script. All to sell us a fear campaign.

       You cannot abolish a republic. If you do you have no one to assume responsability and people fall in the hands of the media that will divide and conquer the minions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What should be done is to enforce responsibility and reduce government and empower populations so that they can provide for themselves. Also a public TV channel were highest voted videos are passed would be nice.
