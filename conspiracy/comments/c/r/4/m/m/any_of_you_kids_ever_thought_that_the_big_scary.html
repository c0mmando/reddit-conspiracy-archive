       only morons use the term "conspiracy theory".  It means that the speaker knows nothing about the subject X, but wants to dismiss those ("conspiracy theorists") who know more than he or she ever will.

       It is just common garden anti-intellectualism. When you ask someone (of the stupidest 90%) if they believe that airline fuel melts steel, their reponse isn't in the domain of reason; their reponse is in the domain of anti-intellectualism.

       I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       imagine they are helping perpetuate these conspiracy theories, and suspect it is for two main reasons. I will try to outline them.
      </p>
      <p>
       one, quite plainly, is because our distrust of the system is part of the agenda. This distrust serves many purposes. At first, it allows us to be marginalized easily. This has clearly been happening for some time, most prominently in the period immediately following 9/11. After that, though, it allows us to be vilified, especially as we proceed to become more uncooperative and rise against the system we distrust, which is presently happening. This vilification enables countermeasures to be justified and appear justifiable, and these countermeasures are, of course, on the agenda as well. Only
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       this happens, however, is the ultimate purpose of our distrust fulfilled, for it will eventually be widely revealed, throughout the course of these events unfolding, that our distrust was, indeed, sensible; that the system is indeed a sinister one which should be destroyed. It is only
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       -- with the distrust that has been cultivated in us, along with the multitude of other dispositions we have been conditioned to maintain and believe are our own -- that we will be
       <em>
        permitted
       </em>
       to topple the system and erect a new one in its stead; one that fulfills the ideals we have been led to prioritize, solving all the problems we have steadily been made to believe are real through means of equally manufactured value. This new world is the
       <em>
        true
       </em>
       New World Order: one where authoritarian power is
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       as consolidated and pervasive as it now is, but one where submission unto that power is
       <em>
        willfully chosen,
       </em>
       where that power no longer must operate in secret, and where suspicion of that power no longer exists. Heed my words: this
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen, and many will welcome it and suspect nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       reason number two is because information which compromises the agenda can never fully be eradicated. Instead of making that information completely inaccessible, then, it is coupled with a flood of misinformation to muddle its nature, rendering all determinations of authenticity significantly more difficult and all avenues of investigation more easily marginalized. We see this type of thing spring up around every suspicious event: outlandish claims arising which help to discredit all claims the events are suspicious. The 9/11 holographic planes idea immediately comes to mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no reason three, and if there was, it certainly wouldn't be to fool us into believing the forces at work are more powerful than they are. As a populace, we are ignorant, inept, and confused. It makes no difference how powerful they are. Controlling us is incredibly simple.

       Don't be so quick to dismiss the value of having your enemy think you're Superman. A percentage of the populace, when deluged by all-cops-all-the-time prime time, will promote that "willful choice" you mention.

       you're right. Building that impression can certainly help. The reason I think it's pointless, though, for the elite or whatever, is not because I believe convincing the average person he is helpless is an invalid tactic, but rather, because the average person, being so many degrees of separation away from where decisions are made, is
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       convinced he is helpless. No more exaggeration is even required.

       you can if it's totalitarian. You can if it's oppressive. You can choose not to want it. If you don't know what it is, you can't. If you think you want it already, you can't. That's all I meant. You are slow.

       Yes. They could be bluffing. However, even if their power was a bluff at some point, the longer that illusion holds, the closer it comes to being the truth.

       Thanks for posting this... too true. I think there are conspiracies, but there are too many for all of there interests to align so well that a "master plan" could ever emerge. It's just powerful people trying to stay on top by whatever means possible. Sometimes, even, those 'elites' actually know what they're doing and can solve a problem, but for the nutters poisoning the discussion.

       Some of the conspiracy theories they do propagate. Like the theory that it's all jews running the world and doing the bad things, instead of the global plutocracy, which is mainly not composed of Jewish people, though there are some. They want a target, that's not them.
