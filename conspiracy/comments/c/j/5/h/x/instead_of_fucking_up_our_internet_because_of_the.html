       I understand that we need to wake people up, but putting all this fear into people isn't healthy for them.  We need to be cautious, but what good is it going to do for people to sit there in fear of the government breaking down their door any second?

       We need to wake up others, but be careful to do in a way that doesn't leave them in fear.

       I bet the Germans in the 1930's felt the same way. Sure, the totalitarianism is slowly choking you, but it's very impolite to point it out to others.

       The problem with our current predicament is that, no matter how softly you break the truth to them, you're going to see them either live in a state of semi-denial, or enter into a bout of soul-crushing depression. I've been through this at least 20 times with close friends. lasts for about 3 months while they ponder why any of this even really matters. Eventually, they see their current role in life, and start thinking about what they want that role to be. then they're full of energy and ideas.

       I don't like this method, but it's the only one I've found that doesn't seem to leave the person paranoid and nearly catatonic at the end. if you have a better suggestion, I'd love to hear it.

       I usually start by stating my world view, and seeing what they disagree with. then I start questioning the cognitive dissonance that comes from these disagreements. they start off pissed off and frustrated, so it's a good idea to gain their trust first.
      </p>
      <p>
       second step: psilocybin mushrooms. don't underestimate their ability to force people into that "oh my god, this is all bullshit" mindset, which you can then use as a jumping-off point for other ideas introduced in later conversations. just don't try to cram too much into their heads while they're tripping; the realization that their entire worldview is completely subjective is enough to make later "ah-hah" moments easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third step is a calm, rational approach to the inevitable questions of "okay, everything's bullshit. what now?" I usually start with Jordan Maxwell's "Occult World of Commerce", then work them through the Jesuit/Papal Bloodline organizational chart (from Adolfo Nicolas, down the chain of command to Joe Biden), ensuring every step of the way that they remember that all religion is just a method of control. Eventually, I introduce the history of coined money, and the 53 Enrons/Economic Bubbles that have occurred since the supposed Birth of Christ, and who was responsible for them (Since 1983, it's been Legatus). once they have a firm understanding on what the hell has happened during the past 8,000 years of recorded human history (following the money has amazing benefits), you introduce the foundations of
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/CommonLaw">
        Common Law
       </a>
       , and how to apply them to your day-to-day life. On average, this is a process that takes over a year to fully get them to understand. if they're a voracious learner, it can take less time. if they're horrifically dense, you're gonna need longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few of my deprogrammed people have reddit accounts. they're just not very active, because they see all the disinformation on these boards. Sadly, I pounded "let he who shall be deceived, be deceived" into their heads a bit too hard. :)

       Interesting. Psilocybin mushroom? Myself, I've done them twice, and they do certainly force you to reassess the givens in your life; doing so turns them into variables (if that makes any sense).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the one source I really care to 'enlighten' is a family member that writes everything off as 'conspiracy.' So it's notably difficult. To add to that, he's clean (for many years) so mushrooms are out.

       The Money Masters is a decent start, but it doesn't really grasp the extent of the issue. if anything, the only reasonable discussion of money, outside of Reinhardt's lessons on IRC, is Stephan Molyneux's articles on FreedomainRadio.

       if there's anything Neuro-Linguistic Programming has taught me, it is best to find the cornerstone of that person, and try to associate your beliefs to it, in order to find common ground to work from. this is a less than honorable approach, though, but it definitely works.

       What do you mean by something else? The Internet and the World Wide Web are two different things. To replace the Internet would be absurdly impractical considering the vast amount of commercial, government, and private networks that are plugged into its infrastructure. As of 2009, over a billion users interact with the Internet. The World Wide Web would also be impractical to replace because of the financial and social impacts of changing website infrastructure and the interconnectivity of hypertext are simply too large to advocate the creation of a new system which very well may not be adopted.

       at that point, you should've already gotten yourself and your family out of the country. the war has been lost. dying for your beliefs, or being gassed under protest is exactly what they want you to do, because either way, you're still dying.

       Protecting immigrants from racism. Protecting gays from homophobia. These are much more successful strategies for controlling the media currently than
       <em>
        attacking
       </em>
       those groups. Why would the powers that be switch tactics when it comes to the internet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they want to divide and rule, as you said. Creating divisions in a homogenous group is more difficult than importing other groups eg Mexicans. There you are - instant, off-the-shelf division. Multiply that across multiple ethnic/religious groups and bingo a divided, stratified society!
