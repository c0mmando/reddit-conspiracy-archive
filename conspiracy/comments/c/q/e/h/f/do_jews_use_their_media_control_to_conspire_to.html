    <div class="md"><p>Ask yourself why a country smaller than Texas has the 4th largest army in the world. That recieves 3 billion in US aid yearly, secretly develops nukes, uses chemical weapons on people, and still maintains they&#39;re the victims.</p>

<p>Could it be possibly because Hollywood producers are generally Jewish, that a large portion of the writers and actors are jewish. Maybe it&#39;s the disproportionate amount of Jewish people in politics, or that many of the media networks are also Jewish owned.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that there&#39;s a massive conspiracy of Jewish people trying to take over the world, but more likely it&#39;s the zionist rulers of Israel using their influence to spread those types of beliefs systems on normal jewish people who are genuinely worried about anti-semite racism.</p>

<p>TL;DR Jews are getting suckered by zionists.</p>

Still, I see many reasons, however misguided, for the US to ally with Israel that don&#39;t require such loyalty.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised by the downvotes here, this is legitimate for militaristic, economic, and religious reasons. What the OP is talking about can be attributed to Zionists, not all Jewish people.</p>

<p>Some Christians want to send all the Jews back to Israel in order for the rapture to occur. Every Jew returning is a pre-condition of the second coming of Christ. As G.W. Bush and his staff teleconferenced with Nutjob Christian Ted Haggard pretty routinely when he was in office, this seems belieavable to me.</p>

<p>Economically / Militarily, the Middle East has a tremendous amount of oil that we want. It&#39;s not enough to control the oil fields, though; we also need a way of transporting the oil out to western markets. Thats why we (and members of the EU) cut Turkey so much slack. </p>

<p>Why else would we do shit like give Turkey free fighter jets? It&#39;s a country that is 98% Muslim, has tremendous human rights problems to resolve, BUT also is the far Western end of a well established (and more importantly largely safe from interruption) oil transport system that takes oil from the Middle East and Central Asia and sends it to European and American markets.</p>

<p>Turkey, however, has been a relatively risky gamble. As part of the former Ottoman empire, it&#39;s a single national entity that is comprised of several tremendously different elasticities. Other places where this was the case had significant sociopolitical discord, which resulted in less manipulatable heads-of-state. (Largely because we couldn&#39;t figure out who they were- constant vying for power amidst the ethnic groups in Yugoslavia and Iraq, also former Ottoman territories). </p>

<p>Turkey also shares a border with Iraq. Of particular concern is that this is the Kurdish borderland. The Kurds have been trying to establish their own, autonomous nation for quite some time now, and have, in the chaos remaining after Saddam&#39;s exit, made attempts to unify to some extent. (Read: Turkish Kurd Militias have crossed the border into Iraq and been forced to leave by American and Turkish instruction).</p>

<p>While I could go on about Turkey for quite some time, I think my point has been made. Namely, Turkey is not the safest bet for us, and it would help to have a plan B for oil export. </p>

<p>On top of an export location, it can serve as a military ally, place from which to launch attacks, and an intelligence hub.</p>

<p>Please note that I&#39;m not at all defending this, I think it&#39;s loathsome. It&#39;s just how I see it.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Not all Zionists are Jews, and not all Jews are Zionists. Powerful people want Israel close for a multitude of reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do some people use their influence to reduce the influence of others with opposing views? Of course.</p>

<p>Does the entirely of the Jewish faith / ethnicity get together and discuss who their going to destroy career wise? Of course not.</p>

<p>Wording your title as simplistically as you did is dangerous. It brands all Jews as not only pro-israel, but also implies that they are a cohesive unit, and that the decisions one Jew makes is totally supported by others. </p>

<p>I will readily admit that the Israel lobby exists, but that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re all behind it. It&#39;s a few rich dudes who have white house rich dude friends. </p>

<p>Further, don&#39;t ignore the fact that antisemitism isn&#39;t tremendously popular in the United States, so if these people are making sincerely antisemitic remarks (Like Gibson&#39;s &quot;Jews cause all the wars&quot;) they might just be facing the repercussions of those comments.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Jew and I think Helen Thomas is great. I think Mel Gibson is an absolutely batshit insane racist wife-beating deviant with his own self-defined brand of Catholicism and critically serious addiction problems. I don&#39;t watch televised news, and don&#39;t know about the Octacia Nasr thing. </p>

<p>tl;dr : Do Jews? No. Did a Jew? Maybe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post! Everything that people say about &#39;the jews&#39; could be said about &#39;the catholics&#39;(ie the roman empire) or &#39;the christians&#39;, as that is what a large majority of &#39;the establishment&#39;(the royal families of Europe, and people like George Bush) claim to be.</p>

<p>If you start digging into the real belief systems of the elite, you&#39;ll find that they have their own religion, in which they are the gods(as compared to us,) a more evolved species of human and as such they have the &#39;divine&#39; right to rule over the lessers. &#39;Divine&#39; as in dictated by nature, they are the top of the food chain, the most highly evolved predators on planet earth. It&#39;s a lot like the old Hinduism, incorporating the caste system and Darwinism. They have proven their worth, to themselves and to the rest of the psychopaths who actually run the world, by gaining vast wealth/power and holding onto it down through the centuries. This is one of the true reasons for the rabid inbreeding that you&#39;ll find in the dynastic families of the old world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone sure seems to be fond of playing &quot;Good Cop, Bad Cop&quot; these days.   </p>

<p>Let me get this straight, now:   </p>

<p>The ZIONISTS are the Evil Ones,   whereas JEWS are just regular downhome folk?     So,  those Jews on Wall Street that just stole trillions of dollars -- are they the Good Genocidal Supremacist Swlndlers or the Bad Genocidal Supremacist Swindlers?    </p>

<p>Oh, dearie,   I do need a scorecard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so fucking binary.</p>

<p>Why are you under the impression that it was only Jews who stole trillions? </p>

<p>Places like Morgan-Stanley have long since shed their Jewish founders and now have employees and board members of all faiths. Unless you&#39;re contending that people like Steven Trevor are actually secretly Jewish?</p>

<p>If it was sincerely a pan-jewish conspiracy, you wouldn&#39;t have people like Madoff wiping out the endowments of pro-jewish charities, like the one founded by Elie Wiesel. </p>

<p>Further, what about the auto industry bailout? Henry Ford, in his time, was one of the most outspoken Nazi sympathizers in America. </p>

<p>Or what about head of GM through the 1990&#39;s John Francis Smith, who was responsible for the &quot;fuck hybrids and gas conservation, all America needs are giant SUVs&quot; mentality that destroyed the company, priming it for the failure which necessitated a bailout.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll readily admit that there parts of some Jewish cultures that make them arrogant, but supremacist seems like an extreme title for that, especially when you&#39;re generalizing across an entire religion. Genocidal is a bit hyperbolic, as well, excluding the idiots in Israel who are as racist and retarded as you, and think Palestinians are the root of all evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mel Gibson? For his drunken rant? Octavia Nasr wasn&#39;t speaking out against Israeli or Jewish crimes, she expressed remorse that a relatively liberal member of Hezbollah had died. And there didn&#39;t have to be a conspiracy to get rid of Helen Thomas, just a press that didn&#39;t like her independent streak and lack of deference to authority. Now there was a conspiracy to scuttle the appointment of Chas Freeman but I wouldn&#39;t blame jews, rather a coalition of right wingers and liberal hawks, though the Israel Lobby probably played the largest part (<a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/03/exiting-chas-fr.html">Freeman certainly thought so</a>). But as <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/07/13/thiessen/index.html">an article</a> I linked to in another thread suggests, the Israel Lobby is not representative of American jews.</p>
