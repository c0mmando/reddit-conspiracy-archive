        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s probably something that many of you already know of, but it&#39;s always good to have on hand verifiable evidence to show the sleeping friend/relative in your attempts to get them to use their brains.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods</a> - here are some excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main proposal was presented in a document entitled &#39;&#39;Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba (TS),&#39;&#39; a collection of draft memoranda written by the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) </p>

<p>&quot;We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area, in other Florida cities and even in Washington.
The terror campaign could be pointed at refugees seeking haven in the United States. We could sink a boatload of Cubans en route to Florida (real or simulated). We could foster attempts on lives of Cuban refugees in the United States even to the extent of wounding in instances to be widely publicized. Exploding a few plastic bombs in carefully chosen spots, the arrest of Cuban agents and the release of prepared documents substantiating Cuban involvement, also would be helpful in projecting the idea of an irresponsible government.&quot;</p>

<p><em>&quot;It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica, Guatemala, Panama or Venezuela. The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan route to cross Cuba.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is a spurious argument. Religions in themselves don&#39;t kill - and while, yes, the believers do some killing in the name of religion it is the powered of the religion that do the killing.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the Jewish faith (or faithful) that asked the Romans to arrest and kill Jesus, it was the elite. It wasn&#39;t the Christians from the European countryside that started the Crusades, it was the elite, in power, looking to secure lands and trade routes.</p>

<p>In fact - look at things like the Islamic expansion, the Crusades and others. It wasn&#39;t religious fighting, it was people of opposing religions using it to get their armies to believe what they were fighting for was the godhead while the real reason to fight was the same reason Alexander the Great and others did: wealth, power and narcissism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s an interesting interpretation and all, but it is rather inaccurate. The full text of the parable, which, in itself, has nothing to even <em>do</em> with Christians <em>or</em> nonbelievers, taken from Luke 19:12 through 19:27, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“A nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself, and then return. “And he called ten of his slaves, and gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do business with this until I come back.’ “But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’ “When he returned, after receiving the kingdom, he ordered that these slaves, to whom he had given the money, be called to him so that he might know what business they had done. “The first appeared, saying, ‘Master, your mina has made ten minas more.’ “And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave, because you have been faithful in a very little thing, you are to be in authority over ten cities.’ “The second came, saying, ‘Your mina, master, has made five minas.’ “And he said to him also, ‘And you are to be over five cities.’ “Another came, saying, ‘Master, here is your mina, which I kept put away in a handkerchief; for I was afraid of you, because you are an exacting man; you take up what you did not lay down and reap what you did not sow.’ “He said to him, ‘By your own words I will judge you, you worthless slave. Did you know that I am an exacting man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow? ‘Then why did you not put my money in the bank, and having come, I would have collected it with interest?’ “Then he said to the bystanders, ‘Take the mina away from him and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’ “And they said to him, ‘Master, he has ten minas already.’ “I tell you that to everyone who has, more shall be given, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away. “But these enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them in my presence.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>good luck making sense of that, first of all, considering that, even as a Christian, knowing some of its context and caring to investigate, I only partially understand it. I certainly am not here to explain it or argue its relevance to anyone. But one thing I do intend to stress is that I most definitely do not regard it as instructions to kill people, nor do I believe I am supposed to. If you happen to read it and disagree, there is probably something wrong with you.</p>

<p>by the way, I&#39;ve seen that little flash card image of incriminating quotations you pulled this little gem from. Pretty much every single thing on it is blatantly misleading and false just like this one is. I don&#39;t have the patience to go on like this about every citation, which is why I haven&#39;t, but it&#39;s true; they&#39;re all garbage. I&#39;m sure it makes good fuel if all you care to do is talk shit, but none of it pertains in any particular way to the Bible.</p>

<p>btw, I am hereby revoking your license to reference &quot;looking hard enough,&quot; because you don&#39;t know a fuckin&#39; thing about it. Even your OP is the conspiracy fodder of 2002, for that matter. Please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And something as vital and complex as military! </p>

<p>Oh wait...</p>

<p>(I love this statement too, it&#39;s no where near the first time I&#39;ve seen it. <em>&quot;OMG the gov&#39;t is in charge of providing me with healthcare!!! OH NOES!!!&quot;</em> Yes, because that is what happened. It wasn&#39;t that they gave you the choice to go their route, they <em>FORCED</em> it on you. Same with education - they are <em>FORCING</em> your kids to go to public schools and not the private one a mile away [which in my city isn&#39;t always the better option actually - the grades are nice, but in real testing the education is not, always]. If you don&#39;t think it should be mandatory to have either, argue that, but good luck on the education aspect. My state forces me to have car insurance so <strong>you</strong> don&#39;t pick up my costs elsewhere in the system, or right after I hit you at 35 mph. I don&#39;t know if I agree with that or them forcing you to have <strong>some type</strong> of healthcare, but I think they did that because someone who is halfway decent at math and looks at <strong>real</strong> numbers decided it was a better idea. Or rather, who should be in charge of it? Local church groups.. nah that isn&#39;t going to work. If only we could choose a group of people that would [try to] keep our best interests in mind and work the details out. Maybe they have that in other countries? That&#39;s a sweet system, we should invent it...)</p>

<p>tl;dr: The gov&#39;t said get some fucking healthcare, we&#39;ll even offer you some. Cheap! But if you fail to fucking take care of yourself there is going to be a fine - because sometimes you have to fine people into being functional adults in this society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Raul Castro had full details of the entire plan A through Z. </p>

<p>All thanks to his very deep and extensive spy network set up to monitor all Cuban exiles living in America. This is where many of the higher elite ex military senior officers , used to a rich opulent wealthy life style morphed into common thieves , drug and gun running in order to maintain their former expensive lifestyle  they lead in a venal corrupt Cuba of the fifties . This deep network still exists today, even as we speak.</p>

<p>Essentially, as the American Military/CIA were in the throes of implementing such a plan, the full details of all involved A through Z pictures inclusive and where the bomb making facilities were to be found, would be fully leaked to the Communist Bloc Media, the International Press and the local police simultaneously the day before the first bombing on US soil was scheduled. </p>

<p>Raul Castro, is one very smart cookie with many fingers and toes in many pies. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t see the commoners of America any differently than they see the average peasant in China, you&#39;re talking about people who are responsible for millions of deaths(1.6million in Iraq, so far, in a war based on admitted lies.) The only reason they aren&#39;t raining bombs down on your head right now is because you are being used to service a different part of the overall agenda.</p>

<p>Ask the children in Vietnam(another war based on admitted lies,) or the children of Baghdad if the people in power give a shit about whether their actions are evil and insane.</p>
