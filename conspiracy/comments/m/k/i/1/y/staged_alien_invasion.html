       I've been noticing alot of alien programming lately. From blockbuster movies such as Battle: Los Angeles and Cowboys and Aliens to the History channel's ancient aliens documentaries. We've seen similar programming in the past, when they wanted to desensitize the masses to terrorism and get mass acceptance for detention camps. Movies like The Siege , in which a bus gets blown up as a precursor to the detention camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am of the opinion that we're going to see an alien invasion soon which will be staged by the same powers that staged other events in the past. What's your take?

       Or it could be that the people in media are unimaginative and risk-adverse and so make cheap shows about aliens because one of the competing channels do the same, so they know people will probably watch it?

       Yes, they are constantly trying to link the "gods" that the ancients believed in to be extraterrestrial. Often they portray them as friendly and benefiting to the society.

       Did you catch the recent discovery channel "when aliens attack" documentary?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it's a human life/earth snuff film, featuring expert military consultants on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a nutshell, they'd have to be extremely advanced to even get here, we'd fail to communicate, would almost certainly be seen as hostile or just irrelevant, and they'd hit with "shock and awe" strategy where they'd literally wipe out all cities, military, and manufacturing. Think cave man.

       I missed it, will have to search for the episode. I'll have to keep a lookout for what direction they head in with regards to programming. It will give me an idea of what they are thinking would be feasible.

       Staged as in a "false flag" sense? Then yes, I agree. You can't trust any governments. If not it would be cool to see aliens. Maybe they can teach us peace or cooperation amongst one another and disarm all the military powers of the world and teach us to love as a species. Or total chaos and destruction, either way it'll be exciting.

       Yes, in a false flag sense. There will be chaos to which the powers will provide a solution and supposedly " save " mankind from these invaders. As usual, people will be mislead and just like sheep just follow their leader in total ignorance.

       The mentally disabled people are the very ones that still don't know or believe that 9/11 is an inside job.

      <p>
       If you notice the programming, they slowly plant the thoughts they want by providing a small bit of information. News flash of a ufo, or the idea that UFO's may exist. Then , as shown lately, that ancient civilization may have been in contact, and they try and provide as much "proof" as they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, movies depicting an invasion, and how nations , individually will be invaded and struggle to fight back, but under one body, they succeed. Remember, they are very good at programming people. They have succeeded in programming people into thinking that Moslim=terrorist, and this is only more apparent that every time a so called "moslim" is caught doing anything , it's a moslem terrorist, but as you've seen lately, with the White house shooter, and the OWS pipe bomber, no mention of religion at all.

       This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You want the country that has the most massive military budget to put together enough resources to fake an invasion which real-life destroys our military?

       No, I don't want such a thing to happen, but I am predicting that it might. But not the way you envision it. The destruction will not be to the military, and if it is, it will all be planned to have just the desired effect.

       I definitely think it will be their way of herding the world under one leadership.

       The "want" wasn't me asking whether you personally want this to happen, it was a rhetorical statement. Either way, you have to be mentally retarded to think that this would work. How do you expect to fake the "battles" between aliens and humans? The F-22's and Hornets and Eagles will be attacking flying saucers with precision munitions and then the saucers will have fake lasers or something?

       What makes you think you'll be able to view first hand any of the incidents that would take place? It will most likely be carefully planned incidents of which the public will see exactly what they want you to see, and the rest will be through the media. Just like one big movie fed through the news channels and outlets. It will all be very quick with little time for the public to analyze the information presented.

       You're thinking like a 5th grader, maybe you should learn to think like an adult, in the real world where it's not always flash and bang and the government only shows you what they want you to see.

       now i know he added the joke afterwards.
but depending on what type of being it was, you may wish to be guarded as to not cause a panic. plus you got some rigidly ignorant people out there. people will see them as the angels of lore. some will worship them. some will fear them.

       or this could be an elaborate ruse to distract us from a culling of sorts. 
or it could be a tool in keeping the populace frozen in fear.

       there is this shadowy force that rules us (according to previous presidents). it could pure fabrication to imprison or it could be the truth, both are humanity's worst fears, shackles and truth.

       the "X-Files" appears to have been aired on FOX to make people associate all impartial analysis of the government with schizophrenic theories about aliens.

       i don't know what to think. anything is possible, anything is plausible. somedays i think it is an ingenious plot to put the fear and obedience into the people but then on other days, i think well, aliens do exist so it is possibility they could already be here.
 the military and govt invented some incredible technology. what most people don't know is that the nazis were behind that.
      </p>
      <p>
       the ufos could be the us military or aliens. the aircraft if military could have been reversed engineered from an alien space craft or it could have been engineered based off the knowledge that the nazis obtained while cutting open skulls in fully awake and aware un-anesthetized human beings. personally i would like it to be a result of aliens but as so far the facts lead me to monsters.

       Couldn't the dissemination of the idea that disclosure will be an elaborate ruse to deceive the masses, possibly be another form of programming? If genuine disclosure were to happen people would say it is just a hoax and nothing would change. Perhaps it depends on how the events unfold? Is this an ET threat that we must unite under a global government to combat? Or are they energy beings come to help us refine our own "free" energy technology?
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like all of these ideas about ETs were planted in order to keep people that are into to this sort of thing skeptical.

       Yes, they are constantly trying to link the "gods" that the ancients believed in to be extraterrestrial. Often they portray them as friendly and benefiting to the society.
