        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been noticing alot of alien programming lately. From blockbuster movies such as Battle: Los Angeles and Cowboys and Aliens to the History channel&#39;s ancient aliens documentaries. We&#39;ve seen similar programming in the past, when they wanted to desensitize the masses to terrorism and get mass acceptance for detention camps. Movies like The Siege , in which a bus gets blown up as a precursor to the detention camps. </p>

<p>I am of the opinion that we&#39;re going to see an alien invasion soon which will be staged by the same powers that staged other events in the past. What&#39;s your take?</p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s a human life/earth snuff film, featuring expert military consultants on this subject. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, they&#39;d have to be extremely advanced to even get here, we&#39;d fail to communicate, would almost certainly be seen as hostile or just irrelevant, and they&#39;d hit with &quot;shock and awe&quot; strategy where they&#39;d literally wipe out all cities, military, and manufacturing. Think cave man. </p>

Maybe they can teach us peace or cooperation amongst one another and disarm all the military powers of the world and teach us to love as a species.

</blockquote>

<p>The mentally disabled people are the very ones that still don&#39;t know or believe that 9/11 is an inside job.</p>

<p>If you notice the programming, they slowly plant the thoughts they want by providing a small bit of information. News flash of a ufo, or the idea that UFO&#39;s may exist. Then , as shown lately, that ancient civilization may have been in contact, and they try and provide as much &quot;proof&quot; as they can.</p>

<p>Next, movies depicting an invasion, and how nations , individually will be invaded and struggle to fight back, but under one body, they succeed. Remember, they are very good at programming people. They have succeeded in programming people into thinking that Moslim=terrorist, and this is only more apparent that every time a so called &quot;moslim&quot; is caught doing anything , it&#39;s a moslem terrorist, but as you&#39;ve seen lately, with the White house shooter, and the OWS pipe bomber, no mention of religion at all.</p>

<p>You&#39;re giving the masses more credit than they are due.</p>

<p>What makes you think you&#39;ll be able to view first hand any of the incidents that would take place? It will most likely be carefully planned incidents of which the public will see exactly what they want you to see, and the rest will be through the media. Just like one big movie fed through the news channels and outlets. It will all be very quick with little time for the public to analyze the information presented.</p>

<p>You&#39;re thinking like a 5th grader, maybe you should learn to think like an adult, in the real world where it&#39;s not always flash and bang and the government only shows you what they want you to see.  </p>
