    <div class="md"><p>It is quite weird to see how what I perceive as the &quot;average&quot; person to be reacting to things these days.</p>

<p>I mean..that sounds generic, as does the whole &quot;waking up&quot; thing.  It&#39;s a matter of looking at your surroundings and using your brain and, while some people do this out of instinct well before it&#39;s necessary (those considered to be in touch or in tune), more and more people are doing it out of necessity, so yeah I agree more people are noticing things.</p>

<p>I think one good piece of evidence for your argument is Senate Bill 1867, which as voted on by the House and Senate allows the detention of American citizens without cause or right to trial.  Um..I&#39;m not sure on how they justify it but I think it has something to do with declaring the US as a battlefield and any citizen as a potential military combatant that they can thus justify detaining.  Would appreciate clarification.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is vetoed by the President or overturned by the Supreme Court or something, but I&#39;m not holding my breath considering everything I&#39;ve ever seen in my lifetime.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think this really hits home with some people that normally wouldn&#39;t notice anything, in the sense that US citizens are taught and raised to believe that everyone person has a right to trial.  This is a reinforced belief ingrained in US citizens if any foreigners are confused about how this is a fundamental right.</p>

<p>I have seen a lot of people support this &quot;defense&quot; bill until someone points out this provision of the bill, that US citizens can be detained indefinitely with no charges and no right to trial in DIRECT violation of the 6th Amendment to the US Constitution guaranteeing the right to trial.  This is pissing people off and making people read the shit and wonder how the fuck this is possible.</p>

<p>It is not necessarily people waking up but at the least it is an encouraging sign that some US citizens are looking at things a bit more closely and being a bit more outraged.</p>

<p>People should have been more pissed off by the PATRIOT Act a decade ago as it was a clear sign of degradation to human rights well before any of this shit began but..ugh.</p>

<p>The saying &quot;until shit hits your doorstep&quot; is so true it isn&#39;t funny.  Despicable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and No.</p>

<p>People in general realize the ship is rusted out and taking on a lot of water, but they have very little idea why, and they have no idea how many holds have already flooded and how far we&#39;ve already sunk. You&#39;ve got all these kids who think they&#39;re going to just &#39;vote&#39; and win something for themselves, they don&#39;t have any idea how deep an individually-based revolution would need to go to make it into anything worth doing - turn it into something new, instead of just a &#39;revolution&#39; where you start in one place, do a lot of moving, and end up right in the same place again, like the Earth&#39;s revolution around the Sun.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in our language. It&#39;s a trick, a con, there&#39;s no change on the horizon unless these same people in general re-evaluate human life, not just politics, rationally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the sense that the message of elite bankers and money lenders corrupting the world financial system is getting out to more people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the control of the mass media and the damage this had caused in our society has got out. They look upon the media as &quot;reality&quot; -- as a reflection of their world. They don&#39;t understand that the reality the media reflects has been crafted and imposed on them, as a way of weakening and controlling them.</p>

<p>The message that the corporations and special interests actually own the politicians is getting out more and more. We see this in the measure of confidence the public has in Congress.</p>

<p>The big message, that Zionist Jews are the heart of the problem, and are guiding and overseeing the destruction of our society -- that is still considered forbidden to speak or even to think about. I find this message reflexively rejected by a large number of people, who have been trained never to think bad thoughts about Jews under any circumstances. And who trained them? Right, the Jews trained them. The media is controlled by Jews and has been for the better part of a century.</p>

<p>So, some messages are getting out, and some are not. People are partially waking up, but if they stay half asleep, I doubt they will accomplish much of real value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. Yes because yes people are starting to realize that shit is very wrong in America and the the world. No because people are not united enough to have a clean purging of government. If a revolution breaks out, people will loot and gangs of racists and any groups with the most stockpiled weapons will go about murdering everyone they deem undesirable to create their own private utopia for their beliefs. A revolution in this country won&#39;t arrive through elections. It will come through force. Those with the means of force will turn this country into hell. There will be small gangs of ethnic, religious, lifestyle etc. gangs that will all be fighting for control. move to Europe. If the Euro crashes European countries won&#39;t risk violent revolution and austerity to save the Euro so Eurozone countries will return to their foreign currencies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in a predominantly rural part of Canada. I do feel that there is a higher awareness of many issues surrounding the dark habits of government; however, most people in my region are still blissfully ignorant of societal shifts or the underlying causes. There is ignorance in high density areas too; however, I still long for my younger days in an urban environment, at times.  </p>

<p>If I could choose to be truly, painfully unaware or to continue on a path of increased awareness and inevitable melancholy ... I would stay on my pathway. The truth prevails over bliss.</p>

<p>I have always had a &quot;gut feel&quot;, loosely defined kind of mistrust for &quot;authority&quot; (I was born in the mid 60&#39;s); however, 9-11 brought my scorn into focus. A decade on and more people are seeing the big picture of widespread, unchallenged, institutional corruption. I am encouraged; however, we have a long bloody road to taking back our world from the 1%.  </p>
