This doesn&#39;t even feel like a conspiracy theory, there&#39;s so much damning evidence. Does anybody know if there&#39;s been any progress toward opening another investigation, and if so, has that investigation turned anything up.
For those who don&#39;t know: Loose Change is a documentary that examines the real events of 9/11, including bringing to light significant evidence that the WTC towers were destroyed through a controlled demolition, rather than through fire as official reports have stated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be how you &quot;win&quot;, I&#39;m in no contest. I did watch the video. He states many times he believes there was a &quot;coverup&quot; and that there needs to be a new investigation. Which is the only point worth making; the only point I am arguing with you. </p>

<p>Dylan Avery did not recant his belief in a 9/11 coverup. He did not recant his objection to the official story. He did not reverse his call for a new investigation. He has, quite wisely, stopped exhorting what conspiracy happened. </p>

<p>Much like atheists claim that the evidence does not support belief in any gods, critical thinkers may claim that the current body of evidence does not, has not, and will never match the 9/11 Report. </p>

<p>I think there are issues with the 9/11 commission report but most of them are due to politics (not wanting to point the find squarely at Saudi and their global policies) but I don&#39;t see a &quot;coverup&quot;.

<p>Eyewitness account from someone who survived the collapse of the towers.</p>

<p>When the building collapse (From the floor of impact), an immense weight was pushed down, forcing the air contained within the building to be forced out at a fantastic speed through the windows, hence what look like demolition squibs.</p>

<p>Did you not think as to why there are no sounds of repeated explosions in any of the videos of the WTC Collapses (Aside from the fake one posted here that people blindly used as evidence), while there are in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;amp;v=GodGViR7T4I#t=6197s">Controlled Demolitions?</a></p>

<p>Everything in Loose Change has been thoroughly debunked due to the lack of context, cherry picking of videos and eyewitness accounts and just outright lies.</p>

<p>Consider that the video you&#39;ve watched has been presented to you by one side, who clearly doesn&#39;t consider the possibility that this could be anything other than an attack perpetrated by the US government. Do you think they will be giving you all of the available information? Do you think they will show any evidence contradictory to their conclusion?</p>

Though I&#39;m not denying that it was obviously biased, it set many of its facts in the context of what we as a nation have been told to believe. However, this theory has so captured my interest that I&#39;ll certainly be watching the debunking videos people are posting. I&#39;m just not sure how convincing they&#39;ll be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah right yeah, the cherry picked accounts of people who heard &#39;explosions&#39; in the confusion are much more authoritive than actual videos with sounds.</p>

<p>Your premise rests on three assumptions:</p>

<ul>
<li>the witnesses heard explosions and not bangs or other noises</li>
<li>these witnessess are infallible in the confusion of the days events</li>
<li>the &#39;explosions&#39; they heard were from demolition charges</li>
</ul>

<p>Which you are taking as verbatim proof for a controlled demolition. Don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Which is more likely? That every single video was edited on the fly to remove the sounds of charges - even the live ones, or that eyewitnesses are hearing other bangs or explosions are taken out of context?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, again this is a good example of Loose Change&#39;s BS.</p>

<p>The towers were designed to withstand the impact of a smaller, lighter airplane, on the assumption it was lost looking for the local airport and got lost in fog etc, not a fully loaded jetliner travelling at cruising speed.</p>

<p>But they conveniently leave them details out.</p>

<p>Freefall: Didn&#39;t happen, freefall time would be ~5.6 seconds, plus you can see the east penthouse collapse a good 8 seconds before in some videos (Again not the ones shown by loose change). Also, the falling debris outpaced the towers collapse which would be impossible if it were free-fall speed.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for collapse was the plane sheared off most of several floors fireproofing structure if I recall correctly. (Don&#39;t have source handy).</p>

<p>Do you have any other questions or points of interest? Contrary to popular belief, I&#39;m not a paid to post shill, just a guy who enjoys talking about a subject i&#39;ve researched a lot about.</p>

<p>My premise is that you are incorrect about your assertion that there were no sounds of explosions. I assume nothing but the evidence gathered and produced in diverse formats. You are assuming I am a Truther who believes that explosives were planted. By assuming that, you are choosing to overlook the actual evidence that has been presented. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which you are taking as verbatim proof for a controlled demolition. Don&#39;t think so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where I am claiming this? I am rejecting your claim of the certainty of absence of evidence of explosions, claimant. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which is more likely? That every single video was edited on the fly to remove the sounds of charges - even the live ones, or that eyewitnesses are hearing other bangs or explosions are taken out of context?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is more likely is that you are guilty of a conjunctive fallacy that you are using improperly to force me objection further into a false dichotomy. </p>

<p>You can believe whatever you like. Don&#39;t speculate that there was <strong>no evidence</strong> of explosions when copious credible evidence exists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the superstructures in question had an over engineered massive steel core designed to withstand the impact of a large airplane. Buildings are designed to hold together and not crumble to bits when one section fails, if anything the top should have just fallen off and to one side, not straight down through the path of greatest resistance. But somehow the terrorists hit both towers in just the right way as to cause nearly identical, symetrical, pancake collapses at very near freefall speed, leaving a debris pile which held temperatures near 2000 degrees for weeks. Despite finding unexploded nano thermite, iron spheres and molten steel, honest, respected scientists learn there is no evidence that will ever be good enough to warrant a true scientific investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, you have a building, say 100 storeys - forces are in equilibrium. The structures normal force will counteract the force due to gravity (What is commonly known as weight). </p>

<p>Gravitys acts towards a body of mass, i.e. Downwards towards the centre of the earth.</p>

<p>Split the building into 2 sections - 80 Floors and 20 Floors and concentrate on the top 20. What are the forces acting on these? Again the normal force provided by 80 floors of structural integrity (Acting upwards, hence the resiliance to compression) and the 20 floor&#39;s worth of gravity, acting straight downwards.</p>

<p>Note that only two forces are in Play - Normal going upwards and Gravity downwards. When all is well they are completely equal.</p>

<p>Now take away some of that Normal force (By affecting the structures integrity) and gravity will eventually overcome the normal force and cause an attraction straight down.</p>

<p>At no point other than the initial impacts are there any horizontal forces acting upon the structures, so how exactly would you expect the building to just topple over sideways?</p>

<p>So where again did you learn physics? UofAlexJones?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A slight grammatical error isn&#39;t in the same league as confusing an incindiery and explosive, especially when using it as such damning evidence for a theory, but if it was a genuine mistake then fair enough.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If the structural integrity on the opposite side wasn&#39;t damaged then how would the building magically sever from that side and fall? It wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not a matter of what &#39;<a href="http://thewebfairy.com/killtown/images/wtc-gallery/fema403-2/2-13_wtc1-imapct-hole.jpg">corner</a>&#39; was taken out - it&#39;s a matter of weight redistribution over the undamaged supports, which would fail at roughly the same time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so obviously the top would fall towards the weaker side, what is so hard to understand about that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the building will stay in the exact same surface area as the floor below it, just that it won&#39;t comically fall over to the side. It was noted that the columns bowed inwards due to the obvious unequal weight distribution. These <a href="http://www.debunking911.com/sag.ht2.jpg">columns</a> are what eventually bowed and gave way setting in motion the collapse.</p>

<p>Sorry, when emotion is used as part of an argument it&#39;s pretty clear it&#39;s due to lack of real evidence or comprehension and a preconceived end result. Someone unbiased would not use such a conclusive statement.</p>

<p>I have no doubt this video you speak of is either misquoted, used out of context or doesn&#39;t apply to the situation (If anything it will be talking about the scenario I mentioned above).</p>

<p>The only thing that can be construed as suspect on the 911research page is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Establishing the true nature of the core structures is of great importance given that the most widely read document on the World Trade Center attack -- the 9/11 Commission Report -- denies their very existence, claiming the towers&#39; cores were &quot;hollow steel shaft[s]:&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it may be the most widely read, the comission report isn&#39;t the scientific report on the structural collapse, more the events leading up the the attack and what could&#39;ve been prevented / done better. That&#39;s the NIST report which is extremely comprehensive (Have you actually read it?) and included the scope of: (From wiki as I don&#39;t have the report handy)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome.</p>

<p>Next documentary: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXda5Kn2LAM">September Clues</a></p>

<p>This documentary is about how planes weren&#39;t used. Crazy right? Almost as crazy as the position you and I were in before we descended down the rabbit hole. But, as always, conclusions must be drawn from the evidence, so I urge you to at least consider this idea before marking it off your list as crazy, because as you&#39;ll find around here, crazy is completely relative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congrats...u waking up from the matrix. I did it about a year ago. I used to think 911 conspiracy was crap. But then I saw the truth. </p>

<p>Now get ready for your next problem. If that conspiracy was true...what about all the others you thought were shit. After 911 falls for you everything is possible and must be examined. Alien, floride, illuminati, chem trails, even hollow earth theory. The best advice I can give you is believe no one....but believe everyone. It is tough life trying to figure out what is real. Good luck...welcome to the real world...all based on lies and not what you thought it was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. While watching the documentary did make me question what else I&#39;ve believed to be true may be a fallacy, the 9/11 &quot;conspiracy&quot; is one of the most convincing ones I&#39;ve ever encountered. In trying to talk to people who haven&#39;t researched it, I&#39;ve been told my newfound belief is akin to believing that the Holocaust never happened. Mass speculation on less evidence-substantiated theories, while justified, allows people to condemn theories like this one as bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something  caught my eye but I didn&#39;t make the connection when watching one of the other Loose Change producers, Jason Bermas doing a video presentation.</p>

<p>I think he was covering Alex Jones one day. He looked really tired and hungoverish and there was something about his demeanor that seemed familiar to me. He seemed drippy and pathetic.
(I&#39;m an old druggie from the sixties(ahem)</p>

<p>And shortly after I had seen that airing of him, his co-producer, Korey Rowe , got busted selling heroin. Then I realized what had caught my attention but I didn&#39;t recognize it. He was coming off a heroin high.</p>

<p>Completely changed my perception of him and his works, not that that means it is all bad or all good.</p>

<p>Just a personal thing,,most people would not have made the connection.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regardless of who you believe was responsible, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible this was a controlled demolition. First, why use a controlled demolition when it could have been a messy explosion that would make for a better news story? Second, why fly planes into it first, THEN demolish it while everyone is watching, recording what&#39;s happening? And, it wasn&#39;t just fire that caused the towers to collapse. It was the impact, disintegration of several floors at once, intense heat from the burning jet fuel, and finally the sheer weight of the remaining floors above. I think they just got incredibly lucky.

    <div class="md"><p>But the government would stand to lose a lot of credibility if it was made public that terrorists were given the opportunity to plant enough explosives to blow up a building as large as the towers were. A hijacked plane can be forgiven by the American people -- the time and energy it would&#39;ve taken to rig a demolition of that magnitude would not. If you assume that the purpose of 9/11 was to unite the American people in a campaign against terrorist organizations, the knowledge that our government was paying so little attention that the groups were allowed to blow up two of our most celebrated buildings would hinder that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the necessity of the planes was that they allowed the government somewhere to direct focus and therefore blame. The image of the planes striking the towers is incredibly dynamic and served the purpose of bringing the nation together. Further, it&#39;s explained that both towers burned for about an hour before they collapsed. There had been fires in the towers before, spanning over several floors, but both times they had survived. The speed of destruction could only have been achieved through serious explosive devices. Not to mention that independent researchers did tests on the debris blown into nearby windows - all tests pointed toward the presence of explosive residue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get why they would use a &quot;controlled&quot; demolition if its that obvious to detect in video footage. Why not use a more destructive, terrorist-like method if they knew they would need more than the planes (and again, why use the planes at all if you could bring them down with explosives??). Seems pretty sloppy given all the other meticulous details that were supposedly carried out that day. But still, given the impact craters, heat and weight in the floors above, the official scenario just seems more plausible. Especially since the execution and aftermath would have been the same with or without a controlled demolition so unless there is also evidence it was placed there by one of the groups targeted by conspiracy theorists its really a moot point. We should move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, was the fire department commander in on it too? The video obviously uses his quote out of context, or that guy is the worst conspirator in the history of conspiracies. 
And, the supposed demolition explosions seen during the WTC7 collapse occur as the building is already falling (and after!). All you see is debris shooting out of the windows as the floors are collapsing on each other. No flashes of light. No audible sounds of charges going off. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p9A">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p9A</a></p>

<p>I share in the general skepticism about the official version of events  on that day, including the motives and key players. But, the demolition theory is just a distraction that keeps people from examining the real evidence and depressing aftermath.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Welcome to the reality based community (look that term up). No, not much progress. But as you look further into the system that allowed for 9/11 to happen, you will start to interpret the situation differently, meaning, it&#39;s not just a cover up, it&#39;s a way of life. Change will require a level of reorganization and communication that we simply don&#39;t have yet. In time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Congratulations! I suspect you will see many other societal accepted elements take on new meaning as time moves forward for you. Stay balanced and rational. </p>

<p>My guess is the entire religion industry will begin to smell &quot;off&quot; soon. Also, research the CIA and &quot;Family Jewels&quot; on Google ... these are packaged, documented facts the CIA have admitted to! Now imagine what they keep secret. </p>

<p>Avoid the nonsense which will diminish your esteem to you being considered a nutjob by others. If you speak of reptilian nazi aliens at the south pole to a fence sitter, you will just &quot;contaminate the well&quot; for your friend and yourself on your new pathway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After the outrage, the stark realization is, it&#39;ll take a good bit more than &quot;all of us in unison&quot;, to get any action.</p>

<p>The quicker we get everybody else in on this, the quicker we get to that unforeseen element, that&#39;ll give the final push that places this unspeakable crime at the front and center of national debate. </p>

<p>Operation Northwoods is a great ice breaker for those clueless to warmonger schemes.  Close friends may be the best place to start. </p>

<p>Can someone suggest or point to a better selection of vids? </p>

<p>If you see something out of place in your search for truth, write it down/ make a video and pass it along.</p>
