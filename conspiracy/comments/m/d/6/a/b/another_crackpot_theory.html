He pretty much thinks Obama is the devil. This is what he sent me after the Navy Seals died in that plane crash. I had kind of a catty response...</p>

<p>Several Weeks Ago On The Alex Jones Radio Show,Dr. Steve Pieczenik(Google Him To See His History) Reported That
Osama Bin Laden Had Died In 2001 From Kidney Disease.
Then,To Make Sure That Obama Would Be Reelected,They Staged The Fake Raid On A Compound In Pakistan.
The Press Fotage Of Hillary And Others Watching This Raid Has Now Been Admitted To Have Been Staged.
To Keep This Lie Secret The People Who Staged The Raid Had To Be Sure That The Truth Did Not Get Out.
Conclusion: Get Rid Of The Witnesses.
News Flash: Navy Seals Die In Helicopter Crash.
Witnesses Silenced!!!
Ask Your Husband About The Copter That They Were Killed In.Not The Copter To Transport Navy Seals
It&#39;s Really Hard To Believe.But All The Facts Lead To This Conclusion.
How Could They Kill These Heroes.Elete Military Forces.
The Economy Is In A Free Fall By Design.
The World Is In Turmoil By Design.
We May Also Be Buried At Sea To Hide The Truth.
All We Want Is To Live A Good Life And To See Our Kids And Grandsons Grow.
Is This Going To Happen?</p>

<p>Notice how no one seriously delves into who profited most from Greek spending? Notice how getting things fixed is the main news? Everything is shit and we need to fix it, never mind why we&#39;re here. That&#39;s my point. Also, to answer your question, I don&#39;t know for sure. I do know however that money just does not vanish. It&#39;s a bit too valuable of a tool for the <em>rulers</em> to just let that happen. Someone is sitting on all the trillions missing from the worlds people, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL you hand me a website aimed at bad mouthing Goldman sacs. Yea I will admit there is some corruption in the world. However if your gonna attempt to call bankers the devil who&#39;s fault is it for dealing with him? What I got out of that article is the Greek nation got screwed over by their politicians and not some mysterious elite. The Greeks didn&#39;t have to take the money. Nope they could have told the people bad news. Instead they lied and now it&#39;s time to pay the piper. Also 300 million is a far cry from trillions of dollars my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was an example to illustrate how easy it is to get governments into these situations. The same happened in america. The guy who&#39;s in office for 4 years gives not a shit if the next guy after him has to deal with the insane rates of the loan he approved to keep his budjet balanced. No conspiracy here, just the lasyness of the average human exploited by the bank whitch is the legal face of the reptiles xD. A lil joke there to remind you that I don&#39;t claim to have all the answers. I just don&#39;t believe the offical story you subscribe to either. It&#39;s a little too easy for me. I really do believe the banksters would not lead their cash cows to slaughter unless they expect to get rewarded handsomely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>without question; but you are making the assumption that they keep their entire wealth in one of those currencies.  At a certain point retaining all of your worth in one currency guarantees failure, as a light day&#39;s turn in the  strength of one could cost you whole percentages of your actual, real-world value.  On the other hand, tradeable materials rarely lose value, and as certain commodities become more necessary, or rare, they tend to multiply in value, and particularly well in regions where people&#39;s money doesn&#39;t go as far anymore.  Most people point to gold, and it is a good example (check out how it essentially doubles in its weight against the USD during the post 2008 crash), but other minerals (like cobalt, palladium, or copper) can grow three or four fold over the period of a couple of years, when products that require massive amounts of them (apple...) hit the markets  </p>

<p>Of course this assumes that the easy route of hedging against the crashing economies isn&#39;t being implemented.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But wouldn&#39;t it just be easier to sell in volume (more people with more money buy more). Than plotting to debt countries into submission. I just don&#39;t see a lot of money to be made at that game. When countries get desperate wars break out and after ww2 the German currency was worth more as fire wood than actual money. The only rational reason to do such things is if one country is attempting through economic means to destroy others. Blame china I guess?</p>
