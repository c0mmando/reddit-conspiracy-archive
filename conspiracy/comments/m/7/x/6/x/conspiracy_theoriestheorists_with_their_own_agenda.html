       Are there any well-documented scenarios where a notable (or somewhat notable) conspiracy theory was proven false and that it existed only because it was working for its own agenda of some kind? Not trying to step on any toes, just curious.

       Fulford believes the NWO is on it's last legs and is about to catastrophically fail.  Along with David Wilcock who believes the same and that we are being helped by human looking aliens. while l'd like to believe this, it's not 100% verifiable.

       Isn't that the whole point of a conspiracy theory? Take the facts and connect the dots. Otherwise it would be conspiracy fact.

       Fulford mixes truth and things that sound good but aren't verifiable. Wilcock is pretty sketchy and has the flavor of a New Age kind of promoter. I don't buy into his grand ethereal assertions at all. By his support for Fulford he tends to decrease Fulford's credibility, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, recent news about the NSA tapping into US military communications lends credence to Fulford's claim that there's a segment within the military that's against the stealthy damage to the US being done by the neocons/Zionists.

       But I also don't trust A.J. completely,

        I think he is pro Israel/zionist cointelpro

       . I think he informs people but also scares the shit out of them and makes them run in circles (making them call congress and what not) accomplishing nothing at the end of the day. I mainly trust dead whistleblowers like Bill Cooper. They're murdered for a reason also like to do my own research and reach my own conclusions. Basically

       While it can be said that it is a bunch of bunk, the whole reptilian bit, that doesn't in the slightest discredit the previous information in Icke's talks as it is easily sourced. Who knows, perhaps it is true and people just haven't caught on to it yet. Like (

       and others like it from Dan Winter, for instance. Doing your own research, connecting dots, and drawing your own conclusions is the only way to learn of the truth. It's just very hard when you're trying to look into matters that can be thousands of years old given the state occulted records.

       proclaimed (through chanelling information through aliens) in the 90's that planet x would cause a crustal rotational shift in may 2003.

      <p>
       Today she claims that Px is in between the earth and the sun and will one day cause this rotational shift. Spews bullshit on this fact on a weekly basis even today with the sole purpose of keeping people in FEAR. That aside, some of the information is true and is very insightful (if you can get around the Planet x, nibiru, doom bull excrement)

      <p>
       1) They are dead or in hiding

       The hay day of CIA killings for whistleblowing are over. Since the advent of the Internet they had to find a new way to disguise the truth. Now they just ignore you, berate you, label you an antisemite, pathologize you and generally make you or anyone that believes you look retarded.

       I refer the term "truther" to Conspiracy theorist, since the stuff I post departed from the province of theory, when video of the cruise missile at the Pentagon, and the missile at the WTC went online.

       – Guided Missile at the WTC
      </p>
      <p>
       And when the news, that 60,00 or more Jews had failed to attend work at the WTC on 911 .. no theories at all, just proof!
      </p>
      <p>
       Whence the purpose is to get the perps - those Zionists that nuked the WTC on 911, who are waging unjust war world wide - onto the gallows, it would be a serious travesty should the journalism lobby that turns from the same hard evidence remain at large.

       Yes they Live here in the duocracy we call united states of Israel. They should just make Israel the 53rd state and stop pretending they are their own country. That's right ladies and gentlemen, Zionism was born here and just acted out by Israel through our support. Most of the people of Israel are against what the gov there is doing.
