    <div class="md"><p>Fulford mixes truth and things that sound good but aren&#39;t verifiable. Wilcock is pretty sketchy and has the flavor of a New Age kind of promoter. I don&#39;t buy into his grand ethereal assertions at all. By his support for Fulford he tends to decrease Fulford&#39;s credibility, too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, recent news about the NSA tapping into US military communications lends credence to Fulford&#39;s claim that there&#39;s a segment within the military that&#39;s against the stealthy damage to the US being done by the neocons/Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it can be said that it is a bunch of bunk, the whole reptilian bit, that doesn&#39;t in the slightest discredit the previous information in Icke&#39;s talks as it is easily sourced. Who knows, perhaps it is true and people just haven&#39;t caught on to it yet. Like (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WH3mvSstrQ)%5Bthis%5D">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WH3mvSstrQ)[this]</a> and others like it from Dan Winter, for instance. Doing your own research, connecting dots, and drawing your own conclusions is the only way to learn of the truth. It&#39;s just very hard when you&#39;re trying to look into matters that can be thousands of years old given the state occulted records.</p>

<p>And when the news, that 60,00 or more Jews had failed to attend work at the WTC on 911 .. no theories at all, just proof!</p>

<p>Whence the purpose is to get the perps - those Zionists that nuked the WTC on 911, who are waging unjust war world wide - onto the gallows, it would be a serious travesty should the journalism lobby that turns from the same hard evidence remain at large. </p>
