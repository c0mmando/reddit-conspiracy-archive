    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah.  That&#39;s why the OP &#39;gifted&#39; 10 views.  Because to watch a non-pirated version would cost you 5 bucks.  When it was in theaters, it cost 20 bucks.  He&#39;s not freely sharing anything, and even worse, nothing he shows in the movie is his.  It&#39;s other people&#39;s ideas and inventions that he cobbled together clips of and took credit for.  That&#39;s completely disgusting.  And even more disgusting is how he claims to have the technology for free energy, yet never shows you how to use it, how to get off the grid those nasty banking families set up.  Why didn&#39;t he share that? It&#39;s simple logic.  He wants money and power to share it, if he even has it at all, which I doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a big believer in being as objective as possible.  I would love to see the banking families fall.  I would love to see human evil eliminated.  I&#39;m also a pragmatist.  I watched the movie open-minded, I mean, if this guy really had something good to share, I&#39;m all for learning about it.  He just simply doesn&#39;t deliver.  And furthermore, he comes from a suspicious background.  His family has done lots of seriously heinous stuff.  To redeem himself, he would need to expose them, if he were serious about saving people.  After all, he has the inside info to stop their evil ways.  Yet, he doesn&#39;t do that.  At all.  Why?  Well, the logical answer would be that he doesn&#39;t want to hurt his income and profits.  So, he&#39;s more concerned about the cash, over saving lives.  Also, if he has this &#39;alien technology&#39; that can make humans independent, and remove them from the grid the elite set up, then he should share the blueprints freely.  But he doesn&#39;t do that.  Why?  Logically, because he either doesn&#39;t have the technology, or on the off chance he does, he wants profit and power for sharing them.  He&#39;s clearly trying to set up his own pyramid scheme, just like those elites he professes to hate.  And it&#39;s insulting, because he thinks people are too stupid to see through his manipulations.  </p>

<p>Though based on how some people want to just blindly follow him, without using logical thought or even researching his family, maybe he&#39;s not wrong in how he estimates the stupidity of people.</p>

<p>What&#39;s sad is that is how all the elite think of the rest of us.  To them, we are stupid, useless eaters.  That is why they want to eliminate 90% of us.  So they can enslave and control the rest.</p>

He shows youtube video clips about machines that other people invented, and tries to take credit for them and how he will revolutionize the world.  Yet, where are the plans for these machines?  Plus, he spends over an hour talking about the &#39;banking elite&#39;, like he discovered that problem, rather than being raised to be part of that problem.

    <div class="md"><p>Well first off, just wow.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for gifting my view.</p>

<p>Initially, I went in very skeptical. Looking at this as a zietgeist but less crazy kind of movie, but it was worth it. While mentioning some conspiracy theories, it was pretty legit. Linking much of the broader theories into one. Banking, energy, monetary, government, etc. </p>

<p>However, it provided a concise path to redemption. A goal that transcended political/geo/monetary ideal into a single idea of the greater good. This one really got to me. Had me really realize OUR idea&#39;s can change the world if we can just come together.</p>

<p>Thank you so much meep185 for letting me and others watch this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, there&#39;s only two ways this guy could possibly be for real, considering he is a member of an illuminati family.<br/>
1.  He would need to have fully outed all the evil shit his family has done, and is doing.  He never even mentioned them, other than to vaguely say &quot;I chose a different path&#39;.
2.  He would need to fully explain and share exactly how to personally manufacture this &#39;free energy&#39; to take you off the grid, and make you non-beholden to the illuminatis.  He never does that.</p>

<p>Instead, he proposes exactly what David Icke talks about.  Problem, reaction, solution.  With his agenda in place.  While he plays &#39;the victim&#39;.  This man is not a victim.  He&#39;s a billionaire illuminati.  He is trying for a power grab.</p>

<p>That is what&#39;s clearly going on here, folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. He&#39;s promoting his own agenda.  What he doesn&#39;t say is more important than what he does say.  Also, look at his actions.  He charges people 5 bucks to watch this pap on the internet.  When it was in theaters, he charged 20 bucks to watch it.  If he really wanted to promote change, he would offer what he knows for free, he would be up front and transparent.  It&#39;s not like he needs more money.  He&#39;s a goddamn billionaire. He would definitely expose his family and their evil ways in an attempt to stop them.  Instead, he&#39;s dancing around that, and trying to add to his billions by charging people to hear stuff that&#39;s already available for free on the internet.  He&#39;s riding the backs of true innovators, and even worse, trying to masturbate his ego by painting himself as some sort of child prodigy genius in the beginning of the movie.  He actually is trying to take credit for things that Einstein, Tesla, and many others discovered.  He offers no proof for his supposed genius.  If he really thought of all that stuff as a kid, why hasn&#39;t it been published?  Because he&#39;s full of shit, that&#39;s why. He hasn&#39;t discovered anything new.  He hasn&#39;t invented anything.  He isn&#39;t sharing any revelatory knowledge.  He&#39;s not freeing anybody.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s acting like a typical, lying, bullshit illuminati with an agenda.  Why?  Because he is one.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t make the mistake of looking for a guru to follow.  You&#39;re being gullible.  Look at the whole picture.  Only the truth, the whole truth, will set you free.</p>

What would this guy have to gain if we stopped using banks and GMO food? Is his whole plan to get ultra-rich by charging people $5 to watch a movie online? Doubtful.</p>

<p>Also, I notice how you attack the messenger, and not any of the actual facts or ideas in the film. He never claimed that any of these ideas were his -- he&#39;s disseminating them to us through his &quot;research&quot; as he put it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the &quot;common denominator&quot; between OWS, Tea Party, all political &quot;solutions&quot;, all the new agers preaching &quot;evolving consciousness&quot; or &quot;connecting with each other&quot;, most, if not all conspiracy theories etc.?  They all advocate &quot;solutions&quot; that require a large group of people to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>Could there be a more simple solution; one that only requires changing myself?</p>

<p>To quote one of the books I&#39;ve been enjoying very much recently, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/QBQ-Question-Behind-Practicing-Accountability/dp/0966583299">&quot;The Question Behind the Question&quot;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most tempting questions to ask when we first learn the QBQ is “What can we do?” The problem is, “we” don’t change. Teams, departments and organizations don’t change. People change, one at a time, through their own choices.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer in the team concept, but if we’re not careful, we can end up substituting the language of teams (“we” and “us”) for the language of personal accountability. We can hide behind the team with thoughts – which become excuses – such as:</p>

<p>“The team didn’t meet the deadline.”</p>

<p>“The team wasn’t given enough resources.”</p>

<p>“The team didn’t get the job done.”</p>

<p>&quot;The team didn’t have a clear mission.”</p>

<p>Personal accountability is not about changing others. It’s about making a difference by changing ourselves.</p>

<p>Personal accountability. The power of one.</p>

<ol>
<li>QBQs begin with the words “What” or “How”, not “Why”, “When”, or “Who”.</li>
</ol>

<p>•    “Why” questions lead to complaining and victim thinking, as in, “Why is this happening to me?”</p>

<p>•    “When” questions lead to procrastination, as in, “When are they going to get back with me?”</p>

<p>•    “Who” questions lead to blame, as in, “Who dropped the ball?”</p>

<ol>
<li><p>QBQs contain the word “I”, not “they”, “them”, “you” or even “we”, because I can change only me.</p></li>
<li><p>QBQs always focus on action.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>One important point to keep in mind is that it is possible to apply the QBQ guidelines and still create a lousy question. For example, &quot;How can I avoid responsibility in this matter?&quot; or &quot;What action can I take right now to hold the team back?&quot; adhere to the rules, but they are certainly not constructive questions!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dare you all to ask yourself &quot;Could I be the &#39;problem&#39;, and if so, how can I be the solution?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right on the money. The power of the people is the sum of its parts. What is the biggest part? The Unit. The Individual.</p>

<p>One of the messages of &quot;Thrive&quot; is that none of what&#39;s happening in the world around us proceeds exactly without our consent. We may think we don&#39;t consent to it, but then we vote for Obama, or don&#39;t go to OWS, etc. Germans didn&#39;t have to follow Hitler -- they <em>wanted</em> to. It&#39;s the same for us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m one of those who&#39;s mostly dismissed the crop circle phenomenon. I must say that the response to our message seems to indicate either a highly advanced race or a very well hidden method of creating crop circles.<br/>
The accompaniment of the &quot;self portrait&quot; seemed to be making fun of the resolution of our transmission&#39;s data matrix. As in, &quot;nice signal, we can burn shit on your planet in gray-scale.&quot;</p>

<p>I disagree that we can effectively utilize the current systems to achieve the goal of mass freedom and sustainability.
I&#39;m of the mind that our current system of government is beyond repair. It&#39;s hard to remain above political influence on this issue. A politician would (and has) call(ed) me an anarchist. I say, &quot;I&#39;m not against government, I&#39;m against this government.&quot;</p>

<p>Our systems were designed on the valuation of gold. We&#39;ve shifted to the valuation of certainty among scarcity. We need to valuate all things based on life, sustainability and peace. These things are what hold true value for a thriving biosphere in an unknown galaxy. Without a shift in focus from competition in markets to &quot;open source&quot; collaboration, we&#39;ll never see the cure for cancer or clean renewable energy. Further, with our current sociopolitical atmosphere, we&#39;ll never see a motivation for such a shift.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hopeful that the revolution will be a cold war fought in the court rooms. I&#39;m also overly optimistic in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched this yesterday, and found it fascinating that the creator is a Gamble. It very well could be controlled opposition, but the information portrayed in the doc is well disseminated by many in the general &quot;truth movement&quot;. As an information scientist, I feel that gathering these various perspectives of information are very important, so long as we continually think critically. Gamble&#39;s perspective regarding our collective oppression and the solutions he proposed appear to be very similar to my own-- against central banking and the cronyism it purports, calling out the Establishment families that pillage and destroy-- supporting non-aggression and voluntarism, circulating alternative currency, holistic medicine, seeking &quot;free energy&quot;...</p>

<p>This was all very interesting, but the most fascinating aspect of this doc is its creator, Foster Gambel. We all need to do some collaborative research to see how legitimate this man and his movement are... I agree somewhat with empresssharyl that this man very well could have an agenda as his name comes from an inconceivably ruthless bunch. I, for one, am typically very skeptical about &quot;proof&quot; of aliens simply because I&#39;ve read the project blue beam papers, and understand the global governance implications of some alien &quot;invasion&quot;.. never the less, if we simply observe this information, much of it is not antagonistic to the information that has been circulating the truth movement for a VERY long time. Technologies have been invented that would literally provide free energy, cure any health problem, and allow us to venture the universe (potentially), but the very monied interests(gamble&#39;s lineage included) have either bought off, used patents, or killed those potentially innovative technologies. This is a somewhat unique aspect of this film, and really speaks to the creative solutions found within voluntary associations outside of corporate/government subsidized research and development. Potentially the biggest inventions in human history have been swept under the rug by the most ruthless Establishment thugs. </p>

<p>Anyway, extract the information from this film, think critically, and incorporate what you sense as truthful into your knowledge base. One of the solutions mentioned is alternative currencies. I would implore anyone who understands central banking to began seriously researching alt currencies... here&#39;s a head start... <a href="http://shiresilver.com/">http://shiresilver.com/</a>  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My two cents. I thought that the film painted the issue with a very broad brush. This is not a film to break people into waking up. This is a film for those people who already know what is happening. The skeptic who watches this film will find that the conclusions drawn in the film are not fully supported or proven with the evidence presented in the film. As I said before, this film is for the initiated and not for the uninitiated. I felt that not enough time was devoted to free energy. </p>

<p>Also, the presentation of the film will put off the more conservative uninitiated. Lets face facts here: I know exactly what that person would say. &quot;What the fuck is all this touchy feely hippy bullshit?&quot; I can totally understand that response. I already knew everything presented in this film and so was not at all surprised, I was actually pretty bored. But if your intention is to share this one with your family and friends and try to enlighten them, I would suggest not using this film, it may do more harm than good as it might convince those people that your are in fact a touchy feely hippy. </p>

<p>I believe if they toned down the free energy / UFO stuff, it would be even better (could have the potential to persuade a wider audience).

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t done much research, but I&#39;ve seen magnets used to move things. Even things as large as trains. But couldn&#39;t you position magnets in such a way that they would spin, floating in the air, forever? If so, you could connect them to something that collects the movement and harness that energy to, say, light a lamp? The magnets would be spinning constantly and it would store energy and you could turn on the light whenever, and not have it tethered to anything? I&#39;d imagine a lot of things that use very little energy and/or aren&#39;t always on could use this. Clocks, cell phone chargers, stuff like that. Would be hard to run, say, a refrigerator or something, but it could run some things. And what&#39;s to say a refrigerator couldn&#39;t have a column of magnets collecting energy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a big believer in being as objective as possible.  I would love to see the banking families fall.  I would love to see human evil eliminated.  I&#39;m also a pragmatist.  I watched the movie open-minded, I mean, if this guy really had something good to share, I&#39;m all for learning about it.  He just simply doesn&#39;t deliver.  And furthermore, he comes from a suspicious background.  His family has done lots of seriously heinous stuff.  To redeem himself, he would need to expose them, if he were serious about saving people.  After all, he has the inside info to stop their evil ways.  Yet, he doesn&#39;t do that.  At all.  Why?  Well, the logical answer would be that he doesn&#39;t want to hurt his income and profits.  So, he&#39;s more concerned about the cash, over saving lives.  Also, if he has this &#39;alien technology&#39; that can make humans independent, and remove them from the grid the elite set up, then he should share the blueprints freely.  But he doesn&#39;t do that.  Why?  Logically, because he either doesn&#39;t have the technology, or on the off chance he does, he wants profit and power for sharing them.  He&#39;s clearly trying to set up his own pyramid scheme, just like those elites he professes to hate.  And it&#39;s insulting, because he thinks people are too stupid to see through his manipulations.  </p>

<p>Though based on how some people want to just blindly follow him, without using logical thought or even researching his family, maybe he&#39;s not wrong in how he estimates the stupidity of people.</p>

<p>What&#39;s sad is that is how all the elite think of the rest of us.  To them, we are stupid, useless eaters.  That is why they want to eliminate 90% of us.  So they can enslave and control the rest.</p>
