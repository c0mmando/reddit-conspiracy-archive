    <div class="md"><p>Here are a few interpretations of recent events that I&#39;ve seen to support this view. As others in this thread have said, it&#39;s a tricky thing to separate hate for <em>all</em> jews and a distrust/hate of the zionist agenda. Unfortunately, the two aren&#39;t always mutually exclusive, and as in any group, ignorant bigots find a way to voice their opinion and justify it as fact. There are also some well thought out arguments that some people present, and some fairly unjust events that have been facilitated for the benefit of a zionist agenda. Whether these events were organized by zionists is up for debate, but some seem to have no other explanation.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start at the most recent, and grandiose exercise of Zionism in the modern era, the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state:
After the end of WWII and the persecution of the Jews, along with many other minority groups, the international community came together to take land from a group of people who played no role in that persecution and handed it to Jewish people as their new state. The justification was that Jerusalem, their holy center was located in the region and they had ancient claim to that land. This new state was defended on principle by the most powerful countries in the world and justified by the recent horrors of the holocaust. The Ukranian exterminations conducted by Stalin on the other hand, went completely unaddressed. After all, his side won the war. Even ignoring these Ukranians, the other groups persecuted by the Nazis, such as Gypsies, homosexuals, blacks, etc... received no similar compensation or protection from the international community. The United Nations only cared to take land from an uninvolved party for the sake of a Jewish state, not for any other. This theft of land is in large part the reason for modern Palestinian discontent. For decades they&#39;ve been told they should be happy with what is left for them, and to many of them, that situation feels (understandably) unjust.</p>

<p>Some reports came out after the holocaust that certain horrors that were put on display (such as candles made from human fat, skull ashtrays, and human skin lampshades) were pieces of propaganda developed by the allies after the liberation of concentration camps. There has been further argument that the Nazi&#39;s plans for jews were actually to use them as forced labor, not simply to exterminate them. Some historians even believe the gas chambers allegedly used for mass exterminations in especially famous camps such as Auschwitz were hoaxes altogether because the characteristic blue staining left by Zyclon B gas (the gas allegedly used in these heinous acts) was completely absent from the chambers. Instead, these theories proclaim most of the deaths in these camps occurred after allied blockades choked supply lines to the extremities of the Axis war machine. It is certain that such blockades and bombing runs on supply lines happened, what is uncertain is whether or not these disruptions were responsible for the deaths of the imprisoned or whether it was intentional genocide. It is certain that the Nazis persecuted the jews, what is less certain is whether they wanted them completely gone, or if they wanted them subjugated under the thumb of absolute authority. (for more information on these allegations, there is a youtube video of two famous holocaust deniers on Donahue <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRrP7AevKi4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRrP7AevKi4</a> One of these deniers is ethnically Jewish, and both make fairly compelling points for why they believe the famous gas chambers didn&#39;t exist.)</p>

<p>In the modern day and age, the most stark example of the power the zionist agenda has is the United States&#39; uncompromising support of Israel despite their repeatedly uncompromising stances on the international stage. The recent vote to allow UN recognition of Palestinian statehood is a great example of this. When there are only two countries voting against something, and it happens to be the United States and Israel, on an issue that doesn&#39;t directly threaten the United States in any conceivable way, is it really that far of a leap to imagine that some very powerful people have a very vested interest in the continued expansion and prominence of Israel in the international community? The fact that the United States annually gives significant aid (both monetary and military) to Israel, an economically successful state also raises a lot of questions for those who believe Zionist forces have undue influence. I won&#39;t go into more examples because you asked for TL;DR version, so I tried to condense as much as possible and provide examples that are within our modern frame of reference. Still, it is difficult to make anything but circumstantial arguments, and it is hard to explain something many people believe has been going on for centuries with a few brief examples, but I tried to present some compelling ones here. </p>

<p>I, for one, believe identifications that separate groups of people from the whole are generally destructive to the overall prosperity of humanity. The danger of having a few people who consider themselves part of an exclusive group possessing undue influence is that they will work for the advancement of that group at the expense of those who aren&#39;t a part of it. This doesn&#39;t mean that everybody within that group is malevolent, and this is a big part of the problem people with suspicions about Zionists run into. Bigotry in any form is a terrible thing, but wariness of those with significant power and myopic agendas is not. Yes, some people here are certainly antisemitic, maybe even a higher percentage than you would find in a random sample of the world population because many of the arguments against Zionist interests are convenient for antisemites to cling on to, but that doesn&#39;t mean all of the arguments they hold are completely invalid. Good luck sorting through what I&#39;ve written and making your own decision. Unfortunately, history is vast and concrete interpretations are difficult to find, every word ever written has a bias behind it, no matter how hard the author tries to set it aside. Good luck making up your own mind, and I hope that your perception of those that question official stories isn&#39;t forever tainted by the few who also spout filth as they do it.</p>

<p>EDIT: I notice that the only post you unequivocally have a positive reaction to is the one that blames the perception on unfettered racism. I hope you don&#39;t believe any answer as simplistic as the one he gave is wholly true. Life is full of shades of grey, and believing any group as diverse as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is united by a single view such as antisemitism feels deliberately narrow minded. It&#39;s a shame if people believe that so much doubt from such a wide range of people can be fueled by simple bigotry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. Just wow. This is a wonderful reply - and thank you.</p>

<p>I want to let you know that I support any answer here that is, at least, an answer. It seems entirely simplistic - but as I said in the original post : I have zero experience or teaching in this area. I&#39;m going to do my best to look into this for myself, as I see thoughts and opinions on this topic range far and wide.</p>

<p>Thank you. So much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you read it and thought about some of the events I brought up. I didn&#39;t mean to accuse you of narrow mindedness, my edit was more a comment on the post that blamed everything on unthinking racism than your reply. Looking through all the posts, I can understand how frustrated you must have felt with the lack of information in them. I feel like the post that blames the attitude on people&#39;s willingness to believe whatever particular &quot;pet&quot; media people hold dear is equally devoid of actual information, however. His statement at the end that &quot;I&#39;m not making this up.&quot; when the entire post is opinion is especially distressing to me. You seem like a discerning individual with a genuine interest in understanding the world you&#39;re living in, and I was sad to see you swallow his statement wholesale.</p>

<p>Good luck sorting through all the information out there, the world&#39;s so damn complicated and curated by so many different curators that truth is a slippery thing to get a hold of. Always keep that curious mind of yours engaged and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find your way to your own, well informed opinions.</p>

<p>Finally, congratulations on finishing college, that&#39;s a tremendous achievement and hopefully it&#39;s given you the critical thinking skills necessary to start parsing the impossibly large wealth of information that&#39;s out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is no tl:dr to this situation, you are insulting us by asking for one, that is why people are jumping down your throat. also your question is poorly worded. we dont hate the jews it just so happens the fuckers who are in power are jews and they support Zionism which is the belief that they are entitled to Israel because it says so in the bible and they are gods chosen people blah blah from my understanding of the bible and zion the jews arnt supposed to start zion until the messiah comes, and if you set up zion without the messiah, it becomes a curse. zion with the messiah is supposed to start 1000 years of peace but as you can see Israel has caused nothing but problems . i believe zion with the messiah isnt just a state or country but a state of being for the whole world. i think being &quot;jews&quot; is just a cover just like the pope being catholic is a cover, i think they are all working hand in hand as satanists. they formed secret societies known as the Illuminati and they are trying to take over the world thru banking, military and media to set up a new world order. it is an order without god aka love it is the beast it is the most imperfect system a system with out love is evil! i used to be an athiest but i now believe in an &quot;all&quot; and i study jesus and guess what?

    <div class="md"><p>zionism is based on the bible why would you ignore my statement because i brought up jesus? when you bring up zionism you are having a religious discussion. you need to understand if you look at the complete conspiracy that we discuss in r/conspiracy it is the jews that control the money system along with the Catholics that control religion are working together because they are both satanists and have hid the real story of jesus because he was against the money changers and rome. these satanists have recruited black people thru the music industry to promote faith in their religion of money. these satanists orchestrate their control thru world wide secs called the illuminatti. they are the ones who are in on the plan they are illuminated and everyone else is in the dark. they meet behind closed doors. these satanists funded and supported the nazis and used the 2nd world war as an excuse to set up Israel. they are using Israel to start world war 3 and their usury based banking system to enslave the world.</p>

<p>This is a good summation of part of what most of them believe.  You might also want to search how many times the Protocols of the Elders of Zion have been posted here.  The general consensus is &quot;ya, they might be fake but why are they so damned true?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At what point do you realize that the people you consider the &quot;powerful Zionist&quot; are actually just regular &quot;professional Jews&quot; (whatever the fuck that is)?  I play online with a real life Zionist living in an occupation settlement and who served in the IDF and a youth.  He spends most of his time smoking &quot;Hezbollah hash&quot; and playing video games, I can assure you he is no different than a &quot;regular Jew&quot;.</p>

Except for the fact that he is living in an occupation settlement and served a racist military (which if I remember correctly is a requirement of all citizens).  Your friend is just a pawn like any other citizen, who has no say in the matter, just like our own US Army and Marine kids.  </p>

<p>Just because your friend is regular, doesn&#39;t mean that the multiple <em>billionaires</em> who own large media, big guns, and play chess with the world aren&#39;t.   It takes a very special kind of fucked-up to do that.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OH, he paved the way for the siphoning trillions of dollars from the US economy into Israel&#39;s military and and weapons programs?   Wow, he must be really good at CoD.    I bet he funded Mossad&#39;s multi-national intelligence cells for the carrying out of 9/11.   Or maybe he&#39;s that one guy who decided to fly multiple aircraft over Palestine dropping White Phosphorous on innocent civilians!</p>

<p>There is no way in hell your buddy has done more to help the Zionist agenda than the chairman of the federal reserve.   Maybe more <em>directly</em>, but he doesn&#39;t have the money and clout to supply tanks/bulldozer/MEDIA BLACKOUTS/PR to allow this type of shit to occur. </p>

<p>Both your friend and Ben Shalom Bernanke are helping the Zionist Agenda, both of them are wrong for doing so, but your friend probably doesn&#39;t have a choice.   Mr. Bernanke does, and he knows <em>exactly</em> what is going on.    Have you ever heard him speak at a Senate Commission? Dude&#39;s voice is shakier than a man with a gun to his head.   He&#39;s scared shitless of the American public, and he knows that he has to pull off lying to our faces, while supplying billions of dollars to support the deaths of our children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You probably wouldn&#39;t believe it from someone here. The preferable solution is to research what individuals own controlling interest in all of the major western news corporations, all of the major military contractor corporations and all of the major banks and investment corporations. Then check out how many members of congress take regular junkets to Israel paid for by Israel lobbies. Then check out how many of them pander to AIPAC and how much money they get from Jewish interests (and those corporations mentioned above) for their campaign funds. The same applies to all of the western countries. You just have to see it for yourself to believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize where a lot of these guys are coming from.  They <em>truly</em> believe that a fair sized group of Zionist control every event that happens on the planet.  Remember the earthquake that hit Japan?  That was the fucking Zionist running HAARP.  Remember the Tsunami that killed millions in Asia?  Another hit operation carried out by the dirty fucking Jews...errr I mean Zionist, ya Zionist.  2008 financial meltdown?  That was a con job that only a Jew would be sneaky enough to carry out, which is 100% conclusive proof that the select few at the top (with Jewish sounding names) had engineered the economy like a Swiss watch to go off at exactly the right time.</p>

<p>The real big one that they will rarely share with newbies is their version of WWII.  Not only did the Jews start the war but also faked MOST (not all, I mean what kind of nut denies the <em>entire</em> Holocaust) of the 6 million deaths attributed to the Holocaust.  I mean come on man, common sense pretty much tells us that if 6 million of them died then, like how would there be any left in Europe today?</p>

<p>Spend some time here, if only for the anthropological experience.  Without the internet you would be hard pressed to encounter this level of crazy in 2 lifetimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They hate the Jews for the same reason Fox News watchers hate liberals. Seriously. They just hear some dumb shit from sources they like and they roll with it. They don&#39;t even understand the implications of what they&#39;re reading and hearing. They don&#39;t understand, for example, that unless there is some inherent characteristic of a Jewish person that predisposes them to play this role they dislike, the associations between the roles and the people being Jews are strictly circumstantial and therefore meaningless. They call them &quot;Zionists&quot; as if Zionist is somehow a more accurate descriptor than any other descriptor. They <em>assume</em> people are Zionists based on how they act or who they affiliate themselves with, when, alternatively, they don&#39;t even know what characterizes a Zionist or how Zionism corresponds to the behavior in question. They are, plainly and simply, complete fucking idiots. Every single one of them who takes this angle against Jews or Zionists, idiots. This is the real reason, I&#39;m not making it up.</p>
