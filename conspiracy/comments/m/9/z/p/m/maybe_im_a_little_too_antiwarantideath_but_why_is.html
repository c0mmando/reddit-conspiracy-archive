        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/m9piz/russian_veteran_finds_his_own_tank_as_a_monument/">This link is #3 on Reddit</a></p>

<p>I understand the basic sentiment. An old Russian veteran finds a tank he used to operate being used as a monument. So he takes some time to observe the tank. Somone takes a picture. Now according to Reddit, it is &quot;heartbreaking&quot;. How many hundreds of people lost their lives because of this worthless machine? Also, when did Veteran&#39;s Day involve celebrating Russian military?</p>

<p>This post isn&#39;t just about this specific event. I&#39;m getting sick of the hero worship targeted at military. Yesterday on my facebook I see dozens of people worshiping and indiscriminately thanking the military for their service. I have seen this type of thing my entire life. The military is constantly honored and thanked for &#39;protecting our freedom&#39;. The people who are doing the worshiping are usually the type of people who are brainwashed and have no idea what is going on, probably couldn&#39;t tell you who the Vice President is. But they&#39;ll sure as hell slap a Support the Troops ribbon on their car and feel good about themselves. Another sad trend I&#39;m seeing is people like your average Redditor letting themselves be conned by the same type of emotional bullshit. I&#39;m starting to think games like Call of Duty, etc.. are starting to have an affect. </p>

<p>If anyone uses a small amount of critical thinking they&#39;ll realize the military isn&#39;t &#39;protecting our freedom&#39;. If anything the multiple wars America is fighting is one of the main components causing the decay of our freedoms. A majority of the troops are good, decent people. There&#39;s also plenty of bad apples. The main problem with the constant, automatic worship of the troops is psychologically most people link the troops with the wars and the government. No one wants to have a discussion about the legality or cost of the wars. No one wants to talk about the terrible treatment the government gives to the troops.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of things that would actually help our military:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop using depleted uranium tainted ammunition(today a good chunk if not the majority of ammunition used by the military is contaminated with depleted uranium, they even use it inside of the country in training)</li>
<li>Stop sending the troops to fight and die in unnecessary, illegal wars</li>
<li>We spend trillions of dollars on defense each year but I still see donation drives to &quot;get armor&quot; for the troops. WTF? Our government uses half of this country&#39;s wealth to wage war and we can&#39;t even get combat armor to our troops? This should be the main isue of Veteran&#39;s Day.</li>
<li>Allow veterans coming back from combat to use cannabis to treat their many medical conditions</li>
<li>Give troops/veterans insurance and benefits instead of the government slashing every benefit they can get away with</li>
<li>Use common sense in combat strategy, don&#39;t pile 30 Navy Seals onto an old helicopter and fly around near ground-level so they can get shot down and all die</li>
<li>Give fallen soldiers the dignity they deserve by not throwing their corpses into trash field</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate the blind hero worship as well. World war two era things are not my forte, and I can&#39;t speak for the soldiers or the battles that were fought then, but as for veterans now, I hold no respect for any individual in the military.</p>

<p>Unless proven otherwise by personal actions of a single soldier I will not &quot;support our troops&quot; because how can you support people who willingly go to fight in a war you don&#39;t agree with? These people weren&#39;t drafted, they went to war. Some try to argue that they &quot;didn&#39;t have a choice&quot; because they needed money that the military provides, but I say that&#39;s a very poor excuse. If you think being paid for supporting an organization that murders civilians is a better option for you than working at a Mcdonalds, then I feel nothing for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reddit front page (r/all) is entirely controlled by the military. The history of reddit is that of gradual fragmentation and dilution of the power of the individual, ie: the introduction of subreddits, customized user front page. This is so that people must look for serious news and those who don&#39;t are not exposed to it. Anything inane or conforming to the agenda is sockpuppetted to 2000+ votes. These stories provide a buffer between the actual news and the ignorant masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are web-savvy, or know anyone who is, please set up a competitor using <a href="http://github.com/ambiversive/asg/">this</a> code. I&#39;ve written it in a way that should prevent the fragmentation mentioned above. The interface is far more advanced than reddit as well. Links are selected from a large set of RSS feeds and submitted to the site with a single click. Once submitted, everyone on the site is informed via the chat, and a full backup is made of the link. <a href="http://improvise.it/rss.htm">Here</a> is a screencast showing what I mean.</p>

<p>In addition, the monolithic nature of reddit and subsequent concentration of power can be averted by having many instances of this that are connected via the RSS aggregator. If each instance has within its rss database a reference to the output of the other instances, then it becomes decentralized link aggregation.</p>

<p>I imagine that sounds confusing- isn&#39;t fragmentation the same as decentralization? </p>

<p>In fact, no. They are not the same. When I say &#39;fragmentation&#39; regarding reddit I refer to the hiding of information from the uninitiated. In order to find serious news on reddit you have to know where to look and actively seek it out. Decentralization means that in the event of one node (instance) &#39;selling out&#39; and being co-opted, others will still retain authority over their content and mechanisms of information distribution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There once was a Russian soldier who was drafted, under the threat of death, to fight a war he knew nothing about. He some how survived to go on and scrape out a meager living in some factory.

    <div class="md"><p>Like all things in r/cons you are missing the CONTEXT.  Being a Russian tanker means he was drafted.  His choices were fight or die and while you might like to pretend that you would die for your ideals you have no idea till you smell the cordite and blood of the body next to you.</p>

<p>Soldiers don&#39;t worry about politics, they worry about missions.  Their mission was to kill the guys who were trying to kill him and hope they got to see their friends at the end of the day.  You can&#39;t understand trauma till you experience it first hand and being that you have never served (not saying I have) you will probably never get to experience the feeling he has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree with you. I understand that bankers orchestrate wars and the 99% have to deal with their manipulation by fighting and dying in wars for bankers&#39; profits.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also trying to get at priorities here. Why is it that this idea/picture is so popular on Reddit? How many thousands of Libyan children just died in the last few months? But instead of worrying about dead children, we think it&#39;s heartwarming and honorable to celebrate a machine of war from 70 years ago?</p>

<p>We need to have an open debate and get the emotionally charged feel-good religious beliefs out of it. American and British companies were in Germany building German weapons and tanks for years before WWII. Britain and America loaned Germany huge amounts of money so they could fight in WWII. Seventy years later we&#39;re still celebrating the big scam from a childish, emotional level.</p>

<p>Can you tell me and provide a reliable source?  Look at the popular message on r/cons, that Gaddafi was some kind of &quot;people&#39;s leader&quot; who was on the verge of destroying the Jewish economy so most of pro-Palestinian Europe teamed up for a limited air war to destroy his heavy weapons.  That fantasy only persists on the internet and is perpetuated by people who have never left the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I somewhat share your sentiment, I also understand that it is not the soldier who plans the atrocities... it&#39;s the people who control them. Unless they go rogue, it&#39;s their commanding officers and their bosses that make the decisions. Although you could say &quot;Then don&#39;t join the military&quot; and I might agree...some people really aren&#39;t suited to do much more than the military. What we should be doing is condemning our leaders for even thinking about forcing our military to perform the atrocities they are. What right do they have to order a human being to kill another human being when they probably wouldn&#39;t pull the trigger themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Absolutely not. You can&#39;t ever remove personal responsibility from any war. If a person is <em>only</em> suited to murder, then that person needs help. I&#39;m talking hardcore psychiatric help. Anyone who joins the army joins the war machine. Anyone who signs up is a part of the ravaging of countries that can do nothing to defend themselves. Except through acts of terrorism, which is their only way to &quot;protect their freedom and their homeland&quot;.</p>

<p>Joining the military is basically signing up for well paid terror duty. The only difference is how we in the west see them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just a western ideal to glorify soldiers... every country does that. If they didn&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t be able to justify why they go to war. War isn&#39;t some western convention that we thought up. It came with cities and banding together. Before mesopotamia there is no signs of organized warfare. The only answer is to form small nomadic bands that rarely meet. This means that 95% of the planets population would have to die. I find it hard to sympathize with you even though I think war can ultimately be avoided. The problem with the leaders no matter how much you make it about the soldiers. If the soldiers didn&#39;t exist at all we would have other problems. Whether you agree with the actions or not a military is necessary for defense at least. The issue is how we use our military and who decides that is the superiors. </p>

<p>I think they&#39;re trying to treat veterans&#39; depression, not make it worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand your statement? Cannabis can be used to treat depression and PTSD along with many other things. I think it would be nice to at least allow the option for returning troops to use medicinal cannabis. Should they use prozac and alcohol instead? They&#39;re adults, I think they can make their own decisions. They can go risk their lives fighting in a foreign country but can&#39;t make the decision to use a plant?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just a western ideal to glorify soldiers... every country does that. If they didn&#39;t they wouldn&#39;t be able to justify why they go to war. War isn&#39;t some western convention that we thought up. It came with cities and banding together. Before mesopotamia there is no signs of organized warfare. The only answer is to form small nomadic bands that rarely meet. This means that 95% of the planets population would have to die. I find it hard to sympathize with you even though I think war can ultimately be avoided. The problem with the leaders no matter how much you make it about the soldiers. If the soldiers didn&#39;t exist at all we would have other problems. Whether you agree with the actions or not a military is necessary for defense at least. The issue is how we use our military and who decides that is the superiors. </p>
