        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All right where to begin. In the past few months i&#39;ve noticed an extraordinary amount of down voting political topics that touch a nerve with the reddit community. I understand that some people downvote because they don&#39;t like the subject it seems like simply not voting would be far less rude. Because of the nature of the topics downvoted I wonder if our nataonalist propaganda teams are hard at work making sure that the only subjects that see the light of day on the main page and other major subreddits are frivolous. Think about it, every aspect of reddit is designed to make the community easily accessible by all with no limits in place to control the amount of accounts one can have. Even a force of only one person tasked to steer the direction of reddit discourse could have major impacts, with simple programs one could find contentious posts or comments and cycle through accounts mass downvoting easily.</p>

<p><strong>TL/DR: I feel that there are organized attempts to lead the direction of subreddits and the reddit community away from important matters.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. Reddit is not just our secret clubhouse of free-thinkers.</p>

<p>Take the Occupy Movement. Reddit has been obsessed with anti-government protests in other countries. Threads about drug policy, the wars, government corruption, and corporate greed regularly hit the front page. Posts that say nothing more than &quot;Americans need to get off the couch and protest!&quot; and &quot;Wake up sheeple!&quot; score thousands of upvotes.</p>

<p>But when America gets its own anti-government protests? Nothing but criticism, cynicism, and slander.</p>

<p>I would hazard a guess and say that subjects like Occupy Wallstreet, Libya, and the Obama Administration&#39;s failures are astroturfed the most. And of course, patrolling new submissions with 10 computers and downvoting whatever you want is extremely easy.</p>

<p>If you believe that there are people in the US government powerful enough to attack foreign countries for their oil, then you must believe they have the power to protect these ambitions here at home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bit of a stretch to assume they would allocate this many resources into swaying the opinion of the Reddit culture, but if you look at the War On Terror™ and the media&#39;s constant reinforcement ten years in, this probably hasn&#39;t been cheap either. Look at how many people still believe the 9/11 &#39;official story&#39;. On the back of this was placed the bin Laden raid/death story, and in the future, on the back of that, whatever else they decide to feed us. I&#39;m in the middle on this one. While I have seen a few lucid ideas regarding current/world affairs, I have also seen the fair share of mainstream links as well. </p>

I particuarly noticed this on Netflix threads and threads about broadband billing.  I am almost 100 percent sure that the site is monitored by the Chinese as any discussions about China are pretty quickly co-opted.  I am pretty sure this is a known phenomenon and is sponsored in some way by the Chinese government.   I assume the US monitors Reddit but am unsure about actual manipulation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is and its very noticable.</p>

<p>This hasnt been happening for a few months, this has been happening for at least a year, probaly much longer.</p>

<p>Also dont think this is something that requires hundereds of people, 1 guy with a special application can control hundreds of reddit accounts. Remember the software being created by HBGary? most people dont since they have an attention span of about 30 seconds! But thats exactly what it did, allowed a few people to control thousands of accounts on facebook and any other site the software was configured for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theres two major problems for r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>1: The OWS and politics submissions;</p>

<p>There are far too many sock puppets coming on to Conspiracy and posting lots of submissions that are clearly political and not conspiracy. Those posts are drowning out good conspiracy submissions that wouldnt get promoted elsewhere. </p>

<p>2: Some persistent posters (wont name names) are just using r/conspiracy has a platform ofr their own political views and are disreagrding the point of the conspiracy forum. This needs to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I suspect the creation of the subreddit system was motivated partly by a desire to reduce the appearance on the front page of 9/11 Truth and other conspiracy topics. Before there were subreddits, 9/11 Truth submissions would appear frequently on the front page. Those submissions typically had lots of downvotes and lots of heavily upvoted hostile comments. But that still meant more exposure to those topics than casual reddit users get now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here we go again.  &quot;<em>Someone disagreed with my political opinion, therefore they must be an astroturfer</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>This attitude really highlights the arrogance of Redditors in general. How arrogant do you have to be to believe that the only explanation why people would disagree with you is because they&#39;re being paid to do so? And taking that &quot;logic&quot; a step further, that the only reason why people disagree with you is because they&#39;re part of an elaborate government conspiracy. How fucking self-absorbed do you have to believe this shit?</p>

<p>This is exactly why I unsubscribed from <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, and why I downvote every political thread I see in a non-political subreddit. Keep that nonsense contained to the circlejerk.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that the government has their hands in Facebook, Google, and Twitter. I highly doubt that they&#39;re wasting their resourcing on pointless trolling in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> where anything that doesn&#39;t agree with the hivemind is mercilessly downvoted without fail. The government is far more skilled and competent at propaganda than to waste their time employing people to argue on Reddit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why would they not troll reddit? is 60million unique visitors a month not enough to pique their interest? No, how about 750,000 pages served every 15minutes?</p>

<p>I agree they are skilled, and experienced, and motivated; and that is why they use every tool in the box.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hivemind is being co-opted? I&#39;d love to see evidence. Try posting anything pro-establishment anywhere on this website, and it will never make it out of <a href="/r/new">/r/new</a>. Anything that would remotely discredit the OWS meets the same fate (<a href="/r/libertarian">/r/libertarian</a> is a possible exception, but they&#39;ve got no love for the government). If anyone is indeed trying to &quot;co-opt the hivemind,&quot; then they&#39;re doing an incredibly shitty job at it.</p>

<p>Reddit is popular, yes, but still small potatoes compared to Facebook, Google, and Twitter. You&#39;ve also got the hivemind to contend with. Why waste your time here when you&#39;ve got bigger and less resistant targets elsewhere?</p>
