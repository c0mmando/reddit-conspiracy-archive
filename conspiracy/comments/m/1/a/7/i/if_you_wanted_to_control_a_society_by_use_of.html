    <div class="md"><p>Of course. That is where Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura come into play. They might not even realize it, but their theories they present on their programs are rather tame compared to what is really happening, and they have a clear set of boundaries in place which prevents them or their own hive minds from poking through this conspiracy bubble which seems to focus almost entirely US government, police, the banks and various round table groups. Alex seems to hit on the truth every now and again, which makes me question the degree to which his show is controlled, but it seems almost accidental when he does, like he&#39;s guessing. There are a lot of blanks in between as well, like either he knows the truth and can&#39;t say because his program is controlled, or because his program focuses mainly on the US and exopolitics are not familiar subject matter. Just try and get Alex to talk about the Vatican or Israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct, there are topics Jones is very uncomfortable even mentioning, but it is not so much Israel as it is Zionism in general. He won&#39;t criticize American Jews and he seems completely blind to their control over the American media and Wall Street, including the Federal Reserve. He seldom talks about AIPAC, or about the total subservience to AIPAC displayed by members of Congress and the Senate. He&#39;s got this generic and vague term &quot;globalists&quot; that he uses for everybody and everything. Everything is the fault of the globalists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about this one a lot and honestly I think Alex is trying his hardest to avoid the scarlet letter that is antisemetism. He has a foothold in the mainstream and any slip on that subject can destroy your credentials and takes any degrees or titles you have worked your entire life to achieve and turns it into one word:antisemite. </p>
