    <div class="md"><p>Considering that Kubrick was a notorious perfectionist obsessed with authenticity, it seems logical to me that he probably had run into shadowy organizations during his career in showbusiness.  Perhaps, especially considering his reputation as a &#39;maverick&#39;, was often at odds with those types of people. Pure conjecture but not hard to imagine, to me at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for this.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always found this movie enigmatic. Like Kubrick was trying to say something about who really controls the world behind all the politicians they spoon feed the masses on TV. I find it curious he died just about the time he released a movie depicting the corrupt rich as ritualistic sex fiends adhering to the rules of some ancient order. It&#39;s bone chilling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what they said to Ernest Hemingway when he tried to tell people he was being followed by the FBI. He was put in a mental institution and given electro shock therapy to help cure his paranoid delusions. Released FBI documents reveal Hemingway was being tailed by them. Even A.E Hochner talks about how back in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s even Hemingway&#39;s closest friends did not believe him.</p>

<p>So much for absurdly crazy. We are not aware of 1/100th of what the government is really doing. That is one reason so much money is always unaccounted for from the defense and intelligence departments.</p>

<p>Dark Side of the Moon, is a French documentary by director William Karel, which originally aired on Arte in 2002, with the title Opération Lune. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The basic premise for the film, is the theory that the television footage from the Apollo 11 Moon landing, was faked and actually recorded in a studio, by the CIA, with help from director Stanley Kubrick. </p>

<p>It features some surprising guest appearances, most notably by Donald Rumsfeld, Dr. Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, Buzz Aldrin and Stanley Kubrick&#39;s widow, Christiane Kubrick. </p>

<p>The tone of the documentary, begins with low key revelations of NASA, working closely with Hollywood, at the time of the Moon landings. </p>

<p>Over the course of the tale, Karel postulates that not only did Kubrick help the USA fake the moon landings, but that he was eventually killed by the CIA, to cover up the truth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First hand testimony backing these claims, is from Rumsfeld, and Dr. Kissinger, which lend credence to the story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or more accurately that he thought it was a hoax. I am not going to deny the symbolism in the film was Kubrick saying he believed the moon landing to be a hoax; however it is silly at this point to say it was. Back then I could easily see why someone could think this and it would be rational, especially someone like Kubrick who had made <em>2001</em>. Yet it is, well, dumb to continue to press this conspiracy theory especially since we can now take pictures of the landing area. The existence of the reflector plates on the moon is also a pretty clear indicator that we did go there even before we could shoot clear images of the surface to such depth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched his Kubrick DVD a couple of times...as far as an explanation as to how the footage could have been faked he presents a pretty decent case. For some reason I found it more convincing the second time around. Can&#39;t say I&#39;m fully on board but it&#39;s definitely interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been great to see how this film has picked up steam in popularity among movie reviewers and dissectors in the last few years.  Rob Ager did a very detailed review after visiting the Kubrick archives.  Lots of reviewers make the claim that this is the kind of shit that happens at the top.  Obviously, Kubrick tends to make things far more beautiful on screen than they would be in reality, but there is a chance that things like this take place in some circles.</p>

<p>That said, this is one of my favorite movies.  Boring at times, but still awesome.  To this day I think the scene at the end of the movie where Sydney Pollock and Tom Cruise are discussing the orgy is one of the most perfect scenes ever recorded.  It&#39;s got the kind of sleazy creepyness that just seeps into me.  I get chills every time I watch it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was going to be a big expose on the whole thing but they poisoned him and altered the content of the film dramatically. Did you know neither Tom Cruise or that other woman were actually in the film, just added in in post production. I did think at the time they weren&#39;t the expected choice for a Kubrick picture</p>
