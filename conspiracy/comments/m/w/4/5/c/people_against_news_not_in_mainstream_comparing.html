       I love it how whenever someone points out something such as "We should be protesting the FED, not Wall Street," some hack comes back with, "You're just parroting Alex Jones."  And that's supposed to win the argument.  Or whenever someone makes a great point, surely some loser comes back with, "Oh, you must support Ron Paul," and feels all good about themself.  Or the obligatory Jesse Ventura reference is always popular when trying to silence someone exposing how the government is hosing us.  Whatever, losers.

       Anybody who answers a statement like "We should be protesting the FED, not Wall Street"  with "You're just parroting Alex Jones" doesn't want to engage in meaningful dialog. Time to move on to someone else.

       Attacking Alex Jones personally shows a insecurity you can't possibly solve for them.

       IMHO it sounds like the one claiming people are protesting the wrong thing started it; they basically said the protesters are wrong by claiming they're protesting the wrong thing.  In return, the one supporting the protesters basically said the other person was wrong because they sound like Alex Jones or some other conspiracy guru.

       No, actually, I think Alex Jones is actually a fucking nutcase. He says some things that are on the money now and again, but even a clock is right twice a day. Perhaps you should examine yourself, and realize that to be a truly free thinker, you probably shouldn't follow a demagogue and everything he says as "gospel". Alex Jones is a modern day preacher and demagogue. Yes, he says some things that are right, but honestly, if you follow him blindly, you're insane.

       Case and point- I have never watched/listened or whatever to Alex jones, have no ideas what his views are, yet every valid point I bring up that can't be disputed, people seem to think that saying, "oh, you are against police brutality? Well, Alex jones, then." like his name is their whole fucking argument.

       He said in July of 2001 that there would be an attack on the World Trades Center by the CIA asset Bin Laden.

       He's said quite a few things that were right. The magnitude of many his predictions, like the one above, is staggering. He's certainly won my respect.

       I find that his "Predictions" are usually heavily over exaggerated by his mindless followers, much like in your comment.  Such as the oft-trotted out assertion that he "predicted" 9/11 down to a T. Find me that video, and promise you he says no such thing about the WTC. He does, however continue to rant about how government sponsored terror attacks would happen on American soil,
       <em>
        imminently
       </em>
       , in the vague, ranting way that he had already been doing for years, and continues to do so. He's a bit like a charlatan psychic in that regard. Make a big list of predictions for the next ten years, rant and rave about them, and pretty soon at least
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       of them will at least come
       <em>
        partially
       </em>
       true.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He's said quite a few things that were right.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What he says right, imho, relates to his analysis of world power structures and how much control they weild - even if he does dress it in all that "New World Order conspiracy shit. What he and his mindless army fail to realize is that the reality is far more ad-hoc and disorganized. Are there powerful people and interests, bent on controlling the world and its money? Sure. Do they all have secet meetings, and a secret handshake, and an unlisted telephone number connected to a phone in a secret office seven floors under the Washington monument? Not fucking likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, so much of the rest of what he says is designed to inspire
       <em>
        constant
       </em>
       fear in his listeners, and unsurprisingly, almost all of his sponsors exclusively pander to that fear. Water filtration systems, solar panels, seed banks, "survival kit" sellers. Honestly if you believed even
       <em>
        half
       </em>
       the shit that is said during a single one of his commercial breaks, you'd be shivering and curled up in the foetal position most of your life.

       He says its Bin Laden, WTC, by using planes. Just watch the fucking video. He's also predicted really early gold and silver's prices going way up. Aside from predicting, he also tells you about events way before the mainstream media. I knew about the TSA and the body scanners in the airports before any of my friends and professors. Its the same way I know about the TSA VIPR check points their doing on highways that will soon be big news.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say they don't have a handshake is just flat out naive. Do you know ANYTHING about freemasonry? It's a religion/organization that predates Christianity, and many historical figures, such as our Founding Fathers, Napoleon, and Gerald Ford were all freemasons. This secret society still exists today.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Alex's sponsors, I think that's to be expected. The reality is, we're headed for an economic depression. The Euro was designed to fail, none of the countries can pay back the debt they signed on to. It's not like Alex is the only one worried about Europe's economy, the media won't shut up about it, and they don't seem to have any good news either. Once Europe falls, its only a matter of time before the US falls with it. Those businesses know that, the customers know that. So the fuck what if their commercials are a little spooky? Unless you think that Europe
       <strong>
        won't
       </strong>
       fall from economic collapse, then I don't really understand your point.

       I'm coming around more to your point of view about Alex Jones. I still listen to his radio show, which I find entertaining, but more and more he is coming across as a bit of a nutcase. He goes on these amazing rants in which he make faces, waves his hands in the air, does strange voices -- he looks like someone possessed by a demon, and he sounds like a 3-year old throwing a tantrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, I've noticed that Jones repeats himself endlessly. He's like a looped audio tape. And much of what he says is untrue. He really thinks there is some group of evil men who planned to poison our food and water deliberately. That's nuts. I'm not saying the food and water has no poison in it, but what is there is almost certainly there by accident, because those making the food or processing the water didn't know any better. Sellers don't kill off their own customers. But Jones thinks they do!
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this his inability to say anything negative about Zionism, and his Southern preacher-like style of speaking, and the fact that he can't conduct a decent interview to save his own life, and he gets tiresome quickly.

       I agree with you on everything up until "Zionism".  He does actually criticize the US's support for Israel now and again, but he understandably steers away from the topic if he can help it. However, if he were to rant on about "Zionism", (in the sense that I'm sure you meant), that would be no different to being paranoid about the pixies under the bed. There's no group of evil men plotting to poison the food and water, just as there is no cabal of yarmulke-wearing Rabbis stroking their beards and discussing how they will take over the world.

       You're spot on about his ranting and raving, although, I do think most of that is an act. He is quite consciously a performer, and he knows that stuff is entertaining (hell,
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       find it entertaining), and that's what gets him ratings. As for the more dark and morbid moods he indulges, he knows that the more terrified he can make his listeners, the more shit they will buy from his sponsors - water filtration systems, emergency generators, emergency seed packages, solar power systems - it's not a coincidence that his sponsors cater almost exclusively to the apocalyptic nutcase fringe. I'm sure it's made him a pretty wealthy man.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, the absolute, dead giveaway that he is a demagogue, a nutcase, and potentially actually quite
       <em>
        dangerous
       </em>
       ? Two things. 
1) He never, never,
       <em>
        EVER
       </em>
       admits to
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       having been wrong about something, ever. He simply moves on and never mentions it again. No matter how wacky and fucking insane his rantings are, he never backs away from them. Those well grounded in the reality-based community are well aware that even the most incredibly enlightened of men are at least wrong
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The response some of his listeners generate. Back when he used to run forums, I'd see comments much like this one I'm writing here, and I swear, the creatures that came out of the woodwork to threaten the writer with all kinds of death, accuse themof being a "NWO Employee", etc., etc., was truly staggering.  I myself got an Alex Jones "Stalker", who kept posting his phone number and address, and demanding that I come down and "fight him like a man". Quite gobsmacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's always careful to openly state that people should
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       take the law into their own hands in "defeating the NWO", but absolutely everything about his rhetoric plays neatly into a narrative where he and his flock are an army, out to destroy the forces of evil. I've heard him on a number of occasions stop JUST short of openly calling for armed insurrection and rebellion against the state, and yet then he backs away from it. This kind of demagoguery is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       dangerous, and I reckon it won't be long until one of his listeners pulls some genuinely crazy shit, with life and death consequences. Of course he'll just trot out the convenient position then that it was all a government conspiracy, an "inside job" designed to rob him and his "movement" of credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm concerned, when he came on the map about 9/11 truth, he was at least grounded a little bit in reality. But now with this shit about "Technocrats" (as if this is some kind of evil word), and anti-scientific rhetoric, and open religious fundamentalism? Zero credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, a lot of fun to watch him gesticulate and growl on his show like some kind of caged animal or mental patient.  I'm half waiting for him to have a heart attack on the air. Now that will sell some "Colloidal Silver", eh?

       I agree but that is just what comes with the territory. It is unpopular to know the truth in this day and age. It is too easy to be ignorant, and if we stop and think about it... who are those people quoting... fox? id rather be a supporter of alex jones and ron paul then a slave to the mainstream message. Mainstream doesn't mean correct, it just means most widely excepted (or as i think of it) most frequently repeated.

       The topic is the auto response of people who dismiss anything outside their comfort zone. The OP and some of the commenters were expressing frustration, others were expressing ways of dealing with this. My comment is to not waste your time being upset or trying to convince
       <em>
        one

       person because that one person is not going to change his mind. Furthermore, each post is, more importantly, a message to the masses. I used my comment to demonstrate this

       I am not Julian Assange. I have never claimed to be. I am pretty sure you did not mistake my user ID for my real name.

       In an earlier post I mentioned how when you are communicating in Reddit you should recall that you are not really communicating with anyone in particular and that you should aim your comments at the wider audience of people who will see the post. I guess you did not understand what I was saying. You seem to think you are communicating with "me".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point that I made was that people act on emotion not on reason. Once you have raised the emotional level your communications become more powerful. One sign that the emotional level has been raised is name calling. At that point everything you communicate is indelibly etched in consciousness. When such a situation arises you should take an opportunity to make your
       <em>

       I am not a clown. I am usually not even funny. I am more of a provocateur than a entertainer. I am

       </strong>
       not
       <em>
        off

       the deep end. But how would you even know anything about my posts let alone feel qualified to characterize them unless you have been exposed to them. So my guess is you have seen what you did not like because your reaction is angry and hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am pretty sure you do not know what ironic means, so I'll skip that. I do not try to suppress different opinions. In fact I draw people out to find the flaws in their thinking. Neither do I chastise people. Rather I embarrass as I am now doing to you if (and only if) they persist in attempting to annoy me. This, by the way, is how I know I have scored another victory. You are, now and forever, unable to think about reddit without thinking about "all the things" you associate with "me".
