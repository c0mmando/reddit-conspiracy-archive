       I really haven't seen any good evidence.  Everything I read does a convincing job showing me they were a major player in the world through the middle ages onward, but when we get to the last one hundred years it delves into 'this 4th cousin married Bush's uncle' or some other irrelevant fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is the Rothschild family more influential than Bill Gates/Microsoft, or Larry Page/Sergey Brin &amp; the Google Beast, or BP or IBM, Chevron or any of these companies that make billions and billions in profit?

       The guy is asking Illuminati/Rothschild Conspiracy Theorists to convince him that their claim is true.  You offer up the claim with no evidence whatsoever, from someone else who was merely repeating it with no evidence whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no sign that any thought was involved in the process; not even a realization that simply repeating the claim does not constitute evidence.

       I offered up links to previous discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had read the link in context, you would have seen the comment above it was edited. It originally contained a citation link (now removed) which the list was based upon (I know this because I read it before the edit). So, again, perhaps you should direct your tantrum at the author(s) of the comment(s) I linked to. It's not like they died or got abducted by aliens.

       Just out of curiosity, do you masturbate to violent rape fantasies while posting this hostile drivel?

       So, I pissed off your "RogerStrong" persona to the point you could no longer use it, so you had to dive into a different split-personality to feebly attempt to regroup, eh

       How do I know? It's a fucking dead thread, you ridiculously inept moron. The only ones reading it are you and me (the person stalking you with downvotes is doing it via a bot, they're not even reading the shit you vomit).
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing "funny" is that you don't know how transparent you are to the rest of reddit. You're a laughingstock and you're oblivious to that fact. The only upvotes you get are the ones you give youself via your sockpuppets.

       People like you serve only to distract everyone else from REAL crimes.  While Halliburton loots the treasury with the help of former CEO and still shareholder Dick Cheney, people like you parrot HAARP and FEMA camp theories and anti-Semitic tripe.  While the bankers crashed the economy with industry-wide mortgage fraud turned industry-wide investment fraud, people like you were in hysterics over Amero and End The Fed wingnuttery.

       Did you notice how convinced the original poster was by those who bothered to try to respond to his demand? Not at all. It's a waste of time answering people who are only looking for reasons to dismiss the topic from their minds.

       Here is what you do- take a rubber mallet and beat yourself over the head with it. Repeat this until you suffer mild brain damage. Once you regain conscience and your ability to speak and read (coherently is optional) browse the internet and hang out in this subreddit.
