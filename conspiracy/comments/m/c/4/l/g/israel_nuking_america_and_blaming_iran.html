    <div class="md"><p>Ever see that scene in X-men: First class where they have all the mutants on that island and decide to kill them all in one fell swoop?  This reminds me of that scene.  </p>

<p>An attack on the US by Israel being blamed on Iran doesn&#39;t make any sense because it gives us the opportunity to do the same and finally be rid of the Israel problem the US faces by having to cater to their interests time and time again.  If they nuke us and blame it on Iran, this puts the US in the uncomfortable position of having to attack Iran.  Well, if they are going to do that, why wouldn&#39;t the US nuke Israel, blame Iran, then attack Iran?  That way, Iran is gone, and so is Israel, and the US never has to be held by the balls again.  It would be the perfect opportunity that they would probably take, given the chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sadly, yes. but the science for the whole 9/11 thing wasn&#39;t exactly in the public domain, that&#39;s changed a huge deal since 9/11.</p>

<p>Its a pretty well known fact that uranium can be easily traced back to its point of origin, Chernobyl is a good testament to this when they found traces of uranium isotopes half way across the world, soon after Russia had no choice but to go public that Chernobyl went meltdown.</p>

<p>Also, it is known Iran has been trying to build nukes, but most officials agree that its not exactly an immediate threat for several years.</p>

<p>so how is Israel going to get ahold of Iranian nukes that don&#39;t currently exist? and how are they going to launch it from Iran without anyone noticing before hand, espically the Iranian government, that somethings fucked up?</p>

<p>the iranian government isn&#39;t stupid by any means, they are pretty extensive about documenting shit that could be used by another country to frame their ass. Oh, and Iran has a few allies that would side with them before they side with the US or Europe any day. One of them pretty much owns our entire economy at this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing, Iran&#39;s uranium signature is most likely unknown/unknowable, so any mystery nuclear devices of an unknown origin could conceivably be blamed on Iran. There&#39;s also the issue of Israel&#39;s nuclear ambiguity, they have undeclared stockpiles of weapons so there could very well be an unknown uranium signature somewhere in the mix.
Personally I wouldn&#39;t expect to see this unless America was somehow in on it, I&#39;m just putting the info out there.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavon_Affair</a></p>

<p>In 1954, Israeli agents placed bombs in American and British properties in Egypt, and wanted to try to blame the Egyptians for the bombings in order to undermine Egypt&#39;s relations with the US and UK.</p>

<p>The Israeli agents were mostly caught when one of their bombs went off prematurely. Israel of course denounced the whole thing as an &quot;antisemitic plot&quot; but later fessed up. NOTHING WAS DONE to israel by the UK or the US - if Israel outright bombs Americans and Brits, nothing happens. </p>

<p>Who did you hear it from? Some guy? Where is the evidence that this plan may be in the works? What report, released declassified document, leak, or general witness is there to this actually being a plan at all? If you&#39;re not asking these questions yourself you&#39;re not doing it right.</p>

<p>You are either an idiot, or your friend is an idiot, or you&#39;re both fucking plants to spread misinformation to willing idiots who are looking for another reason to think they&#39;re in absolutely no control of their own lives, thereby excusing their own failures and foibles. I leave it open. Maybe you&#39;re not an idiot, and you are just pathologically paranoid and you genuinely believe this is a possibility despite an obvious lack of any evidence of the possibility.</p>

<p>Shit like this makes everyone who reads this subreddit seem like they&#39;re all crazy, and it discredits everything associated with it by proxy. If you can&#39;t present evidence of any sort then don&#39;t fucking post it. It hurts the genuine discussions that need to happen that ARE based on some few facts that have been painstakingly gathered by people doing something constructive. Stop the conspiracy circlejerk. Downvote shit like this to hell.</p>

<p>EDIT I waited till it happened. I didn&#39;t think it would, but it did finally. Fuck this subreddit, I&#39;m done. You fucking morons have proven to me that you&#39;d rather hear the musings of a retard than actually prove any sort of real conspiracies. The fact that people have downvoted this more than upvoted without A FUCKING SHRED OF EVIDENCE TO A COUNTER ARGUMENT is proof that the majority of people here are as stupid as everyone actually thinks the community is. Fuck all of you. If you love this subreddit I&#39;m talking to you. You love a place that spouts bullshit based on nothing at all. You love another mouthpiece of disinformation and subterfuge. I&#39;m out. Fuck you.</p>
