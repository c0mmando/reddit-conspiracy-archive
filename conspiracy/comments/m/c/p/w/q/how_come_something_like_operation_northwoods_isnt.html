       Forgive my wording but I think you know what I meant. Why aren't people commonly aware that this kind of legislation has been proposed? And why is it more fun to worry about Obama calling Kanye a jackass or Bush fucking up a speech?
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize that I'm not going to get a solid answer because no one can explain the fucked up priorities of others. I guess I was actually hoping someone would debunk the whole thing and give me proof that the documents were fake or something. Either way, you're right.

       Who wants to believe that the people in charge might be arse-holes, that they might not have the public's best interests at heart, that the politicians and power-brokers running the show just might be thinking of their own self-interests instead of the interests of the country; and would be willing to sacrifice the citizens for some less than noble goals?
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking in very general terms, when you tell a child that they've done something wrong they might protest a little bit but they know that you're probably right. They might feel ashamed, embarrassed, or curious about why it was wrong, but their little receptive mind is usually going to remember what was wrong and what was right and maybe not do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adults are a different matter. They
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don't like being told that they're wrong, that an official they voted for might be a scumbag, or that one they didn't vote for is at least not as bad as he could be like some dictator in some 3rd world country.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm a grown up now, I don't make silly mistakes. Other people are stupid sometimes, but this is not a backwards country. We're [country]ians, and we don't make bad mistakes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Questioning the public's choice, and therefore their intelligence, always riles people up.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm not wrong,
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       wrong!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The more deep-seated the "truths" that you challenge, the more resistance you'll be met with. Show people facts in documentation, video tape, photographs, and even testimony straight from the horse's mouth and you're likely to find the response to be,
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's fake!
       <em>
        They
       </em>
       made him say that. I saw a boy flying on a broom on the television last night, so don't tell me they couldn't fake that!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Tis true, certain things could be faked, and so you show them corroborating evidence from a variety of sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the argument will descend into simple platitudes of conspiracy theories, nut cases trying to destabilise the country, accusations of socialism, et-cetera…
      </p>
      <p>
       A child may take it on face value that something you say is true, but an adult will hang on to their preconceived notions with a fierce intensity of purpose; regardless of whether those notions are based on fact or fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a sense it's like shaping the growth of a tree. You can easily wrap a sapling around a strong wire and guide its growth, but you're not going to have much luck trying to shape the growth of a century old oak.

       That is a very clear description of this dilemma. Perhaps this is why religion want to indoctrinate the flock as children ... they are more "pliable", like in your tree analogy. Have an upvote, friend.

       This is a great explanation but bringing it to light isn't really telling people that they're wrong, just that they hadn't heard about this before. People learn new things every day. You'd think that this kind of scandal (if you'll let me call it that) would at least resonate with people even if they aren't going to take action.

       You might instead ask why it isn't a Very Big Deal.  "OMG the President and government did X!!!" is a very big deal.  "OMG some government official suggested X, and the President removed him from his post because of it!!!" isn't so big.

       It would take a much greater understanding of the functionality (and lack there of) of the Federal Government and military than is on display in r/cons to put something like Northwoods into context.  If "the government" really was going to carry out 9/11 as a "false flag operation" why in the fuck would they not remove any and all records of such attacks?

       Looking from the Bible's standpoint, pedophilia would basically be a hateful act of fornication. Lust would be it's sin. To excuse it like it's no big deal, is proof the Catholic Church is run by sick individuals, unforgettably holding some stature in society. Sorry you lost friends through your comment...just proves your point...

       It is public knowledge, it's just that no one cares. You would have to be a conspiracy wacko to believe in things like that...get it?

       Looking from the Bible's standpoint, pedophilia would basically be a hateful act of fornication. Lust would be it's sin. To excuse it like it's no big deal, is proof the Catholic Church is run by sick individuals, unforgettably holding some stature in society. Sorry you lost friends through your comment...just proves your point...
