       I can't find a link to the episode yet, my apologies. The gang gets the itch to do a viral video and make a web presence for themselves and Paddy's. While discussing social networking, Mac went on one of his rants. Here is a quote from that rant:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The whole world is connected. It's connected by Bill Gates, and that Rain Man Zuckerberg. He and his Jews have connected the whole world and now they're toppling regimes, and Egypt, and Japan, and the Jews are all...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then he gets cut off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, just a funny truther moment on a fairly popular show that caught my attention.
If anyone can find the episode (The Anti-Social Network), it happens fairly early on in Paddy's.

       Seems to me, from what im reading, they were poking fun of conspiracy nuts. It could also be a truth portrayed as a joke. This kinds of things are all over the place if you look for them. The Matrix comes to mind, the Simpsons,  and many movies.

       do you not realize that a common theme of the show is mac's (and everyone else, too) ignorance and stupidity when thinking critically about the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       in just about every single episode there's an instance of mac or charlie expressing some ridiculously ignorant untruth as something they truly believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       so mac says something you agree with, and now think he's offering sage advice? no my friend, he was making fun of you.

       Great find, would love to see a link to the part in question (not for the conspiracy part, but because that show is hilarious!)  Would like to see how they act it out.  That cast is great acting out their characters, imho.

       That kind of says it all as Oliver Stone found out. You dare not have an alternative view of history and many other subjects that are not kosher.
       <strong>
        Kosher censorship will eventually fail.
       </strong>
       As John Gilmore has written, "The internet views censorship as damage and routes around it."

       Someone has to bring down the Zionist Jewish Mafia. Might as well be me. As Minister Farrakhan said to the presstitutes recently, "You need to somebody to tell the truth. You need to have somebody who is willing to die for the truth so that you can be made free."

       I hope someone can find the clip and post it. They were obviously making a point in some subtle way. Whether it was pushing the point of Jewish conspiracies or making fun of conspiracy theories. Hollywood is a Jewish dictatorship and really not a soft dictatorship.

       i'd say they were making fun of conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       notice the type of people who said those things. just a few episodes ago, they were talking about how little kid beauty pageants are the essence of america. they come up with crazy ignorant shit like that in most of the epidodes.
      </p>
      <p>
       the characters represent ignorant, self-absorbed, and undeservingly confident people. their actions and words are a warning of what to avoid should you not want to end up with their hollow, depraved lives. (although it's fucking hilarious, for sure.)
      </p>
      <p>
       so when a guy like frank talks about how the media "hypes everything up, just hyping it up" you're supposed to remember that he's the guy who uses one knife for both eating and toe-picking, boils denim he finds in a nasty philly river, and is generally a pretty depraved asshole.
      </p>
      <p>
       when a guy like mac blames it all on the jews, you're supposed to remember that he's the guy who has a hugely warped view of what america is and what it represents. he's very rarely correct in anything he ever says, yet he doesn't let external arguements convince him of something he has firm belief in.
      </p>
      <p>
       ... so what part of that made OP think mac was giving the silent nod to conspiracy theorists? are people really that bad at analyzing things like this?

       I would like to point out that the cast are also the writers, producers, and creators of the show. While the characters are ignorant and loud, the show itself is snappy and smartly written (tho it is getting a big overblown as the seasons go on). The “gang” has used the show to point out the absurdities of many American systems, including welfare, false-patriotism, and political favoritism, and have more than once taken a non-mainstream approach to Jewish relations (The Gang Goes Jihad, anyone?). These people are not stupid, and I personally believe that they are at least halfway “awake”. When they put remarks like that into the show, I believe they are using it as a platform to plant little seeds of truth into people’s brains…even if it is in a loud, stoned kind of way. You can see it as making fun of us if you want, but that isn’t the vibe I get from them.

       look, again, normally they say those things to highlight how stupid some people can be. so mac says something stupid, and
       <em>
        just because you agree with it
       </em>
       you think he's suggesting that it's actually true? that's actually the opposite of what you just said to justify it.
      </p>
      <p>
       they have subtle points, true, but it's typically "don't be useless drunken jackasses."
      </p>
      <p>
       so, if what you just said is the case, what they've done is a total flip-flop from what they usually do. that makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       your confirmation bias is blinding you. they were making fun of you and you dont' want to admit it, because you'd rather be able to blame the jews for everything without feeling like an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit- ok, an example involving myself to illustrate this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       the south park from a couple weeks ago about wikileaks? that pissed me off. no matter what my personal grievances against wikileaks happen to be, i think it's a good thing overall. but what south park did was say that it's just a glorified gossip project.
      </p>
      <p>
       even though it was 100% ineffective and proved to be just a distraction, i still got pissed that south park wrote it off so harshly. i didn't even finish the episode because they were pissing me off.
      </p>
      <p>
       it made me confront the dual opinion in my head that wikileaks was both good and bad. i didn't like having to confront that in the middle of a comedy show, so i turned it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       with you, you didn't want to confront the fact that they were making fun of your belief system. you instead tried to rationalize that they weren't making fun of you, but were secretly agreeing with you through a two-layered metaphor. that is not true. it is not a double-layered metaphor that gives the thumbs-up to conspiracy theorists. it is a joke that ignorant morons think the jews are behind everything.
      </p>

       No, fuck you and your edit. And before you give me some line about how I ignored all your points, you need to know that when you come in here and start telling people you don’t agree with to “Go die in a fucking fire”, you aren’t going to be taken seriously. You come in and pick fights, then tell people to die. I don't give a shit what you have to say.

       i got curious, so i downloaded the episode and started to watch it. (i was going to wait for later this weekend when i was supposed to watch it with someone else.)

       it is totally obvious that they're making fun of ignorant fucks who think the jews are behind everything. (that sentiment has been around for a long time, and has nothing to do with the recent wave of protests against bankers.)

      <p>
       how can you watch what i just watched and not understand that very simple scene? ask me how i know you have no education or experience with analyzing works of art.

       i can't pick out your meaning. i can't figure out if you're mocking me or agreeing, so instead i'll just point out that you ended a sentence with a preposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'd still say that (using your above post about zionist hollywood) they're making fun of you, because even though you seem to realize that you can't take mac's words literally or in a straightforward way, the intent was to mock those who think the jews control the world. you're still in that camp if you took that message and turned it back onto the jews who control hollywood.

       Could be that uneducated white supremacist trash part of me. After all I must be just one generation removed from white trash.

       I guess I won't point out that you don't know how to capitalize. Oops, I just did.

       the difference between you and i is that i can capitalize words at any time i wish by simply pressing the shift key, but you can't turn on the ability to magically not be an idiot.
