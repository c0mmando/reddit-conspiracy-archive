       Ah, directors are not owners - they are the public face of a private institution.  The fact remains, the ownership is private, has been for years.  Nobody knows what the current structure looks like now, it's all speculation.

       Please review the thread, it's a
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       the bank(s) are privately owned.  If they are public then you should be able to tell me the share percentages.  Since you cannot find this information, it's a private bank.  The last best guess was in 1983:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Author Eustace Mullins in his 1983 book Secrets of the Federal Reserve, reported that the top eight shareholders of the New York Fed were, in order from largest to smallest as of 1983, Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Morgan Guaranty Trust, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Bankers Trust Company, National Bank of North America, and the Bank of New York (Mullins, p. 179). At first glance, the owners of the Fed are U.S. banks but the next question is who are the majority owners of the U.S. banks?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, for the third time - this information is private.

       Shareholders of the Federal Reserve are private banks. The Federal Reserve's governors are publicly-appointed. I'm not disagreeing with any of those facts. I'm disagreeing with the guy I responded to earlier who said that the Rothschild family controlled the Federal Reserve.

       That would be an educated guess, but again, nobody can be 100% sure now.  The information is private.  The FED used to report their ownership years ago, and at the time there was heavy Rothschild influence.

       It's not an "educated guess", it's the way the Fed has been chartered. Member banks consist of all national banks, which are known, as well as some state-chartered banks, which are not known. The member banks own shares based on their size.
       <br/>
       Do you have a source for your claim that there was "heavy Rothschild influence" in the Federal Reserve? I've been trying to track down a source for this claim and have been unsuccessful.

       Since we cannot audit them, we will never know.  I suppose we are to 'trust' the bankers are honest and don't make any money off the tremendously valuable information they have access to, while the economy is being turned upside down.

       6% of the cost of the shares means that in about 16 years your "membership fee" is paid back. It's also an inconsequential amount of money compared to, say, "quantitative easing."

       Interest is never profit, the only way it's considered profit is that it goes to the bankers and makes them rich. Although interest may by some be viewed as a kind of profit, because it's gain and in a very general sense that is profit, the difference lies in the fact that in our banking system when Debt is created there is nothing backing the value of that Debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I have 3 apples and it cost me 50 cents to make each apple and sell them to you for 5 bucks, then I made a 4.50 profit. Now even though I'm still talking about the same Fiat currency, the profit I made in this transaction is backed by the time I put in and the 1.50 I spent on growing the apples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in another scenario, if I am a bank and loan you 5 bucks at 20% interest per day. All I have to do to make that happen add a 5 to your account balance, I didn't have to go out find a $5 bill to add to my bank so that your account is backed by something of value. So here's me, just adding a number to your account, doing no work to back your credits with value, but you have to pay me a 1 a day interest. I as the banker did nothing to add any actual value to the system, while you the person who will pay the loan will work to earn the credits to pay me back. So the banker didn't do anything that adds any greater value to society while you will work, doing manual labor; do a service or creating a good that will be used or consumed by others.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if it isn't clear, bankers don't do work, they loan out credit and produce Debt while the people get caught in a seemingly endless machine of work and production.

       I think you misunderstood my comment, I was merely answering the posters question and stating that High School Economics was the source that first taught me the Federal reserve was a private institution and not government owned or operated. Actually,  my teacher specifically stated that "The federal reserve is about as 'Federal as Federal Experess."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not sure what you're trying to imply by saying I have a lot to learn because I'm citing my HS education as where I first learned about the Federal Reserve?

       All profit made by the fed goes to the US Treasury. "Shares" in the Fed are a matter of membership: members have to buy shares.

       Any good lie or conspiracy theory is wrapped around a kernel of truth.  The liar can then "prove" that kernel of truth, and use it to convince people that the lie he wrapped around it is also true.  This goes for "End the Fed" claims too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are indeed
       <a href="http://www.publiceye.org/conspire/flaherty/Federal_Reserve.html">
        privately owned
       </a>
       .  They're "owned" by their "stockholders," they make their own pay and hiring policies, and pay local property taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        However:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They're CONTROLLED by the publically-appointed Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System - a government agency. Its employees are employees of the federal government, paid in accordance with federal government pay scales, and part of the federal employee retirement system. The premises are federal government property. The seven Board members are appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate in the same fashion as other government appointees.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're restricted to conducting business specified by the Federal Reserve Act.  Nearly all the interest the Federal Reserve collects on government bonds is rebated to the Treasury each year, so the government does not pay any net interest to the Fed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Federal Reserve was created by popular demand, to end the endless boom/bust/panic cycle that preceded it.

        America just got a taste of what ending the Fed would be like.
       </strong>
       The US and Britain deregulated their banks, but Canada did not. The American banking system became a libertarian dream, with Alan Greenspan vehemently opposing any regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The result was the collapse of Wall Street in late 2008, after industry-wide mortgage fraud was turned into industry-wide investment fraud - with private "independent" investment rating agencies like Standard &amp; Poor's
       <a href="http://www.thetrumpet.com/index.php?q=4288.2525.0.0">
        in on the fraud
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       They ripped off the very investors holding the US's debt - which is why the government had no choice but to step in and try to salvage those investments.  As Greenspan stated, "Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equity -- myself especially -- are in a state of shocked disbelief."
      </p>
      <p>
       Gee, you think he'd have learned a lesson from Enron and WorldCom. (With the private independent auditor, Arthur Anderson, in on the fraud instead of protecting their clients the investors.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Canada's banking system - which kept a small amount of government regulation - at the height of the 2008 crisis was rated the
       <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/id/183670">
        healthiest
       </a>
       in the world by the World Economic Forum. (America's ranked 40th, Britain's 44th.) No banks are going under, and there are no massive bank bailouts.  Today it's the only country with a AAA credit rating in the western hemisphere.

       The industry-wide mortgage fraud was turned into industry-wide investment fraud which in turn became the 2008 Wall Street collapse.  It was corporate fraud on the part of the banks.  They did it all by themselves, thanks to the government taking a hands-off approach and letting them regulate themselves.

       I also find it highly naive to compare the FED deregulating banks with the FED being non-existent.
Using the same logic and ideas, you're easily contradicted by the fact that, no-one has said more about the ridiculousness that the banks and the Federal Reserve have been doing than a
       <strong>
        libertarian
       </strong>
       by the name Ron Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, to be clear again Fed Deregulation =/= No Privately Owned Central Bank. Although the truth is, having no Federal Reserve doesn't guarantee a fix to our problems, it would allow us the option to return to a Silver and/or Gold backed currency.
