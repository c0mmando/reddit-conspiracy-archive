    <div class="md"><p>Because rape symbolically speaking is a attack on someone&#39;s control.   A young boy is supposed to be learning the ropes to become a man and thus have his own idea&#39;s and follow through....ect  (manhood)   By raping a young boy you are destroying his identity and destroying his grasp on his life.   The boy will no longer be in charge of his life.   Shame will dictate his thoughts.</p>

<p>Typically rape against women is more symptomatic of abuse, anger and lust.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends how we use the word. If we mean &quot;designated group of individuals who call themselves the illuminati&quot; then maybe not.</p>

<p>However, if we mean &quot;group of individuals aware of global politics, economics, and philosophy in a way inaccessible by most people, who use this power collectively-by-design and collectively-by-accident to enslave, ensnare, and control everything (or attempt to, getting rich in the process) then yes, totally, the illuminati are real.</p>

<p>RE: your friends - my mom always said &quot;never teach a pig to sing, it wastes your time and annoys the pig&quot;. If your friends don&#39;t want to listen, they won&#39;t be able to see any of your evidence. Better to keep researching yourself and let them think whatever they want. </p>

<li><p>there are two basic possibilities: a. a secret cabal runs everything. or b. the thing drives itself. The latter is actually scarier than the prior, imho.</p></li>
<li><p>The 1776 illuminati/US government kids were founded by Germanic Secret Society peeps. The 1848 Communist Manifesto kids were founded by Germanic Secret Society peeps. The 1930&#39;s Nazi regime kids were founded by Germanic Secret Society peeps. Maybe not the exact same organization, but close enough to be freaky.</p></li>
<li><p>If you woke up tomorrow and had to &quot;run the world&quot;, what choices would be rational? Consider our earths population as &quot;hit points&quot; in a video game. They rebuild over time, and sometimes you take damage to get goals accomplished. What is a million hit points when you have 7 billion? What is 3000? Nothing. Dust in the wind. </p></li>
<li><p>Every aspect of your life (assuming you are american, but western europe/aust/etc too) has been controlled. Since birth you have been raised to hold a single specific view of reality, intrinsic to which is the rejection of all other views. It is about more than being raised to hate muslims or blacks or whatever, it is about being raised to support the economic masters that made you.</p></li>
<li><p>This system is older than we can imagine. In either scenario in point 1, it is has been here longer than you and I. Greek philosophy discussed the cave, ignorance, and dragging individuals into the light. That was thousands of years ago. We have made zero progress. </p></li>
<li><p>It is possible to think of the &quot;illuminati&quot; as &quot;good&quot;, even in the face of mass killings, war, famine, and so on. Consider point 3 again. Keeping the world running is a hell of a task. (not saying they are good, just saying it is a matter of perspective). </p></li>
<li><p>The media we consume in the west is produced by a few small interconnected groups. This ranges from Cable TV to school books. It all paints a specific picture and worldview. The internet has been increasingly a threat to this, which is why they are trying to kill it or shut it down or reduce it to a fully user-tracking version of cable tv. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Just an example of obvious world tinkering with zero proper attention from the media. Surely three plus cables can get accidentally severed in a few weeks of each other, right?</p>

<p>It was probably a cover while splitters were installed to monitor dataflow, like the at&amp;t blackroom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s amazing to me that people are so afraid of what they term the illuminati. (meaning anything they fear and don&#39;t have the access to understand, basically.) </p>

<p>point 3 is a major one. ensuring the long-term survival of the species requires hard decisions. if one billion lives in this century means billions and billions more in coming centuries will live in peace, that&#39;s a responsible choice. to avoid turmoil and change simply out of compassion for those alive right now is unfair to future generations and honestly pretty insane. we&#39;re all going to die anyway, so guarding a shitty system for the benefit of those already living in it is extremely selfish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re joking, right?  &quot;Their website&quot;?  Wow, excellent journalistic rigor you&#39;ve got going there.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re willing to take <strong>the title of a poorly made website that bashes the Illuminati</strong> as proof that said organization exists and that the website <strong>is actually run</strong> by them, then you&#39;re just...stupid.  I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s just stupid.  That&#39;s the least serious fact-finding I&#39;ve ever seen, and you are <strong>literally</strong> believing everything you read.</p>

<p>Excellent work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be interested in having a more detailed explaination of meritocracy. For instance.... if I am not allowed to have my father&#39;s assets when he passes on, who would get them? Oh, they would be forcibly liquidated into a &#39;commonwelth&#39; you say? How does someone have the authority to take my father&#39;s posesions away? Would there be no family heirlooms? What about my grandfather&#39;s century old acoustic guitar? I don&#39;t keep that either? Or is it just the paper money that gets &#39;liberated&#39;?</p>

<p>What power does the repo man possess that comes to take my dead father&#39;s things? Is he allowed to give me a birthday present? What if he just gives his assets as a gift to me BEFORE he dies? What motivation do I even have to reproduce if I will not be able to take care of them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi all. I have just read this entire thread ... very deep, very intense, fucked up stuff we are discussing here. Have any of you considered that the small group who used to be termed &quot;elites&quot; (the 1%) may just be playing with us? </p>

<p>On a country level - is there any real difference in outcome, regardless of who wins elections? I think Obama was told what&#39;s what after he won and capitulated on much of the promised change. Sadly, I had hope he was going to knock a few out of the park for my American friends.</p>

<p>On a global level - is there any real difference in outcome, regardless of who wins wars? I get a sense we are just being pointed in a direction as a society, like pieces on a giant chess board. I hear Hitler was quietly carted off to enjoy his senior years of peace and tranquility in South America via the Americans during &quot;Operation Paperclip&quot;. </p>

<p>I think as a people we are all conditioned to think in terms of borders, language, etc. There has to be some wholesale fuckin&#39; changes to the way things are done. Getting rid of these evil bastards like the Rothschilds family would be a good start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to toot my own horn (warning: here comes the horn tooting) but I went and got an MA in sociology, partially to study global politic and it&#39;s relation to occult tradition.</p>

<p>It is worse than you can possibly imagine. And the more you understand, the worse it will seem. I don&#39;t claim to know everything, I know very little, but more than the lay-person.</p>

<p>Anyway, it is scary shit. Try not to let it keep you up at night. You can see it, and that is a gift. Keep training your eye.</p>
