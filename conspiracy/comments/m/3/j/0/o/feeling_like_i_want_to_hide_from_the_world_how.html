       I decided to get informed because I couldn't accept what I saw, now that I feel more informed. I don't trust people I once respected. I've talked, discussed, and argued with people. But I feel no real comfort, I thought the knoledge would free me from fear. I can't turn back, pretend it never happened (blue pill) I feel I'm too young to be taken seriously (late high school) but I want to do something, take action.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I move on from here?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I did not expect these kind of responses, Already I am impressed Thanks, I hope this gets upvoted so others like me can see it, I kept putting off posting this for too long anyways. Thanks again

       Each time we repeat a behavior we strengthen the pattern of thoughts and feelings that go together with it. That is why it is easier to repeat a behavior than to learn a new one. That is why we often find ourselves in familiar patterns of counter-productive behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good habits can be learned just as easily as bad ones. We can replace negative feelings with the positive feelings associated with wisdom, beauty and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, practice thinking of an inconsequential event from various points of view:
    • Imagine that you are listening to a football game while driving;
    • Imagine you are watching the game on TV;
    • Imagine you are at the stadium;
    • Imagine you are involved in a disputed play;
    • Imagine you are the referee who makes the call;
    • Imagine seeing a slow-motion replay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, recall your most significant memories. What is the best thing that ever happened to you?  What is the worst thing that ever happened to you? What is the best thing you ever did? What is the worst thing you ever did? Examine each experience from a series of different perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you experience discomfort,
       <em>
        add clarity, color and motion
       </em>
       to your thoughts. If your ideas are unclear, black-and-white or fixed you will not feel good. Replace unclear, black-and-white, still mental images with
       <em>
        clear, colorful and moving
       </em>
       memories:
    • Add details.
    • Add light and color.
    • What came just before? What came before that?
    • What came just after? What came after that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apply this technique  -of
       <em>
        seeing things from more than one frame of reference with clarity, color and motion
       </em>
       -  to the future. This includes unpleasant or fearful situations that may arise. Envision the worst-case scenario so that you can remain creative and not become paralyzed when things don’t go as you wish. What is the worst thing that can happen?
       <em>
        Create clear, colorful and moving images of yourself in a future that is wise, beautiful and true
       </em>
       (not a fantasy).
      </p>
      <p>
       Aesthetic Outcome (adult, post-formal, dialectical) Thinking frees us from the fixed images and automatic responses that limit us. Instead of trying to avoid discomfort and confusion by doing what we’ve done before, we can use this technique to:
       <em>
        engage in critical reflection; find alternative solutions; make informed choices; maintain effective relationships; persevere in crisis;
       </em>
       and succeed in overcoming the difficulties we face.
       <strong>
        When we create new neural pathways that make us feel good we experience a world of infinite possibilities.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Love what is good.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Do what is right.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Alleviate suffering.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Contribute to the happiness of others.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Trust that good things await you.

       Ha, came here to say this, but in less detail... All I'll add, is if I remember to do the positive visualisation, life feels lighter; focus on goals you want, outcomes you truly hope for. A but of Neuro-Linguistic Programming can't do any harm either, if this is the kind of path you fancy.

       I recommend checking out the survivalist and prepper movement. It basically implores people to be as self sufficient as possible, store extra food, don't rely on systems of support but if you do have a backup plan. Its not nearly as crazy and cooky as the media makes it sound, plus they are actionable steps you can take that make you less dependent on the system and better able to handle any disasters that may come. I think this is so much better than the typical conspiracy theorists advice of "research and tell everyone you know! "
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if 100% of the people know something horrible is going on, if no one can change it what is the point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the survivalpodcast, that is a great show that talks a lot about this stuff (and a lot about gardening, so be warned haha)

       I'm with you in a lot of ways. The golden rule I live by nowadays is humility. I accept the idea that I am in fact, nothing special. I am not much different than any other fellow human being. Which in turn means, no one else is either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I feel that, myself, I have better opinions and am better informed in certain things than others? Well, sure, otherwise I wouldn't hold the opinions I do, however, ultimately it's not because I'm somehow better or smarter than others, my life and experiences are just different and have led me down a path that is unique to me. This very fact is what makes all our world views unique. (note: I'm not accusing you of any kind of arrogance here I'm trying to set up my logic).
      </p>
      <p>
       By pressing myself into having a humility at the core of my personality, and also by not being afraid or dismissive of any opinion, I am not held to any belief system that is either put before me, or which may form in my own mind. And it simultaneously keeps me grounded in the idea that I am not privy to some superior wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it seems that most people don't take this perspective in their own lives. Enjoying a sense of intellectual superiority and the comfort it affords seems to be a basic human nature. However, the grey matter inside my head really is no different than any one else's.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what to do now? When there's some urgent problem looming on the horizon and everyone is too entrenched and stubborn to challenge themselves? Educate yourself, challenge your views, and respect all humans. Live by your own rules, share peace and charity with others, be polite and respectful if and when questions or arguments arise. Go ahead and join groups or sub-communities than share your views but be careful not to fall into the trap of comfort through group-think. Always question, always debate, never be afraid of not going with the flow of a certain group or sub-community if they don't jive with who you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if this is a bit fractured, but I have to rush out the door right now.

       Straight up, theres a global economic collapse on the way. Theres not much you can do about it except prepare NOW. inform ya family and friends, if they dont want to keep that third eye closed then fuck it, but continue your relationships with people, find a hobby, but prepare because shit is about to go down

       Yeah, the truth hurts. But it's the truth, so if you have any guts at all, once you know it, you have to accept it, even if you don't want to. Ignorance isn't bliss, it's servitude. Truth is freedom.

       daily meditation really helped me process the information overload. It reduced my negativity and depression while helping me gain insight into what I should be doing in this lifetime.
