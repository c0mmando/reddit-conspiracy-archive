    <div class="md"><p>they suck, but i did get a chuckle reading about an incident during the madrid conference in 1991, where the israeli PM (shamir, from likud) went off on syria for this and that, calling them terrorists, at which point the syrian delegate pulled out an old arrest warrant for shamir from his younger days for an assassination he pulled while part of what would today be considered a terrorist organization. (the irgun.)</p>

<p>just goes to show how subjective the label of terrorism can be, and that actual terrorists can become PM in israel and then call someone a terrorist without feeling hypocritical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure! Given the amount of Israeli higher-ups who cut their teeth bombing and assassinating in support of Zionism, their labeling anyone as terrorists is laughable.

    <div class="md"><p>The Jewish Combat Organization was a terrorist organization to Nazi Germany...Hamas is doing exactly what the Zionist government did some 70 odd years ago to fight its oppressor. But the Jews are labelled as freedom fighters, and the Palestinians who have no basic rights, blockaded from medical aid, and construction supplies are labeled as terrorists for fighting back. Imagine being stuck in a city with a 30 mile radius and not being to leave, and not being able to receive any goods for years on end....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both my parents are from Syria, I live in a broad community of different Arabs in my apartment complex. One of my neighbors father is from Hama, luckily he was in Damascus when Bashar&#39;s father, Hafez Al-Assad committed the 1982 massacre of Hama. He told us he lost 25 family members in a span of 2 days....There is blood on both of their hands. The Assad family and Baath party have sucked Syria and its people dry since 1966, as an American-Syrian....It would be a dream to see this man and his family fall....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is like saying that Obama is murdering protesters because Troy Davis was executed. Well, you could say that, but keep in mind that according to Islam the death penalty is permittable in some extreme cases, but should never be used wrongly. And according to Islam they should be held publicly to serve as a warning to others. This has nothing to with president Assad, and as a case in point, Gaddafi opposed the death penalty his whole life but the people in Libya were in favour of it.</p>

<p>Keep in mind also that &#39;those who protest his rule&#39; is not the correct term to be applied here. These are not any regular protesters, these are people employed by various vicious agencies such as Mossad, MI5 and the CIA, armed people that were attacking civilian police officers! </p>

<p>Here is mainstream coverage from Journeyman TV, he tries to make it seem like everyone is just afraid of Assad, but they are afraid of the rebels. Just judge for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh7ksVJuseg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh7ksVJuseg</a></p>

<p>Look at the videos an independent Syrian reporter is showing him of the supposed &quot;peaceful pro-democratic movement&quot; dealing with the police in Syria. Why do people accept this while even the slightest hint of violence is abhorred in OWS?</p>

<p>(There is plenty more evidence for this, I just don&#39;t want this to end up a comment full of youtube clips)</p>

<p>not very many people besides crazy neocons in israel and america think that a war with iran is a good idea in any way. you can bet that most military officers already recognize how huge of a blunder it would be. </p>

<p>an invasion of syria would be easier (at least on paper) and has the added bonus of being an action against israel&#39;s longest-lasting enemy.</p>
