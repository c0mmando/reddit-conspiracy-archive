       there is a network of secret societies designed to correlate the parts of society required for global control - religion, politics, industry, 'entertainment,' 'news,' etc..  the Rothschild family is the link at the center every time.  you will find a Rothschild having direction interactions with Murdochs, reports of the Rothschilds controlling the Vatican bank, reports of the Rothschilds controlling national central banks, reports of the Rothschilds having personal disputes with politicians (Tsar Nicholas being the most famous example), reports of the Rothschilds performing huge financial moves (the old Rothschild/Battle of Waterloo story).  it goes on and on.  the simple truth explaining the entire operation?  uncontested control of money is control over people.

       i have seen more than enough to be convinced who holds control, and who has been holding it for centuries upon centuries.    not only does the historical evidence tie them to the same scam for all that time, but only their institutions are in the position of profit.

       why is Zionism continually brought up in these theories (or whatever you would prefer to call them)? From what i can see it seems like a very small influence when compared to larger NWO motives

       simply put, the ruling powers find it convenient to identify with Judaism in order to play the victim card whenever they are publicly called out in any way (although they are not actually members of the ethnicity, however it's usually defined).  it's a particularly disgusting way to use the misfortunes of a people for personal benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Zionism"'s implementation as the state of "Israel" is meant to allow for military expansion into the Middle East under the guise of the creation of a state to protect the Jews.  all critics of Israel's imperialism - that is, the oppression of Palestine, "alliances" with local governments (both military and trade), war-mongering (Iran is a great current example) - are thus labelled "anti-Semites," and their actual statements are so dramatically distorted in translation that the labels tend to stick - the public, absent any way of communicating among themselves, would be incapable of bringing the truth of the conflicts to light.  so, the leaders of the people being oppressed by Israel are actually themselves painted in a highly racist light - the stereotype of the "uneducated Arab" - as opposed to speaking in favor of justice and peace.  propaganda outlets such as FOX and CNN then attempt to build consensus among the American/Israeli population by painting the leaders - especially if they are members of government - as crazed dictators.
      </p>
      <p>
       that was the assumed scenario.  unfortunately for the NWO spooks, they "mis-underestimated" the internet, and people began to recognize the injustice, en masse, regardless of the "official" story provided by the U.S. government.  the Gaza flotilla attack was particularly damaging to the acceptance of that story - attacks on humanitarian missions are pretty much impossible to lie about.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, to sum up my response and directly answer your question - Zionism, as an ideology, is merely a tool for conquest of the Middle East, virtually identical to the equivalent American ideology, from about 1700-1900, today known as "Manifest Destiny," which disguised the slaughter of native Americans behind visions of a totally conquered North America (which, more or less - less being "Canada and Mexico" - was the result).

       I think the conspiracy "gurus" are disinfo.  They teach people to look outward for solutions; that the only solution will come from "waking people up".  Could there be a more simple solution, one that only requires changing myself?

       Sure, why not? It's worth a shot. We can't actually wake anybody else up, but we can point them toward certain truths that reveal the deliberate deception of modern society, and sometimes -- at rare intervals -- the person who has his nose rubbed in truth will wake up on his own. It happens.

       The point is that relying on others to "wake up" is looking outward for a solution.  Political "solutions" and newage "collective conciousness" "solutions" both require more than one "awake person"; I'm asking if there's possibly an alternative solution that can be accomplished individually...

       I think the reason why we're credulous of so many of these conspiracies comes from what we know about human behavior: absolute power corrupts absolutely. A good example is the Bilderberg meetings. I don't think it's that crazy to believe that the few people who thrive within the 1% would congregate and conspire on how to maintain their standard of living while screwing over everyone else.

       So if we're part of the Source, and we're bored, and we choose to separate ourselves from the Source in order to experience something challenging, by arbitrarily limiting our knowledge and power, what we're really doing is playing a game, right? We limit ourselves through a set of arbitrary rules, in order to compete. That's a game. So all of mortal existence is just a game, a diversion, an entertainment, and hence, ultimately meaningless.

       Cue various replies about religion being yet another control mechanism, etc., but I think the ultimate goal is this:  To deceive the world into following the Antichrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd even go so far as to say this: Having succeeded in planting false beliefs about the end times based on deliberately misleading interpretations of scripture prophecy, they intend on staging world events in the same way in order to produce a
       <em>
        patsy

       Antichrist, who will meet these all these false expectations.  This stooge Antichrist will be defeated by the real one, who many will believe is Christ because, hey, the previous one was obviously the Antichrist.

       Banking based on the Talmud which was taken up in earnest by the Rothschild family. They moved from simple usury and lending to individuals to money creation and lending to entire governments. It made them and their close associates essentially God's on earth. To be able to create money out of nothing and lend it governments at interest. Basically enslaving entire nations. Due to its international nature they profited from both sides of conflicts. The Rothschilds then worked with the Zionist movement to create modern day Israel. This was essentially a stick in the eye of both Christianity and Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the over arching conspiracy is Rothschilds Zionism.

       Yes, there are people who are trying to gain power over the rest of the world. There always have been, and always will be. Nor is it a secret - kings, CEOs, dictators and Imams have always been quite open about it.

      <p>
       Sure.  Corporations and the rich try to usurp the power of the state, which is controlled by the people via democracy.  Meanwhile in the Soviet Union, a powerful few usurped the power of the people by controlling the state itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both want power, but using opposite methods.  And those methods were not compatible.  Capitalism was a threat to the communist system - a threat to the power of those who controlled everything.  Communism was a threat to the capitalist system - a threat to the corporations and rich folks.  Those nukes that the west and the Soviets had pointed at each other weren't a myth or a front.

       A learned a lot about the Soviet Union outside of school.  That included travelling around the Soviet Union for a few weeks back in the 1980s.

       (I was with a couple die-hard Québécois separatists, in Russia with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Levesque">
        René Lévesque

       died.  Explaining Quebec separatism to some Russians - the idea that we simply let a whole province vote on leaving, was... interesting.  And probably dangerous.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, a lot of what was taught in the west was BS:  Communism died in the USSR back in the 1930s, if not earlier.  But the totalitarian system that replaced it, what both sides found convenient to call communism, was still utterly incompatible with western capitalism and democracy.
