    <div class="md"><p>there is a network of secret societies designed to correlate the parts of society required for global control - religion, politics, industry, &#39;entertainment,&#39; &#39;news,&#39; etc..  the Rothschild family is the link at the center every time.  you will find a Rothschild having direction interactions with Murdochs, reports of the Rothschilds controlling the Vatican bank, reports of the Rothschilds controlling national central banks, reports of the Rothschilds having personal disputes with politicians (Tsar Nicholas being the most famous example), reports of the Rothschilds performing huge financial moves (the old Rothschild/Battle of Waterloo story).  it goes on and on.  the simple truth explaining the entire operation?  uncontested control of money is control over people.</p>

</div>

    <div class="md"><p>simply put, the ruling powers find it convenient to identify with Judaism in order to play the victim card whenever they are publicly called out in any way (although they are not actually members of the ethnicity, however it&#39;s usually defined).  it&#39;s a particularly disgusting way to use the misfortunes of a people for personal benefit.</p>

<p>&quot;Zionism&quot;&#39;s implementation as the state of &quot;Israel&quot; is meant to allow for military expansion into the Middle East under the guise of the creation of a state to protect the Jews.  all critics of Israel&#39;s imperialism - that is, the oppression of Palestine, &quot;alliances&quot; with local governments (both military and trade), war-mongering (Iran is a great current example) - are thus labelled &quot;anti-Semites,&quot; and their actual statements are so dramatically distorted in translation that the labels tend to stick - the public, absent any way of communicating among themselves, would be incapable of bringing the truth of the conflicts to light.  so, the leaders of the people being oppressed by Israel are actually themselves painted in a highly racist light - the stereotype of the &quot;uneducated Arab&quot; - as opposed to speaking in favor of justice and peace.  propaganda outlets such as FOX and CNN then attempt to build consensus among the American/Israeli population by painting the leaders - especially if they are members of government - as crazed dictators.</p>

<p>that was the assumed scenario.  unfortunately for the NWO spooks, they &quot;mis-underestimated&quot; the internet, and people began to recognize the injustice, en masse, regardless of the &quot;official&quot; story provided by the U.S. government.  the Gaza flotilla attack was particularly damaging to the acceptance of that story - attacks on humanitarian missions are pretty much impossible to lie about.</p>

<p>so, to sum up my response and directly answer your question - Zionism, as an ideology, is merely a tool for conquest of the Middle East, virtually identical to the equivalent American ideology, from about 1700-1900, today known as &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; which disguised the slaughter of native Americans behind visions of a totally conquered North America (which, more or less - less being &quot;Canada and Mexico&quot; - was the result).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, why not? It&#39;s worth a shot. We can&#39;t actually wake anybody else up, but we can point them toward certain truths that reveal the deliberate deception of modern society, and sometimes -- at rare intervals -- the person who has his nose rubbed in truth will wake up on his own.

    <div class="md"><p>The point is that relying on others to &quot;wake up&quot; is looking outward for a solution.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason why we&#39;re credulous of so many of these conspiracies comes from what we know about human behavior: absolute power corrupts absolutely. A good example is the Bilderberg meetings.

    <div class="md"><p>So if we&#39;re part of the Source, and we&#39;re bored, and we choose to separate ourselves from the Source in order to experience something challenging, by arbitrarily limiting our knowledge and power, what we&#39;re really doing is playing a game, right? We limit ourselves through a set of arbitrary rules, in order to compete. That&#39;s a game. So all of mortal existence is just a game, a diversion, an entertainment, and hence, ultimately meaningless.</p>

This stooge Antichrist will be defeated by the real one, who many will believe is Christ because, hey, the previous one was obviously the Antichrist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banking based on the Talmud which was taken up in earnest by the Rothschild family. They moved from simple usury and lending to individuals to money creation and lending to entire governments. It made them and their close associates essentially God&#39;s on earth. To be able to create money out of nothing and lend it governments at interest. Basically enslaving entire nations. Due to its international nature they profited from both sides of conflicts. The Rothschilds then worked with the Zionist movement to create modern day Israel. This was essentially a stick in the eye of both Christianity and Islam. </p>

<p>So the over arching conspiracy is Rothschilds Zionism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There isn&#39;t one.</p>

<p>George Soro&#39;s &quot;New World Order&quot; (in 2010, of a repaired international currency trading system) is nothing like Gorbachev&#39;s &quot;New World Order&quot; (of communism, in 1988) is nothing like George Bush&#39;s &quot;New World Order&quot; (of American supremacy, in 1991), nothing like Kofi Annan&#39;s &quot;New World Order&quot; (of UN Supremacy), nothing like Iran&#39;s President Ahmadinejad&#39;s &quot;New World Order&quot; (of Islamic supremacy), and only somewhat like the G20&#39;s &quot;New World Order&quot; (an adjustment to the Bretton Woods system, and rolling back the bank deregulation of the &#39;90s.)</p>

<p>For others it means NO organization having supremacy, or the common citizens united by the internet having supremacy over government. For still others it means their music player or detergent has supremacy over the market.</p>

<p><strong>These definitions are almost all incompatible with each other.</strong> The capitalists and the communists and the monarchists and the Islamic theocrats have opposing goals.</p>

<p>Yes, there are people who are trying to gain power over the rest of the world. There always have been, and always will be. Nor is it a secret - kings, CEOs, dictators and Imams have always been quite open about it.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, &quot;The difference between common-sense and paranoia is that common-sense is thinking everyone is out to get you. That&#39;s normal -- they are. Paranoia is thinking that they&#39;re conspiring.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;At the last count the world was secretly being run by the Illuminati, Knights Templar, Freemasons, Trilateral commission, New World Order, Skull &amp; Bones society, Bilderberg group, Nine Unknown Men and the ever-popular Jews. It&#39;s unknown whether they all vote on various issues or just ask Dan Brown whose turn it is each week. Conspiracy theorists honestly believe that these invisible elites have run thousands of years of history but are incapable of killing someone who lives in a basement and shouts on street corners.&quot;</p>

<p>There is some evidence that capitalist &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;communist&quot; totalitarianism are fronts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure.  Corporations and the rich try to usurp the power of the state, which is controlled by the people via democracy.  Meanwhile in the Soviet Union, a powerful few usurped the power of the people by controlling the state itself.</p>

<p>Both want power, but using opposite methods.  And those methods were not compatible.  Capitalism was a threat to the communist system - a threat to the power of those who controlled everything.  Communism was a threat to the capitalist system - a threat to the corporations and rich folks.  Those nukes that the west and the Soviets had pointed at each other weren&#39;t a myth or a front.</p>

<p>Not what I&#39;m suggesting at all. The power of the state has always been private -- democracy, especially at the highest levels, is merely social management and theatre.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a cop-out by those too lazy to get involved.  Here in Canada that last party that thought that way wasn&#39;t just voted out of power; they were voted out of existence.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve taken part in an election campaign.  I have family who have been involved in winning campaigns near the top.  Democracy is real.</p>

<p>Yeah that&#39;s what I was taught at school as well, but imo it&#39;s bullshit. </p>

<p>A learned a lot about the Soviet Union outside of school.  That included travelling around the Soviet Union for a few weeks back in the 1980s.</p>

<p>(I was with a couple die-hard Québécois separatists, in Russia with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Levesque">René Lévesque</a> died.  Explaining Quebec separatism to some Russians - the idea that we simply let a whole province vote on leaving, was... interesting.  And probably dangerous.)</p>

<p>Yes, a lot of what was taught in the west was BS:  Communism died in the USSR back in the 1930s, if not earlier.  But the totalitarian system that replaced it, what both sides found convenient to call communism, was still utterly incompatible with western capitalism and democracy.</p>
