<p>This was or could have been caused by the air on a given floor being expelled out of a window when that given floor collapsed. It was explained in another thread around here like a week or two ago, I believe...</p>

<p>Even if you can prove that the twin towers were brought down by explosives, how does this prove the United States government was involved in the attacks? These explosives could just as easily have been planted by any other domestic terrorist organizations, or even a cell of agents that remain hidden or was never identified. I don&#39;t know how plausible this is, but I&#39;m also not convinced that the towers were brought down by explosives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do all in their power to let something happen? That&#39;s kind of an oxymoron. It could have been simple arrogance, or gross neglect. If they wanted to go to war, why would they need the attack to actually occur? If they knew exactly how the attacks were going to unfold, why not shoot down the planes just before they found their targets? I feel like this would have given them just as clean justification to go to war on whoever they wanted to claim made the attack, with less domestic destruction, civilian loss of life, might even have avoided that recession, which it seems pretty dumb to cause your own country to go into when you plan on going to war.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that they &quot;found&quot; one of the hijackers passports in the rubble is evidence that they&#39;re making shit up. It&#39;s not circumstantial, but it&#39;s not enough evidence to convict of X. Just enough to warrant further study and questioning of their official story. Plus they had the crime scene broken down into scrap metal and shipped off to various parts of the world for industrial re-use. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a lot of evidence that they left us with, given that they also didn&#39;t release multiple security camera shots of the &quot;plane&quot; hitting the pentagon. So what you&#39;re demanding isn&#39;t easy to do necessarily, we do have to be wary of unwarranted speculation...for sure...but c&#39;mon dude. wake up sheeple?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be clear, even NIST&#39;s analysis of the Building 7 collapse is unconvincing because it was never peer reviewed, nor was the raw data allowed to be independently analyzed.  Models can be used to produced anything when you don&#39;t have to show anyone what&#39;s under the hood. I don&#39;t know why they just don&#39;t publish the files on a website to end the debate.  </p>

<p>Additionally, the NIST report on the other two towers was rather lazy.  There are too many unsourced claims of mass when they should have provided architectural drawings of cross sections and materials. Anyone who has performed peer reviews in science would laugh at the sourceless claims the report makes to support their conclusions.</p>

<p>A good example of what a government investigative report should look like is the CAIB report of the Space Shuttle Columbia accident.  I don&#39;t see people claiming &quot;conspiracy!&quot; in that disaster because NASA provided a compelling scientific explanation that was supported by data from several directions, all converging on one source (the damage to the leading edge).  </p>

<p>Conspiracies grow when there is a vacuum of convincing information. And unconvincing information is noticed by people who pay close attention.  Not many people do.  But when both lay people and skeptics alike agree on something, it&#39;s usually because it&#39;s true.  Unfortunately the government has presented too many opportunities/gaps in the story/weak arguments in this case, and hence the number of skeptics grows. </p>

<p>Even if one accepts all of NIST&#39;s claims about extensive structural damage to WTC 7, and its claims about fires on several different floors, its collapse scenario is not remotely plausible. The alleged damage was asymmetric, confined to the tower&#39;s south side, and any weakening of the steelwork from fire exposure would also be asymmetric. Thus, even if the damage were sufficient to cause the whole building to collapse, it would have fallen over asymmetrically -- toward the south. But WTC 7 fell straight down, into its footprint.</p>

<p>Your lies don&#39;t pass the smell test here anymore. Even NIST admitted to freefall in their final report (after many complaints from the truth movement following the preliminary report).</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center#7_World_Trade_Center">NIST observed that the building&#39;s exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet)</a>.</p>

<p>Or you could go straight to the actual report:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <strong>north face</strong> hit free fall speed <strong>briefly</strong> as it started to fall.  But then the north face was the last part to collapse - you can see the penthouses at the center of the building disappear seconds before the north face goes - so it met little resistance.  &quot;In State 2, the north face descended at gravitational accelleration, as the buckled columns provided negligible support to the upper portion of the north face.&quot;</p>

<p>But that was very brief.  As the report notes - and does the math to prove it - &quot;the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of decent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The three stages of collapse progression are consistent with the results of the global collapse analysis discudeed in Chapter 12 of NIST NCSTAR 1-9.&quot;</p>

Yes, the video I linked to was from the north side, but even when you examine the damage on the south side, it still does not innately necessitate a collapse.</p>

<p>As for the the seismograph information, <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/essays/demolition/seismic.html">here is another take on it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the seismic records from the Doherty Earth Observatory and other recording stations don&#39;t support the theory of controlled demolition put forth by Christopher Bollyn and other proponents of basement bomb scenarios, they nonetheless do support the case for controlled demolition, albeit in an indirect sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you come right down to it, probably the only evidence of it being an inside job is truly circumstantial. However, there is so damn much of it that it&#39;s next to impossible to come to any other conclusion without claiming there were umpteen million coincidences, lapses of judgement or cases of irresponsibility. All the way from visas being improperly approved on orders from highly placed officials to the hijackers being trained and living near US bases and other government installations. From $2.3 trillion unaccounted for announced by Rumsfeld on 9/10 and the investigative unit and all of their documentation about that investigation being destroyed at the Pentagon to Bush and Cheney stonewalling an investigation into the attacks. From FBI investigations of the hijackers prior to 9/11 being shut down by highly placed officials to Mossad agents being there &quot;to document the event&quot;. From the ISI wiring $100k to Mohammed Atta to the US Military continually changing their story during the 9/11 Commission investigation.</p>

<p>I could go on and on but hopefully you get the idea. If a suspect were on trial in a US court they would easily be convicted on a whole lot less circumstantial evidence than exists for a 9/11 inside job. Highly placed individuals in the US government had the means, motive and opportunity to plan and execute those attacks.</p>

<p>It also seems that <a href="http://jamesfetzer.blogspot.com/2011/05/has-nanothermite-been-oversold-to-911.html">nanothermite alone isn&#39;t destructive enough to have brought down the towers by itself</a></p>

<p>And once again, even if it could be shown that explosives were used to bring down the towers, one could probably conclude that there were more people involved in the attacks than are officially accounted for, but I don&#39;t see how this necessarily implicates the government as being these people.</p>

<p>Is the most likely scenario really that the government attacked and killed its own people and sunk its own economy into a recession on the eve of a pre-planned war? Couldn&#39;t almost-accomplished but foiled terrorist attacks be just as effective a justification of war and augmentation of national defense administrations?

    <div class="md"><p>Uh-huh. If you read the links from wiki, you&#39;d know they&#39;re open enough to publish things like <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17288-crap-paper-accepted-by-journal.html">completely randomly generated nonsense</a>, which indicates that this publication is clearly not peer-reviewed. Why would Jones publish this important research in a publisher like this? I can only imagine its because he didn&#39;t think his research would stand up to peer review. Why won&#39;t he publish this research anywhere else? Apparently Jones doesn&#39;t have enough confidence in his own work to even try to have his research tested by his fellow scientists.</p>
