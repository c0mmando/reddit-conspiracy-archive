       Tried to buy an Xbox game at Target and the clerk tried to scan my driver's license, saying the state requires it!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just dropped off some packages at UPS and the clerk tried to scan my driver's license, saying it was policy.  He also said I was the first customer to complain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to tape over the bar code on my license so it can't be scanned without some effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is getting ridiculous.  Fortunately, in both cases, I was able to complete my transaction without the scan, but it took standing up to these "policies."  (UPS wasn't able to show me a written policy.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does "the state" need to have a scan of my DL associated with my every move now??

       A driver's license is just a common form of ID.  If you don't drive, then you will have a state ID.  In my state, this is a card that is almost exactly like a driver's license except it says "X State ID" instead of "X Driver's License."  It can still be scanned in exactly the same way.

       I'll be absolutely floored and shocked to the core if anyone can back this up with a law or even a court precedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, you need I'd to drive and fly and shit. You sure as fucking hell cannot be compelled to produce Id 'cause it's the law'. Anyone who says otherwise probably got bullied by a cop into thinking it is the law. I seriously can't count the number of times I have told police that I will not give them my id. Sometimes they try and strong arm you, sometimes they don't. One tried forcing me to give him my wallet cause he 'knnew I had one'. I told him I would not.
      </p>

       Sometimes I will give my name if I don't want a big hassle, but unless I'm behind a wheel or buying alcohol you are not going to get it.

       It's the same as photographing police - they'll maintain it's illegal and farm up charges on you but if you stand firm you'll learn it's a farce.  As with most 'rights', you must stand for them.  If you do have identification and you fail to produce it (on request), they can charge you.  As mentioned, the best response is "am I being detained or under arrest" - if you are then hand it over.  If you are being detained or arrested, a report must be filed and the officer must get creative for the reason (which is becoming even easier for them).

       any natural diet...low on easily digestable sugars...medium amount of fats...lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, especially citrus, but also fruits like mangoes, peaches, kiwis, berries...some grains...the things that you know you're supposed to be eating.  and it's also a big problem if you're eating poor quality factory meat - that can be the cause of other minor (or fatal) illnesses as well.  that means to eat free range meat.  follow your instincts.

       You are completely correct.  The willing acceptance of anything similar to the OP's story is outrageous.  I have never encountered such a situation so I cannot personally comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the aforementioned acceptance occurs in other areas in which I have encountered.  PEOPLE DON'T CARE IF IT DOESN'T CAUSE THEM HARM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people don't care if they're carded or searched for something because they have nothing to hide, or some stupid response that is constantly reinforced by the media, society, entertainment etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was taught to actually believe in human rights, civil rights, rights guaranteed to me as a citizen, et cetera and I feel like I either missed a lesson where those things only apply to certain people, or under certain circumstances, or should be surrendered when asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you fucking kidding me? Fucking fuck shit I wish there was a cuss word worse than fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right oasiss.  A friend said they thought it was cool and funny when they were nudey scanned by the TSA because it felt like a video game.  I asked why they thought it was ok, why they liked it and why they didn't care about their rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer?  Safety and it didn't hurt them.

       To so carelessly toss away things that should be granted to every person on this earth......ugh.

       I'm still convinced the only legitimate alteration to airline travel was adding a cockpit door that is only able to be opened from the inside.  The rest is TOTAL bullshit. The rest is slowly sapping you, from you, for lack of a better way to put it.  Please don't fall for it.

       Wow, I've never had that happen, but best believe when it does that I'm gonna raise some hell. The fact that A) no one has questioned this according to the UPS clerk and B) most likely 99% of people won't question it after you, is a sign of the complacency of this nation. I have faith in humanity, but damn people need to start catching on to these subtle, yet when you think about not even really that subtle, actions being taken by the higher ups at IRL big brother shit.

       but stores WILL most definitely sell your information (which will face statistical analysis to reveal your preferences) for money.
      </p>
      <p>
       the capture of your most vital information at the point of transaction as a prerequisite to completion of the same is just another useful grab for your masters to learn how best to milk you.

       That's not entirely true.  My DL is scanned at the Target register when I try to buy my nicotine gum.  This occurs at the point of scanning the item, and well before my declaration of payment method is provided or requested.

       I was simply stating that payment of cash does not remove the requirement (by Target) to scan my DL.  I wasn't buying a tobacco product, but rather an age restricted item from Target.  Why an eyeball of my DL wasn't sufficient is puzzling.  I have an easier time buying a bottle of Jack Daniels from the liqueur store, or getting into a bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if only my birth date was captured when my DL is scanned, okay, but that's not the case.  My license contains name, address, phone number, date-of-birth, eye color, hair color, weight, driving restrictions, organ donar status, and driver's license number.  And in some cases, my SS#.  That's a lot of information to provide to purchase nicotine gum, or a pack of cigarettes.  At Target, it goes beyond those items as well.  Video games are included, as well as other seemingly random items.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, whether I or someone else has any evidence that a merchant or advertiser would sell/purchase this information, or not, doesn't mean it's a non-issue.  Once my DL is scanned, all of that personal information is then in the hands of the merchant, and not in my control.  In my case, it's stored and maintained by Target, and Target is a big company.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I know what Target is or isn't doing with my personal information?  I wasn't provided any official Fair Information Practices policy from Target, nor was I informed of any sort of Privacy Policy.  I was just required to provide my personal information.  That's an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I know that Target will protect my data?  Do you think a company like Target can't be part of a targeted cyber attack, where personal information is stolen?  All I wanted to do was buy some gum, but my personal information could potentially end up in the black market in the hands of criminals.  That's an issue
      </p>
      <p>
       If Target can't trust there own trained point of sale employees to read a DL and determine the age of someone, why should I trust that they can safely and responsibly maintain my personal information?

       I have recently moved back to my country of origin - and it has now become practice to use your equivalent of a ssn to buy anything. Tried paying for a coffee maker the other day with CASH. They asked me for it, so I told the woman I wasn't giving it to her - so she said she had to otherwise the system wouldn't proceed. So i told her to make one up (because it doens't get checked jsut stored). Second, I  go through this every month at the gym when I pay for my membership also with cash and they ask me for the number again. They look at me like I'm form mars for not wanting to give that kind of information up.

       Serious question : what if you truly don't have a driver's liscence? I know plenty of adults who don't! Don't tell me they wouldn't have sold you the xbox or that Ups wouldn't take your package? What happens if you tell them you simply don't have one? Weirdest thing ever, and creepy 0_o

       only place i've had that is when i bought whiskey at a grocery store.
they scanned the bar code before I realized it. I thought they would just verify the front age. never will let it out of my hand again.
