<p>The political class is bought and sold. It is a dog-and-pony show. And if you&#39;re busy going about the business of confusing regular citizens to that FACT, regardless of what pre-selected Manchurian you support, you are doing the work of the <em>enemy</em>. </p>

<p>The FACT remains that the US Political sphere, as it exists, is corrupt by design. Even Jesus Christ himself would end up appointing bankers and criminal executives to Cabinet posts in 2012. Yes, it&#39;s that rigged. And your chosen savior will do exactly FUCK ALL to change that. I promise. </p>

<p>So what do you do? Here&#39;s what you do. You take all that energy you have to proselytize on the internet about your favorite American Political Idol, and you hit the streets. Join other protestors. Work with your local politicians to address the real issues in your community, and rail against them when they don&#39;t. That&#39;s where the real change is happening. </p>

<p>Until we get some MAJOR reforms in Washington, we won&#39;t see anything but the same agenda being carried out by an endless procession of patsies and figureheads. The time to pretend we haven&#39;t had evidence of that is over. And we can&#39;t wait on the political class to change it, WE have to show the political will to get it done. Signing on for another personality-as-president is the opposite of that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that Rockefeller is scared. Maybe a bit nervous about that, what the reporter said. &quot;Bringing the power from the federal reserve back to the US government.&quot; Would not be that dramatic without the music.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know if they are really fighting to keep him out of the media. Maybe they want us to believe that he is a good one. And I saw a lot of his appearances anyway. I know more about Ron Paul than I know about any other candidate. And i live in austria btw.</p>

<p>I really tried to find some proofs about his connections to the NWO. There is some stuff available on the web but there are no 100% proofs.</p>

<p>But i can clearly say that Ron Paul wants to support a capitalistic system. He is also partly a conservative politician who is against abortion. He says that life begins with human fertilization and he wants a law for it. I don&#39;t know his real opinion about the death penalty though. He also is supporting the right to keep and bear arms and he is backed up by the lobbying &quot;Gun Owners of America&quot; organization.</p>

<p>And he works with that shill alex jones.</p>

<p>I still believe that he is a puppet for the hidden elite.
And if he is not, then he will become one, when he is president. But as i&#39;ve written before...i don&#39;t think, someone can become POTUS, if he is not controlled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t think Rockefeller was scared of Ron in that video but he was very uneasy about the idea of a Presidential Candidate wanting to take away the feds power to print money. They had to kill the last one, it probably wouldn&#39;t be as easy this time.</p>

<p>I agree with Ron on all of those issues you bring up, he wants to bring capitalism back to the states and I&#39;m all for that.  What we have now is far from capitalism, Ron Paul calls it cronyism, but I think its even closer to fascism.  He is a true conservative, in a sense that he wants to go back to our roots and uphold the Constitution. That is what conservatism is, sticking to old ways. We have moved away from the Constitution, the Bill of Rights is more like a guideline now than actual rights. 2nd on the list of the Bill of Rights? Right to bare arms, so of course he will be for that. </p>

<p>I think Ron Paul is the real deal, I trust him. As a former President once said. &quot;fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can&#39;t get fooled again.&quot;</p>

<p>I was almost certain Obama would get shot by the end of his first term.  But he decided to play along with the higher powers.  If Ron goes after the Fed, I fear he could end up like the last president that went after the Fed....JFK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh... who&#39;s getting into that firefight in the first place?</p>

<p>FUN FACT: If you <em>need</em> a gun, it&#39;s a 50-50 chance you&#39;re already proper fucked. If you own a gun, if you love guns, you have utterly NO understanding of what a powerful person is, who gives the orders, and who dies. HINT: It&#39;s usually the guy with the gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. But... spoken like a true gamer. The Barrett weighs 35 lbs fully loaded. You don&#39;t just throw it around like you can on the game. The thing&#39;s a PIG. And in close quarters, inner-city fighting, you need something with an effective range of 300-500 yards, TOPS. Compact, light, and easy to relocate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol at all the comments after your post.</p>

<p><em>Clearly all expert marksmen</em></p>

<p>I like to think I can handle a gun quite well, and have dropped roo&#39;s at 200 yards with a .22 before. But I wouldn&#39;t like my chances trying to conduct a guerilla war against the US for one simple reason.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t try to shoot you if you&#39;re better than them. They drop a ton and a half of high-explosive freedom on you from miles away out of a radio-controlled model plane. </p>

<p>And for the record, you want a .223 with a remmington 700 action. The gun will go forever, and you can re-use your brass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still wouldn&#39;t go anywhere near a weapon like that. If you want something purely for home defense, you still would be fine with a .223, and if you really needed something to spray a group of people, an automatic 12g would be well enough. I just find the thought of having automatics around more trouble than their worth - they ruin your brass, group like a blind retard with parkinsons disease, and have a much higher chance of jams, failures and breakages...  I won&#39;t dispute that they&#39;re damn entertaining though.</p>

Sitting out on the sidelines in a fight for our future is not solving any problems. I would rather confront and call out the criminals to their faces, and put the fear in them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that Rockefeller is scared. Maybe a bit nervous about that, what the reporter said. &quot;Bringing the power from the federal reserve back to the US government.&quot; Would not be that dramatic without the music.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know if they are really fighting to keep him out of the media. Maybe they want us to believe that he is a good one. And I saw a lot of his appearances anyway. I know more about Ron Paul than I know about any other candidate. And i live in austria btw.</p>

<p>I really tried to find some proofs about his connections to the NWO. There is some stuff available on the web but there are no 100% proofs.</p>

<p>But i can clearly say that Ron Paul wants to support a capitalistic system. He is also partly a conservative politician who is against abortion. He says that life begins with human fertilization and he wants a law for it. I don&#39;t know his real opinion about the death penalty though. He also is supporting the right to keep and bear arms and he is backed up by the lobbying &quot;Gun Owners of America&quot; organization.</p>

<p>And he works with that shill alex jones.</p>

<p>I still believe that he is a puppet for the hidden elite.
And if he is not, then he will become one, when he is president. But as i&#39;ve written before...i don&#39;t think, someone can become POTUS, if he is not controlled.</p>
