        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve encountered people in other sub-reddits saying that they post here. Which, is hard to believe seeing as how I see the same few names on here every day. there are 42 thousand readers of r/conspiracy. However, very few post here. I will say I have been posting here for at least 6-8 months. I use a lot of throw-away accounts though. Anyway, I find it sad that others pretend they know what conspiracy is. They really have no clue, and furthermore the rest of reddit knows almost nothing about the world we actually live in. They can continue their cat pictures and memes all day, but at the end of it, they will still laugh at r/conspiracy as if we&#39;re the &quot;crazy&quot; ones. Unfortunately, my biggest complaint is that this board has been co-opted and it&#39;s not even fucking moderated. It&#39;s a piece of shit, and conspiracy deserves better. However, getting people to read a new board is impossible. So I&#39;m stuck here, my lizard people friends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You highlight another big problem with r/cons, the total lack of consensus or a single narrative.  At least the so called &quot;government story&quot; is the same from person to person, you don&#39;t have counter terrorism experts arguing over who really pulled off 9/11, Osama or Iran.</p>

<p>You use the term &quot;real conspiracy&quot; which is like using the term &quot;real Christian&quot;, it is really in the eye of the beholder.  You might tell me 9/11 was a Mossad operation carried out while the US willingly stood down.  Before you get done fleshing out your whole story someone will be along to tell you that you are some kind of blind sheep and everyone who knows &quot;the Truth&quot; (everyone on r/cons thinks they have a monopoly on truth) that the buildings were brought down by holographic mini-nukes and then the evil overlord Zurg came and sucked up all the radiation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Govt worker here. Yes, there are millions of people in govt, but only a select few need to know the plan. Govt is compartmentalized way more than people think, below the agency director level anyway, and most people do what they are told to do or get shitcanned, just like any other business. Do you <strong>really</strong> think every teller at every BoA branch has to &quot;be in on it&quot; in order to rip off customers? Are you that stupid?

    <div class="md"><p>As soon as something gets the label &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; it is a lost cause for the most part. As this sub is all about this, it can&#39;t have the impact you wish it to have.</p>

<p>edit: What I think this sub needs (if it wasn&#39;t done yet) is a discussion about how discrediting conspiracy theories works and how successful that is. And how a lot of the &quot;loons&quot; do their own (unintended) part in this. A lot of those aren&#39;t mature enough to work this through intellectually and do exactly as &quot;they&quot; want them to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just find it interesting, I think the reason people are here is because they sense that something in the world isn&#39;t right. Something is going on, and no one has answers for them. Religion is a croc, government is a croc, and I think what everyone is zeroing in on is real freedom, freedom from social-experiment slavery. We all just want to be free from society, free from all the bullshit. We all know that you can&#39;t have freedom without first having the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most truths are unavailable, so all people have left are educated guesses. So it is in everyone&#39;s interest here to be educated. That includes education in psychology, conditioning, mass manipulation and mass and single education.</p>

<p>I think instead of talking about theories it would be good to show how society is held in check by pointing out and commenting examples of it in political speeches, media and general discussions.</p>

<p>Link to a news article and analyze how it plays with the minds. Link to (scientifically sound) articles about the fallacies of the mind. Stuff like that will look educated instead of laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I for one, LOVE conspiracies. I truly think that there are two types - the accidental and the planned.</p>

<p>For example: a group of companies are wanting certain regulation passed so they all profit more. Although they aren&#39;t working together in actuality, their actions appear to be coordinated efforts to ensure a common outcome.</p>

<p>Of course the other is the real conspiracy: two or more individuals working together, usually clandestinely, to effect an outcome or change. </p>

<p>The truth remains, however, that people have been systematically indoctrinated to see and hear &#39;conspiracy&#39; as &#39;lunacy&#39; or &#39;idiocy&#39; or any other terms used to describe undesirables. Led astray I would think.</p>
