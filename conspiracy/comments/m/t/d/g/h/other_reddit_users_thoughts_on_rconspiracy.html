       I've encountered people in other sub-reddits saying that they post here. Which, is hard to believe seeing as how I see the same few names on here every day. there are 42 thousand readers of r/conspiracy. However, very few post here. I will say I have been posting here for at least 6-8 months. I use a lot of throw-away accounts though. Anyway, I find it sad that others pretend they know what conspiracy is. They really have no clue, and furthermore the rest of reddit knows almost nothing about the world we actually live in. They can continue their cat pictures and memes all day, but at the end of it, they will still laugh at r/conspiracy as if we're the "crazy" ones. Unfortunately, my biggest complaint is that this board has been co-opted and it's not even fucking moderated. It's a piece of shit, and conspiracy deserves better. However, getting people to read a new board is impossible. So I'm stuck here, my lizard people friends.

       You highlight another big problem with r/cons, the total lack of consensus or a single narrative.  At least the so called "government story" is the same from person to person, you don't have counter terrorism experts arguing over who really pulled off 9/11, Osama or Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       You use the term "real conspiracy" which is like using the term "real Christian", it is really in the eye of the beholder.  You might tell me 9/11 was a Mossad operation carried out while the US willingly stood down.  Before you get done fleshing out your whole story someone will be along to tell you that you are some kind of blind sheep and everyone who knows "the Truth" (everyone on r/cons thinks they have a monopoly on truth) that the buildings were brought down by holographic mini-nukes and then the evil overlord Zurg came and sucked up all the radiation.

       Yes, I understand what you're saying, but at least we can all agree that what is shown and what is actually happening are two different things.

       We live in 3 different worlds. The world the government and the media want us to live in, the world we actually live in, and the world that actually exists.

       Are we talking federal, state or local?  Is my city counsel part of the Zionist conspiracy or are they just pawns?  Saying "the government" is like saying "white people" you are painting with a fucking HUGE brush.

       No bro, I'm talking about any government. North Korea, or Russia, or America. I understand that the government is made up of "tens of millions of people". What I'm trying to explain to you, is that the representatives of the AMERICAN government or ANY government have THEIR story that they want you to follow.

       Ok so explain to me specifically who "they" are in the US government.  Message discipline is hard to do in a political party so I want to know how "they" manage to get allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll the agencies that make up "the government" to agree on what "they" want us to believe.

       Govt worker here. Yes, there are millions of people in govt, but only a select few need to know the plan. Govt is compartmentalized way more than people think, below the agency director level anyway, and most people do what they are told to do or get shitcanned, just like any other business. Do you

       As soon as something gets the label "conspiracy theory" it is a lost cause for the most part. As this sub is all about this, it can't have the impact you wish it to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: What I think this sub needs (if it wasn't done yet) is a discussion about how discrediting conspiracy theories works and how successful that is. And how a lot of the "loons" do their own (unintended) part in this. A lot of those aren't mature enough to work this through intellectually and do exactly as "they" want them to do.

       I just find it interesting, I think the reason people are here is because they sense that something in the world isn't right. Something is going on, and no one has answers for them. Religion is a croc, government is a croc, and I think what everyone is zeroing in on is real freedom, freedom from social-experiment slavery. We all just want to be free from society, free from all the bullshit. We all know that you can't have freedom without first having the truth.

       Most truths are unavailable, so all people have left are educated guesses. So it is in everyone's interest here to be educated. That includes education in psychology, conditioning, mass manipulation and mass and single education.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think instead of talking about theories it would be good to show how society is held in check by pointing out and commenting examples of it in political speeches, media and general discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Link to a news article and analyze how it plays with the minds. Link to (scientifically sound) articles about the fallacies of the mind. Stuff like that will look educated instead of laughable.

       Yes, instead of posting shaky "truths" it might be better to post the tools required to seek out truth.

       I for one, LOVE conspiracies. I truly think that there are two types - the accidental and the planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: a group of companies are wanting certain regulation passed so they all profit more. Although they aren't working together in actuality, their actions appear to be coordinated efforts to ensure a common outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the other is the real conspiracy: two or more individuals working together, usually clandestinely, to effect an outcome or change.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth remains, however, that people have been systematically indoctrinated to see and hear 'conspiracy' as 'lunacy' or 'idiocy' or any other terms used to describe undesirables. Led astray I would think.

       If you don't like it here, change it or get out. But stop whining. You can start a new subreddit -- it just has to be something people are interested in, and you have to devote a lot of time and effort to making it work, by consistently posting interesting links and information. So you're not stuck here. And we lizards don't have any friends.

       I'm not whining. I see you around here plenty. Always posting about the zionists. The point is that no one is going to join a new subreddit. Most of the links posted here are from blogs or other really crappy sources.
