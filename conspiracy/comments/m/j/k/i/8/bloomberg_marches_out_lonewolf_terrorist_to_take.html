        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just watched the press conference.  So well-timed it&#39;s almost like poetry.</p>

<p>So, just when the masses are roaring for his ouster over the OWS attacks, etc suddenly they pick up this &#39;terrorist&#39; that they&#39;ve been watching for over a year -- and they just swoop in and pick him up with no problems whatsoever.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my gut reaction -- which may be disproved as time goes on -- Bloomberg needs to change the news, needs to take some heat off (especially since even Conservatives are starting to side with OWS, mostly over NYPD beatings, et al).  He needs to get Conservatives back onside fast so... he tells his men to pick up this nutbar (who, already seems like exactly a &#39;lone wolf&#39; nutbar) Terrorist!  </p>

<p>Instantly Conservatives have a reason to like him again... and a nice distracting headline from OWS.</p>

<p>Anyways, just my gut here but it seems way too perfectly timed.</p>

They focus on a situation/problem nobody really cares about and then lead people to the solution that is in their best interests (to the problem that they didnt care about to begin with)...or just to validate the &quot;consumers&quot; belief system.

They can go two ways with this; they can &quot;catch&quot; him and do all of the stuff that they just did or they can empower him and let him succeed.  Either way they get what they want - as long as the people are unaware of this tactic.</p>
