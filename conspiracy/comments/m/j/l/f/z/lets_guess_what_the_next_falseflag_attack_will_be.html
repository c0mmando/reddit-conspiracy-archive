    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree.  I believe it is harder to do an investigation than the MSM tends to portray (we KNEW that osama bin laden was behind 9/11 4 days after).</p>

<p>It is good that Iran didn&#39;t fall for their trap by retaliating.  It&#39;s important for the West to be seen as defending their position.  Ideally they would get Iran to attack them, but if that doesn&#39;t work, then it&#39;s false flag time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OWS related incident. I&#39;m almost feeling they will have someone do some crazy HK Ultra triggered shit with someone. Shooting en masse or something to make people think OWS is anarchist/communist natured. From this type of scenario, I see more suspension of rights in favor of preventing more OWS protests. </p>

<p>SOPA is a step to suppress the videos and information coming out of the camps. If they can&#39;t suppress the content, they need to find an excuse to make it more relevant to suppress. </p>

<p>Americans need to be haunted an image. A video, an action, similar to WTC.  That alone will sway people to be against whatever it is the attacking party stands for. </p>

<p>They used Van der Lubbe to make a case that Communists were trying to take control of Germany. They need a similar person to finish the plan of total authoritarian rule. A homegrown terrorist is the logical step.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A cyber attack on the US (by the US) that appears to come from N Korea, Iran, China, Russia... in order to push through insane Internet laws and maybe even take military action against countries.</p>

<p>A suitcase nuke on Israel or the US, to invade Iran. If the US is targeted more than once, it might strike both Iran and N Korea.</p>

<p>An OWS rally gets ugly and a high ranking US gov official (maybe even obama) happens to be there, and is killed by &#39;demonstrators&#39; (provocateurs). This would allow the gov to treat the entire OWS movement as a terrorist group under their little patriot act and either detain mass numbers of protestors, set up curfews/martial law, or simply deter people from showing up to rallies because the media would push through the image that OWS = evil.</p>

<p>Also possible is that the US or Israel would attack Iran under total media blackout, and then when Iran retaliates the media switch is flipped back on and all of a sudden it looks like Iran is the aggressor, allowing Israel and the US to do what they want in the name of defense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if they do away with the system of nationalism and its imaginary borders, who will buy all that military equipment? you&#39;re telling me that a large part of the stucture of the &quot;nwo&quot; is just going to quietly accept its obsolescence after being privy to the plan? </p>

<p>you still can&#39;t explain what the nwo is. i say stop being so fucking selfish. a shitty america is our payment for what we&#39;ve done to the world this past century. people in this world are starving, right now, living in shanty towns for generations, with no hope of ever having a decent paying job or healthcare for their children. is that the nwo your&#39;e afraid of? that&#39;s already here. </p>

<p>you&#39;re basically just a selfish whiny twat because you don&#39;t give a shit about those things because they aren&#39;t happening in your country. your basic schtick is &quot;i&#39;m only afraid of the nwo because i don&#39;t want my country to end up like africa or the poor areas of asia or south america.&quot; </p>

<p>if you actually stopped and thought about things for just a couple minutes, you&#39;d realize that the quality of life on earth moves through waves of good to bad in a particular area over time. america has been a shitty place because of capitalism, and will be a shitty place again because of capitalism. </p>

<p>your rant about how they&#39;re trying to control the world and bring down your standard of living is an insult to the people who have had a lowered standard of living for <em>generations</em> since you only seem to care that it happens to you. </p>

<p>and that&#39;s why you have no idea what the fuck you&#39;re talking abuot.</p>

<p>Fuckin a I wish so many more people, here on this little corner of the internet especially I think, would realise precisely this for themselves. Stop being so ameri-centric when WHITE FOLK ARE A MINORITY ON EARTH AND HAVE IT FUCKING DANDY FOR THE MOST PART. Constant vigilance is the price of liberty and all that, I get it, but kindly fuck yourself if you are able to post here AND sincerely believe you have it bad. Shanty towns. Assembling shit for western kids to take for granted. For generations.</p>
