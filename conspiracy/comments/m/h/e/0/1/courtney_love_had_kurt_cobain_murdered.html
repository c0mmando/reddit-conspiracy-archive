       Growing up in the Seattle area in the 90's, I have always been fascinated by the "Courtney killed Kurt" conspiracy theory. I read all of
       <a href="http://justiceforkurt.com">
        JusticeForKurt.com
       </a>
       a few years ago. I just searched this subreddit and found only two mentions of this (one had no upvotes or comments, the other is 2 years old). I would love to learn more about this topic and/or have a discussion about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Just to clarify: I'm not suggesting Courtney was the one who physically killed Kurt. The theory is, Courtney
       <em>
        hired someone
       </em>
       to murder him.

       There are just a few things that seem very odd to me. The private detective Courtney hired is the very person who thinks Kurt was murdered. What did he have to gain from making this up? People think he's a crackpot now. The "suicide" note. How the handwriting at the end was so different. How there was no mention of death before that part. He shot himself with a shotgun, using his toe? The amount of heroin in his body would have left him incapacitated, not hysterical and suicidal. The fact that Courtney had so much to gain from Kurt's death, her obsession with his will, the fact that she's just a crazy, drug riddled bitch to begin with. Thoughts? I would be interested in any of these points being rebutted or supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, after watching several interviews with Kurt on YouTube, he said his stomach pains had been gone for over a year, thanks to some new medicine he was taking. That pain seemed to be the main reason he considered suicide and drugs in the first place. In the interviews he mentioned a few times how he would like to be less responsible for writing all of Nirvana's songs and how he didn't want Nirvana to last much longer. Which lends credit to Grant's theory on the note being about Nirvana breaking up, not suicide.

       why would courtney hire a lawyer to find out what happened to millions of kurt's missing money.. reportedly even real estate transactions using Kurt's SSN.
      </p>
      <p>
       why would she then give up looking for it saying 'it's not my money anyway'?

       the lawyer is currently suing courtney for defamation..
      </p>
      <p>
       Gordon &amp; Holmes, a San Diego-based law firm, represented Love between December 2008 and May 2009 in a fraud lawsuit, but it stopped providing legal counsel after Love hooked up with another lawyer who made the rocker second-guess the firm's litigation strategy.

       not sure.  it means that nobody is looking for the missing money (almost half a billion??) and the Lawyer that was looking is now suing Courtney for suggesting 'they got to her.'  Well who are 'they'?   (is half a billion dollars enough to say we don't get to find out?)

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nick Broomfield
       </p>
       <p>
        Filmmaker Nick Broomfield decided to investigate the theories for himself, and took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love, including Love's estranged father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to Mentors' bandleader El Duce, who claimed that Love had offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain, and passed a polygraph administered by polygraph expert Edward Gelb.
       </p>
       <p>
        Though El Duce claimed that he knew who killed Kurt, he failed to mention a name, and offered no evidence to support his assertion.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         However, during the interview, he mentioned speaking to someone called Alan, before quickly saying,"I mean, my friend" then laughing, saying, "I'll let the FBI catch him". Broomfield inadvertently captured El Duce's last interview, as he died days later when he passed out on train tracks and was run over.

       <p>
        Everyone knows about how Courtney Love offered El Duce $50,000. to kill her husband Kurt Cobain. But that wasn't the whole story. The truth of the matter is ... El Duce didn't have the stomach to kill someone. But he knew someone that did. That's when Allen Wrench comes into the picture. The Mentors were going on tour, so that gave Duce a good excuse to back out of the deal. So what he did was put Courtney love in contact with Mr. Wrench. Allen Wrench has never admitted to El Duce or anyone else about killing Cobain, but Duce was 100% sure that that's what happened.

       Wow. I've never heard that one before. It's pretty far out there, but interesting. I'm not sure how much you really believe it, but I will discuss it. The facial overlay was pretty crazy, but Kurt had a butt-chin. Unless he got some pretty extensive plastic surgery, it's not him. Plus, the newer Weezer albums suck. Kurt is too talented for that. Also, why would it make sense to fake your own death just to become a giant rock star again under a different name? Weezer has sold out much more than Nirvana ever did.

       i remain unconvinced that it's not him.     chin surgery, no problem.  the multiple facial match points, esp the ears are uncanny.   the guitar style in the 'goat punishment' audio is very similar (Kurt was ambidextrous)
      </p>
      <p>
       Keeps notebooks on Nirvana song formula, tours with Foo Fighters.  even does sessions with them (I'd love to hear those..)
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure he couldn't go on in Nirvana (read a diary of their last year of touring to see why)  and that he was forced to clean up and found jesus.  this meant a clean break from his previous life.  he certainly had the cash t afford it.

       the material in the linked thread is compelling to me.  So far nothing is convincing otherwise and there are many odd things that are unexplainable.

       There's a movie about it, called
       <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138563/">
        Kurt and Courtney

       .  C Love hated it when it came out, which is not surprising, since it accuses her of murder.

       In the interest of a fair and balanced argument, I would like to share a couple people's opinions on how Kurt did indeed commit suicide. I actually found these posts on the IMDB message board for "Kurt &amp; Courtney". I must say, they're pretty convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       One: The crap that loser Grant says about Courtney was ridiculous. That she killed him and he was afraid of her and they were going to divorce (something he hated his parents for doing). His suicide note reads "I have a GODDESS of a wife who bleeds EMPATHY", and then goes on about how he needs more empathy. Sure doesn't sound like someone he was afraid of and would murder him, and I doubt he'd refer to her as a GODDESS if he was planning to dump her.. If she really tried to kill him in Rome, why call the police and possibly put herself at risk? Why not let him die, then call?
      </p>
      <p>
       Grants senario: Courtney arranged a drug intervention, somehow knowing Kurt would agree to go to a clinic, knew he would break out, knew he'd come back where people would be looking for him, knew he'd go to the greenhouse and knew he'd be writing something that could be misinterpreted as a suicide note. Or does he think the killers just got lucky. They came and said, "ah ha! There you are Kurt. We were just waiting for you to bust out of a drug clinic, so it would look like you were on the run and had a reason to kill yourself. What's this? You're writing a note saying you're divorcing you're wife and leaving Seattle, the music business and everything else, except commit suicide? Wow, what a stroke of luck! Now we can add a few lines at the bottom that will make it look like a suicide note. Man, we were lucky to find you here writing the particular note we need. Now lie down please, and don't struggle. We're going to overdose you on heroin then blow you're head off so it'll look like you killed yourself. They'll never find out there was heroin in you. I mean who does autopsies in Seattle?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Two: (This person confuses heroin for morphine, but her argument is still strong) I can't believe the amount of biased sites fooling their readers about Kurt's death. There's no proof out there that points to murder. I'll explain:
      </p>
      <p>
       LEVEL OF MORPHINE IN KURT'S BLOOD 
Kurt's autopsy was never made public, it's illegal. The toxicology report is private and only Kurt's family is allowed to ask for copies. Kurt's wife, father, mother, sister, half-siblings, step mother and step siblings believe Kurt commited suicide, and these people have access to the autopsy report.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.52 mg/l of morphine in blood? That's what The Seattle Post Intelligencer printed it citing "a source". Who is the source? We don't know. 
Did the source exist or just a made up story to sell copies? Who knows. Was the source right? The newspaper wasn't shown anything, just words from "a misterious source". The Kurt had three times the lethal dose is nonsensical because nobody knows what the amount of morphine in his blood was.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory of Kurt being sedated with diazepam in order to be murdered is nuts too: Kurt was in rehab and his doctor says he was given Valium there (which is diazepam). This drug stays for days in the system (5 days). Last time Kurt was given valium was April 1st, he died April 5th (do the math).
      </p>
      <p>
       LACK OF FINGERPRINTS? 
There were fingerprints at the scene. From official reports: 
- shell: a latent print card was lifted 
- casing: a latent print card was lifted 
- red print: no legible prints 
- shotgun: 4 cards of latent prints were lifted
      </p>
      <p>
       So 6 cards of prints were lifted from the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authorities explained the prints were not legible because of excessive sweat (common in suicide cases because the victim gets really nervous) and because of the movement the shotgun makes when fired (the friction makes the prints illegible).
      </p>
      <p>
       SUICIDE NOTE NOT WRITTEN BY KURT? No proof at all. 
The real note was examined by a forensic document examiner of the Washington State Patrol. She determined that "The note, item 1, was written by Kurt Cobain". She's the only person in the entire world who has examined the real note. Other experts were given photocopies of a fax, really bad quality. They said the last lines might have been written by a different person but they needed the real note (it's the only way to know how the traces were done).
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know when the note was written. What if Kurt wrote the body of the note April 2nd and added the first and last lines April 5th while on drugs? It's known that people under the influence can't write properly (a drunk person trying to open a door with a key rings a bell, right?).
      </p>

       The theory is very interesting.  I think that the case does need to be reopened for a proper investigation.  There are just to many scientific inconsistencies that point to a possible murder.  I'm not saying that Courtney killed Kurt but her  recorded conversations with Tom Grant (a PI she hired) are highly suspicious.  With the Natalie Wood case being reopened, I'm interesting to see if the Cobain case will get another look.

       This is the thing believers and non believers of the theory alike agree upon. The investigation was shoddy and rushed. To not even attempt to take prints the day the body was found was ridiculous. The bottom line is there were inconsistencies and mistakes made. I don't believe the case will ever be re opened, unfortunately. Although mistakes were made, Tom Grant nor anyone else has produced the necessary solid evidence of murder it would take to reopen it (lie detector tests are not admissible evidence)... As much as I want to believe the conspiracy, all that's been offered is hear-say and opinion.

       heres what i think, the music industry is an extension of the media, these people become famous and hold a lot of public sway. if their ideas/values differ from the agenda the people who control the media hold, i feel they look for ways to "keep them under their thumb". look at micheal jackson, tupac, john lennon, they all tried to speak out. they slandered mj as a kid toucher and that didnt work they kept him doped up out of his mind and ODed him. they tried to deport john lennon on pot charges he still was able to use his money and influence to fund rallys and buy billboards that said war is over if you want it and they had him shot in the street by a mk ultra drone. now they use mk ultra to brain wash the "celebrities" to keep them under control, google - monarch mind control and lady gaga. crazy shit. tupac was talking about killuminatti and starting a political party to rally the black people they fucking murdered him in front of a pyramid. now look who is famous mindless drones and the hip hop illuminatti like jayz kanye west  rhianna just google any of their names just add " and the occult" in the search and you will get 100s of videos picking apart all of the symbolism in their music and videos, fucking satanists. anyway ..... i think kurt cobains murder goes a little deeper than just his crazy girlfriend
