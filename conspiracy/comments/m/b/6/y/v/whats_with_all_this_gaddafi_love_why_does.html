       Is it annoying anyone else that ANY time there is ANY event going on in the world, 90% of this subreddit simply refuses the simple answer in favour of an overly complicated theory?
      </p>
      <p>
       All of a sudden most of this subreddit seems to think Gaddafi was some sort of saint killed by the US for trying to expose secrets or some stupid shit. I've seen questions asking for proof that he was brutal and unfair, others saying he didn't deserve to be removed and it was a conspiracy for oil or some stupid shit
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been asked for proof that his troops shot on protesters. DO YOU PEOPLE NOT KEEP UP WITH ANY NEWS?

       These are civilian uploads to youtube. And for some reason everything the press says has to be 100% made up according to this subreddit, so I won't post any news reports detailing civilian executions. Don't forget the warehouse where they found protestors and fighters massacred. Lets just throw all his broadcasts saying to kill the rebels like rats and that they would not spare a single one. I'm also sure that the media just made up the fact that he was in power for over 30 FUCKING YEARS
      </p>
      <p>
       No, suddenly this subreddit fucking loves this man. Suddenly he was a saint, was fair to his people and EVERYONE who has replied to my comments demands proof that he was an unfair dictator.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right, r/conspiracy. You are all smarter than me and everyone else and the "mainstream media" because you're in on this great conspiracy and you know that Gaddafi was a great person

       Your "Rockefeller Zionist" wingnuttery aside, OF COURSE the first thing they did was set up a new state bank and oil company.  They needed money and credibility for their revolution, and they needed to deny it to Gaddafi.  What were you expecting them to do?  Drum circles?

       I called your claim of Arabs setting up "Rothschild Zionist" banks and oil companies wingnutty.  That's not a "ad hominem attack"; that's stating the obvious.

      <p>
       If you disagree, kindly explain the differences between a "Rothschild Zionist" bank and a NON-"Rothschild Zionist" bank.  Or the difference between a "Rothschild Zionist" State Oil Company and a NON-"Rothschild Zionist" State Oil Company

       Except western intelligence has been wanting to take him out since 1996 and made use of the opportunity. It had nothing to do with his people rising up. Lybia went from being one of the poorest countries in the world to the highest standard of living on the continent. Lybia was a functioning direct democracy not a dictatorship.Egypt was an actual revolution, lybia was a coupe.

       First off, there were attempts on his life by western countries in the mid-80s. Noone is denying that.

       No one is denying that it had one of the best standards of living in Africa. With the world's 10th largest oil reserves, it should have.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, why are you retarded enough to state that it was a functioning direct democracy considering Gaddafi took power in a coup detat and was a dictator for 35 years? Where the fuck is that a democracy?

       Notorious 1994, you state that those that opposed the removal of Gaddafi did so because we believe there was" a conspiracy for oil or some stupid shit." The reasons for my objections are somewhat deeper than "oil or some stupid shit." The main reason Gadaffi was deposed and murdered is that he had plans tointroduce the gold dinar, a single African currency that would serve as an alternative to the U.S. dollar and allow African nations to share the wealth. The Dinar would have been backed 100% by gold, thus destroying the dollar's usability and credibility in Africa and the Middle East.  It is surely no coincidence that Iraq’s prior leader, Saddam Hussein, was trying to do the same thing just prior to U.S. invasion for all of those “weapons of mass destruction.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Human Rights Watch ranked Libya at 58 on it latest world report. When referring to this ranking by HRW one must keep in mind that a higher number is a better number. Notorious 1994, would you care to guess who has the dubious distinction of being number 1? If you guessed the United States of America, you'd be correct. In fact, of all the nations in Africa, Libya outranked EVERY single other nation on the continent.  Also, the United Nations was preparing to bestow an award on the "brutal dictator" Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, and the Libyan Jamahiriya, for its achievements in the area of human rights. Lastly, Libya was a member of the  UN Human Rights panel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notorious 1994, since you seem to be a fan of visual aids, I offer the following. This video shows what was reported by several news agencies to be over 1 million Libyans gathered in SUPPORT of Gadaffi. That would be 1 million out of a nation of 6 million

       Why? Every NATO mission in the past while seems to be about oil, frankly makes me wonder what is going on. It would be naive to say that the U.S finds all the evil in the world and randomly selects a country to be freed from their shackles.

       That's just the liberal media lying to you, it's actually liberty, democracy, and (most of all)
       <em>
        free markets

       being established over there, now that the nasty old bogey man is gone. It's true because the president said so.

       I share your sentiment. I think a lot of people have an immature need to provide "deeper" explanations for why things happen the way they do. These same people see inconsistencies in the status quo explanations of the world as proof that they are right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is everything the media telling us about Libya correct? Probably not. Can a high schooler accessing the internet from his mom's basement come up with a better explanation for why things happen the way they do? Definitely not.

       His sentiment isn't "let's accept everything at face value". His sentiment is "I am tired of idiots coming up with deluded theories."

      <p>
       It's one thing to "find the truth". It's another thing when we start loving a dictator simply because our government attacked his country. The latter is paranoia.

       It's obvious that the MSM has been feeding us all a load of horse shit, but that's not the same thing as loving Gaddafi.

       1) That's just what his sentiment is. And I agree with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It's paranoia because people are so angry with the American government at this point that they jump to a conclusion any leader deposed by the American government was killed because of some occult reason.

       Stop it with the nonsensical attacks.

       There are very good reasons for Gaddafi to be attacked, and they're much the same reasons as for Saddam to be attacked.
