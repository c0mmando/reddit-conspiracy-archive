       Im not from US but it seems like no one in the US wants to admit that there is even a slight possibility that the government knew about it or somehow was involved in organizing it. And if you admit to believing its an inside job apparently you are a piece of shit. Its a tricky thing. Nobody wants to either look at the facts from the past like operation northwood or the bay of pigs invasion or all the different times where it might have been a bunch of bullshit while US was in some other country and while young people were getting killed for some bullshit reasons that people would maybe not have agreed on if they really knew what was going on. But for some reason people dont wanna hear all that. And it crazy how much evidence there is that 9/11 was super shady. Most people dont even know 3 skyscrapers went down on that day. They will tell you two. Three went down! They just dont talk about Tower 7. That was like a 50-story skyscraper that just imploded like a controlled demolition? You can see it on a bunch of different angles and it looks just like a controlled demolition. They didn't talk about it in the initial 9/11 commission report. They didnt even mention about it. I dont know if it in fact was a controlled demolition cause obviously im not an architecht nor do I know anything about building construction but goddamn it sure looks like a controlled demolition. Does my opinion really mean anything? No because im an idiot and im not some sort of engineer or scientist. However why does everyone get mad if you say it looks like a controlled demolition? Cause it fucking does look like one. It literally falls in its own base. Everything gives out at the exact same order. No building has ever collapsed like that on its own. If anyone does have any arguments why 9/11 wasn't an inside job please state them! I would LOOOOOVE to hear them. Im super interested in 9/11 stuff.

       Most Americans truly believe 9/11 was perpetrated by 15 uneducated Saudis sent by a senior citizen in a cave in a backwards third-world country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, terrorists hate us because they envy our freedom. Freedom that we need to sacrifice to "prevent another attack".

      <p>
       Also, anyone who thinks differently is a crazy person or jihadist.

       Yes, Americans actually believe this.

       I recently watched a video by engineers &amp; architects for 9/11 truth, I believe. Toward the end psychologists were offering opinions on why Americans would refuse to consider certain evidence and theories, because it would conflict with their worldview. This worldview is imposed on us from childhood through media, schools, churches. This also happens in other countries. IOW you have to have a certain mindset to even have the capability to consider nonestablishment theories, and most of us do not have such a mindset, for whatever reasons, so no matter the evidence, it gets blocked in our minds, not necessarily intentionally.

       I am not an architect or engineer. What does it for me re Bldg 7 is the complete free fall. Free fall means there was zero resistance. Not a little resistance, zero resistance. I think even NIST admits free fall, or a rate of fall that equals free fall.

       Not really. Collapses begin before the top of a building begins to fall. That you say this demonstrates your lack of knowledge in this area.

       A poll in 2006 reported that 16% of the American people thought the Bush Administration telling the truth about 911. Question 81 here:

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Nearly two-thirds of Americans think it is possible that some federal officials had specific warnings of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, but chose to ignore those warnings
       </p>
       <p>
        An earlier Scripps Howard/Ohio University survey, conducted in July 2006, revealed that more than one-third of Americans thought federal officials assisted in the 9/11 attacks or took no action to stop them so the United States could go to war in the Middle East.
        <a href="http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/28533">
         http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/28533
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2004, just three years after the event, a Zogby poll found that half of all New Yorkers believe that US leaders had foreknowledge of the impending attacks and “consciously failed” to act in response.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So somewhere between a quarter to a half of Americans think some parts of the US government was involved in 911 and most of them think they have been lied to about it.

       Probably about 70% believe 95% of the official story.  Unfortunately, only about 10% are willing to look at evidence that people in power knew it would happen before it did and allowed it to take place.  Of those 10%, only about 10% will dig deeper.  People are too busy to care.

       The problem I have with 9/11, besides 3000 of my countrymen dying for likely devious ends, is that the official story, and everything else associated with the War on Terror™ is so full of holes, yet pushed so hard onto people as truth. The theatrics of it all suggested something other than 'terrorists'.. And yes the elephant in the room of Building 7 never seems to get into first gear. If anything is a smoking gun of those events, it's Building 7. It seems to me, that 9/11 was overall a way to usher in a police state under the guise of 'safety'.

       I believe that 9/11 was not an inside job, but I believe the government knew so much more then they have led on. Do I think the government knew enough to prevent the attacks? I do not know. Tower 7 certainly interests me, there needs to be tests done on this. If you told me though that the government hired these 15 Saudis and threw them under the bus so 9/11 could happen and blamed it all on Bin Laden, I would not think that your story is far fetched at all.

       I don't think 9/11 was an inside job. I don't really think I need to prove that to you, simply because you think George Bush (or the American Govt) flew those planes into the towers.. All I want to say is that the reason those buildings fell was probably because large planes with tons of fuel hit them.. I'm sure I'll get down voted for simply stating my opinion..

       Thanks.. The OP asked a question, and being an American who doesn't believe 9/11 was an inside job, I responded accordingly.. But that's Reddit.  If you have a different opinion, you get down voted.

       I don't really have any arguments besides that fact that I just really can't believe that the American government would allow thousands of innocent people to be slaughtered on 9/11, just so George Bush could finish a fight that his father started.  This may seem like a childish argument, but can I ask if you believe that's true, why you would still want to live in America if you think the government was behind the attacks?

       You seem to be saying that if 9/11 did not happen as you believe it did you have to abandon your faith and your country. You very correctly discern that your argument is childish. Most people who post comments in r/conspiracy on a 9/11 thread do so to reinforce their already established beliefs (just like r/politics). The problem for most people is misunderstanding the opposing argument and arguing against their own misconceptions. W was not fighting his father's war. W did not authorize or even know what was happening. So when you say you cannot believe that, you are actually concurring with what most people believe. That is comforting. The next step is to frame the issue as an appeal to humanity: "I just really can't believe that the American government would allow thousands of innocent people to be slaughtered". This is a subtle way of dismissing any further
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       by implying that anyone who could believe such a thing must  have something wrong with them. However, if you look at the history of America you can find innumerable occasions when this is actually what the government did, from "native" Americans, to African slaves, to German civilians (Dresden), to carpet bombing in IndoChina to the current slaughter of Muslims (where ever we find them). So this particular line of "reasoning" only keeps
       <strong>
        you
       </strong>
       from examining the truth.

       I dont think George Bush was behind 9/11. But I do believe some americans were behind it. I dont live in America so i dont know how to answer your question. Nowadays when people have found 1000's of things about 9/11 that points to the fact that it was an inside job I think its a little bit naive to believe in the offical story.

       You would have us abandon the nation instead of fight to take it back from the few who currently hold power? And where would you have us go? This war, and the unavoidable economic collapse is overtaking the entire globe. At least here we know people and can form a sort of underground.

       Lack of evidence that would back up the assertion. Combine this with Occam's razor and you get a pretty good idea that the conspiracy theories are crap.

       WTC7 was not hit by a plane Sir.  Silverstein says he had it pulled.....and NIST says it fell due to fire.....

       So if you say the two towers fell "because large planes with tons of fuel hit them," then why did Tower 7 fall..?
