        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was pretty stoned during the Ravens and 49&#39;s game over the weekend and was thinking, &quot;how can two brothers both be head coaches of NFL teams?&quot; and even more so, how has this happened a few times in the past as well?  Who&#39;s to say there isn&#39;t a person who&#39;s in total control of the NFL and the games&#39; results (via choosing each play ahead of time for all teams) and profiting not only from tickets and merch, but also side betting in the billions/millions.</p>

<p>This is just a stoned thought, but it makes a lot of sense.  The NFL is a very commercial, over the top business. At least when compared to other sports around the world.  </p>

Distractions of steroid use scandals and contract disputes are bad for business, something at least Vince McMahon realizes. In the end, it&#39;s all about what most things are: money.</p>

<p>We used to call it the boob-tube. we used to call tv series, a program. The truth always hide in plain site. they never &quot;technically&quot; lied to us, but they did bombard us with a shit ton of bullshit mixed in with a few kernels of truth. when I mean &quot;they&quot; I mean, whoever is in charge of this place, earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is probably heavily influenced by gamblers. The NFL&#39;s obsession with security is well known, and I&#39;m not talking about stadium security. They spend a lot of time following and reporting on players. And we can presume their own employees and officials too, but they always cast the players as their #1 problem. Why would they obsess about security unless there have been big problems in the past? In 1963 two of the league&#39;s premier players were suspended for a year for betting on games.</p>

<p>Statistically, <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/buc/jpredm/v3y2009i3p13-31.html">point shaving is happening</a></p>

<p>I imagine that over time, the forces in control ease away from making money with gambling, but there&#39;s almost a billion dollars a year bet on NFL games. If you could make more money (and you surely could) by spending 2% that amount on fixing them, that&#39;s $20 million. You could fix a hell of a lot of games for $20 million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. At least not like you described- the better explanation there is that certain families have a major advantage in terms of opportunities and experiences. Gives me an idea though, we should post a poll with like 20 conspiracy theories and see how the percentages break down in terms of who believes what in our little community here. I for example, think alien shit is ridiculous but 9/11 was most definitely an inside job. Can we do something like that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people I know as well as myself have pondered this exact same question.  If anything, my &quot;bet&quot; (pun intended) is that Vegas is in control of the NFL one way or another.  I also find it strange, that every week, NY Times&#39; picks for NFL for the past several weeks has been pretty much accurate, with the occasional miss here and there, and then suddenly, Every Single, Pick, that they chose, loses except one.</p>

<p>Sure, It could be a coincidence, or maybe the person who was picking them wasn&#39;t paying attention, but for every team &quot;picked&quot; by vegas (and awarded that extra spread based on odds), to lose... that says something...</p>

<p>Honestly I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a few years from now the NFL gets caught up with a black-sox type scandal on their hands.</p>

A prime example: the Miami Heat, buys their &quot;actors&quot; to portray a dynasty, accumulates huge amounts of money/endorsements from bandwagon fans, sells out in NBA Finals as no surprise. I don&#39;t understand why middle class/poor people praise these over paid humans walking around on their light box throwing shit and hitting each other. </p>
