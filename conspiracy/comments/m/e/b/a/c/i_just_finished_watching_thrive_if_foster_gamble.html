    <div class="md"><p>What does this movie, all the new agers preaching &quot;evolving consciousness&quot; or &quot;connecting with each other&quot;, OWS, Tea Party etc. all have in common?</p>

<p>They all advocate &quot;solutions&quot; that require a large group of people to accomplish anything.</p>

<p>Could there be a more simple solution, one that only requires changing myself?</p>

<p>To quote one of the books I&#39;ve been enjoying very much recently, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/QBQ-Question-Behind-Practicing-Accountability/dp/0966583299">&quot;The Question Behind the Question&quot;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the most tempting questions to ask when we first learn the QBQ is “What can we do?” The problem is, “we” don’t change. Teams, departments and organizations don’t change. People change, one at a time, through their own choices.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer in the team concept, but if we’re not careful, we can end up substituting the language of teams (“we” and “us”) for the language of personal accountability. We can hide behind the team with thoughts – which become excuses – such as:</p>

<p>“The team didn’t meet the deadline.”</p>

<p>“The team wasn’t given enough resources.”</p>

<p>“The team didn’t get the job done.”</p>

<p>&quot;The team didn’t have a clear mission.”</p>

<p>Personal accountability is not about changing others. It’s about making a difference by changing ourselves.</p>

<p>Personal accountability. The power of one.</p>

<ol>
<li>QBQs begin with the words “What” or “How”, not “Why”, “When”, or “Who”.</li>
</ol>

<p>•    “Why” questions lead to complaining and victim thinking, as in, “Why is this happening to me?”</p>

<p>•    “When” questions lead to procrastination, as in, “When are they going to get back with me?”</p>

<p>•    “Who” questions lead to blame, as in, “Who dropped the ball?”</p>

<ol>
<li>QBQs contain the word “I”, not “they”, “them”, “you” or even “we”, because I can change only me.</li>
<li>QBQs always focus on action.</li>
</ol>

<p>One important point to keep in mind is that it is possible to apply the QBQ guidelines and still create a lousy question. For example, &quot;How can I avoid responsibility in this matter?&quot; or &quot;What action can I take right now to hold the team back?&quot; adhere to the rules, but they are certainly not constructive questions!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I dare you all to ask yourself &quot;Could I be the &#39;problem&#39;, and if so, how can I be the solution?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched this documentary last night. As MRuppert says, it&#39;s controlled opposition. Mr.Gamble claims in the documentary himself that he was groomed for power, but he &quot;didn&#39;t take it&quot;. Instead he spending probably a couple million of his own dollars/(or someone elses? who funded this doc?) on this website/video/books or whatever. Is it a way to make money? probably. or are the monied elite head faking us with false disinfo? Why all the stuff about free energy though? It seems fairly legit, no way for me to know without seeing it in person. Although I have heard of magnetic motors before that require little to no energy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to decide what the underlying motive is, just like Mr.Gamble says in the documentary, follow the money. Well, in his case. Who benefits? Does Mr.Gamble benefit from destroying the world? Hell, he probably does more so than I do. If I wanted to paint that picture. It&#39;s all about perception right? However, he at least is sourcing stuff, and trying to back up his claims.</p>

<p>I personally think that this documentary alludes to something else. Are we close to disclosure on Aliens? There defiantly was something off about this film. I just can&#39;t quite place my finger on it. It&#39;s everywhere and no where. David Icke (edit: hey maybe alien lizard people are real?) almost ruined it for me, but it also leads me to believe that maybe there is more to this than meets the eye. It&#39;s a well done documentary, right up there with the propaganda of zeitgeist.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that both films go out of there way to give solutions to all of our problems, but leaves us no real way to fix them. As a viewer, I take a passive roll, so the future will largely be dependent on who is actually doing something. Which again, are the elite. They can just pay their way, we have to work.</p>

<p>So, I guess if Mr.Gamble is right, we&#39;ll all be living in a global order with a dictator picked by the global banking elite. They will decide who lives and who dies, and will decide who procreates and who doesn&#39;t. They want to control every aspect of our lives. So, if it is disinfo. We have to look objectively at what we&#39;re being told, how it fits into the larger puzzle, and what we actually can do about it. There  a lot of questions in this world, with very few answers, and even less people to trust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, technically any piece of work is going to be propaganda. They all have their point to make. They best way to be informed about the world around you is to research it yourself. However, these documentaries (including Zeitgeist) have a wealth of information. Understanding what parts are important is the hard part. </p>

<p>DAE think this documentary felt like an episode of Ancient Aliens?</p>

<p>A much better documentary though IMO / <a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-revelation-of-the-pyramids/">http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-revelation-of-the-pyramids/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched this yesterday, and found it fascinating that the creator is a Gamble. I agree with the comments thus far. It very well could be controlled opposition, but the information portrayed in the doc is well disseminated by many in the general &quot;truth movement&quot;. As an information scientist, I feel that gathering these various perspectives of information are very important, so long as we continually think critically. Gamble&#39;s perspective regarding our collective oppression and the solutions he proposed appear to be very similar to my own-- against central banking and the cronyism it purports, calling out the Establishment families that pillage and destroy-- supporting non-aggression and voluntarism,  circulating alternative currency, holistic medicine, seeking &quot;free energy&quot;...</p>

<p>This was all very interesting, but the most fascinating aspect of this doc is its creator, Foster Gambel. We all need to do some collaborative research to see how legitimate this man and his movement are...</p>

<p>Just a thought, it&#39;s almost like the zeitgeist movement is the collectivist side, with the thrive movement being the individualistic side of some alternate consciousness, NEW Socio-Economic paradigm.. Hmm. What do you guys think???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Asking that simple question is a huge deal. Disinfo, controlled opp, whatever... If viewers take away the simple question of &quot;Will we destroy ourselves, or will we Thrive?&quot; -- and then follow the rabbit hole of how we got to this point and what our solutions are -- their worldview very well could be completely different. Personally, I still find myself introspectively stepping back with very much this feeling of -- holy shit, what was I thinking!??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the concept, but I think this film is more likely to open people&#39;s eyes to reality rather to how things really are than form a controlled opposition.

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, this movie is designed to be a crash course for people that aren&#39;t already familiar with these ideas. These are the kind of ideas that could trigger WWIII.  Say the &quot;Eastern&quot; powers discovers &quot;free&quot; energy and ETs and wants to reveal it, the &quot;West&quot; would start WWIII to try and protect their interests. The turmoil would be greater if the powers that be didn&#39;t release some sort of cognitive safety valves to try and help ease people through such a rapid change in global perception of reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the documentary as well.  I find that other docs. such as Food Inc. &amp; Collapse point in the same direction.  They on the other hand point to the doom and gloom, not necessarily and acceptance of the circumstance and concepts of how to deal with the changes. If you take the cumulative the efforts of Phillip Schneider and William Cooper in the 90&#39;s with the information here, then I find this to be right on point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This documentary could have been expanded into a season long series with the wealth of information that it has. And there lies the problem. It glossed over a lot of key points without going into too much detail. For example, I was really interested in hearing about free energy but there weren&#39;t a lot of info on what is being done at the moment to circumvent the suppression. Then again, I believe this was addressed by the accompanying website where you can read up more on certain topics. </p>

<p>I followed the documentary fairly well as I&#39;ve kept up with most of the key talking points. The documentary does a good job of connecting all of the dots that didn&#39;t seem to be interconnected at first. But I think anyone who is not familiar with the topics discussed will need to approach the documentary with a very open mind. It&#39;s a lot to take in.</p>

<p>It is up to us to make changes to this world and how it is run. This movie points out some bad ways it is being run today and simply asks people to peacefully resist this crappy way and contribute to a new way. I see nothing at all wrong with this message.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw the movie last night in it&#39;s entirety with enough mixed feelings that I was very glad to find this discussion of others asking the same questions.  I&#39;m both inspired and skeptical.  Is there a hidden agenda?  Who&#39;s profiting and to what end?  etc, etc. The Free Energy / aliens / crop circle sections are generally too woowoo for my taste, but certainly intriguing.  The money sections are also a bit too conspiracy theory for me, but there&#39;s no arguing with the rapidly growing wealth inequality in this country.  Whether by design or default, the system has become rigged and needs fundamental change.  I looked forward to the solutions section for that&#39;s where the rubber meets the road and found that I could agree with all of the proposed action steps.  But every time I drill down into the web site itself, more doubts and questions arise and I highly recommend spending time with the web site before making any final opinions.  The Liberty section has been most troubling so far. Stefan Molyneux is one of the primary sources used and an internet search reveals lots of troubling info there.  Ann Rand, the Neo-con prophetess is also quoted. I&#39;ll continue to watch this thread and appreciate all of your perspectives.</p>
