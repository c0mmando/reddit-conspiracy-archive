       There's an interesting documentary about the Clintons and Mena, Arkansas out there, but I can't find the link. Look at the bottom of this link for some of the details. I tend to believe that Clinton's complicity in the trafficking of cocaine is one of the reasons he was picked to be president. That, and the whole rise of the world of Wal-Mart of course.

       The CIA Contra cocaine connection is very well documented.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the CIA got involved in SE asia the majority of opium and heroin were manufactured in that region. Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
      </p>
      <p>
       My suppositions from personal discoveries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, the majority of opium comes from Afghanistan and Iraq,It was funneled into Europe through the muslims in Bosnia. This is why the US intervened in the war there in the early 90's. It was disrupting the flow of opium and heroin to Rammstein airbase in Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: This is all information that was gleaned from personal interviews and experiences. But the fact remains Coca and Poppies do not grow on a large scale in the US, but there is no shortage of either here.

       Popular history tells us that Britain looted India. But in reality Britain
       <em>
        lost
       </em>
       money on India, and all her possessions. What was happening was the East India Company was looting the British treasury with the help of a few paid politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what Halliburton/KBR and friends have been doing.  Dick Cheney is the former CEO of Halliburton, and still owns considerable stock in it. Cheney's war has made him and his friends very rich indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Around $23 billion may have been lost, stolen or not properly accounted for in Iraq.  The United States Department of Justice has imposed gagging orders that prevent further investigation.

        Military Commissions Act of 2006
       </a>
       included an amendment that retroactively rewrote the

        War Crimes Act
       </a>
       , effectively making policy makers, i.e., politicians and military leaders, and those applying policy, i.e., Central Intelligence Agency interrogators and US Army soldiers, no longer subject to legal prosecution under U.S. law for what, before the amendment, was defined as a war crime, such as torture.  It's essentially an amnesty law for Bush II and Co's war crimes.

       The financial crisis of 2008 didn't happen merely because of a lot of risky mortgages.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there weren't enough bad mortgages to collect into bonds for those in on the fraud to bet against, the
       <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/11/11/The-End-of-Wall-Streets-Boom">
        banks created them - in vast numbers, out of thin air
       </a>
       - with no actual homes, homebuyers or borrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Eisman, in effect, was paying to Goldman the interest on a subprime mortgage. In fact, there was no mortgage at all. "They weren’t satisfied getting lots of unqualified borrowers to borrow money to buy a house they couldn’t afford," Eisman says. "They were creating them out of whole cloth. One hundred times over! That’s why the losses are so much greater than the loans."
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course the next conspiracy:  the
       <strong>
        lack of prosecution
       </strong>
       , and everyone involved keeping their jobs and bonuses for "a job well done."

       Clinton getting a BJ was declared to be of vital national importance by the Republicans. They did everything but demand that he get re-blown on the Senate floor. ("We must know exactly what happenned!!!) Everything had to be done in public and under oath, and every word published.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not so with 9/11, when they investigated what warnings the President received.
      </p>
      <p>
       The White House wanted to limit any appearance by the president to just one hour spent with two of the commissioners. Bush II did eventually meet with the Commission, but only under stringent conditions: Bush had to have Dick Cheney at his side, testifying at the same time; testimony was given in private and NOT UNDER OATH; no press coverage was allowed; and no recordings or transcripts were made of what they said.

       Does anyone believe, even for an instant, that there isn't some damning pieces of evidence they kept unpublished?

       911 was an inside job.

       Meeting Riconosciuto and Gunderson at the hotel were two representatives of the mujahadeen, waiting to discuss their armament needs. One of the two was named "Ralph Olberg." The other one was called Tim Osman (or Ossman).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Ralph Olberg" was an American businesman who was leading the procurement of American weapons and technology on behalf of the Afghan rebels. He worked through the Afghan desk at the U.S. State Department, as well as through Senator Hubert Humphrey's office. Olberg looked after the Afghanis through a curious front called MSH - Management Sciences for Health.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other man, dressed in Docker's clothing, was not a native Afghan any more than Olberg was. He was a 28-year-old Saudi. Tim Osman (Ossman) has recently become better known as Osama Bin Ladin. "Tim Osman" was the name assigned to him by the CIA for his tour of the U.S. and U.S. military bases, in search of political support and armaments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gunderson and Riconosciuto were not on an altruistic mission. They had some conditions for their help. And they had some bad news to deliver. The mujahadeen needed to be willing to test new weapons in the field and to return a research report, complete with photos. The bad news was that some factions of the CIA didn't feel that Oldberg and Osman's group were the real representatives of the Afghans. Upon hearing this both Tim and Ralph were indignant. They wanted to mount a full-court press. Round up other members of their group and do a congressional and White House lobbying effort in Washington, D.C.

       "How Jimmy Carter and I Started the Mujahideen". By: Zbigniew Brzezinski [ January 15, 1998 ]
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Q: The former director of the CIA, Robert Gates, stated in his memoirs ["From the Shadows"], that American intelligence services began to aid the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan 6 months before the Soviet intervention. In this period you were the national security adviser to President Carter. You therefore played a role in this affair. Is that correct?
       </p>
       <p>
        Brzezinski: Yes.

       "The Business Plot (also the Plot Against FDR and the White House Putsch) was an alleged political conspiracy in 1933. Retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler claimed that wealthy businessmen were plotting to create a fascist veterans' organization and use it in a coup d’état to overthrow United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, with Butler as leader of that organization. In 1934 Butler testified to the McCormack–Dickstein Congressional committee on these claims. In the opinion of the committee, these allegations were credible. No one was prosecuted."
