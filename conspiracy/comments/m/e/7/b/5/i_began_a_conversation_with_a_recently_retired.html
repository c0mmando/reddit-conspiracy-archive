       This man worked under inteligence for the better part of his life. In our conversation the man began to talk about a recent conversation he had with a politician named John, region is Fl. In this talk he said to the man if we ended operation grace land our military spending would reduce greatly. The politician responded "i didnt hear you say that, dont talk about that again." With great curosity I asked him what it was. He went on to tell me that there are 30 prisons scattered in random countries across the world. (After getting home the only thing i researched close to it is black sites that Bush said we had.) The thing that threw me off though is the next part. He responded next with "they are run by boeing, they make airplanes, what business do they have with prisons!" The man began to chuckle at his last remark and go about his way.

       Not at all improbable given the fact that Boeing runs the extradition flights to the black sites already. It only makes sense that they'd run the prisons too.

       It's probably because they wouldn't run the slave labor camps if they were not profit centers.  Those profits come from somewhere, probably the taxpayers pocketbook under the guise of "international stability" or something.

       he'll hint at random things, and he'll always be like "so I was in Italy(or insert different country here).... on... uh business." whenever he tells a story about some random place he's been. Aside from that its all mostly off limits, especially bringing up nam; thats how you get a fork through the throat really fast.

       Trust me, a LOT of people in this country "worked" in intelligence. The ones I have met that actually have would not give up one word about their activities.

       You are applying meaning to the politician's statement that is not supported. If there are secret prisons, operated by Boeing, supported by the US military budget, scattered around random countries across the world, why would a politician in FL know about it --and if he did, why would he respond in such a leading manner?? Additionally, why would the government spend so much money (he mentioned eliminating Op Grace Land would reduce spending greatly) to help Boeing secure slave labor to build their planes? There are plenty of overt ways for the military to waste tax dollars and make Boeing rich without the risk and uncertainty of operating secret slave labor factories in foreign countries..

       Not everyone can keep a secret and it does make an excellent conversation piece. What do you mean i implied meaning to the politicians statement? I live in Fl and had this conversation in Fl. So i could only assume thats where he talked to the politician and thought maybe reddit could narrow it down to who possibly the man could be. Sure there are probably a lot of johns in politics but mentioning a specific region would narrow it down a little.

       I do see your point on the second half! I share some of these doubts and reasoning as well, which is why i posted it to r/conspiracy and in this post light has already been shed on the subject more than i previously could acknowledge.

       I meant you were implying that the politician's response somehow gave some validity to your friend's question about operation grace land, but we have no evidence of that. He may have been confused or bluffing because he thought he SHOULD know. He may have just been tired of conspiracy theorists wasting his time with such ideas, or tired of constituents trying to oversimplify complex budget issues by fixating one random program.

       Ohh ok. What i took from it when talking to him was the politician knew about it and didnt want it brought up for good reasons. The politician could have been trying just pass him off, but the way he worded it the acknowledgement of the politician added depth to the story making it more real to me.

       Most of those black sites have been shut down because civilian reports were able to piece together where they were.  Google "Top Secret America".

       You also need to look into intelligence contracting.  Boeing, Ratheon and a couple of others provide contracting services to intel agencies all over the world.  Everything from guarding to interrogating prisoners.

       No unless you want to believe in something you just made up. The op never mentions slave labour or airplane parts/manufacturing, they are simple prisons and prisons not only make money but cost money to operate and build.

       I don't think so in all honesty, I just think the CIA uses their planes through shell companies, so there are no direct ties, they use other planes as well like learjets.  I would imagine they like using American companies, so they aren't exactly many choices when you want to buy a jumbo jet.

       I didnt make it up. This conversation really took place. The older gentleman could have possibly mixed up his facts. But i could hear the certainty in his voice as he sternly looked into my eyes. I've taken pride in being able to tell when people lie ever since i was little and i dont think he was.
