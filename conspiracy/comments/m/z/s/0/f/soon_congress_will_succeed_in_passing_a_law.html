       What is to be afraid of?
      </p>
      <p>
       I took the user ID I
       <strong>
        a
       </strong>
       mJulianAssange when I discovered Reddit about 10 months ago. At that time people in our criminal government and the sycophant syndicate media were calling for Julian Assange to be assassinated. I wanted to express the idea that "we are legion" and if you take one of us down a hundred will rise in his place. I got the idea from Anonymous and the movie
       <em>
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8h_v_our_Q">
         I am Spartacus
        </a>
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I soon learned that Reddit is crawling with shills. Through the use of multiple user accounts they can bury posts and gang up on posters in a comment thread. I decided to beat them at their own game by posting as many provocative links as I could find and engaging them in endless desultory banter. It worked. In order to get their comments noticed they had to up-vote my posts. In less than 3 months I accrued over 32,000 karma points but more importantly I drew attention to r/conspiracy and readers went from around 26,000 to over 38,000. They could not keep up with everyone while they were stalking me.
      </p>
      <p>
       In exasperation "they" deleted my account. I had not broken any rules; I was not warned; and I was not given any notice (even to this day). I did not know that my account was deleted until someone put up a self post asking what had happened to me. My account appeared normal to me on my computer. However, no one else could see my posts or my comments. Who could do that I wondered. I created this account, ImJulianAssange to find out. I got no help from the mods who could not detect anything wrong with my account. I finally got a very succint message from one of the mods that admins had deleted my account. They have never responded to my many messages and have made no attempt to find out "who hacked their site" so I guess the admins are "they".
      </p>
      <p>
       After a two week hiatus to think about what I might have done wrong I returned with my new (almost identical) user name and appear to have scored another victory.
      </p>
      <p>
       My original intent was to "cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appal the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears." Now I am trying to focus on exposing people to ideas that challenge what religion, free public education and nationalism would have us believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very few people are capable of respecting any interpretation of events other than the one to which they feel naturally inclined by the circumstances into which they are born. We are all born into circumstances we did not create and cannot control. So we develop a method of understanding what is happening in, around and to us called culture. When the precepts of that culture are challenged the natural tendency is to "correct" the person who presents the challenge or to eliminate the discordant information. I think this is an adequate explanation of the shills. It also suggests a futility in trying to argue with them. However, just being exposed to a constant barrage of counter-intuitive ideas (the more annoying the better) has a cumulative effect of "breaking through". The status quo mindset is like a water jug that people carry on their heads. You do not have to demolish it to make it useless, ONE crack will do. So rather than remain silent, I voice my opinion (quietly and clearly) as often and in as many venues as seem appropriate to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not fearless:  I cover the webcam on my computer.

       fantastic response.

      <p>
       We are free and sovereign beings. Just because the criminal and corrupt governments of the world write faulty ideas and treacherous thoughts down on paper and call them laws, does not make them any more real or authoritative or even truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time is fast approaching where Man will fully awaken to our place in the universe, where the small mind will no longer have any power over the awakened mind of Man who realizes his individual sovereignty.

       They won't shut down Reddit. They will never shut down Reddit, because it's owned by a large corporation, and it has the potential to make a lot of money. What they will do is censor Reddit, and make the owners of Reddit censor it. Reddit will become another Digg.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this doesn't happen, but I think Reddit's fate was sealed way back when it was sold. It's only a matter of time until the Zionist elite close the noose around it's neck.

       We need a secret sub reddit.... like r/pot holders ... with code words like weave to mean over throw and yarn to mean uh... b*mb and hot pot to mean government officials... any feds listening would get bored to tears and stop listening after 5 minutes....  I mean any hot pot would cool off after a few minutes and set the pot back down on the stove.

       It's just like Patrice O'neal said (paraphrasing):
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers that be do not make sweeping changes, because no matter the changes, if they are blasted through they will be met with resistance.  Instead, reforms are passed bit by bit, slowly widdling away our freedoms because we prefer lubrication while we are getting fucked!
      </p>
      <p>
       They have done exactly this...and so far it has worked, despite fragments of resistance popping up across the country.  The real advantage the ruling elite have is their devotion to observing history's power struggle failures, and acting upon those failures.  Censorship of the internet will happen exactly the same way:
      </p>

       No way sites like reddit get shut down; or much of any site for that matter.  Reddit is just a program, one with publicly available source code everywhere, and there are computers everywhere.  It's enough to say that the US Congress simply doesn't have jurisdiction.  Beyond that, free speech benefits everyone; especially the corrupt politicians.

       fantastic response.

       We are free and sovereign beings. Just because the criminal and corrupt governments of the world write faulty ideas and treacherous thoughts down on paper and call them laws, does not make them any more real or authoritative or even truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time is fast approaching where Man will fully awaken to our place in the universe, where the small mind will no longer have any power over the awakened mind of Man who realizes his individual sovereignty.
