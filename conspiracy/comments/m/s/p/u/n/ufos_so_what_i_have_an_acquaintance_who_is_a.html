    <div class="md"><p>The same one/s. Why is that so hard to understand? If a creator exists and exists supernaturally, then it is the God of all in the natural realm. Having problems with mankind&#39;s various interpretations of religion doesn&#39;t necessitate the absence of a creator. God isn&#39;t negated just because our grip on the details is shaky. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither, I&#39;m sure. Don&#39;t worry though. Even if all Earthly religion washes away, we&#39;ll still kill each other for the real reasons we&#39;ve been doing it all along.

It&#39;s funny people who loathe religion so much can&#39;t see through the smokescreen of atheist dogma.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not going to engage furthur in a debate of this nature. I just thought your question was transparently provocative and stupid, so I wanted to point out that the answers are obvious and transcend your agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there&#39;s a mix of 95% extroverted liars and story-tellers out there exploiting this for money, and the real 5% which is buried under the garbage. Meier is a BS artist and demonstrated hoaxer.  If any story seems to sound like a compulsive liar is telling it in order to make money, it&#39;s probably BS.  Anyone handing out quasi-religious stories or New Age baloney is phony. And there&#39;s certain disinfo floating around specifically to throw the public off and cover our black projects.   But certain reports ring true (not all of them though).  The most credible one I&#39;ve ever seen is a book with an interview with an officer, that was transcribed at <a href="http://lunaticoutpost.com/Topic-AMERICA-Dulce-AFB-Insider-Interview-COMPLETE-will-take-an-hour-or-two-to-read">http://lunaticoutpost.com/Topic-AMERICA-Dulce-AFB-Insider-Interview-COMPLETE-will-take-an-hour-or-two-to-read</a>.  Certain parts of it are very credible, others leave big questions but don&#39;t seem to be lies, just missing needed details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only consider true those things I can confirm. I can&#39;t confirm these. I do know Thomas Costello lied quite a bit, but that doesn&#39;t disprove the items you identify. Some of what he said I judge very much a lie, based on my working in some of the areas concerned and his language is just wrong and clearly made up. No one in the fields would use the terms he did, his words were those of a storyteller without actual exposure to the reality. In other words, he was clearly a sociopathic liar trying to spin a credible story, but he made many mistakes doing so and tripped himself up, ruined his credibility for me.</p>

<p>What I do believe is that there are very complex situations behind the scenes, a lot of disinformation and distortions, but some of what&#39;s rumored is true.</p>

<p>I do accept the reality of cattle mutilations, but don&#39;t believe it&#39;s for nutrients. If you were underground and couldn&#39;t raise cattle there, and needed tissues for some research reason, mutilation expeditions to the surface make a little sense. For any kind of mass population nutrients, it doesn&#39;t make sense. I note that the Dulce region is the densest area in the US for cattle mutilations but these happen a few other places too. I&#39;ve seen very credible photos of human mutilation that happened in Brazil, matching exactly what is done to cattle. Obviously someone understands comparative anatomy and  has been doing same actions on cattle and humans: removal of eyeballs, tongue, rectum coring, and peculiar tissue sample operations not used by human medical or biological researchers. Plus we don&#39;t use laserlike tools for it, and one has to ask why the corpse&#39;s blood is mostly missing, A cult would probably merely use knives, not laser cauterizers, and why cauterize a corpse anyway. Doesn&#39;t make sense.  Analyst said the mutilated guy in Brazil was alive when he was cut up, though.</p>

<p>Google &quot;brazil human mutilation&quot; and look at the photos. That 1988 or 1994 one not done by animal or cult or military weapon.</p>

<p>Finally, I think the mutilations are done by machinery.  I suspect robotic and automated. Multiple case of internal organs removed through roughly 1-1/2&quot; perfect round holes, indicates consistent extraction action by machines. We are only now developing robotic surgical machines, for example now used for prostate operations through a tiny hole. Nobody had that technology in 1988 or before. Yet the 1988 Brazil guy had his organs removed through small perfect holes in his chest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah those stories are blatantly fictitious. However, I do believe there is a small percentage of stories which are true. Simply put, if you have mastered faster than light travel, what else is there other than to observe others? Life is unique wherever it is, that in itself is enough reason to come here. If you&#39;re an advanced race, you don&#39;t get there by ignoring sentient life - let alone any life. </p>

<p>On a slightly different note, I&#39;ve noticed a bunch of people who react to hearing that we used to consider ourselves the center of the universe by taking the same stance as retardican - which is to say &quot;[we are useless and ignorant.] We are not worth their time&quot;. Not attacking you dude, I just think when you make a mistake you shouldn&#39;t go and do the exact opposite. The golden mean is almost categorically  the safe place to be. </p>

<p>Yeah, right, there&#39;s no possible way that humanity hasn&#39;t already learned everything that there is to know about the potential for interstellar travel in the short 100 year period we&#39;ve recently undergone where we moved from horses pulling carts to airplanes burning fossil fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem, demonstrate your evidence. All you think of as &#39;evidence&#39; is of course mysteriously vague and almost but not quite available as evidence as defined in the real world, which would be something that normal people could see and touch. </p>

<p>Ever served on jury duty?  Give that some thought, if you have, everything you think of as evidence, in its entirety, would be instantly tossed out and never heard from again.</p>

<p>You have exactly, 100%, nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, more mysterious stuff!  That remains mysterious!  So it must be true.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are UFOs in the sense that things aren&#39;t identified in the air but that doesn&#39;t equal visitors from another star.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neither, I&#39;m sure. Don&#39;t worry though. Even if all Earthly religion washes away, we&#39;ll still kill each other for the real reasons we&#39;ve been doing it all along. Money, land, resources, control, and sex. At least it will clear up some misconceptions about using religion as a scapegoat to blame for war. It&#39;s funny people who loathe religion so much can&#39;t see through the smokescreen of atheist dogma.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m not going to engage furthur in a debate of this nature. I just thought your question was transparently provocative and stupid, so I wanted to point out that the answers are obvious and transcend your agenda.</p>
