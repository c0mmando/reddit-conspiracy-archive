    <div class="md"><p>Some advice to newcomers:</p>

<p>The best articles &quot;get caught in the spam filter&quot; .. and of those that don&#39;t, they are mercilessly downvoted, no matter how reputable the source is. Look at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/mrqh6/faster_than_a_speeding_bullet_and_bigger_than_a/">this</a>, a story from NPR about a UFO. 15 upvotes, 16 downvotes. Why would a conspiracy subreddit downvote something like that? So, keep watching <a href="/r/conspiracy/new">/r/conspiracy/new</a> and make sure you are looking at &#39;new&#39; and not &#39;rising&#39; ..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So when you type a title in the title field of a link submission that isn&#39;t true, is that suspicious? When you yourself admit that what you posted doesn&#39;t have any evidence yet you still make that claim in the link title to get people to click on it, I call that being suspicious. </p>

<p>I only see one type of suspiciousness being presented in your subreddit, and that&#39;s your own motives. I would think that someone trying to subvert OWS would have better tactics than your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On 9/11 the NORAD was conducting North Vigilance. A russian bomber over Northwestern airspace. Conspiracy theorists will claim that the drill diverted forces there, but there is no evidence of this. There was only 14 planes covering the entire United States, which was the normal number since about 1998, in which Bill Clinton reduced the number of airbases around the world to balance the budget. Today the number is still around 20ish, with response time being 10 minutes anywhere in the country as a direct result of 9/11 corrections. There are thousands of planes that can be readied in 24 hours if we need them, but there are only 20ish that are able to be flown at will. </p>

<p>On 9/11, it took about 30 seconds to switch over from exercise to real world. Conspiracy theorists try and claim that people asking about the possibility of this being a drill confused them, but there is no evidence that when the person said it wasn&#39;t a drill they were confused. In other words, when asked if it was a drill and they were told no is wasn&#39;t, they believed them. </p>

<p>Conspiracy therorists will try and claim that there were other exercises going on that day, but there is no evidence of this. Their claim that other NORAD operations had drills of planes crashing into buildings, but there is no evidence of this.</p>

<p>There was an exercise planned on 9/11 at the National Reconnaissance Office that involved a non-hijacked plane crashing into one of its buildings. Conspiracy theorists will claim this was to distract our spy satellites, but in fact, spy satellites aren&#39;t used to track planes. The exercise was canceled as real plane crashes started happening in New York. The people in the office weren&#39;t needed. Many were sent home to be with their family. Conspiracy theorists will try and lump this in with NORAD to convince you that it somehow affected the response time, rather then it being a safety drill as a result of being near an airport, in a completely unrelated area.</p>

<p>It has been said, that the drills on 9/11 actually expedited NORAD response because key people were already in position because of the drill.</p>

<p>If you examine the NORAD tapes, you will find that on 9/11, the FAA had to tell NORAD what planes were hijacked. NORAD had no independant way to know which were hijacked, and which were not. </p>

<p>NORAD had about 8 minutes warning before the FAA notified that flight 11 was hijacked and when it crashed into the WTC. The fighter planes were about to take off when this happened.</p>

<p>The planes took off, but were unsure of whet plane was hijacked as there were some 5000 plane in the air over the united states. </p>

<p>NORAD was told about a minute before Flight 175 crashed that it was also hijacked.</p>

<p>NORAD was not told of Flight 77 or Flight 93 being hijacked until after they were down.</p>

<p>The problem is the FAA was unaware of how many planes were hijacked. They had no plan dealing with this kind of attack and could not respond fast enough to notify NORAD.</p>

<p>The NY Times released the full NORAD tapes this year, so you can go and listen to the whole thing and see what NORAD knew when.</p>

<p>editing: my poor grammar, forgive me as I can not think and write coherently at the same time... lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What went on during 9/11 as I understood it. Was that the US Airforce were in the middle of simulated war games. That&#39;s why none of the planes were intercepted and shot down before they hit their targets. 
In London, they did have a simulation a year or so before the attacks. They simulated what would happen if &quot;terrorists&quot; were to blow up subway trains and a bus at the same time. Its nice that the law enforcement were prepared for that exact situation. </p>
