       I had the chance to talk to a friend of mine who just got back from a 1 year deployment in the single largest opium producing province of Afghanistan.  When he first arrived this time last year there was poppy growing EVERYWHERE, even in front of the local government offices.  A few months into the deployment they had a Law Enforcement liaison attached to them and opium production was officially declared illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that point he said production was forced "underground" and out of the public eye.  That also allowed the Marines and ANA to start seizing drugs and drug money.  My Marine friend recounted individual instances where they seized "black tar heroin" (raw opium paste) by the metric ton as well as Hashish and cash money.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I will ask the same question I always ask, does anyone have any proof that the US military (not the CIA) is currently involved in the opium trade?  I have been told at least twice here that it is "common knowledge" that the US government really runs drugs so this should be pretty easy to prove.

       Not to be rude but your just going to believe your Marine friend? That's equivalent to asking a cashier at McDonald's where the food comes from, they know because they see it come in a box but don't know because they don't know what those "cows" have been fed nor look like. Or ask an Apple salesman who makes the Ipad, does he know what employee did, no because he doesn't speak Mandarin. They don't know the entire game plan, that's essentially what I'm getting at.

       I'm talking to Marine NCO's based in a pretty specific region of the country.  A more apt analogy would be asking every McDonalds manager in the Northern Oklahoma area to find out who is delivering their food and at what time.

       It's a double-edge sword taking away the drug trade in Afghanistan, either you hurt the world's worst economy even more, or you support the trade of hard drugs.

       It is totally anecdotal, I have said that.  It does however make me very skeptical that the military is involved in cultivation.

       Veteran here. I wouldn't say they "run" the drugs, but during my deployments, a blind eye was definitely turned to the massive amounts of poppy that was being grown throughout the country. Think about it, this is a war for the hearts and minds of the people of Afghanistan. Either they side with us because we offer a better life or they side with the taliban because they offer a better life. If we disrupted their opium trade we'd be removing the only source of income for large populations of people in this country. It'd be similar to taking corn away from farmers in America. This is their livelihood. Any attempts to "stop the opium trade" by the us government is simply a dog and pony show for the media. In reality we must let them continue to support themselves in order for them to support our occupation.

       Where were you and in what year?  Only about a quarter of the country's landmass can be farmed at all so in the areas that can be farmed they are generally planted heavy.  The level of open production will really depend on the local government but I am getting a lot of reports like I mentioned in the OP, where they are cracking down on stuff out in the open.

       That is exactly my point, there is a large group here on r/cons who believes that you and your fellow service member are growing and distributing opium.  This is retarded on about a dozen levels, mostly because Alex Jones is supporting it.

       I mean I knew a few individuals that bought a few things, and shipped them home for a profit, but I never saw, first hand, a drug growing operation sponsored or run by US troops or anyone with American affiliation. As far as when, 2001-2004, and as far as where, If you were to draw a line from Herat to Jalalabad, everything south of there I probably visited.

       Which is the entire point of this post.  As a matter of policy the military of the United States is not producing, shipping or distributing Afghan heroin.

       So yes I agree. It's my opinion that the US government, in some shape or form, isn't "running" heroin out of Afghanistan. Do they "support" it, hell yes, lots of money to be made within the war on drugs and our prison systems.

       Who is making the money in that situation?  About the only people I can figure that truly profit are private prison shareholders.  True, the cops get more money and cooler toys for busting more "dangerous drug criminals" but it is not like they are personally getting more cash.

       Prisons are a business, and a profitable one at that. Plain and simple. 16 billion dollars is spent annually on the war on drugs. Money being spent means money is being received by someone. In turn those people on the receiving end of the 16 billion dollars contribute money back into the political systems to ensure their agenda is perpetuated. It's all part of our Huxleyan utopian ruse.

       Can you prove that "The military" was ever "dealing" drugs in the first place?  At best the policy was to leave the opium farmers alone and turn stockpiles over to local authorities.  That policy was there for a reason, not just because we like the way the flowers make the landscape look.

       That video doesn't prove anything. US troops have been present in opium fields in Afghanistan. That doesn't mean they're "guarding" opium production or involved in the opium trade. I imagine if Canada invaded the United States, we'd see Canadian soldiers standing in cornfields. That doesn't say anything about "guarding" corn, it just means that we grow a lot of corn.

       Right off the bat you can see that he has no understanding of the situation.  It is true that the Taliban did enforce a couple of 1 year bans on opium production while they were holding the only regions of the country that could grow poppy.  Why would they do this?  These bans coincide almost exactly with the lowest global prices for heroin in recent history.  During this time of extremely cheap opium paste the warlords would buy it by the ton and hide it in caves.  After taking 90% of the world's opium production offline for 12 months, supply and demand kicks in and the price skyrockets.  The various warlords would then sell their horded opium at the peak of the market and walk away with millions just based on speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The part about Pat Tillman writing letters home about them growing opium is a balled face lie.  After about 10 minutes of googling I found literally the only source to be Alex Jones and this video.  No copies of the letters, no one in his profoundly anti-military, anti-war family speaking up, nothing but Alex Jones' word.
      </p>
      <p>
       He keeps asserting that the US troops are "growing the opium" but I have yet to meet anyone who says that is what they did while there.  Why are there not pictures?  How about some kind of physical proof?  Without that these are just assertions and damned disrespectful ones from where I sit.
      </p>
      <p>
       See my above post about Karzai's brother.  He was a CIA informant and it was a public secret that he was involved in drugs.  That in and of itself does not prove that the CIA's policy was to produce opium.  To prove that you need more than just "they worked together on terrorism".
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy shit, the Geraldo video totally proves the man is full of shit.  Notice the soldiers are talking about WATCHING the opium be grown?  Didn't Alex just say they were doing it themselves?  Regular military have no mandate to pull up poppy and doing so would simply drive the locals into the hands of the Taliban.  Can you think of a better solution in that situation?  All that being said, the DEA has been sending teams in to do busts since 2001, why isn't Alex covering that?

       It is not the US actively growing poppies man...yeesh!
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are a military, and you choose to cut down all poppy production in one area, does that mean that the US stopped all poppy production in that country?  NO!
      </p>
      <p>
       The key is that the US chooses whom in what areas are to grow poppy unaffected by the military incursion.  Poppy production is the independent variable...no matter what, it will consistently continue where possible, because of the economic incentive (and its ability to fund Taliban).  The independent variable is the US' monopoly on violence throughout Afghanistan, and its ability to choose to wield its sword in this area, but not that area...
      </p>
      <p>
       It works exactly the same way in Mexico, which takes its orders on what groups its military actively pursues from the US (and don't tell me it doesn't when the US funds and arms the military and arms the cartels).  Don't you see that the real issue is the US providing the conditions for monopolies (in drugs, guns, you name it) to flourish?  The US and western govts' policies have been characterized as empowering one group over the other, because one group is much easier to control than many.  Think Saddam, Pinochet, the Shah, etc!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I BELIEVE the same applies in Afghanistan (I say I believe because proof is difficult to come by as Afghanistan is a journalistic dead zone with no rule of law or authority outside of large cities, which is not where poppy is grown).  One area is pursued, poppies are cut down and the cameras are flashing and the US appears to be doing a good deed; meanwhile there are vast areas in Afghanistan where poppies are allowed to grow, and who knows who controls these areas, and how the heroin gets into other markets when most supply routes are US CONTROLLED!
      </p>
      <p>
       We are here to ask questions on r/conspiracy...not write stupid articles like the originator of this post that are based on empiricism and the hearsay of one or a few soldiers.  In reality we will not find proof of this for a long time...but if we look at history it becomes clear that many speculations, like this one, were actually well founded and true.

       All I am asking for is proof.  If the US were as involved as people claim it is then why does everyone I talk to who has or is deployed can't remember anything about plowing poppy fields or helping load bags of opium paste onto planes bound for secret labs.  Why do the ones coming back from the  opium producing region talk about seizing drugs?

       It's hard not to act like a total asshole around these questions. Google "CIA drug plane crashes". The amount of proof out there is just absolutely LEGION. For instance, in 2004, a CIA private jet crashed with four tonnes of cocaine on board. The same plane had been used to ferry rendition suspects to secret prisons in Poland as well. I mean, a question like this doesn't ask for proof... it's literally ignoring TONNES of proof.

       How many private jets does the CIA own?  Most of the planes use in renditions were contracted out to companies like blackwater aviation.

      <p>
       I googled the story and all of the links said it was a jet that had once been contracted out to the CIA crashed with cocaine in it.  My only question would be if I crash a rental car in the woods that is filled with bales of cocaine, do the police come arrest you because you rented the same car in 2003?

       . If you think the CIA sits around with drug-laden jets that can be directly traced to Langley, VA, you're nuts. They don't. These are not like cars. The jets are "registered" and "owned" by "individuals" all over the place. There are
       <em>
        dozens
       </em>
       of these jets. They are all passed around like groupes backstage at a rock concert. Once you get used to operating above the law, the same morals that allow you to summarily execute a "terrorist" on one flight are exactly the same morals that allow you to smuggle 4 tons of cocaine the next. The gov't knows that drugs aren't as harmful as they make them out to be (they're not benign, of course). They know that "the dugs are going to be snorted up anyway," right? Might was well be us that profit and then use the cash for "just" causes, right? The war on drugs justifies anything. These people in charge of our government literally have no sense of when enough is enough.

       I get that you want to believe in your government. I get that, deep in all our hearts, you don't want to be a cynical rat bastard of a person. You deserve better, and each of us deserves better. But opening your eyes to the facts is not being cynical. Understanding that our government is utterly bankrupt and dedicating yourself to the change needed to bring it all back to being FOR the people is a purpose worth dedicating yourself to.

       Actually they have been unmasked a couple of times with open records requests.  I read a book called Top Secret America where there 2 authors tracked down the CIA black sites inside Europe and made a couple of government end their relationship with the CIA.

       The tail numbers are registered to companies, at least a few of which are legit to the point that they are suing the CIA for back pay.  Blackwater got most of the contracts dealing with black sites since their pilots were cleared to fly into and out of them.

        Suspicions of corruption in the Afghan government: When one of Afghanistan’s two vice presidents visited the United Arab Emirates last year, local authorities working with the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered that he was carrying $52 million in cash. With wry understatement, a cable from the American Embassy in Kabul called the money “a significant amount” that the official, Ahmed Zia Massoud, “was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the money’s origin or destination.” (Mr. Massoud denies taking any money out of Afghanistan.)

       The reality is that like drug production and distribution in the United States, it is not one singular agency that makes the drugs available or sells the drugs.  A big reason why the United States has been able to get away with providing heroin to its citizens is by making it a stepped process where the DEA/CIA/NSA play different active roles in making drugs like crack cocaine an heroin available to the ghettos of America and the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drug and money flows are much easier to control and potentially profit from when the agencies choose to allow one gang, or group access to the American market, while their competitors are pursued.  This makes it much more easy to control and skim money off the top.  Look into Michael Ruppert's work on the CIA/DEA making crack cocaine available to the ghettos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, one agency's intel and busts (DEA) represents opportunity for another agency (CIA).  Think of the DEA/NSA/Military as the intelligence gathering wings that establish the ground rules for the CIA to effectively channel drugs into various markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that, YES!, there are busts galore in Afghanistan, and they serve several purposes:
      </p>
      <p>
       -as I said, intelligence gathering on who the key players are and where things are being shipped and where the markets are
      </p>
      <p>
       -To give the illusion that the US is making Afghanistan a better place, cleaning up the opium trade.  But really, what we see being busted is a minute fraction of the 90 FREAKING PERCENT of the world's opium supply originating in Afghanistan
      </p>
      <p>
       ...and lets not forget that there are however many other countries deployed in Afghanistan that likely play a role as well (i.e. britain)

       Embedded journalism, which is the only form of on-the-ground journalism available to us from places like Afghanistan, is very much kept in check, and you should know this.  We do not have a clear picture of what happens on the ground, but we do have piles upon piles of proof that the CIA and military in, South America for example, made the American market available with safe passage to certain groups, and also made drugs available to the American people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use your critical thinking skills, rather than pronouncing an absence of proof you speak of, as proof itself...the US 'Carebears' are saving Afghan lives one hug at a time!
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if you look at Operation Northwoods, where the US government planned in excrutiating detail to carry out terrorist attacks on its own civilians to justify war, it raises the question...if they did it then, then who is to say they would not do it now.  It does not presuppose that the US carried out 9/11, but in light of Northwoods and many incidents like the Gulf of Tonken where war was started over a completely false attack, it certainly raises some serious questions about the state of world affairs today.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as your argument goes with the "hockey game", go fuck yourself if you can't discuss things without veiled insults on other peoples' intelligence.  The linear logic of yourself and the chap that posted: "I talked to a friend on duty in Afghanistan, so it must be the whole story" is just dumbfounding.  Empiricist idiots!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, asking me to provide you with a citation immediately confers legitimacy to your argument without you yourself providing proof to the contrary!  These are all questions we are asking on this conspiracy thread, don't you see?  We don't know for sure, but with all the historical proof of what our governments have done to maintain power in the past, you have to ask these questions and try to answer them, unless you are part of the problem...which it appears you are!
      </p>
      <p>
       WE HAVE NO CLUE WHAT GOES DOWN ON THE GROUND IN AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE IT IS A JOURNALISTIC DEADZONE AND A PLACE IN THE WORLD WHERE ANY RESEMBLANCE OF LAW HAS BEEN DISMANTLED.  The US and other governments have a wild west situation there, please tell me you don't deny this!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, please do not forget the Iran Contra scandal and the recent scandal with cartels being paid by Iran to kill the Suadi ambassador (which has so many frigging holes in it) when you try to suggest the US government does not have a hand in dealing with drug cartels when it is to their benefit!!!

       "any proof that the US military (not the CIA) is currently involved in the opium trade?" This is what the OP asked for. I responded with a total of three links in two responses. This is not good enough for the OP, he wants to be spoon fed something different than the very information he asked for. Personally I am tired of people that come to r/conspiracy demanding proof of something. What we have here with this OP is yet another case of a child that cannot admit when they are wrong.

       All I want is physical evidence and some semblance of a logical explanation.  Sorry, I have a little bit of background on Afghanistan and the heroin trade, it just means you have to research that much harder to prove it to me.

       what are you really after? to show people that they can't produce evidence? so what?  did you expect conscientious germans to provide evidence of crimes against humanity to the ones perpetrating it?  what would that get them?    really!

       Why is 90% of the world's opium grown there?  Only because it is possible, production has shifted away from the Golden Triangle region because China, India and Myanmar started cracking down.  Afghanistan is the furthest thing from being an ideal place to grow poppy, there just isn't any authority in many parts of the country that is willing to enforce the ban.

       By who?  If you hadn't noticed the US government is running a massive budget deficit and it is only projected to get bigger.  We are borrowing money from China to buy the equipment to keep troops in Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan has almost no oil, some natural gas and fairly hard to extract rare earth minerals.  The strongest political force in the country outside the US propped up government are a band of 14th century religious fundamentalist with ties to global jihadist movement.  I am not sure how much you know about drilling and mineral extraction in hostile regions but the US doesn't have a great history there.  This is the key reason why not a single US oil company even bid on Iraqi fields.

       You sound like a Fox News anchor.  Well known to people who frequent conspiracy sites maybe.  I do a lot of reading about the CIA and operations and I only ever hear accounts of individuals or small groups of people "going rogue".  Also, all those accounts take place in the 1970's and 1980's without any proof other than "everyone knows" that it still happens today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have proof that as a matter of policy the CIA distributes drugs today?  Also what drugs, produced where and consumed where?  The first sign someone has been parroting Alex Jones and not reading multiple sources is "America is in Afghanistan for the opium" since almost none of the opium produced in Afghanistan ends up on the streets of the US.

       No, neither you nor I would be privy to classified information, you're being intentionally obtuse. In 1998 Celerino Castillo, a top level DEA employee gave testimony before congress of "Widespread" trafficking being performed by the CIA.

       How much do you know about Afghan politics?  EVERYONE in a position of power is currently or has been involved in the opium trade.  Even the Taliban were would guard fields and escort convoys out of the country because before the US invasion it was the single most profitable business in the entire country.  I'll let you in on another secret, everyone currently or formerly in power in that country is either a war criminal or a pedophile.  Ahmed Shah Massoud, the man who Osama had killed on 9/9 and the single best hope for beating back the Taliban and uniting the country used to put prisoners in shipping containers and leave them in the desert to bake alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was no real secret that Ahmed Wali Karzai was involved in the drug trade and working with the CIA.  Again, this might come as a bit of a shock to you but the CIA will deal with terrorist, drug lords and criminals to get the access or information they want.  Proving that a man the CIA paid for information is involved in the opium trade doesn't in any way prove that the agency itself or the wider military is involved.  That is guilt by association, your friend is a drug dealer so we should lock you up since you spend lots of time with him and must deal drugs as well.

       really? these sources also backed up the claim to Iraqs WMDs. Your missing the point, the taliban did in fact ban opium and were on their way to eradicating it in Afghanistan and pockets of resistance namely the Northern Alliance and other warlords  kept up production. The Taliban or whatever they call the insurgency did take up production of Opium again to fund their insurgency.

       You have no idea what you are talking about.  The same people fighting with the Taliban were producing opium during the Soviet invasion.  Opium is the single most profitable plant that can be grown in Afghanistan, everyone did it.

       what? I never said the Mujahedin didn't grow opium, I said that the pre  american invasion Taliban governement that was finishing consolidating power throughout the country, banned and was destroying the opium trade. The only real pockets of production was the Northern Alliance. The current taliban does produce opium but the current taliban is not the same as the pre invasion one.

       How so?  They both pledge elegance to the same guy.  They both followed the Quetta Shura.  They don't have the resources or the reach by the structure is still there.  Seriously, read about the country and you will see that the pre-2001 Taliban had a minister of drugs who said it was perfectly acceptable to grow opium for export.

       according to audio interviews at the time, there was an agreement reached between taliban, northern alliance, and other warlords.  northern alliance was allowed to keep producing along with traditional tribal values - while opium production was outlawed generally elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       On sept. 9 2011, the northern alliance leader seems to have been assassinated.

       The CIA and military maybe were not directly involved but they let the Opium trade flourish and sold arms in Afghanistan to warlords. It started with the soviet invasion of Afghanistan were the CIA sold weapons to the Mujahedin who used their opium money to buy weapons. Then after the soviet retreat several factions fought  for control and guess what they used opium money to buy weapons. When the Taliban took control of the country they banned opium production and had reduced the crop significantly. After the US invaded production shot up and as long as you were a US friendly warlord, the military turned a blind eye. The taliban or whatever group claims to be it, have again started producing Opium to fund their insurgency and this is probably what the military is destroying, but as long as your friendly to the occupation they leave you alone. Fuck, the leader of Afghanistan brother is accused of major drug trafficking Ahmed Wali Karzai (an active CIA asset), and Abdul Rashid Dostum (a former CIA asset)

       It was within our strategic interest to let it flourish during the Cold War, almost none of the opium produced in Afghanistan makes it to America.

       A lot of that has to do with the total lack of a central government.  We destroyed the Taliban's infrastructure in a month or 2 and if no one is telling you that you can't plant the FAR more profitable plant, why wouldn't you?  What good would it have done the US to destroy all the poppy they encountered?

       Again I don't think you realize the level of corruption in Afghanistan.  Almost all the regional warlords have fought each other, fought along side each other, participated in some level of the drug trade (production, taxation, protection...) and committed what we in the West consider war crimes.  Wali Karzai was involved in the drug trade, there is no doubts there, shit they even killed him.  He was also a paid CIA informant and all those 2 pieces of information prove is that the CIA is willing to work with criminals (nothing new).  I am not saying it is impossible that the CIA was helping him move/grow/produce drugs but there is no proof that he was anything more than a paid informant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact, Dostum sent his Russian trained aircraft techs to the Taliban so they could use the old Air Force during their takeover of the country.

       Before the US went into Afghanistan, there was no opium trade. It had been abolished by the fanatical Muslim regime that gave a safe haven to Osama Bin Laden. After the US troops took over, they army began to protect the opium fields from terrorists. There is video of this. Production went from zero under the Muslims to 90% of world production under the Americans. That's a lot of money. Use your common sense -- do you really think American troops and American business wasn't skimming some of that opium money? Do you really think they stopped doing it?

       Again I will point out that the bans only lasted a year and just so happened to take place right at the very time the opium market was flooded.  You also might want to look into the pre-Taliban history of Afghanistan because the trade moved over the border from Pakistan in the late 70's.

       The implication is there if you have the right facts. That Karzai happened to have his brother(on cia payroll I believe) and top aid killed at the same time Petreyus was stepping out of Iraq and into a nifty cia gig makes me suspicious.

       Correct. Truth is truth even if you don't believe it. Truth is truth no matter how many convincing lies are told to cover it up. Truth is truth even if you personally have no evidence of it. Truth is truth, period.

       the truth is has absolutely nothing to do with what the truth

        actually

       is.

       How much do you know about Afghan politics?  EVERYONE in a position of power is currently or has been involved in the opium trade.  Even the Taliban were would guard fields and escort convoys out of the country because before the US invasion it was the single most profitable business in the entire country.  I'll let you in on another secret, everyone currently or formerly in power in that country is either a war criminal or a pedophile.  Ahmed Shah Massoud, the man who Osama had killed on 9/9 and the single best hope for beating back the Taliban and uniting the country used to put prisoners in shipping containers and leave them in the desert to bake alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was no real secret that Ahmed Wali Karzai was involved in the drug trade and working with the CIA.  Again, this might come as a bit of a shock to you but the CIA will deal with terrorist, drug lords and criminals to get the access or information they want.  Proving that a man the CIA paid for information is involved in the opium trade doesn't in any way prove that the agency itself or the wider military is involved.  That is guilt by association, your friend is a drug dealer so we should lock you up since you spend lots of time with him and must deal drugs as well.

       When did I ever say the Afghan government was perfect?  EVERYONE, fucking E-V-E-R-Y-O-N-E involved with the upper levels of Afghan government is corrupt.  The only thing I asked for here was proof that the US military was producing opium.  Big shock but no one has been able to deliver any physical evidence.

       really? these sources also backed up the claim to Iraqs WMDs. Your missing the point, the taliban did in fact ban opium and were on their way to eradicating it in Afghanistan and pockets of resistance namely the Northern Alliance and other warlords  kept up production. The Taliban or whatever they call the insurgency did take up production of Opium again to fund their insurgency.

       I'm the NSA east coast director of operations. Who are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, tell us please...if an NSA employee wants to communicate with an CIA employee...you think they need to go through a lawyer? Seriously?
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, I'm so sure that the lawyers are sitting there decoding all of the messages flying around the various networks.

       <strong>
        WHO is watching the lawyers?

       Really great logic there. Lawyers are involved, so everything's OK guys!
