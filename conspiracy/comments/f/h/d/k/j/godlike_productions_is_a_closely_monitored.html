       Many of you who traverse the "conspiracy" networks may know about GLP, and how ridiculous it is.   I never quite thought it was anything beyond innocent ignorance, until I tried to make this post which ultimately got me PERMANENTLY banned.   "Trinity" is a one of the main moderators who constantly and consistently makes posts fear-mongering against Muslims in a completely and overtly racist manner.   So I thought I'd test the waters to see if there was an agenda behind the blatant group-think thought-crime that was occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       After some research, I thought this post would be a reasonable criticism that would be seen by
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       at least.   But no, my IP was banned and the post removed.   Reading the post that got me banned, it becomes clear that there is something VERY amiss here.   Info-wars, Godlikeproductions and AboveTopSecret are concerted attempts to confuse and mislead the legitimate conspiracy discourse.    When you look at what they are deflecting
       <em>
        from
       </em>
       , it has become entirely obvious that we are justified in pointing our fingers toward Israel.  And I believe that r/conspiracy is one of the few places left that ANY sort of un-moderated and constructive progress can be made. (regardless of how convoluted with tards it is, it is not CENSORED).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my original post:
[in response to Islam being a death cult]
We all live under satanic death cults,
we all are victims of hate crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Israelis committed the 9/11 false flag under the pre-tense of starting a war on the Islamic faith (the main enemy of their harsh economic policies enforced by the IMF), and reap billions of profits in their AIPAC lobbies and private military contracts with the US.

       Such information has been EDITED and FILTERED out of GLP.   Being a conspiracy site, I find this behavior to be extremely
suspicious, especially considering the amount of crazy bullshit that I see on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much Islamic fear-mongering on here that it is QUITE obvious that this site is the product of a Ta-vi-stock
      </p>
      <p>
       Institute project under the wing of the Stan-ford Re-search institute.

       What's with the hyphens?   well those words have been BLOCKED by GLP because they expose exactly what this site is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychological warfare to dilute the legitimate intellectual discourse of very real conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further prove my point, this post will likely be [DELETED] by one of the mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trinity, your blatant islama-phobia is going to influence and affect many idealistic people in the completely wrong way.
      </p>
      <p>
       You all have been told the truth, and very few of you will ever live to see the day that it becomes public, because of
      </p>
      <p>
       experiments like GLP, that continue to muck up the search for truth much like Info-wars has.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is NO legitimate source for true conspiracy, except for personal and dignified research.  Follow the money, follow the
      </p>
      <p>
       actions, follow the political rhetoric maze and it will lead you to Zion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you are all happy taking the side of the betrayer in the name of justice.  I don't believe in hell, but I do believe in
      </p>
      <p>
       karma and it will be returned ten-fold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you start blindly accusing "violent" religions, maybe you should look at the ones with the RESOURCES and the MEANS to
      </p>
      <p>
       violently oppress people.  Let me tell you, it's not some poor ass Muslims in a cave.  It's the men behind the desks.

       I think it was part marketing ploy and part reputation management to feign some sort of "street cred" with conspiracy types, the vast majority of which were beginning to suspect that GLP was a government run psy op.

       It's more about social engineering and data-mining than anything else. I think they have a specific profile thing that they are looking for and when the community becomes too big, they purge with bannings so as to narrow the focus, etc.

       Pretty good info. I don't get it...I loathe GLP. Apparently something is up with it's owner. I think Jack Frost used to get you banned there as well...and their was ALOT of talk about "kittens" early on.

       Christian Zionist and Dispensationalists (Left Behind Crazies)  need the Jewish people to return to Israel and get nuked so Jesus can come back.
Where have you been?

       Yeah I just finished the documentary. Very good one, I like how Ryan Dawson is just an ordinary person who see's things for what they are. A very good piece he has put together without being racist or critical of Judaism. Personally I am an Atheist and don't believe in any of the religions and thats why its hard for me to tie all this into what is going on in the world today. I am not a UFO nut or anything but I like to decide for myself with the knowledge I gather daily. Have you read David Icke's article on Rothschild Zionism? He is a little extreme in some areas but is really fascinating to listen to and read his work. Here's a link...

       "The thing you have to understand is that people are easily manipulated and brainwashed and they do evil things because they feel justified doing them for the "greater cause.""
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess that is what I am having the most trouble understanding. What make's these people so evil, what do they believe in and why. But it must be that in there eyes they are not evil, they are doing this for the greater good of humanity as we are already overpopulated and in there eyes regressing the gene pool so to speak. Its hard to tie together everything but I definitely think this all points to Alex Jones being a Zionist agent put in position to raise fear among the people and misinformation.

       I got banned from GLP for posting the 4chan Information Librarys.  No warning, no prior conflicts with the mods, just banned.  That's when I figured that, that kind of place is not what I wanted to be a part of anyway.  But that shit's like crack.  On a slow news day I often still can't help but to peak on what going on there.
