        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://buildingwhat.org/">BuildingWhat.org</a> I enjoy a good conspiracy theory but I don&#39;t give them much credence because they usually come up short on facts and generally fall apart when brought into the light of science and physics.  Until tonight, I have never heard about Building 7.  Must say, I&#39;m very much agreeing with the site.  Read the site and judge for yourself, but that video looks very much like a controlled demolition to me.  I thought that about the main towers too, but you don&#39;t often see towers of that size demolished.  You can find many videos online of various demolitions of buildings about the size of 7 and it looks textbook to me. Felt it was worth sharing for any who haven&#39;t seen it.</p>

<p>Further, I would doubt, were this a real conspiracy, that it was solely our government or if our government was even involved.  Pure conjecture, but I would imagine bigger, invisible hands are at play.  I&#39;d be interested to see what happened to the overall world economy after this.  Or, say &quot;big nasty world order&quot; decided the U.S. had too much money and knew the only way to successfully drain our economy was to launch us into an unwinnable war, knowing that a war in Afghanistan was unwinnable as Russia learned a few decades ago.  So, they kill a number of civilians, strike at the heart of our financial system, and blame someone in the middle east, knowing they can eventually direct us to Afghanistan.  Again, conjecture I&#39;m just now coming up with. As I said, I like a good conspiracy theory.  I have also just played the 3rd Assassin&#39;s Creed, which may be contributing.</p>

<p>-edit- Furthermore, does anyone else find it odd that at the recent Arizona shooting, one of the victims happened to be a 9 year old girl that was born on 9/11? And if you wanna get really crazy about numbers, the shooting happened on 1/8/11.  1+8=9....9/11.  9 year old girl born on 9/11 killed on a date that, with minor number tweaking, becomes 9/11 (yes I know this is a bit of a stretch, but at at 3 a.m. you see weird connections) On top of that, she&#39;s a pretty little white girl.  Because you know how Americans work, sympathy wouldn&#39;t be all that strong if it was a non-white child.  Like when they talk about a missing child on the news, the child is almost always a white child. </p>

<p>What purpose does this serve?  Maybe to garner sympathy and cement this event in American&#39;s lives for a purpose yet unplayed.  Maybe it&#39;s about gun control, or mental illness. Maybe I&#39;m just trying to see connections because I&#39;m bored and it&#39;s late and I play too many video games.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well obviously on the numbers thing I am. Just a random thought. But I feel like Americans wouldn&#39;t care much about the shooting if there wasn&#39;t a pretty young face to plaster up on tv. And were some nefarious entity behind it all, they&#39;d know that would be the way to get people more invested in this event. That and her being born on 9/11 just seems a little too coincidental for me. <em>begins making tin foil hat</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well most Americans wouldn&#39;t care either way. The media on the other hand would treat a &quot;domestic terrorism&quot; event the same without regard to the details. It&#39;s not unfair to assume though that since the victims are (all?) Caucasian, it is all the more compelling. The only thing that I think would change the way it is reported would be if the murderer was a minority.</p>

<p>I grasp at straws, or connect the dots too. I just feel like it&#39;s important to choose which straws are actually worth sharing. Not that there is anything to lose here on Reddit. Which is why I subscribe to the Conspiracy section. Some shit is way-out-there crazy, but it&#39;s good to keep an open mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well,  I should specify. The media rarely latches onto missing or murdered child stories unless the child is white.  You very rarely see a black or hispanic child on Nancy Grace or one of those other shows that make a living off missing children.

<p>This is the problem the truthers have. It <em>looks</em> like it. You can compare videos all day, but that doesn&#39;t mean anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you realize what it takes to melt steel? Thats why they use it in buildings. So in the event of a fire it can maintain structural integrity. Moreso, allowing that fire could melt steel, it would cause the building to collapse in stages as the fire spread and in that direction, not all at once and in on itself.  For example, if a building has 4 main support columns, and you take out 2 on one side, the building is going to lean that way as it falls. The only way it falls straight down is taking out all 4 main supports at once and I dont think fire, even if it was hot enough to melt steel, is that organized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, you don&#39;t have to melt steel to cause it to not be able to support weight. That&#39;s why they put fire proofing material around the beams.</p>

<p>And again, just because YOU claim a building will lean in every case like the one you&#39;ve mentioned, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s actually fact.</p>

<p>The scientific method has not been followed with the controlled demolition theory yet, so everyone <em>should</em> be skeptical, if they were truly a critical thinker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m repeating something I agree with. Trust me, I was just as skeptical about truthers. Read some of the website I posted. I understand your skepticism and in the event no one has gone to such lengths as to recreate the incident in an experiment, that doesn&#39;t mean the physics don&#39;t still apply. I will do further research when I can and see what I can find. Be assured I am not just blindly following something I read. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes WTC 7 appears to be a demo job.   It&#39;s 2011 and you never heard one speck of wtc7 conspiracies?  Nearly 10 years it took you to learn/find out about that?   What an inquisitive mind you must possess. 
Now try to learn what was actually in WTC7 at the time it was pulled.....</p>

<p>And you should just remove the &quot;edit&quot;, because you can&#39;t just make up random acts of mathematics (8+1=9?) and attempt to derive causality based on it. It&#39;s worse than a straw man, it&#39;s...  wait. straw?  straw man? that&#39;s close to strawberry. Strawberries are grown in florida. Florida is where that terrorist trained to fly.  Fly? Flies were present in NYC at the time of the attacks.  NYC  hmmm NYC has odd initials, perhaps they really means  Now You Can (attack)?  LOL    stfu. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s kinda the point isn&#39;t it?  No one ever mentioned Building 7.  It fell in late afternoon and that day no one said a word about it.  </p>

<p>and as far as my edit, you don&#39;t have to agree, but you don&#39;t have to be an ass about it.  Causality and a connection are not the same thing.  I just thought it was interesting that the numbers added up.</p>
