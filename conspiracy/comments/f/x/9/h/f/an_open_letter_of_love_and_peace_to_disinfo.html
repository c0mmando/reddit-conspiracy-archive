       Any reasonable, balanced person can read your comment history and tell there is something up.  How long do you intend to keep on doing what you do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand you got to do what you got to do, and I forgive you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't you sense the shift yet?  Isn't it time to let go?  Whatever human happens to read this, whoever is really behind that screen with a soul, can you please consider letting up?  How long do you really think it will be before the truth rises to the top anyways?
      </p>
      <p>
       A lie can only be supported by another lie; The Truth simply is.  Imagine the beauty when Humanity finally comes back to the truth.  You can give that back to them.  We will forgive you, I promise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to thank you for what you do, because you have given those of us who are waking up to the truth meaning.  You are giving us meaning in our life so it is very easy to forgive you!  Honestly.  If there is any kind of "revolution" it will be a human revolution of love and peace, and it will be peaceful!  Just let go!  Let it all go.... there might be a couple bumps in the road but we are so close to freeing all of humanity....
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not all ignorant you know.  Some of us have managed to become educated while growing up very poor.  That is the amazing part of living in the year 2011!  There is really no need for this anymore.  We understand why things had to be hidden for a long time, we weren't educated enough to be ready.  But its starting to change.... Please, just let go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love what you do, and I forgive you.

       I say that there is certainly something weird about jcm267. I could not imagine a human being truly thinking that way and being able to hold down a regular life.

       Lots of flamey rhetoric.  I wouldn't use the term disinformation agent on this "person" I think disinformation troll is a better term.

       Right.  Mental disability , disinfo agent, Crazy asshole, theres a lot of possibilities.

       Maybe we should message him either way? :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Do not forget in all of the infinite possibilities, the most likely truth , is he is a human.  Soon they'll have bots doing this type of shit and then its game over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scratch that, they already have bots, but I doubt they are Watson Jeopardy level yet.  I think its time to start routing out the disinfo while we still can, I don't really care what the guy is.

       Since you're wondering things are going just great. I've recently gotten married, I was able to use my frequent flier status to jump ahead of some serious lines this morning, and I have some small business opportunities opening up in two countries. I'm not a "disinformation troll you idiot, I just like to laugh at conspiracy theorists who think everybody and every thing is out to get them. There isn't a person in the world who can stop me from doing what I want to do.

       I do truly have to agree with the original author of this topic, thank you. Without people repeating the same lies to the point of sounding ridiculous in their nonsensical repetition. To the point they even seem to "CLING" to those lies against simple explanations that make sense. And we "conspiracy truthers" would be just shouting empty remarks without the debate. While it may be informative, it does lack the 2 sided view that cause "questioners" to read on and view the links personally and discover the truth themselves and see how bad the lies are that are being spouted are. So in a way you are helping the truth by creating the argument to be shot down with truth and facts.

       We all have this information. The Internet is a great tool for chasing down facts. 10+ years ago a layman would never be able to educate himself like this without spending considerable time at libraries and such, which is just impractical for most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering how easy it is to find out the truth about things such as 9/11 in today's Internet age it's quite amazing that there are so many people who still believe in the insane 9/11 conspiracy theories like the "controlled demolition" theory. Oh well  :/

       Yes, we all know about the internetz. Not to burst your bubble but the internet is propagating the ideas your against. The internet isn't always making it easier for everyone to believe in exactly the truth. That's a bit more human nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I find quite amazing is that you are demonstrating such a low burden of proof for truth, such strong convictions about the issues, and most alarmingly such high confidence in government. For a skeptical mind 9/11 is not an easy subject to find out the exact truth about... That is unless you want to believe in whatever story you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note truly thinking anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic reveals a lunatic mentality far more than not completely believing in it. Just calling it like I sees it, friend.

       Give me a fucking break. I have never said that "anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic" you pathetic liar. The information about 9/11 is widely available. Much of it is in the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/dc9tk/about_911/">
        Official 9/11 Thread at Conspiratard
       </a>
       . Scientific studies and the like are available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection. The fact that there are people with Internet access and tons of free time who actually believe in this "inside job" nonsense is remarkable. It's like they simply prefer being on the "other" side of an issue for the sake of being against the "establishment", even if it means they are siding against the facts. It truly is remarkable that people like you exist, TheGrandMart.
      </p>
      <p>
       I implore you right now to side with the truth and not with the 9/11 Truth Movement.

       Really, pathetic liar... Pathetic insult from a desperate person; you've got nothing. Did I say you said "anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic", you hysterical little bitch? I'll answer for you because you'll just miss the point and say something off, no. If these are your best points don't bother responding. God knows I won't. You're spouting bullshit for lack of any argument at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, some people are anti-authority. They will believe the "other" side because it fits emotionally for whatever reason. But you have no idea what I believe. With that being a fact it's bizarre you could find it remarkable people like me exist when people like me isn't defined. Side with the truth or what? Nothing... It's irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time you say the information is widely available and no one has any reason to believe anything other than your story you're exposing yourself for what you are. I'll tell you again the information to the layman is not unequivocal, you pathetic liar. It never will be. Do you really think anybody falls for your stupid drivel? I doubt it. Believe what you want but even Bush and Ol' Rummy wouldn't respect you, you lack question and independent thought.

       The facts all show that the theories of the "Truthers" such as the "controlled demolition" theory are wrong. There is no refuting these facts so just stop pretending that you have a leg to stand on here. Now just admit that the truthers are wrong about 9/11 and post a retraction.

       HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ACTUALLY I DIDN'T!!!1! You pathetic liar. You have no shame sir. I was trying to get you to define your crazy views with some of that cult of 9/11 propaganda that I've seen you saying. Different tools for different venues huh? YOU'RE A REAL PIECE OF WORK TO BE ARGUING WITH PEOPLE LIKE A CONDESCENDING ASSHOLE ABOUT 9/11 AND TO NOT EVEN KNOW IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME TO WRITE THE PATRIOT ACT. IT WAS DRAFTED BEFORE 9/11 AS AN

       . That doesn't mean conspiracy. It doesn't necessarily mean anything. Your black and white thinking on these issues is absolutely remarkable.

      <p>
       I won't retract anything. I haven't said anything about my personal beliefs about 9/11. I won't say anybody is wrong. I will say your abilities are not adequate for your undertakings.

       Do you remember the Cole bombing? Could it be that even if some version of the Patriot Act was drafted before Bush took office that it was in response to the numerous worldwide terrorist attacks that had been practically ignored? One thing that really sticks out is that George W Bush says in "Decision Points" that his Administration had some other name for the "Patriot Act" but that Congress came up with the PATRIOT Act acronym and changed the name of it. Your version says "Patriot Act" right at the top so it's not the pre-Bush Administration draft that you seem to be trying to say that it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please show me the exact version of the Patriot Act that was submitted on Jan 3, 2001. This should be easy to find so go ahead and find it. I'd like to know what changes were made to the bill after 9/11. I bet the changes are numerous. This could be quite a fruitful discussion after all.

       I'll be waiting.

       You've got to be joking. You have repeatedly parroted that all the information is out there for anybody to see. A point I've made is that it is not all out there. For one having a skeptical mind, the information is not completely satisfactory, and is often a bit amiss for any number of reasons. Thank you for proving my point though. I appreciate it. Maybe you're not such a bad guy after all, conceding defeat like this. Well except for your nasty little habit of getting enjoyment out of antagonizing people who you say need help, and are mentally ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The information isn't out there to be relied upon about the exact origins of the PATRIOT ACT for the layman. I'm not doing research or answering questions like this for you, it's out there for anybody to find, so you can go ahead and find it for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be awaiting your exact and completely accurate findings.

       You are too much buddy. Calling me a liar again for no reason... Taking ownership? That's your idiotic assumption in addition you're trying to stretch all this into me being a liar again! Pure craziness! I said different things... meaning, I didn't say the same thing. When I could have clearly said one thing I said another. That should be an indicator for you that everything is not exactly the same. Instead of moving on after I correct you, you try to make some meaningless idiotic point out of it... a bit nutty.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point the entire time, while you've been spouting off drivel and grasping at anything you can, is that the information out there is not good enough to truly convince anybody of the complete official story unequivocally unless you really want to believe in it for whatever reason. Just like you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't bother responding to the proper comment? Yes I did. Forgive you for trying to have the same conversation with two different people although my point is entirely different?

       I deleted it because I missed the 3 minute window and do not like seeing that asterisk next to my comments. It leaves the window open for conspiratards such as yourself to accuse me of editing a comment after the fact. I went ahead and re-posted the comment but I messed up on the editing. Egg on my face!

       That's way too ridiculous, but good for a laugh. We have common ground here. Your admitting that you're a hypocrite, right? You already know you fit the definition of a liar. See, I'm only telling lies in that crazy teeny tiny little misshapen head of yours. If your "proof" is enough to truly convince you, no one should be trusting your judgement. I also feel sorry for you bothering like this. What your doing is obvious rationalization (Making excuses).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's move in for a closer look and recount your accusation. You want to hold me accountable for something I never said, but by association of one comment you declare me guilty and responsible. You declare that I am taking ownership (due to me laughing at your ignorance) of the exact details and point of what someone else said (even though I defined what I said differently in my same comment). There isn't any proof, buddy, just you being full of shit. The information was right there for you to see the difference, or ask (to avoid looking like a dumbass). You assumed and came out a dumbass. If you're not a bit nuts that would actually make you a liar; knowingly making up idiotic accusations. Or (back to crazy) maybe it's self delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't be right try, as hard as possible, to make yourself feel right, huh? Who am I kidding!? You probably believe deeply in your own bullshit. Possibly going so far as to be liberally smearing it under your nose regularly so you never have to know the difference. Everyone will always be wrong when you think they are, eh? You poor small small flaccid little man, jcm267.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's look at two of your idiotic outright lies:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Did I say you said "anybody who questions the official 9/11 story is anti-semitic" Actually you did.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Oh yeah?? "I've never mentioned a January 2001 draft EVER. " Here you go, liar: "YOU'RE A REAL PIECE OF WORK TO BE ARGUING WITH PEOPLE LIKE A CONDESCENDING ASSHOLE ABOUT 9/11 AND TO NOT EVEN KNOW IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME TO WRITE THE PATRIOT ACT. IT WAS DRAFTED BEFORE 9/11 AS AN ABSOLUTE FACT"
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Wait?!?! Whaaaa?!?! Where does it say January?!?! It doesn't!!! Ohh my Sweet Lord Jesus save me!!!!! You could have accepted my clarification for your benefit but you wanted to call me a liar instead. You chose to lose credibility. And you previously directly lied in the same manner! Why are you doing this to yourself?! It makes no sense. Are you going to start demanding information again? I refuse to argue it with you. Guess why...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait, you'll just fuck it up. I'll tell you. My point has been that the details about every facet of the events associated with 9/11 are not reliable or in some circumstances not even present. 10 years is not enough time for history to be reliable. How we understand 2001-present is still changing... You know because more information is coming out all the time... There are many different ideas concerning possible abuse and wrong doing that involve and use 9/11 (not just centered around it) that you don't know for certain what the fuck you're talking about when you claim all the information is out there for the layman to find. Especially not for you to be going around calling everyone crazy for not believeing exactly what you believe. There are some facts, but there is room for doubt. A sane person would admit there is doubt in a heartbeat, because a sane person doesn't believe himself to be omniscient. You can't bear to give an inch if you think you can get away with being a douche, even if you risk looking like an idiot (like right now), can you?

       Arrogance goes to the man (jcm267) who claims he knows it all, and thinks he has the 100% correct opinion.

       I already explained to you how you took ownership of the other idiot's position regarding the Patriot and thus should in good faith go and either provide a Jan 3 2001 copy of the Patriot Act or admit that you are wrong.

       You did say that I said that anyone who questions 9/11 is antisemitic.

       I don't care for you wall of text. You are a liar and are now resorting to useless distractions. Plus the suspicion that you might a crazy person who believes his own lies is growing in my mind.

       Did you have a point? I don't remember you having a point so I'll just post some facts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Neither you nor the other conspiratard who I've been arguing with in this thread have proven that the PATRIOT Act draft version, hosted by Answers.com, that has been posted to this thread does not contain a forged date. I have reason to believe the date is forged, as explained in detail throughout this thread.
       </li>
       <li>
        9/11 was carried out by Muslim terrorists with boxcutters and there is no reason to believe that the US government was involved or had sufficient knowledge of the plot to stop it
       </li>
       <li>
        There was no "controlled demolition" at the World Trade Center on 9/11. There were controlled demolitions in the days following 9/11, when they "pulled" some severely damaged buildings to the ground with cables
       </li>
       <li>
        Silverstein's "pull" term was referring to rescue teams, not a controlled demolition
       </li>
       <li>
        There was no stand-down order issued
       </li>
       <li>
        An airplane did in fact crash into the Pentagon
       </li>

       Yeah, see above for a clearly defined point. You should be able to spot it because it usually follows "my point is." Seeing as how your don't read replies and often can't remember them the rest of your reply isn't worth paying attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did read the rest but I don't see what your saying or where your coming from so maybe I should leave some bullet points about making an omelet.

       well it is important to tell people how Bin Laden was able to
       <strong>
        order
       </strong>
       NORAD to stand down, and how he
       <strong>
        forced
       </strong>
       the FAA to change regulations about hijackings the week before 9/11. Or how he forced Bush to draw up the Patriot act 6 months
       <strong>
        Before
       </strong>
       9/11, and how he
       <strong>
        Forced
       </strong>
       Chenney into a bunker and
       <strong>
        made
       </strong>
       him REFUSE to evacuate the Pentagon before the impact. Especially since most people did not know Bin Laden had that much power in this country ... I'll let you continue the truth here, oh.. bring up how Bin Laden's family was in Washington D.C. watching 9/11 unfold. Or how Bin Ladens #3 man had dinner at the pentagon a year after 9/11. Or how
       <strong>
        All

       the rebuilding plans started with the removal of "building 7" so it
       <em>

         Please provide a link about this FAA regulation change and explain why it's relevant. The box cutters were legal and the long standing policy had been for those on board to not engage with terrorists. They turned off the transponders, making it hard to impossible to track down. Again, explanation needed here.

         bin Laden's family is a very big one and they are not proud of him. Why, if this was a carefully planned "inside job", would they choose a wealthy Saudi national whose relatives have ties to the US to be the scape goat? Why would they allow the Saudis to be on US soil during the attack? Why not use someone from Iraq or Afghanistan? Do you
         <em>

         tells me that it was none other than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who was the "number 3 guy" at the time. Look at his history. From the Wikipedia entry on KSM:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed">
          <em>
           "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was secretly indicted on terrorism charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in January 1996 for his alleged involvement in Operation Bojinka, and was subsequently placed on the October 10, 2001, initial list of the FBI's twenty-two Most Wanted Terrorists."
          </em>
         </a>
         . Your theory is getting dumber by the minute. He was indicted in 1996 but was having dinner at the Pentagon in 2002, one year before he was captured and sent to Gitmo? Man, you're dumb!

       The only thing you posted that made me do a double take was the Patriot Act thing. But it's bullshit. First off the Bush Administration hadn't even taken power. How many people are involved in this little conspiracy of yours? From your source:

       I reiterate everything I said. In some of these responses you have demonstrated that you lack some basic reading comprehension abilities so it's no wonder you're a truther. You don't like facts but the facts are facts. I refer you to the official 9/11 thread in conspiratard. Your idiocy isn't worth my time.

No amount of investigations will change the irrefutable fact that Muslim Terrorists -- and not Bush or Silverstein or Mossad -- were responsible for 9/11.

       btw your precious "keep me safe from freedom" un-patriot act defines you as a terrorist also, thats why it was important enough to kill a few thousand on 9/11 to be sure it passes.

       appeared done less then a month later, get real you arent
       <strong>
        that

       stupid are you, to
       <strong>
        believe
       </strong>
       that our (moves at a worthless pace) government came up with that

        Lengthy
       </strong>

       if you believe that its no wonder why you argue with irrationalities instead of credible evidence, wiki is about the most trusted independent site you will find, unless your an "I am a sheeple I

       I think you must have been skipping
       <strong>
        your
       </strong>
       medications again, skippy. Where is this
       <strong>
        draft
       </strong>
       ? I've been talking to two
       <strong>
        conspiratards
       </strong>
       in this thread and I'm losing track of who is who. I know that
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       of you guys has a habit of replying to me with a comment that is in the context of what I was talking to the
       <strong>
        other
       </strong>
       conspiratard about. So please forgive me if I've
       <strong>
        already
       </strong>
       asked this of you, but could you please post
       <strong>
        the
       </strong>
       original draft? I would
       <strong>
        like
       </strong>
       to know what revisions were made to the bill was apparently put on Congressional record
       <strong>
        before
       </strong>
       Bush was even inaugurated. Would you like to
       <strong>
        have
       </strong>
       a serious discussion or are you just interested in continuing to post idiotic replies to my comments?

      <p>
       According to George W. Bush in
       <em>
        "Decision Points"
       </em>
       the name "PATRIOT Act" was conjured up by Congress and that his Administration had some other name for it until Congress changed it. How can we be so sure that this have been the original text from before Bush took office when it has the name that Congress gave to it after Bush was already President (see section 1, part a)?

       the link I gave is a credible source or they would have removed it, .. yes EXACTLY the wording IS pretty much the same, the govt is good at hiding these sources so as time goes on they become more scarce and I am VERY surprised that as informed you pretend to be you never heard of this fact ... since you are so behind here is another fact that has become difficult to prove but 4 years ago was a simple search (did it myself) on the FBI's own site, but most record of it has been altered: Fact up until 2006ish I personally looked around 2004 and Bin Laden was NOT on the FBI's most wanted list, he was wanted for questioning, but could NOT be put on the list without some evidence to his involvement to 9/11. But like I said around 2006 without introduction of new evidence he was put on the list, because it WAS a well known fact he wasnt on the list, and they slowly forced out the sites that showed this fact. But hey if you trust this government with your family have at it. Trust ONLY what they tell you and let me know how that works for the ones you love

       Who is "they"? Answers.com? Really? Answers.com is not a remotely credible source.

      <p>
       bin Laden wasn't put on the FBI's Most Wanted list for 9/11 because this is not a criminal matter. George Bush rightly chose to treat 9/11 as an act of war.

      <p>
       You really need to stop being so wrong about everything. It's pathetic. The whole government isn't out to get you and that's what you're making this out to be. And yes it would take pretty much the whole government's involvement including folks in Congresss like Ron Paul to cover up this whole idea of yours that there was a version of the Patriot Act from before Bush was even President that is WORD FOR WORD the same thing as the final bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now please post a
       <strong>
        credible
       </strong>
       source to support your claim.

       wow you are fixated on the ONLY thing that I did not know that the evidence of has been removed for, (I did mention Kudo's to you and your teammates for being thorough) It does seem you knew full well that all those links were removed, but you guys forgot to post the retractions which is mandated, but since it was like the Pentagon video camera footage and classified "National Security" they couldnt retract it because it would prove the article existed. Like I said you'll need to know this for promotions, its easier to keep a lie if you dont acknowledge its existence. A retraction would have proven it did exist. And I PERSONALLY saw those documents about 6 years ago.

       to stop this group, but they have chipped away at it soo much they can now steal trillions quadrillions and there is little we can do to save ourselves from their tyranny, and your trying to help them will not work. "Those who give up personal liberties for temporary security deserve neither" ~Ben Franklin he knew how these crooks worked they stopped them, but ever since 1779 they have been working on this for their childrens children ... they dont think like you do. They have taught you to think about
       <strong>
        Your

       retirement, and not your kids, or theirs. The rich do, they plan and plan and plan, strategies covert deception. Then when they take complete control to wipe out terrorists. ANY infraction can be used to declare YOU a terrorist. &lt;---Is why 9/11 HAD to happen for them. No not 2,000 Afghan people. Well good luck, I give up on finding anything but threads with deleted links for the "Original" date of this miraculously contrived 4000 page law that was written miraculously fast and thorough, in 3 weeks (sure there is an easter bunny relax)

       Funny you say "al qaeda didn't exist before 9/11". I was able to accurately guess who did this the very moment the 2nd plane hit the WTC.

       You know someone is allowed to have a different opinion than you and not be a "disinfo agent".....right? I don't see what good it does you to label those with differing opinions as disinformation agents. If anything, it makes you look absurdly paranoid. Ultimately, you just come off sounding condescending in this letter you wrote.

       And you are right no hate; a disinfo agent is just a human, whoever is at the top of that pyramid is just a human unless you want to believe some theories that do absolutely nothing to empower you.  Whoever is behind all this corruption, they are just a human or a group of humans in the end.

       forgive the neocons too  man.  i mean obviously let the truth be known.  speak the truth endlessy.  but forgive them.
      </p>
      <p>
       honestly, i suspect the key to beating these "devils" we have built up is to forgive them.  they will get theres completely on its own simply but speaking the truth over and over and allowing freedom to exist in all things, including freedom in debate, and dare i say, freedom to manipulate people into your point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       people need to wake up, manipulation is a variable in the universe as constant as gravity.  its not a paranoid statement its the facts of life.  i cant even tell you i love you without the contradiction coming out the other side that i'm trying to control you in a way with that love.
      </p>
      <p>
       even in freedom there is contradictions.  maybe we are about to learn a new nuance to the word "freedom".
      </p>
      <p>
       and just to clarify, i'm not a christian.  i'm an agnostic.  believe nothing.  keep your mind fresh.  keep your mind growing.
      </p>
      <p>
       a lie is only supported by a lie.  the truth simply is.  we have never needed anything other than to find the truth.  thats it.
      </p>
      <p>
       could the biggest game of all be to turn the concept of forgiveness into a dogmatic bullshit superstious religion?  its never been about religion its never been about christ, the dude doesnt even need to exist. its about truth its about love thats it.
      </p>
      <p>
       we dont even know what exists anyway if you are real with yourself and that ain't some existentialism.  be real with yourself.

       I've also been agnostic a large part of my life. Then some heavy shit went down, and now I'm a gnostic christian (which is nothing but a fancy word for born again.) Although our understanding is not the same. Jesus is not my savior. It means I understand his words. I am he as he is me. His father is my father (as well as yours). Only one God my friend, and it looks like you are well on your way to fully understanding him.

       thank you for revealing more about your personal belief system.  i will be opening up to you soon too, as long as i can be confident it is time to push the message to that point.  reddit cannot be compromised, the timing must be right.
      </p>
      <p>
       we all have a personal belief system in addition to the one that we face the world with.  those of us who are awake know that we can't just go out telling people what we believe lest we want to have no ability to share in

       The most poetic of questions, free will.  I've always believed in it as a useful belief system as it empowers but again obviously it is just another contradiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I using it?  Have I ever been?  My life is so miraculous.  How could I tell who's will this really was?  It has been a revealed mystery.  It has been beautiful.  Free will is probably the last illusion to go.  I feel it slipping.  I am also ready to serve but I don't know what I'm serving other than a few abstract concepts of Truth and Goodness...and intuition.  These concepts seem good enough to get the universe this far, I'm willing to serve them into infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really ought not to have allowed myself to feel so good and become so manic that I start screwing up my grammar and etc.  But its Day 1.5 of no sleep.  Ah well, I have tested those limits before and I am not pushing them any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid to ask because all of my truth will now be colored with a belief and many will tune out, but I feel I have written my story here.  This has been a heck of a day of posts.  But I need some help getting to bed so I don't push this good feeling a bit too far into a state of mania and become a Charlie Sheen without the drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you mind praying for me?  I'm willing to believe it will make a difference.  I just need some sleep right now, badly.

       Actually, among other things, I point to peer-reviewed papers that refute the idiotic theories of the truthers. Always remember that the 9/11 Truthers have had 10 years and to date have not managed to get a single paper through the rigors of peer review. They are trying to prove their preconceived notions to be true, while the scientists such as Dr Seffen from Cambridge stick to reality.

       Modify it for your own use.  This is just how I personally feel.  Remove whatever part you feel is too much hippy bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have studied Alchemy, Taoism, Zen Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism.  I have concluded the key to healing your own mind is to merge the two opposite concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As rational as you believe you might be, there is a part of your psyche that is absurdly irrational, and if you don't believe me, check your dreams for an example.  You can either work to program it or leave the programming of it to chance.  I have actively redefined all symbols and semantics in my  mind to pick the belief system I think most usefully serves me.  I have concluded the  most useful belief would be to respect the "devil", the "dark side" if you will, but not to identify with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the most useful belief would be to try to heal the concept of "Devil" by loving and forgiving it.  Note the difference between love and worship.  In no way should you worship the dark side, only love it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't think of loving it in a romantic sense ; think of loving it as a mother loves its terrible black sheep child in its large human family.  Even Charles Manson had a mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have chosen to believe we are all part of one big human family more or less.  It seems to be the belief system that most serves me.  Don't listen to my preachy hippy shit, find the belief system that you think most serves you.  You might want to think long and hard first on what the most useful defintion of "you" is first, or from your first person point of view, "I".
      </p>
      <p>
       Define - "Who Am I"
then define the rest of your beliefs
      </p>
      <p>
       And you will have programmed your mind as if it were a computer.  Your mind is already programmed, whether you like it or not, it has to be to have some parameters to work within.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mind is programmed as well.  I am not some sort of savior or cult figure.  I have just worked hard at actively consciously defining my belief system.  I am quite sure I still have some glitches of my own, but this current message of peace and love resonates strongly right now in march of 2011 for me.

       <em>
        In developmental psychology - particularly analytical psychology - individuation is the process through which a person becomes his/her 'true self'. Hence it is the process whereby the innate elements of personality; the different experiences of a person's life and the different aspects and components of the immature psyche become integrated over time into a well-functioning whole. Individuation might thus be summarised as the stabilizing of the personality.

       i will read them again later but i think you are mistaking my hippie mask with who I actually am.
      </p>
      <p>
       that is just one mask i  put on .  i can easily put on the paranoid mask and see what you are saying is true.  it is, i have studied political theory decently well in an academic sense AND have studied it extensively in a paranoid sense.  i can contrast both views to each other and you are absolutely right about slicing and dicing up people into about 3 distinct categories of how they are going to view these escalating revolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       let me ask you, since i am capable of seeing shit your way, you care to try my view on for size , just for a second, even if its not "true"?  just imagine it like you would a unicorn or dragon or something man, and see how it feels.  you dont have to believe any of it, my view isnt true, its just some idealistic shit one can achieve if they choose to.  maybe you dont think my philosophy is useful but the way im' feeling today...it feels pretty damn useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       you are more than welcome to your paranoid view if you feel it serves you.  no doubt we are going to need some paranoid people to get us through these upcoming times.  all i'm suggesting is, ask yourself is that view really serving you?  is it empowering you?  ultimately theres certain things we havent been able to empower ourselves with, namely, ive never met anybody who can survive death yet.  so i dont believe anyone who tries to sell me a solution.  and i'm tired of fear, theres no point.
      </p>
      <p>
       when i finally go to bed i will come back much sharper.  still riding this positive energy right now.

       by the way, your instruction to tell me to stop making noise is indicating a desire towards one directional communication, also known as a closed network....and all closed networks lead to entropy and entropy leads to death.

       you are there dude.  i wonder how many are awake and building their symbols?
      </p>
      <p>
       if you are open to it, here is my advice to encourage more to start doing it
      </p>
      <p>
       keep doing what you do with interjecting things like
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       circuit and then
      </p>
      <p>
       "no seriously"
      </p>
      <p>
       right....predict their reaction then quickly plant the proper response
      </p>
      <p>
       but then let them know you are doing it as you are doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you use NLP / this type of hypnotic technique when talking to people, you will open them up more and more to the fact that you are in fact manipulating them and then they will in turn trust you more and more.  the problem with a of these NLP magicians of which i have gotten the sense that you are one (forgive me if came to this conclusion irrationally, i was on 2 days no sleep yesterday, finally got some sleep!) , the problem is too often they do not tell the patient that they are implanting new ideas.

       as for your idea of trying to steer me away from going to a place where entropy exists in reverse, i think that is a fascinating perspective on it and i suspect it is true.  but i don't see how that is "bad" , i think it is a world where the same games have to be played so i'm sure it is "bad" in some sense but it is also most likely beautiful in many senses.....

       at any rate, since the only belief i have chosen to take on is truth;  i know that arriving at
       <em>

        if you use NLP / this type of hypnotic technique when talking to people, you will open them up more and more to the fact that you are in fact manipulating them and then they will in turn trust you more and more. the problem with a of these NLP magicians of which i have gotten the sense that you are one (forgive me if came to this conclusion irrationally, i was on 2 days no sleep yesterday, finally got some sleep!) , the problem is too often they do not tell the patient that they are implanting new ideas.

       you seem to have misunderstood. There is an elaborate trap laid by the world for people like you and I. It leads to death. There's only one way out of it, which you have said relies on one-dimensional communication and instantiates a closed loop. My response is that
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       loop, in particular, is open, because the one-dimensional pathway leads to a place where entropy, as it turns out, is backwards. Infinity. Not in some abstract, conceptual sense, either, but
       <em>
        literally.
       </em>
       Heaven. Far beyond this plane. I am an advocate of this particular one-dimensional pathway.

       by the way your use of "no , seriously" is transparent manipulation.  at least tell me when you are doing that.  if your point were to rest on the truth, why cant you speak of the contradiction more often?

       also entropy existing in reverse.... i guess that means i would be God and i would get to devolve back to nothing?  sounds pretty interesting to me.

       if truth wasnt such a challenge to find it would be easier to fall for your manipulation.  what type of backwards game makes the biggest goal punish you?  i know a good game when i play one and so do the redditors.  people will wake up.  get the fuck out of here with your fear.

       I got flamed on their forum because Google blocked Infowars/Prisonplanet content from their News aggregator, in response to the "Google bombs", and I said it was a foreseeable consequence for gaming the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they aren't getting any new exposure from the "Google bombs." According to Alexa, traffic has not increased any faster since they started.  No normal person knows Google Trends even exists, while at the same time millions of people are using Google News, where Infowars content has been removed... in response to gaming Google Trends.  It's ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst.

       engage and outwit him, or ignore him. If you get emotionally invested in your argument you will lose.

       edit: it makes no difference if someone is a "shill" or a paid disinfo agent - if your arguments have merit and are supported by facts, the motivations of the person you are debating are irrelevant.

       I think it is time for reddit to eliminate the downvote. More and more any leftist link I post goes nowhere because it gets an immediate 5 downvotes. And not weird articles. Just things from Nation or Alternet.

       So what a person believes about you being a troll or 9/11 defines how much better or worse you are than another person? That's just fucking stupid. By extension you are a fucking idiot. That's what this shit is about for you losers anyway. I doubt it has anything truly to do with 9/11. Too bad you're too inadequate to see how much of an asshole doing this shit makes you. You've never met the people you claim to be superior to and they haven't met you to verify anything. Blah blah blah I can go on and on but it's a waste of time for both of us even if you can't see that. You like to pick on people like this? That makes you inferior not superior.
