    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. It seems more of a domino effect. Each successful revolution proves to the next they might have a chance.</p>

<p>The first recent one in Tunisia was relatively peaceful. The next, in Egypt was harder and received a more violent response from the government. This in turn was followed by Libya, where the army it&#39;s self was/is deployed against the people.</p>

<p>Each revolution is harder to achieve, but the people involved draw couragefrom what those in similar, but less dangerous revolutions managed to do.</p>

<p>Combined with this is the effect of the global media spotlight. It creates almost a feedback loop providing the people on the ground with inflammation about how well they are doing. The global media can only really cover 1 revolution effectively at a time though, creating a stronger apparent domino effect </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is the media limited to covering only one at a time? I thought this at first too but if you think of the global media structure (or lack thereof) then by its very nature it should be able to handle multiple situations that could have global economic and humanitarian impact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Viewer attention focus. </p>

<p>One riot in a Middle Eastern country looks a lot like another, at least to Americans and Europeans. Jumping between different countries would confuse the average viewer. Particularly if the protests are not directly linked (e.g. one is peaceful with local police backing, another is not, with the army moving in.).</p>

<p>Also, most news organisations only have limited research and analytical capabilities. As well as a limited number of reporters for a given region. Most prefer to focus themselves on one &#39;event&#39; to get the &#39;in depth&#39; view.</p>

<p>While different news agencies could cover different events. The large cross-flow of information between them (formal, informal and plain old plagiarism) means that they get the &#39;best&#39; coverage is they focus where everyone else is focused. Otherwise they risk being marginalised by viewers wanting more info on the &#39;main event&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could see how this would be a valid argument. But the wonder of the internet is that the fringe can become the &#39;main event&#39; very quickly. But I also see how the &#39;herd&#39; can be led to the same place because it&#39;s trendy (for the day). The only other argument about this is that social media sites have the ability to break away from these main stream lines of thought.  It&#39;s the direct voice of thousands that should be roaring louder than any main stream media outlet.</p>

<p>I am thankful that Al Jazeera is there and becoming more and more of a factor (at least in the US) in leading the herd. The more alternatives we have to the multi-national corporately produced news the better off we will be in the long run.</p>

<p>Again, thanks for the insight cynar.</p>

<p>this shit was a long time coming. the only moderate tie to anything that could come close to approaching a conspiracy is the role of putin in banning russian grain exports for 4 months last year after the huge russian wildfires, which is more pragmatic (and nationalistically douchey) than outright conspiratorial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These threads have been on conspiracy just about every day this week and it really just shows how paranoid and misguided <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is.  Instead of celebrating the power of the people to OVERTHROW REPRESSIVE AND CORRUPT DICTATORS WHO HAVE BEEN IN POWER FOR DECADES, conspiracy seems to be looking at a gift horse in the mouth trying to look under every insignificant rock to find some sort of evidence that the USA is up to some shady dealings and creating all this for some cynical reason.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> needs to take a step back and reflect on the situation, the USA has done many things but the USA is not behind everything that goes on in the world.  Maybe you guys should be spending more time promoting the cause of freedom in these countries instead of just trying to ham up even more sensationalist fear mongering</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to forget that Mubarak was our ally and important to the stability of the region.  We invested heavily in arming and training his army, he was a key ally in the region to secure the Suez canal that is vital to global trade, he was the only arab leader to officially sign a peace agreement with Isreal, and it received the second most aid from the USA in the region behind Isreal.  Mubarak was OUR man, we did not want to see him go and for most of the time we were fumbling with trying to deal with the situation.  Egypt is often seen as the heart of the Arab world and its influence matters to the rest of the region and when Mubarak fell, it created shock waves through the region.  It is willfully naive to believe that we actually wanted to promote such instability in the region especially when it comes to autocrats/dictators that we have supported</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. It&#39;s the phenomenon of repressed people seeing that their neighbors were able to topple their own dictators. It&#39;s merely that they no longer fear the dictatorship they were living under and willing to put their lives on the line for a change.

    <div class="md"><p>Know what you speak of before you speak. Yes, you are entitled to your opinion...but opinions are not what matter here. </p>

<p>With the release of the Wikileaks document about American aspects of the revolution, even the people in Egypt suspect American influence. That is not saying that Mubarak wasn&#39;t a dictator or that his regime didn&#39;t deserve to fall. That is also not taking away from the actions the protesters have taken to try and create better for their country.  Just saying that if even with all of the injustice they have lived and worked hard to correct, even they see the silent American hand involved and are afraid of what might come next. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that is true, it could well be OPEC, or some other organization. I wouldn&#39;t put it past OPEC - who basically are 50% responsible for the Iraq war.. As for countries being interested in their own well being, I was suggesting the complete opposite - just look at all the US&#39; meddling in foreign policy in the last 50 years. None of it has been in the US &quot;public interest&quot;, and 99% of it has been in the interests of corporations or the military-industrial complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point there is not much of any doubt in my mind that we have a hidden hand / agenda here. It can&#39;t be a coincidence that Libya has the largest oil reserves in Africa and we are going to invade them. The media is making Gaddafhi out to be a monster and I honestly can&#39;t see someone mass murdering his people in the way they say that he is. If he is then he needs to die immediately but I just don&#39;t feel like that is the case. Its the NWO&#39;s agenda for a &quot;New Middle East&quot; and it starts with Islamic / Palestinian powerhouses such as Egypt / Libya... Iran will be the final piece of the puzzle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, correct, they are <em>absolutely</em> being coordinated, and the information suggesting they are being coordinated becoming accessible, in itself, is <em>also</em> being coordinated.</p>

<p>if you are lacking in meta-consciousness, if you are lacking in the ability to conceptualize hierarchical data structures easily, you probably <em>won&#39;t</em> understand this in any depth, and should instead <em>trust nothing.</em> It is highly, highly unsafe; this information warfare is <em>very</em> sophisticated and <em>will</em> outmatch you.

    <div class="md"><p>i know this is the conspiracy subreddit and all, but i&#39;m in my 3rd upper-level college course about the middle eastern history with the current one focusing on relatively recent events. if you think this has more to do with NWO-plotting than people finally getting pissed enough to do something, you&#39;re an ill-informed nutjob. sorry to throw that around, i&#39;ve been called a nutjob a few too many times, but i can&#39;t sit by and let people circlejerk to the idea that the bankers are MUCH more powerful than they are. </p>

<p>have you all not entertained the idea that the perception of the shadow governments of the world as being all-knowing, all-powerful, all-controlling, and all-coordinating with no coincidence or accidental occurrences allowed just plays right into their gameplan of keeping people scared and ineffective? that convincing you that when someone rises up against their bullshit, they&#39;re actually the ones who caused it and therefore you&#39;re better off fighting against it? </p>

<p>seriously, you totally bought their PR campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said a damn thing about bankers. No straw men, please.</p>

<p>have I not entertained the idea? <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/cr4mm/any_of_you_kids_ever_thought_that_the_big_scary/c0umcn8">Of course I have.</a> Please read before being diminutive if possible.</p>

<p>your post does imply another issue, even though you fail to bring it up for whatever reason. Namely, <em>who is it,</em> if not bankers, and <em>how do they plot with such coordination,</em> if they are plotting. <a href="http://td.discharges.org/showpost.php?p=126411&amp;amp;postcount=28">I have spoken a fair bit on this, also.</a> I recommend reading <a href="http://td.discharges.org/showthread.php?t=14384">that entire thread from the beginning</a> before even <em>looking</em> at the post I linked, first, but the first post I linked does, indeed, explain.</p>

<p>cheers, and if you have any more input, feel free to interject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve been directly fucked with by disinfo field agents. i know a thing or two. if i&#39;m not totally off-base with what happened, it&#39;s an attempt to spin you around and get you to be an unpaid and unknowing disinfo agent. </p>

<p>some things? yeah, totally true. others? total fabrication, more to do with skills at thought manipulation and the tricks of the shady salesman. teaches you a couple things, namely that a very big part of the game is playing up the level of control and oversight. that idea defines their intent. you don&#39;t have to spend as much time actually employing active mind control as long as you keep those who learn a little under the impression that active mind control is always employed. they&#39;re all about efficiency, after all.</p>

<p>reason i brought up the bankers was because if it&#39;s being coordinated, and someone&#39;s arguing that it is indeed being coordinated, &quot;by whom?&quot; is a necessary question. &quot;bankers&quot; stands as the default answer to the rhetorical question, used more as a device to project my point into something easier to visualize than being a straw man arguement.</p>
