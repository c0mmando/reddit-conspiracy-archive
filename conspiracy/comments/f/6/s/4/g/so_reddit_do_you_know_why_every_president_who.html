    <em>“The money powers prey upon the nation in times of peace and
    conspire against it in times of adversity. It is more despotic than a 
    monarchy, more insolent than autocracy, and more selfish than 
    bureaucracy. It denounces as public enemies all who question its
    methods or throw light upon its crimes. I have two great enemies,<br/>
    the Southern Army in front of me and the bankers in the rear. Of the
    two, the one at my rear is my greatest foe.”</em> 
<strong>James A. Garfield - killed in 1881</strong> 
    <em>&quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute 
    master of all industry and commerce.&quot;</em> 
<strong>John F. Kennedy - killed in 1963</strong> 
    He was muredered just days after he had signed a document 
    (Executive Order 11110), 
    which returned to the federal government, specifically 
    the Treasury Department, the Constitutional power to create
    and issue currency -money - without going through the
    privately owned Federal Reserve Bank. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though changing the gold standard, he didn&#39;t change who printed the money.  Jackson, Garfield and Lincoln wanted the government to print the money rather than a private bank.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that JFK signed an order as well, here is the history behind that for people uniformed as I am.  </p>

<p>E.O. 11110 was never reversed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and remained on the books until President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12608 on September 9, 1987 as part of a general clean-up of executive orders. E.O. 12608 specifically revoked the sections added by E.O. 11110 which effectively revoked the entire Order. By this time, however, the remaining legislative authority behind E.O. 11110 had been repealed by Congress when Pub.L. 97-258 was passed in 1982. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the complete system is still pretty fucked up, because the importance of gold as a equivalent to &quot;money&quot; becomes less important every day. Which means it kind of failed. You just need to check on the fact how much money is circulating and if it&#39;s balance with the gold reserves. Quote: <a href="http://www.dollardaze.org/blog/?post_id=00751">&quot;As of November 2009, the ratio of the U.S. monetary base to the valuation of the gold reserve is nearly 7 to 1.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think part of the reason why the us$ is devaluating is the economic policy america holds onto, which is pretty much &quot;just print more&quot;. in europe there are different approaches to tackle this problem.
america should put an end to the fed and print its own money respective to the size of its economy. debt would dissolve. lincoln did exactly the same with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Note">the greenbacks</a> and it worked just fine for over 100 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Money Masters&quot; is a great documentary about the financial system, the federal reserve and the presidents from the american revolution until today. (it has been posted before many times) It shows that since the beginning presidents and other politicians were concerned with the power of the fed, and afraid of international bankers who repeatedly tried to gain control over the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aw, I&#39;m not trying to be too contentious- I don&#39;t think <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a pack of crazies, nor do I look down on people investigating weird stuff. I have some pretty strange beliefs, myself. It&#39;s just kind of a logical fallacy- it&#39;s an interesting supposition, but I can&#39;t bring myself to regard it as Truth based on circumstantial evidence since I don&#39;t know all the details.</p>

<p>Point being, if we (not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> folks, just people in general) are at each other&#39;s throats for questioning the validity of this stuff, we&#39;re divided- and I don&#39;t believe much in Organized Evil being a major force in the world, but there is evil out there. People who are willing to ask questions and be skeptical of what those in power are saying need to at least get along if we&#39;re to accomplish anything, and I can guarantee we won&#39;t all agree with each other all the time.</p>

<p>Just saying, file this away in the &quot;needs more evidence&quot; folder before you take it as gospel. I agree that it stinks- sometimes that means there&#39;s a body rotting under your house, sometimes it&#39;s just a septic problem. Don&#39;t call the cops until you&#39;ve called the plumber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Though changing the gold standard, he didn&#39;t change who printed the money.  Jackson, Garfield and Lincoln wanted the government to print the money rather than a private bank.  </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that JFK signed an order as well, here is the history behind that for people uniformed as I am.  </p>

<p>E.O. 11110 was never reversed by President Lyndon B. Johnson and remained on the books until President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12608 on September 9, 1987 as part of a general clean-up of executive orders. E.O. 12608 specifically revoked the sections added by E.O. 11110 which effectively revoked the entire Order. By this time, however, the remaining legislative authority behind E.O. 11110 had been repealed by Congress when Pub.L. 97-258 was passed in 1982. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nixon did that because the Fed told him to! Leaving the gold standard is the ultimate dream of corrupt bankers, because they can start creating money out of thin air.</p>
