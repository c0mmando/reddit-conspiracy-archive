    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who backs Ron Paul can&#39;t be all that bad. Out of curiosity I checked his stance on the flotilla. Very astute observations and a heavy slam about AIPAC trying to take our guns at the end. Check the link, stormfront of all places. 
<a href="http://www.stormfront.org/forum/t715609/">http://www.stormfront.org/forum/t715609/</a></p>

<p>Now does he limit his info? I think he does, but I also think Dylan Ratigan and the Judge limit themselves. I suspect the reasoning is due to national security. For the truth about the Zionist influence &quot;they&quot; give us Gordon Duff.  So while I agree with your points, it&#39;s not high on my nefarious list.

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s an intelligent man. This is evident in his comments -- he doesn&#39;t make the same stupid mistakes about science that most media talking heads make. However, he is there for one reason, to make Alex Jones rich and famous. This means he will not speak freely on certain issues, even though he pretends to be a voice for truth. It is selective truth, truth within politically correct boundaries. Now, the boundaries of Alex Jones are a little wider than those of, say Wolf Blitzer, but he is still operating within PC boundaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that stuff as a commercial, possibly even bait.</p>

<p>Take a look at prisonplanet.com:</p>

<ul>
<li>Banner at top selling conspiracy video</li>
<li>Banner at top selling prisonplanet.tv</li>
<li>Ad promoting radio show (increase listeners for ad revenue)</li>
<li>ChemTrails Exposed banner ad linking to DVD page</li>
<li>Another banner ad for prisonplanet.tv subscriptions</li>
<li>Banner ad for survival seed bank (whatever that is)</li>
<li>Ad from a gold-selling agency</li>
<li>Ad for &quot;eFoods&quot;</li>
<li>Ad for colloidal silver</li>
</ul>

<p>Literally 80%+ of the landing page on my laptop is ads, 10% is the navigation banner, and 10% is original content.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/BnWHD">http://imgur.com/BnWHD</a> &lt;---- Red highlights for external ads, green for self-promoting ads for profit-generating services</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/8b4fc">http://imgur.com/8b4fc</a> &lt;---- Ads removed</p>

<p>My resolution is only 1440x900, but that&#39;s still large <a href="http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2009/12/introducing-google-browser-size.html">according to Google</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... Like I said, 99% of his content is free so the revenue to support that has to come from somewhere... Again, I&#39;m not defending him as I don&#39;t particularly care for the dude one way or another. Point is yes, there are valid arguments to be made against Jones, but money or greed ain&#39;t one of &#39;em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is there to stir up the dumb violent folks and to push a gold standard.</p>

<p>His info is pretty spot on, his sources are legit(AP, Reuters, and such) but his own new articles on his page are terrible.</p>

<p>I Give him credit for the pushing fluoride into the mass media. His info on the topic was spot on.</p>

<p>If you are able to think for yourself and criticize what you hear AJ is great.  If you get carried away with hysteria and believe every word from his mouth, you&#39;re going to end up looking stupid.</p>

<p>I Watch is for as Infotainment, the same way i watch Colbert or Stewart. Its a great place to find news the mass media wont cover, but there is an agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is of Jesuit roots.  The Jesuits reside over the Zionists, the Zionists reside over everyone else.  He is married to a Zionist.  They could be called a &quot;Jesuzionic couple&quot;.  Two legs of the same monster (Jesuits &amp; Zionists).  Both controlling gargantuan amounts of wealth and religious dogma, marching humanity toward freedoom for their own &#39;elite&#39; benefit.  Alex was a cast-change operation, replacing Bill Cooper with controlled opposition.  Alex is good at wacky.  Attach that label to the truth and you&#39;ve substantially reduced your opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no conspiracy theory to &#39;Alex Jones&#39; - he is not zionist agent, or on the payroll of any shadow group of ne&#39;er-do-wells...</p>

<p>He is a guy who found out that you can make heaps of cash by lying and  scaremongering to the gullible masses - and he has no conscience or qualms about doing it. </p>
