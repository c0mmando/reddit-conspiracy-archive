       People of Reddit-
I am asking you to join me and my colleagues in our attempt to overthrow and rid the world of the corrupt, criminal organization that rules the economy know as the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.  The FED is NOT a branch of our government, yet it controls our government and has the ability to bring our government (and also the world) to it's knees.  It's time for a Revolution.  Tunisia and the underreported Egypt situations are the first in what I believe will be many regime changes around the world orchestrated by the people.  While the corruption in those countries (and no doubt countless others yet to be exposed) is deplorable, they pale in comparison to what is going on here in the US.  We have remained silent for too long.  Now we are at a tipping point, where our economy is about to collapse, and we are standing by and watching it happen, powerless.  I am calling on each of you to take the power back with me.  It has to start somewhere, and through our efforts we can pioneer the change that will take place within our own borders.  I am starting this post to organize the effort and begin the process to take our country back.  Anyone that would like to help-share your ideas, and update frequently.

        Ron Paul and Ralph Nader support this
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It will require strong grassroots support, though. Because I'm pretty certain it will require BOTH:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Congressional action, and...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Presidential endorsement
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That is: In order to abolish the Federal Reserve, it appears that it will require an act of congress (passing a bill) signed by the president (into law).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also like to point out that the primary focus of all of this effort needs to be upon two main issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Who can print money (and, by extension, who that money belongs to - the USA shouldn't be "borrowing" money from a "privately owned corporation"), and
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         End "fractional reserve banking" (i.e., fabricating currency out of thin air)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Focus on these - they are, pretty much, the core of the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck on starting your movement. I'll monitor your progress and offer my best insights when I can (although I can't think of much beyond this - other than: make sure the IRS is abolished along with the Federal Reserve ... the IRS, aka taxation of income, is what keeps the Fed in business).

       "That is: In order to abolish the Federal Reserve, it appears that it will require an act of congress (passing a bill) signed by the president (into law)." 
    i thought the fed stays in action as long as the government renews its charter to print money.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Federal_Reserve_Act">
        wikipedia:
       </a>
       "The First Bank of the United States came to an end when President Madison refused to renew its charter. The Second Bank of the United States met a similar fate under President Jackson. Both banks were based upon the Bank of England.[17] Ultimately, a third national bank—known as the Federal Reserve—was established in 1913 and still exists to this day."

       the funny thing is, one of the main reasons the fed was installed, was to ensure a stable economy after the crash in 1913. (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#Creation_of_First_and_Second_Central_Bank">
        link
       </a>
       ).
so the fed exists to protect the market from crashing. but it did not prevent the latest crash. so the fed's justification should be questioned anyway.

       This attitude will get us nowhere, my friend.  Please look at Tunisia and Egypt and realize that there are options other than ones abiding by the very red tape that the people we are against set up to keep us down.  I thank you for your well-wishes, but I do ask that you consider getting serious about this endeavor, as I and many others are.

       This attitude? What attitude? I'm a pacifist. If you want to organize a march or rally or something, I'm down with that. However,...
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want me raise arms against another human being, or to put my life on the line over money, f-off. I've got better things to do which are far more enjoyable and rewarding (like working with children to overcome the plague of internet predators).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point here is: I am serious. I've been very vocal about the Fed for many many years (hell, check my comment history and you'll see I"ve been having this discussion/argument with others in the last 24 hours). And, I was the first person to comment to your post...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... and what did I get? -- "Thanks but that's not good enough."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you should reconsider YOUR attitude before responding to any other comments.

       There are other ways to bring down the FED than violence or congressional support. You simply have to look at how the FED operates to realize that it is dependent on tax dollars paying for government debt (most income tax goes to the fed). If a large enough percent of the population withholds tax payment in protest, the government would have no other choice but to listen and implement reforms.

       I have lived in pretty much abject poverty for the last few years. I'm days/weeks away from pursuing an upgrade to my income. Due to the fact that I've adapted to life on the poor farm, I'm pretty sure I can upgrade my income and remain below poverty level with little-to-no discomfort (thus still being exempt from participation in the ponzi scheme). It's a shame everyone in the USA is unable to embrace this the way I am able to embrace it - living a full, rich life ... on a shoestring.

       It's not just putting your life on the line for "Money", it's the future you put your life on the line for. Money is just the tool, if we traded in clamshells, the Fed would own every beach in the world.

       I'm in my good man. We need a good plan, but having Paul back us would be a stat. I doubt our president would, he seems to like status quo just fine.

       I really don't know if a squad of Israeli internauts are acting as a coordinated 'bury brigade' but if it were true it stands to reason that they would target the most vocal anti-semites or anti-Israelis and downvote them to oblivion every time they post.

       Aww you guys are cute with your little ideas of revolution that will never leave this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately revolution happens after the fact. That is to say after the tipping point when the people are denied a basic need like food. Because unfortunately nobody, including people in this thread, wants to die. Maybe you want to die OP, but I am not dying for your stupid half baked ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       And thats the why it will never work because that is the mentality of the entire populous, the hundreds of millions of them.

       Maybe you don't want to die because you are afraid of death. Death is a part of life that happens every day every second, and you are not excluded. You think you are "Living" right now? You aren't shit, your life isn't shit, none of our lives are shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are afraid of death, than you are afraid of life. Embrace death because one day you will meet Death, and what will you do. Beg for "Life"?.

      <ul>
       <li>
        Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is why one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. In our time, when the old "proletarians" are becoming petty bourgeois (and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene), the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers of Ur-Fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In such a perspective everybody is educated to become a hero.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In every mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death. It is not by chance that a motto of the Spanish Falangists was Viva la Muerte ("Long Live Death!"). In nonfascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant but must be faced with dignity; believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness. By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death, advertised as the best reward for a heroic life. The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Ur-Fascism is based upon a selective populism, a qualitative populism, one might say.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative point of view -- one follows the decisions of the majority. For Ur-Fascism, however, individuals as individuals have no rights, and the People is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common Will. Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader pretends to be their interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the People. Thus the People is only a theatrical fiction. There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of its qualitative populism, Ur-Fascism must be against "rotten" parliamentary governments. Wherever a politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of a parliament because it no longer represents the Voice of the People, we can smell Ur-Fascism.

       Never said I was afraid of death so this post comes off as a bit of self reflection doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       But let me tell you: If you are so willing to throw away your own life then basically your life probably worthless already. Young men who aren't afraid to throw their lives away change thier tune when they get a bit older and have something to lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets examine what you said a little closer shall we?

      <p>
       This is purely a subjective point but it sounds like your own life isn't worth much at this very moment. Its good if you want to throw your life away for some cause, older men in charge generally look for people like yourself as loyal footsoldiers because you are easy to impress upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you see because you have this sense that living is shit that you basically want become enraptured in a fantasy of a sweeping change to give your own life some worth. Because if you know if the shit hit the fan you would be one of the people on top and everyone would be so impressed with you.

      <p>
       I think every man is afraid of death and has fears except that many people run away from their fears instead of facing them and by doing so think they are not afraid. I was once like thinking I had no fears before I changed my attitude about things and instead owned up to the fears I was running away from. Life for instance I have still have anxiety about girls and in a lesser part I do fear death because time is so limited I might not finish my work before I am dead. But before I came to this realization I was running away from these problems but today I can face them and deal with them head on. I feel many people do not deal with the problems in their life and become unhappy because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I have already accepted death like many things but I will be honest in saying that the older I get I may still fear it. Its very easy to not be afraid of death as a strong young man but not so much an old frail one.

       Hoo boy. Were you trying recruit me by attacking my masculinity? Do you really think you are manlier and superior to others because you have deluded yourself into believing you can die on the dime for some cause? You don't see the irony at all that this has been the call for young men to die for thier countries on whim four thousands of years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen: When you die the ladies are not going to have sex with you, nor will you get seventy two virgins. You are just dead, in the mud shot by some army soldier who thought he could become a real man by blindly following a cause and dying for it. Zealotry is the real bane in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway im not saying you shouldn't fight for a cause just that its pointless to die for one and revolution means dying. You need to throw away those romantic delusions of yours that you can die nobley for some cause and become a hero that will be remembered for all time. It does not happen, its a fucking fantasy. Nobody gives a shit about you know and nobody will give a shit after you are dead. Thats it.

       Doesn't sound like anyone wants to be a hero here, nor did endorse a revolution at this time anyway. I was simply commenting on your comment about dying for nothing. It's not about anyone giving a shit after I am dead, do you think we recognize everyone that died in the American Revolution, NO, if they knew that would it have changed their minds about fighting, NO, because that is not why you are fighting. You aren't fighting for yourself in a Revolution.

       Nice way to take my comment out of context, or maybe you just didn't understand. Our lives our shit, because we are so small. Earth is a tiny dot in a universe filled with so much more. We are little compared to everything else.

       You're gonna have to give a very specific definition of "hero" here, because what I think you mean is "doesn't sound like anyone wants to be a

       The government should not pay interest on its own money, then charge that interest to us., interest money which was never created in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       When money is created the interest money that is required is not created so that it builds relentlessly creating crippling debt that we all carry in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about a system where the interest money IS created and it is then transferred to the government for use instead of taxes? That way the government has a reason to promote new business that they can directly  understand.

       I have thought about this for a while. And this is what I think: the only way to get rid of the Fed is to do it in bulk. So you get a core bunch of people who wish to do away with the Fed and everything that they do has that intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you need a metric on how you're getting rid of the Fed. So is shopping at walmart promoting the Fed or hurting them? To what extent? Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have a metric and you all agree to do the same thing, eg. let's all buy our diapers from XYZ co. No one drinks Coke, just Pepsi, etc., you have to get other people to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shouldn't be hard since I think that living this way would naturally be better in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Share wireless networks, lawnmowers, vacuum cleaners, and juice makers (stuff you only use once in a while). Communal living as well as purchasing groups. This will limit spending. The Fed thrives on materialism and consumerism. If you don't have this philosophy, you're probably not going to make it. I would say that the world is ready for this (online connectivity finally), but it needs leadership and dedication.

       Would a new currency destabilize things for a while? Hell yes. But look at where we are right now. Everybody with any sense is jumping the hell out of paper anything while the getting's good. Two years? Ten years? Who knows, but the end game is
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       . And people tend to get a little testy when charged ten dollars for a gallon of milk or twenty dollars for chicken. It is going to get nasty. Really nasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot even
       <em>
        begin
       </em>
       to dig ourselves out of this hole while the Fed determines monetary policy. We owe them over 14 trillion dollars for the privilege of using our own money!
      </p>
      <p>
       So to these people who owe their allegiance to the Fed, how do
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       propose we get out of this? The Fed's already proven that they're out of options and ideas. I'm sure they'd welcome some brilliant insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best solution is to stop the train
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       . It will hurt. It might even hurt like hell. But it won't hurt near as much as the coming implosion of our Federal Reserve system.

       I am all for this, but this wouldn't be something that could be done overnight--this is NOT Tunisia or Egypt. It is time for a revolution, and the people need to start standing up for themselves. Instead of wasting their time on Facebook, or obsessively watching sports, they need to start educating themselves on policy, politics, and government. If they did, the country may not be in the mess we are in now.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, Ron Paul advocates having competing currencies. This is a good idea, but maybe not practical. Although with technology, the problem of competing currencies becomes less of a hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to the gold standard, which Ron Paul also advocates, could be a solution. Although, as we all don't know, our gold is probably gone. But having currency backed by gold would mean that there is less of a need for a central bank, because what is in circulation, is in circulation, and we wouldn't need to manipulate our currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Fed, although not a branch of government, derives its power from Congress. The more reps that we elect that want to limit that power, the better.
      </p>
      <p>
       PBS had a great documentary a few weeks ago about the Federal Reserve and central banking, throughout history (although I forget the name). It was all historical facts, no bias either way. But anyone with common sense can take away a good point from it-- basically, there will always be a central bank. The US has tried to rid itself from various central banks throughout it's history, but that ideal will not prevail, ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if we get rid of our central bank, there are still others around the world, and just because you get rid of one, doesn't mean the problem is solved. There is a global elite, and with or without the The Fed, they will control everything from behind the scenes.
--I wish this wasn't the case.

       Ron Paul is the only Congressman in my memory, and perhaps in history, who has
       <em>
        a perfect voting record

       for individual liberty and Constitutional supremacy.  He could believe the moon is made out of swiss cheese and I wouldn't care. Look at his deeds, not his words. That's a good way to judge anyone's honesty.

       this is a step in the right direction, but I see a similar problem as jeremyeatworld pointed out its to little we don't need to just get rid of the fed the whole god damn system needs to go.  This is a much bigger problem then one area of the government.

       But, I am proud that a fellow American actually made this post this is showing something that I have been feeling for years the people need to get fed up, but even more so they need to vocalize there rage.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a related note:
The Tea Party was a way for billionaires to channel rage and anger over the corruption of our system into something that would actually help them.  You have to remember more than anything that the smartest people in the world are the heads of these organizations they use there money to manipulate the minds of the masses for the corporate agenda.  Fox News is a prime example of Orwellian double think brought to the masses.

       I agree that my focus may be a bit specific.  But regardless, we need to get the ball rolling.  Yes, the whole system is corrupt.  But after countless hours of studying and debating, I have come to the conclusion that the people must take control of the money if anything further is to be done.  It was Rothschild who said, "Give me control of a nation's economy and I care not who makes the laws."  The same holds true for the People.

       I propose on the 15th of every month hand write a letter to ALL of your representatives.  Make YouTube videos of the process to show everyone it can be done and share your arguments against the FED. If someone sees you constantly doing this they may join in. Monkey see monkey do.

       It depends on how it happens. If it happens because [the President refuses to renew their charter](), then ultimately the only thing that is needed is one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Insiders willing to protect (rather than assassinate) the President, or...

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         a President willing to die for this [in]action.

       In this line of thinking, the Rothschilds will just profit again the way they always have - by investing in precious gems until the precious metals coup is over. They have a tendency to orchestrate these things, in fact.

       <strong>
        Two thoughts:
       </strong>
       I always thought that if every one simultaneously refused to pay taxes (Perhaps just certain taxes, I don't know the specifics) this would bring the institutions that reaped that money to its knee's because it needs that money to function. thus, cut off supply, starve it out. This method would no doubt come with some expected turmoil. And ultimately, it would seem impossible to get enough people to do this at once in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Second thought:
       </strong>
       I watched a video report on a guy in a southern state who started forging his own currency with copper and maybe silver and gold. I saw that he got a number of people interested and started utilizing his hard currency including local business's. Does any one know about this type of thing? Local currencies? My town has "The Hour Trader". Trading work hours for commerce credits at a number of retailers. Is it possible to implement such currency systems to combat the economic decline?
      </p>
      <p>
       I like your vigor towards your idea of ending the fed, good luck.

       Local currencies are very real and, sadly, a very functional solution for many areas here in the US.  There are areas currently using local currency-most notably towns in Massachusetts.

       I think you're confusing the empire of the USA with the empire of the global banking cartel. What is about to happen is a global economic collapse (actually, I personally believe it is and/or has already happened, but that's just my opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
       The current state of things appears to be an enormous battle between the Rothschild empire and China. From what I've seen of the Rothschild method throughout the last 300 years of history, I'm guessing they'll attempt to make it a violent war (to wipe out a significant portion of humans on the planet, create a trauma which takes attention away from them for a while, so they can get a new "grip" on world money supplies).
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point here is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand, you're clamoring for the demise of the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, you're mourning (re: "sadly") those things which could actually accomplish it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the dissonance? Because it's not the METHOD you want? Because it's not a bloody revolution?

       I refuse to interact with you on this topic any further, if you continue to avoid answering my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've attempted to stir up a hornet's nest and then backed away from any accountability for anything you've said. You are the problem. You and people like you. I never should have commented under this thread in the first place. Your post was passionate and sensationalistic, and you've rejected every reasonable comment made to it. You are making an ass of yourself with every comment you make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please answer my question. Because it's becoming ever more clear that you don't even know what you're talking about - but, rather, it appears you watched one of the conspiracy documentaries, got shocked into the awakening (realizing how corrupt everything is), came to the realization that the world banks (including the Fed) are the root of the problem (all of this adding up to you basically catching up with everyone else who knows these things), and then posted this "call for revolution, dammit!" shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer the question: Why are you posting dissonant responses (favoring the abolition of the Federal reserve, but opposing every method to get there which isn't a violent bloody revolution)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect a week or two from now, you (like so many others who have come and gone) will have gotten over this and moved on... leaving those of us who TRULY are committed to this to fend for ourselves and to take responsibility for the shit you've stirred up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm wrong in this assessment (you already have 2 or 3 comments absolutely
       <strong>
        buried
       </strong>
       in downvotes for the stupidity you utter), you should now do your best to correct me (preferably by answering my question).
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, the long-time regulars in this subreddit will consume you ... not for lunch... but for a tiny bite-sized snack.

       Please point out where I have mentioned anything resembling a "violent, bloody revolution."  I am having trouble finding where i typed that.  Maybe because I DIDN'T.  So instead of trying to go against something i NEVER SAID, and trying to get me to answer a question about something the YOU FABRICATED, I'm just not going to honor your slanted, directional inquiry.

        JF Kennedy (he actually backed silver)

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, the opposite is true. Executive order 11,110 was part of a plan to replace silver certificates with Federal Reserve notes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what Kennedy said in the 1963 Economic Report of the President to Congress:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I again urge a revision in our silver policy to reflect the status of silver as a metal for which there is an expanding industrial demand.  Except for its use in coins,
        <strong>
         silver serves no useful monetary function
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1961, at my direction, sales of silver were suspended by the Secretary of the Treasury. As further steps, I recommend repeal of those Acts that oblige the Treasury to support the price of silver; and repeal of the special 50-percent tax on transfers of interest in silver and
        <strong>
         authorization for the Federal Reserve System to issue notes in denominations of $1, so as to make possible the gradual withdrawal of silver certificates from circulation
        </strong>
        and the use of the silver thus released for coinage purposes. I urge the Congress to take prompt action on these recommended changes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As a result, Congress passed
       <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/coinageactheari00statgoog#page/n426/mode/2up">
        Public Law 88-36
       </a>
       , which repealed the Silver Purchase Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day Kennedy signed the bill into law, he issued
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11110">
        Executive Order 11,110
       </a>
       to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue Silver Certificates. The repeal of the Silver Purchase Act had removed the Secretary's authority to do it on his own. The President delegated his authority under the Agricultural Adjustment Act, so that silver certificates could continue to be issued during the transition period,

       My belief is that a country's government should control it's currency, not a private institution.  A leadership branch of a country should never be indebted to a private corporation while making promises to, and being responsible for it's citizens.  We need to begin this transition, and institute a government takeover of the FED one way or another, preferably with a new, democratically elected government.  We also need an overhaul of the voting process, doing away with the electoral college.  These are a few of the points to a New Government that has been discussed at length in my organization's meetings.  No sir, I am not "just winging it."  Get behind us, and we will will the fight.

       Good luck convincing any conservatives that the government should control currency. At least, until they have a man in the WH again. Also, if we're going to do something about the Fed, I think we should investigate the Chamber of Commerce.

       This is like saying "well the model we have doesn't work, but we don't have another one let's stick with what doesn't work." 
Don't replace it with anything, lets let things evolve without trying to put a man-made system on top of a natural one which will sort itself out with efficiency. Just my two cents.

       Sorry but my sarcasm meter is currently broken.

       Are you suggesting we should dissolve the FED, offer no replacement for controlling monetary policy, watch as the country's economic, social and civil institutions collapse, then let things evolve 'naturally' and 'efficiently'?
      </p>
      <p>
       After the collapse, who do you think will be the only ones with the resources to finance the creation of national institutions? The super-rich, that's who. And do you really believe they will allow these new institutions to evolve naturally against their interests? Probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a problem with the way the FED operates, it makes far more sense to show you understand what role it plays in the US and internationally, advocate what you would prefer to see in it's place, and how you would replace it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'build it and they will come'/'destroy it and it will all be ok' is unlikely to garner much support from those who have the capacity to make it happen.

       Start getting out in the streets. The new world order will fall on it own. It's history, no empire ever makes it to the top, they destroy themselves by the time they get there.

       Their main mistake was allowing so many people to live in this country. The population is what will destroy them.

       I always think about it, during Obamas' (or any other presidential inauguration speech), what if all those people there in DC just turned, and marched forth. What would they do? They couldn't do anything. There is just far to many people. They can't kill everyone. It's crazy to think that in two seconds flat, those fucks could be taken down, but they aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe Violence is the answer as of right now. Right now, they are still very very sucessfull and using Violence as a way to demonize further and control more. They are fucking pros at that shit. The breaking point will come when it hits home with far to many people, and noone, or very few robots, are still buying their shit.

       How is the us economy supposed to function without its central bank? I wont argue that some of its activities are disagreeable to onlookers, but likely you and almost every other american citizen depends on it for your way of life whether you realize it or not because you participate in the us economy.

       A nation can do just fine with a fiat currency so long as that nation prints it's own fiat currency rather than borrowing it from a third, unaccountable party at interest.

       years. By far the most stable form of currency ever invented. And they were sticks. From a tree.

       I assume the "two things" you mention are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         print money
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         set the interest rate
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       ... but this is very short-sighted. Here are two other things they do:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         they loan the USA it's own money, at interest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         they require taxation of citizen's income as security for that loan.

       Excuse me, sir, but clearly the FED is not protecting us from political corruption.  I do realize that the model for the way we currently do things has been engrained in the population as the least corrupt way to do things, but I believe that this has either been a lie all along, or somewhere along the way it went off course.  It is evident that the way we do things now does not work any longer.  We need to be open to new ideas, not just brush them away as lunacy.

       there are so many people that are just fine with the status quo and it makes me SICK.  This world is yours to do with what you wish grasp it by the horns and makes this world a world worth living in.  The world we live in right now is a friend to no one besides the top 1% of the world. But, no people want to keep dragging their feet through this wretched and bespoiled world when the tools to fix it have been staring you in the face the entire time.

      <p>
       It shouldn't be militant, but thinking that this isn't going to get violent is the same as covering your ears and saying nananananana i can't hear you.  Revolutions are always violent regardless whether it is the people that start the violence or the riot police, but either way governments don't go down without a fight.

       dude this entire post is a cop out you provided no arguments no real data and just attacked his side reletlesly maybe you should close your fox news manual and actually start thinking in your debates instead of just saying x and can't happen because its too bad
      </p>
      <p>
       You go on to say that all the majority of people are corrupt, greedy, and immoral.  Thats not because of human nature at all that how they raised thats what they see their coworkers doing.  Its a self reinforcing system.  That needs to be knocked senseless so that humans can once again progress we have stagnated socially its time for social change real change we can believe in not Obama's hope for the best bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on top of that.  How can you not think we need a revolution when you admit that people who are mad at there government for corruption, lies, and treason can't stand up for their own rights because if they do they will be charged with treason or shot by a firing squad.  BTW that fear mongering if the US ever tried to shoot people like that people would be up in arms in a matter of seconds.  You probably wouldn't be though, coward.

       Sorry but my sarcasm meter is currently broken.

       Are you suggesting we should dissolve the FED, offer no replacement for controlling monetary policy, watch as the country's economic, social and civil institutions collapse, then let things evolve 'naturally' and 'efficiently'?
      </p>
      <p>
       After the collapse, who do you think will be the only ones with the resources to finance the creation of national institutions? The super-rich, that's who. And do you really believe they will allow these new institutions to evolve naturally against their interests? Probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a problem with the way the FED operates, it makes far more sense to show you understand what role it plays in the US and internationally, advocate what you would prefer to see in it's place, and how you would replace it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'build it and they will come'/'destroy it and it will all be ok' is unlikely to garner much support from those who have the capacity to make it happen.

       already.

      <ul>
       <li>
        Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That is why one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. In our time, when the old "proletarians" are becoming petty bourgeois (and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene), the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers of Ur-Fascism must also be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        In such a perspective everybody is educated to become a hero.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In every mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death. It is not by chance that a motto of the Spanish Falangists was Viva la Muerte ("Long Live Death!"). In nonfascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant but must be faced with dignity; believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness. By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death, advertised as the best reward for a heroic life. The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Ur-Fascism is based upon a selective populism, a qualitative populism, one might say.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative point of view -- one follows the decisions of the majority. For Ur-Fascism, however, individuals as individuals have no rights, and the People is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common Will. Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader pretends to be their interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the People. Thus the People is only a theatrical fiction. There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of its qualitative populism, Ur-Fascism must be against "rotten" parliamentary governments. Wherever a politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of a parliament because it no longer represents the Voice of the People, we can smell Ur-Fascism.

       Never said I was afraid of death so this post comes off as a bit of self reflection doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       But let me tell you: If you are so willing to throw away your own life then basically your life probably worthless already. Young men who aren't afraid to throw their lives away change thier tune when they get a bit older and have something to lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets examine what you said a little closer shall we?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You think you are "Living" right now? You aren't shit, your life isn't shit, none of our lives are shit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is purely a subjective point but it sounds like your own life isn't worth much at this very moment. Its good if you want to throw your life away for some cause, older men in charge generally look for people like yourself as loyal footsoldiers because you are easy to impress upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you see because you have this sense that living is shit that you basically want become enraptured in a fantasy of a sweeping change to give your own life some worth. Because if you know if the shit hit the fan you would be one of the people on top and everyone would be so impressed with you.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you are afraid of death, than you are afraid of life. Embrace death because one day you will meet Death, and what will you do. Beg for "Life"?.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think every man is afraid of death and has fears except that many people run away from their fears instead of facing them and by doing so think they are not afraid. I was once like thinking I had no fears before I changed my attitude about things and instead owned up to the fears I was running away from. Life for instance I have still have anxiety about girls and in a lesser part I do fear death because time is so limited I might not finish my work before I am dead. But before I came to this realization I was running away from these problems but today I can face them and deal with them head on. I feel many people do not deal with the problems in their life and become unhappy because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I have already accepted death like many things but I will be honest in saying that the older I get I may still fear it. Its very easy to not be afraid of death as a strong young man but not so much an old frail one.

       Hoo boy. Were you trying recruit me by attacking my masculinity? Do you really think you are manlier and superior to others because you have deluded yourself into believing you can die on the dime for some cause? You don't see the irony at all that this has been the call for young men to die for thier countries on whim four thousands of years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen: When you die the ladies are not going to have sex with you, nor will you get seventy two virgins. You are just dead, in the mud shot by some army soldier who thought he could become a real man by blindly following a cause and dying for it. Zealotry is the real bane in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway im not saying you shouldn't fight for a cause just that its pointless to die for one and revolution means dying. You need to throw away those romantic delusions of yours that you can die nobley for some cause and become a hero that will be remembered for all time. It does not happen, its a fucking fantasy. Nobody gives a shit about you know and nobody will give a shit after you are dead. Thats it.

       Ron Paul is the only Congressman in my memory, and perhaps in history, who has
       <em>
        a perfect voting record
       </em>
       for individual liberty and Constitutional supremacy.  He could believe the moon is made out of swiss cheese and I wouldn't care. Look at his deeds, not his words. That's a good way to judge anyone's honesty.
