        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seemed as if every performer was knowingly or unknowingly giving a nod to the NWO and the occult.</p>

<p>In the beginning, it was 5 divas on stage, all dressed in red and black (except florence welch)  The color theme to most of the show was red white &amp; black.  These 3 colors are very symbolic in the occult.  It is a sign of pure evil and death.  The nazi flag had these colors.  But the whole 1st half of the show had a red white and black theme.</p>

<p>Another thing I noticed is B.o.B. came out on stage with a monocle on his right eye, total occult symbolism there.  I can imagine the stage director at the Grammys telling B.o.B. to put it on before he went out on stage.  It definitely wasnt his idea to do it.</p>

<p>Next I noticed the bumper video and logo for the grammys.  You know, the video they run during the nominees and right before and after each commercial break?  I cant find it online, someone would have to screen cap/tivo to see it.  But did anyone else notice the &quot;Grammy Awards&quot; letters were broken and destroyed as the theme?  If you watch it, that bumper video has sparks flying, broken wires, and the letters were always depicted as being broken or destroyed.  Why would they use this as the theme?</p>

<p>Next during Bruno Mars&#39; song, it was black and white video and all the video screens had the masonic black and white checker board on it.</p>

<p>Of course Gaga&#39;s peformance was total occult.  She called everyone monsters and tried to look like a non-human alien.  The whole cyborg/alien theme is overused and is tired and boring, yet they love to use it every chance they get.</p>

<p>There was a lot more, I just cant remember it all right now.</p>

<p>Besides that, did anybody notice that all the artists who performed won an award immediately after?   I&#39;m placing bets on next year&#39;s Grammy&#39;s haha.   The whole thing is a joke.   The performers know it too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I associated the egg with the ancient various spring rites of death &amp; resurrection (eostre, tammuz, adonis, etc). The Easter egg takes us back to some of the oldest known civilizations on earth where the symbol of an egg played an important part in mythical accounts of the creation of the world. According to this tale heaven and earth were formed from the two halves of a mysterious World-Egg. The Easter egg is associated with this World-Egg, the original germ from which all life proceeds, and whose shell is the firmament. So there is a heathen connection between the egg and the ideas or feelings of birth, new life, and creation. </p>

<p>This element goes with the coming year and all the talk recently about the dawn of a new age.</p>

Red, black, and white are the cheapest colors to print (save yellow) that&#39;s why punk bands would use them, now it&#39;s just a good looking colorway.

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta tell you, red black white are key component colors for Native Americans, plus what the submitter said about the Third Reich. Whatever OTHER factors, such as print cost or aesthetics, may have led to their being commercialized in the way that they are AFTER that time, doesn&#39;t explain how and why we see it the only way we do TODAY, which is through projected or televised images. To think &quot;punk rock&quot; is immune or somehow secondary to the very same programming is ludicrous when the Grammy Awards are the subject of discussion. Classical baroque musicians probably had a thing for chessboards too, but that doesn&#39;t explain what the &quot;entertainment&quot; industry looks like now nor what their obviously homogenizing, design-engineered culture is moving towards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The source of a single art director&#39;s personal experience or initiation into a particular idea does not explain the reasons why it persists into a much larger culture space that is not conscious of and thus can&#39;t care much about those origins or original meanings after they&#39;ve been translated. The question is what is it about those colors or patterns that leads to them not just being chosen but followed. The design subconsciously works the designer.</p>

<p>If you think money is a factor when determining color schemes for the Grammy&#39;s then you are severly brainwashed.</p>

<p>Its the grammys, each year they get more and more into the rituals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you misunderstood - red black and white were initially used (as a whole) due to their cheap print value. The Grammys hired a design agency, and a guy like me said &quot;these colors look rad together, I&#39;m going to use them.&quot; 
I made a skateboard graphic with TONS of freemason and occult images all over it just last week. It&#39;s a fad in design / fashion right now and will go away. Thanks for the warning I will not watch that video.</p>

<p>They didnt print anything, its all on video screens and stage lighting.</p>

<p>So you make no sense.  </p>

<p>And again, color design isnt based on price for the grammys.  The design is not decided by a hipster who just graduataed from the art institute.  this is the grammys, they have a whole team of designers. Also, youre clueless about the history of the grammys.  Theyve been doing this every year out in the open since Madonna.</p>

The ORIGIN of red white and black in the history of print process is due to cheap print cost. Punk bands in the 80s made it a staple color scheme.</p>
