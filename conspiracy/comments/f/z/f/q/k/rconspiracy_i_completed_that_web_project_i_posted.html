<p>The site is live here: <a href="http://www.ifeveryoneknew.com">http://www.ifeveryoneknew.com</a></p>

<p>Everything on there should be accurate, if something isn&#39;t let me know.  <a href="http://www.ifeveryoneknew.com/#p2">#2</a> came out WAAY longer than I wanted it to, so if there&#39;s stuff you&#39;d take out or rearrange or anything, please help me out.  I wanted everything to be as short as possible because people&#39;s attention spans are really short on the internet, so I could always use help in that area.</p>

<p>I plan to make small changes as time goes on (readibility, share links, etc.) but other than that, it went live today and it&#39;s ready to go.  I tried my best SEO techniques to get a high Google ranking, but I won&#39;t know till later on when Googlebot makes its rounds.  The more links I get incoming though, the higher up on Google it&#39;ll go, and the larger effect it can have. So, you know... ಠ_ಠ</p>

<p>But what do you guys think?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I posted a link on ATS and PrisonPlanet forums, but not on Godlike Productions.  I wouldn&#39;t want my first post to be &quot;spammy&quot;, advertising a site, so could someone post it on there for me?</p>

<p>My only issue is that you hit a wall of text when you open one of the sections. You said you&#39;re going to work on that already but I just wanted to point it out.</p>

<p>Maybe break up the text with some sub headers so you can break up your points. It makes it way easier to read and emphasizes your key points.</p>

<p>Great work man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, you&#39;re right about adding sub headers to break it up a little bit.  I was also thinking of including quotes that are relevant to the article.</p>

<p>Ideally, everything should be only as long as #1, but I&#39;m having trouble of condensing everything down that far.  I&#39;ll probably keep going over it trying to bring it down in size.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once you open up a section you shouldn&#39;t have to worry about it being too long. Have some fun with it. Throw in some quotes with pics and focus on your internal layouts. If people have to scroll a little bit, so be it.</p>

<p>Even if you made the text in 2 margins, it&#39;d give you a chance to use abit more lively graphics. You have such a clean, minimal layout, if you open the section up with some colour and nice looking typography, people will be pleasantly surprised with eas to read information that gets the salient points across instead of scaring them off with a wall of text.</p>

<p>Waco, Ok city bombing, bay of Tonkin, underwear bomber (detroit news exposed), USS Liberty, Patriot act originally drawn up on Jan 3rd 2001, WHY Japan was forced and <strong>allowed</strong> to attack Pearl Harbor, etc :-D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was really interested in doing one on the Patirot Act being written before the 9/11 attacks, but I was unable to find a legitimate source for it.  I found some info on 9/11 truth sites, some sites like AntiWar.com and stuff like that, but I aim to keep everything pretty mainstream + admitted to on the site.  If you know of a source that is really credible, I&#39;d love to include it because its a very big deal.</p>

<p>I was thinking of doing one for Waco, but for the the site&#39;s target audience, the site owuld probably come across as defending some cult leader or some shit.  I know that there&#39;s some shady shit about Waco (like the front door + police tapes disappearing which would show who fired first), but for most people I think it would turn em off to the whole site.  People tend to be ok with the government doing shady shit as as they are assured it won&#39;t happen to them.  It&#39;s not ruled out though.</p>

<p>The Japan idea is interesting and I may add that into a different article.  I was thinking of covering the Lustania (I think that&#39;s how its spelled) and how it was basically sacrificed to bring the US into WW1, and how there was also shady shit going on which brought us into WW2.</p>

<p>Thanks though, spread the word.  I can code the site and do the research and write the articles, but getting people to actually come to the site is the hard part.</p>

<li> Thats how it was originally, but people would be unable to select any of the text (for copying n pasting) without triggering the animation again.  So I opted to limit the closing functionality to a dedicated button instead.</li>

The hard part is taking all these things we want to share and bringing it down to only 5 items that you think will appeal to everyone.</li>
<li> I used Photoshop to make the mockup (just to get a general idea of where I wanted to go) and the gradient at the top, then basically hand coded it in Notepad++ (I&#39;d use TextWrangler if I was on Mac).  The logo was done in Adobe Illustrator so it&#39;ll scale to whatever size I need it to in the future.  I used <a href="http://initializr.com/">Initializr</a> to bring HTML5 functionality to older browsers like IE6.<br/>
GoDaddy is hosting it.  I hate them and all, but for now I&#39;ll have to deal with them.  When I get a chance I&#39;d rather move it to <a href="http://prq.se">PRQ</a>, who hosts Wikileaks &amp; The Pirate Bay.</li>

<li><p>IMO, I think you could go up to 7-10 items on the homepage without it feeling cluttered/crammed. IMO, you should stay on the path you are on and not veer into the JFK and 9-11 stuff.

<p>Yeah I agree 100% with not getting caught up in theories and things that are still up in the air.  I was thinking of including Tuskegee study with MK-Ultra as sorta a side note since its all human experimentation, but that article was running a bit long.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my aim.  There&#39;s a ton of sites out there that do good stuff, but they seem to go a little too far which kinda makes it embarrassing to share with people.  I&#39;m trying to not fall into that trap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Point #3 is interesting to me, in that just yesterday I was listening to an Alex Jones interview (with John Taylor Gatto) wherein he referenced the feminist movement being started/cultivated by the CIA. Premise being, if you encourage women to enter the workforce--and therefore spend less time raising their children-- and you destabilize the family structure and hence lend greater authority to the State.</p>

<p>I youtubed around a bit but couldn&#39;t find anything conclusive. Credibility of information is an ongoing problem in the conspiracy theorist realm, and it&#39;s exacerbated by the video style everyone seems to go for. (I.e., &quot;just fucking wait till you hear this SHIT, bro&quot; with one of three different ominous songs playing too loudly in the background.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I discovered that too.  The problem is that <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto25/html5/">Opera hasn&#39;t yet added support for HTML5</a>, outside of a couple tags.  So the browser isn&#39;t recognizing the onClick event on the &lt;article&gt; tags.</p>

<p>I can probably sniff the user agent with PHP and serve up different content, which I might do depending on how many people use Opera who hit the site.  I used to use Opera when I was on dialup and I was used to a site here or there not working, and kept another browser ready for when that happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I&#39;m actually not certain. My browser is so old it should be illegal (many modern websites keep reminding me of that). I have Javascript enabled, but when I load the main url I see the list of numbered items (1-4 or whatever?) with their text and links - about four or five screens long, total. My suggestion was to get the numbered items to appear all on one screen as heading items, with expandable text portions viewable on the same page. (think &quot;4 ama&#39;s, collapsed&quot; or whatever). Anyway... if you&#39;ve alread addressed this and my browser doesn&#39;t support it, feel free to ignore everything I&#39;ve said.

    <div class="md"><p>I never used the reddit is fun app, are you saying that when you click the link in my self post, that you can&#39;t click the back button to get back to reddit?</p>

<p>Does that happen with all self posts or is it just mine?  I know jqTouch does some ajax-y stuff which is supposed to allow the back button to work (even though you&#39;re only viewing a single HTML page).  If that&#39;s the case there&#39;s a chance it broke the back button, sorta like Twitter has a habit of doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t even have a Facebook, so I&#39;m not sure what you mean.</p>

<p>Do you mean like, embed some sort of Facebook module on IfEveryoneKnew and have it load whatever news is posted on the Facebook thing?</p>

<p>Shit you got me thinkin bout Facebook, I should probably add &quot;Like&quot; buttons to the page.  If someone clicks the Like button, it posts a link on their Wall page, right?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> &quot;Like&quot; button added to bottom of page :)</p>
