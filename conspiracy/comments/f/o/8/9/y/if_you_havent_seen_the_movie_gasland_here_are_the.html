        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you haven&#39;t seen the movie &quot;Gasland&quot; - here are the facts the gas companies don&#39;t want you to be terrified by.</p>

<p>In 2004 Cheney and Bush  exempted all the &quot;Gas Fracturing&quot; extraction companies from the clean water act and the superfund cleanup act and simultaneously leased them a huge percentage of all the BLM Public land in the country.</p>

<p>Now they have built thousands of fracture wells injecting extremely harmful cancer causing chemicals into the ground and ground water  in all those public lands to break up the earth so the natural gas would be able to flow back to the well head and be extracted.</p>

<p>The effect has been -unsurprisingly- huge seepages of all those injected chemicals - which by the way NEVER will break down - all the way back up into ground water, wells and even surface streams where literally you see film of many many people lighting their faucet water on fire and streams bubbling up with the gases that also can be lit on fire. (the effect in the movie is hard to exaggerate - literally people&#39;s faucet water exploding in their sinks on camera in multiple states.</p>

<p>These are also causing pollution fog clouds in these otherwise nearly pristine areas so the air quality in some of this public land is now worse than in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Some of the people who have breathed those ground hugging clouds are in the hospital and suffered permanent whole body systemic breakdowns.</p>

<p>There have been animal kills as well.</p>

<p>This is across multiple states in the southwest and Wyoming - huge areas of land. HUGE.</p>

<p>Some homeowners in these states have been supplied with reverse osmosis water filters for the wells which the underground injected chemicals simply eat through the membranes of. Others have had water trucked in.</p>

<p>The area of pristine land from northern Pennsylvania and further that supplies all the fresh water to New York city and Philadelphia has also been leased to these same people but as of now they have not built any fracture wells ... yet (as of the movie filming in 2010 - they are probably RACING to do it now so If I lived in NYC I &#39;d be screaming for an injunction and stop fast).</p>

<p>You can&#39;t possibly truck in enough water to replace that water supply to New York city and Philadelphia. There isn&#39;t enough fresh water anywhere to do it.</p>

<p>There is no known way to get those chemicals that have been injected into the ground in all those states back out of the ground or stop them from moving around under ground since they have fractured all the barrier rocks layers underground to get to the natural gas.</p>

<p>The areas of poisoned land just since 2004 is so immense it is staggering and because most of it was BLM land given by Bush it used to all be the cleanest area in the country and is now the most polluted and poisonous. </p>

<p>THAT is why the gas companies are so desperate for you not to see this movie.</p>

<p>The damage is so immense and the damaging intent and fore knowledge of the damage it was going to cause was so clear (that&#39;s why they were exempted from the clean water act and the superfund act) that is defies belief that Cheney and Bush and corporate leaders shouldn&#39;t be brought up on charges of intentional terrorism and poisoning of essential national water supplies. Honestly if a person had poisoned one one hundredth of the water supply Cheney and Bush intentionally and with fore knowledge PERMANENTLY poisoned that person would be tried and put to death as a terrorist like in Oklahoma City or Guantanemo.</p>

<p>It staggers belief and the damage and scale is even worse than the gulf Oil spill which is hard to imagine.</p>

<p>And that is why they don&#39;t want you to see that film GasLand.</p>

<p>Edit: a fellow redditor provided me this link to watch the movie online</p>

<p>The Adullam Park and surrounding areas are in danger of destruction from oil-shale drilling.

<p>Why do we care in Australia because Murdoch and his &#39;world democracy&#39; has a habit of squeezing the life blood out of the environment and the people who live in that environment.......?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched this film tonight after seeing this post on Reddit.
HOLY CRAP!
Weld County, CO is literally behind my house, I live in Boulder County.</p>

<p>I have (on many occasions) drank unfiltered tap water throughout the state within the past 10 years.</p>

<p>Possibly unrelated but I have actually experienced a higher than normal amount of dizziness, headaches, etc. I would even go so far as to say that at random times I feel like there is an &quot;inner ear infection&quot; in my left ear, but then it goes away as soon as it comes.</p>

<p>I have been told anemia and hypotension are the causes of most of these issues, but my girlfriend was freaking the fuck out watching this.</p>

<p>The film itself is amazing, two thumbs for sure.</p>
