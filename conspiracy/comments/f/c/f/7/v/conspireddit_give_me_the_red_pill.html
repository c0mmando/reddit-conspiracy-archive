    <div class="md"><p>I hate to burst the green energy economy bubble that Obama has been selling.  Here&#39;s how it will work out.  Company X in California develops the most awesome windmill, solar panel, and green car ever seen on the planet.  They make prototypes and open their first production lines.  Their products all start selling amazingly well, they&#39;re profitable, and they want to raise money to expand, and their investors want a big payday, so they do an IPO and become a public company.  Sales are climbing, their stock is climbing and investors are happy for a while.  Then, one day the topic comes up in a board meeting of selling more units by lowering the price, and how the company can do this without hurting profits, and maybe even make more in profits.  The next production plant they open is in Mexico, China, or India.  Once those are up and running, they notice how much more expensive the payroll is for their US factories, so they start the layoffs or &quot;restructuring&quot;.  Eventually, that great green hope of a product is made anywhere but the USA.    </p>

<p>We need to pay off our debts, buy back treasury bonds from other countries, and then put import taxes on everything not made in the USA if we ever hope to rebuild our manufacturing infrastructure.  We can&#39;t be a service based economy forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No globalist wants a population that is self-sufficient and independent from the big energy industries. Not because they want your money, but because they want the power over you to control every step you make. If they control the energy and the money then they can control your life. Look up what Diesel was on to when he invented Diesel. He was killed for that. But that is nothing compared of what could have being done by now with the discoveries of Tesla. There is the real free energy. The elite globalists support only unefficient alternatives that are are no thread to their status quo. They surpress all the real alternatives (electric cars, cold fusion, Tesla). You can boil some eggs with solar energy, but you need more energy then that for the population of this world. They know that and that is the reason they fund greenpeace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard this argument before: We&#39;re deliberately producing goods designed to be replaced.</p>

<p>But isn&#39;t this a consumer choice?  I mean, the reasons computers are replaced every few years is because progress in lithography allows much tighter-packed chips (so faster).  So it really doesn&#39;t make sense to make a computer last 10 years if its going to be obsolete after 3-5, depending on your use of it.</p>

<p>Same thing goes for almost any product - if you could still be driving a car from the 40s that was in perfect condition.....would you want to? Or would you want something that could consume unleaded gas, had bluetooth integration, got decent gas mileage, had airbags, seatbelts,etc,etc,etc.</p>

<p>Interesting point about the clean energy lobbyist - i hadn&#39;t heard about that.  Can you elaborate on that more?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A 94 Honda Civic VX gets roughly 47 miles per gallon, which is around the same as a Toyota Prius. We are looking past necessities, and indulging into wants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought a prius got like 60, but i see your point.  However, I&#39;d argue that a prius is a better car.  Your right though, if we went pure utilitarian, we could have cheaper cars....and we do, the TATA nano is like 3k.  If you think there is a market for this (there probably is), you should try to get a dealership here.  </p>

<p>So capitalism HAS produced cheap cars in this day and age (I bet the tata nano is at least on par with a 94 civic, and selling brand new for dirt cheap), but the US market just doesn&#39;t have a demand yet for ultra cheap cars - because we have so many USED cars for the lower end of the market to sell.</p>

<p>In countries like india, they don&#39;t have the tradition of all these cars laying around, so new, cheap cars are being produced.</p>

<p>Give it time and they&#39;ll make there way over here too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This economy has our priorities mixed up in where you start thinking about goods with a sense of fashion and how it will attribute to your individuality. That has people buying hundred dollar jackets, instead of the thirty dollar one because it looks better. Meanwhile the children of another country are starving. They are distant, and you don&#39;t see them, so they aren&#39;t your problem. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that&#39;s fashion. its not supposed to make sense.  I&#39;m not really a fan. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are distant, and you don&#39;t see them, so they aren&#39;t your problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Will throwing money at them solve their problems, or is there another underlying cause?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have become extremely isolated with the world. Where if we concentrated and seriously funded the necessities of every person, we would later have more people to further our technology, education, and needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How will the necessary capital required to do this be raised?  Where will get get the money?  How will you convince people to accept (in their minds) inferior quality goods and then donate money to social issues?</p>

<p>I think the rest of your argument is a re-iteration of the points above.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info on the lobbyist - I&#39;ll have to look into that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having studied these things for six years I believe the Zeitgeist trilogy provides the best summary and introduction to these things. It focuses on what we know for a fact and leaves speculation up to the viewer. You don´t have to necessarily go for the whole Venus Project idea but it is definitely a concept worth considering. Note that unlike Hollywood films the sequel is better than the first one and the new one is the best one of them all:</p>

<p>If you are just being exposed to this kind of information, prepare yourself emotionally. You may find much of this information shocking and be left in a state of bewilderment. You must speak out about what you learn to others once you understand it and hence you might face a great degree of condemnation and ridicule from even close friends and family members. Keep a level head and remain positive and rational about the future. You will also be surprised how many allies you have. The fact is more and more people are getting educated on these subjects and the atmosphere regarding these topics is a lot better now than it was when I got into this.</p>

<p>You really need to watch all three films and see that as just an introduction, there is so much information that has been suppressed for s long that you really can´t expect to have it summed up for you in a reddit comment. When you start your expedition be prepared to think for yourself and don´t believe everything that you come across. Do your best to piece together the puzzle without jumping to conclusions. In the end this stuff is extremely interesting and you will be rewarded at the end of the journey.</p>

<p>Good luck friend, you are heading for a ride, but remember, like Bill Hicks said, that´s all it is :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For example? The quote where he explicitly states &quot;this can not be found in any textbook.&quot;</p>

<p>The part on derivatives is totally wrong he ends it with calling them an &#39;illegal practice&#39; that destroys lives and so forth [but without derivatives your commodity prices would fluctuate dramatically between cropping seasons and so forth] and the part on how government&#39;s finance themselves, totally wrong, they are as bad as most of the mainstream media hying about &quot;deficits,&quot; governments don&#39;t get enough tax receipts to use without leveraging the money via bonds. the money that is collected in the short term, pays for the long term coupon payments on the bonds that are used for all spending [healthcare, military spending and so on]</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t mind his social model, his &quot;solution&quot; but just before in the film he was having a pop at &quot;socialists&quot; in Europe.</p>

<p>The film is full of lies and deceptions and more fool anyone who will believe a film that cites no sources. The only good bit was the part on the human body and human nature, which cited sources and had interviews with professionals... Why didn&#39;t the part on the economy if you might add? Because it was full of false truths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes, I do too. </p>

<p>I just think to myself, you know, religion is a joke. But damn, those folks don&#39;t live too bad a lifestyle...they work, they pray, they are communally social at least once a week - you know, get up get some good clothes on and go to church - they&#39;re more or less...happy. I mean, that&#39;s a pretty huge deal! Happy. Give up all worries, pray that the man has it figured out for you, trudge on until you die. Can&#39;t be <em>that</em> bad, right? </p>

<p>Then I think, and all of the bad things men do can all be attributed to the devil, so it&#39;s not their fault. And all of the money makers and big bankers and large industries are corrupted by his unholiness. They&#39;re just trying to fight the lord, the savior.</p>

<p>And I think, yea. That wouldn&#39;t be so bad now, would it? I could trudge on, worry free. It wouldn&#39;t be my fault, for the lord has my fate in his hands. It wouldn&#39;t be their fault, for the devil has their fate in his hands. Not so bad, right?</p>

<p>Then I think, HA! Fuck that shit. I have a world to save.</p>

<p>Its true for me...I mean I really think they have it so easy. Just to give up on, well...nearly everything! I mean, you don&#39;t have to think for yourself, and your life is in the hands of fate! </p>

<p>Do I want that? Sometimes. Not all the time, but sometimes. Especially when I&#39;m down and out. </p>

<p>But then I think, who would I be if I took the blue pill? I&#39;d be that dick that comes up to my house and tries to introduce people to the lord and savior Jesus Christ. Fuck. That. Shit. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be the bloke that has all faith in our government, that this land is chosen to save the world. We are the greatest civilization in the world, no faults, everything working towards the good, let&#39;s go kill us some A-Rabs, and get us some goddamn oil. Fuck. That. Shit. Too. </p>

<p>Honestly, I just think we can do better than what we are right now. I don&#39;t see a need for war. I don&#39;t see a need for half our money going towards the MIC so that we can have 1.5million troops chillin scattered all over the world. HALF THA CUT. To the War fund. Half. I just think we could have solved world hunger, cured AIDS, cured cancer, all that shit if the money were in it. But the money isn&#39;t. It&#39;s in the drugs to keep you alive while you suffer. I really just think that we could be spending our resources trying to eliminate suffering, and not prolong it. We could be on Mars right now. You know? <strong>Fuck.</strong> Sometimes I&#39;d like to take the blue pill. This rock has too much wrong though, for me to take that ride. I have suffering to eliminate. How? I don&#39;t know. When? I don&#39;t know. But I&#39;m <strong>going</strong> to figure it out. Red pill till death, motherfucker.</p>

<p>It seems you&#39;ve bought into the idea that &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are all crackpots and dysfunctional people, which simply isn&#39;t true. Most of us are just intelligent people who simply refuse to file things in the unsolved/unknowable bin (that we think may actually be solvable and knowable) and continue to pursue the truth despite the road blocks that have been left in our way and the constant derision by those who are either apathetic, intellectually lazy or have an interest in the truth not being known.</p>

<p>In the end it&#39;s simply a matter of saying &quot;I&#39;m not convinced&quot; or &quot;I remain skeptical&quot; and acknowledging that while Occam&#39;s Razor exists, so is the human mind prone to accepting explanations that are simple, concise and completely wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I agree, we&#39;re the product of a very, very long history of natural selection, and it&#39;s shaped us into a social, competitive species. And the capitalism itself isn&#39;t evil or good- it&#39;s a system that we&#39;ve been randomly building since the first sapient being on Earth traded a sharp rock for a dead bird. It&#39;s a tool, morally neutral, like a hammer- you can use it to build a house for someone, you can use it to cave in someone&#39;s skull.</p>

<p>I see chaos in the Big Picture. Of course there&#39;s order and patterns that we can understand on a smaller scale, and we take advantage of those patterns every day. My last workplace calculated our clock in times in six-minute increments- I took advantage of this by not worrying so much if I were up to six minutes late clocking in. Same goes for, say, Halliburton. They found a loophole that allowed them to frack the earth for its delicious natural gas, and took advantage of that loophole in order to increase profits. Neither I nor the board room at Halliburton is thinking much about the Big Picture ramifications of our actions, mainly because the bigger you go, the more chaotic it gets- the interlocking systems of human society, planetary ecology, physics, etc, etc, <em>ad nauseum</em>, are incredibly complex. Sometimes real patterns emerge, but just as many, if not more, false patterns emerge, as well.</p>

<p>Who is providing and shaping the fuel for capitalism? Pretty much all of the billions of people who have participated in that system over the last several centuries. No one person, or small group of people, sat down and decided to wage-enslave the western world. Nor do I think that the majority of decision-makers and power-wielders are conspiring to keep us down. In fact, it&#39;s somewhat narcissistic to think so- they&#39;re playing a game that they&#39;re winning, without a second thought as to who is losing. That&#39;s the problem right now, not evil men wringing their hands in walnut-paneled boardrooms, but morally neutral men working to make what they think is required for a living.</p>

<p>Why? Because that&#39;s where the chips fell- it stochastically happened through the actions of billions. You might as well ask why we exist- scientific rationalists will tell you we happened to evolve this way, and a theist will tell you God did it. I feel like there&#39;s a similar notion in this community- the answer to why the world is so fucked right now is &quot;a conspiracy did it&quot;.</p>

<p>I only say all this because I think it&#39;s harmful in the long run to blame social problems on evil, or on conspiracy. It misses the point, and distracts us from the real roots of our global problems. In the example cited above, Halliburton is involved in actions that harm rural communities and could have serious ramifications for the future of clean water in North America. That&#39;s harmful, dangerous, and it stinks to high heaven... but it&#39;s not evil. I could well be wrong, since I don&#39;t know any of these men and women, but no one in the boardroom at that company hopes to kill other people and make their lives miserable. They hope to increase their profit margins so they continue to attract investors, and if people get stepped on in the way, it&#39;s not their concern. Negligent? Yes. Naughty? Very. Evil? Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>That&#39;s harmful, dangerous, and it stinks to high heaven... but it&#39;s not evil. I could well be wrong, since I don&#39;t know any of these men and women, but no one in the boardroom at that company hopes to kill other people and make their lives miserable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are wrong, because there is no measurable difference between &quot;I want to kill people and make their lives miserable&quot; and &quot;I want to make money, and I don&#39;t care if it kills people and makes their lives miserable&quot;, especially to the victims. And don&#39;t tell me &quot;they don&#39;t know the damage they&#39;re doing&quot; or &quot;if they knew they would be more responsible.&quot; We see how &quot;responsible&quot; these bastards are every day when they&#39;re confronted in our inadequate legal system with the crimes they&#39;ve committed, and more often than not they get off with a slap on the wrist and are free to continue their crimes or invent new ones.</p>

<p>You&#39;re saying that someone who kills because they want to kill is evil but someone who doesn&#39;t mind killing as a side effect of their insatiable greed is simply &quot;naughty.&quot; Uh uh, that doesn&#39;t parse my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the major conspiracies that effect our lives today are things like <strong>international banks</strong> gaining control of states-then sucking them dry of every thing they have. Another would be the <strong>centralized media</strong> control. Aside from news programs that skew real info about world events, the image of humanity reflected in TV is terrible and psychologically stunted people who grow up influenced by that image. Example: I&#39;ve been relatively poor compared to the common level of wealth in my community. Because wealth is a figure of status and social acceptability, I have become saddened with low confidence because of the way I think I&#39;m perceived by others (Being a lazy dead beat) when in fact I&#39;m a spirited, inspired, ambition mofo with numerous skills and plentiful knowledge.</p>

<p>allot of people will be spreading word about major apocalyptic conspiracies. They too should be considered, but if you look back in history you will see a pattern of <strong>power consolidation through religious subversion, economic subversion and cultural subversion.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend Jim Marrs&#39;s books. He&#39;s been an investigative journalist for decades and highly respected in alternative media. &#39;Rule By Secrecy&#39; is a really good primer on the global cabal throughout history. I&#39;m in the middle of his new book &#39;The Trillion Dollar Conspiracy&#39;. If you are at the ET Reality, then I would also suggest &#39;Alien Agenda&#39;.</p>

<p>I would also recommend listening to alternative radio/whisteblower interviews and the like. A few I&#39;d recommend are the archive library at <a href="http://projectcamelotportal.com">http://projectcamelotportal.com</a>, the podcasts at corbettreport.com and the radio show archives on truthfrequencyradio.com. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think a name is your identity?  Have you ever looked up the definition of <a href="http://machaut.uchicago.edu/?resource=Webster&#x27;s&amp;amp;word=identity">identity</a>?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Identity (Page: 725)
I<em>den&quot;ti</em>ty (?), n.; pl. Identities (#). [F. identité, LL. identitas, fr. L. idem the same, from the root of is he, that; cf. Skr. idam this. Cf. Item.]</p>

<ol>
<li>The state or quality of being identical, or the same; sameness.</li>
</ol>

<p>Identity is a relation between our cognitions of a thing, not between things themselves. Sir W. Hamilton.</p>

<ol>
<li>The condition of being the same with something described or asserted, or of possessing a character claimed; as, to establish the identity of stolen goods.</li>
</ol>

<p>IDEN&#39;&#39;TITY, n. Sameness, as distinguished from similitude and diversity. We speak of the identity of goods found, the identity of persons, or of personal identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you identical to a name?</p>

<p>The conspiracy part of it is that the effects of the persistent contrails have already been contributing to the changing climate, where we have been told about various proposed methods as if they were still in consideration, where in actuality some of these methods have &quot;accidentally&quot; been implemented.</p>

This infection (with over 15,000 families reporting in the US) is within the bloodstream of each one of us and is rapidly degrading our health; it crosses evolutionary boundaries of classification and we must do more research on it (CDC&#39;s hasn&#39;t released any info on it, although they officially recognized the disease two and a half years ago.
