       This archive contains almost 20,000 faked pictures from the NASA Apollo "moon landing" missions. Every famous faked picture you have ever seen from the moon missions is in this archive, along with thousands of obvious fakes that you have never seen before. The Archive is logically broken down into folders for each mission.

       Actually, being special effects artists, they are the perfect two guys to judge whether the landings were faked, since "movie magic" would have been used to fake the landings.

       look at the sky. see the "grain"?
      </p>
      <p>
       notice that the sky has a 6-pack?
      </p>
      <p>
       that is 6 screens sewn together into one bigger screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       look where the "moon" (stage) meets the screen. that is supposed to be the horizon.

       i used to love star trek, and the cheesy sets never really caught my attention,

       but if you watch an old star trek today, the cheesy sets jump right out at you.

       this moon pic is a cheesy movie set.

       heres the breakdown:

      <p>
       i dont know for sure if we went to the moon or not. the proof isnt there either way
      </p>
      <p>
       but more importantly that picture proves nothing. you dont know where exactly it was taken, if it was on a ridge it would produce the same effect. the fact that you think that kubrick used front projection with no background in film or any visual field makes it impossible for you to properly diagose this. from a person that has worked in both the film and graphic design, im just telling you thats not how things were done on there.

       Do you understand how they sew images together? For large detailed pictures? 
Looks to me like 28 seperate images sewn together to make 1 big picture of the moon which has since been downgraded into complete crap.

       The weak link in the story is the former ambassador who gave the PM the "rock" but can't recall the details of how he acquired it from the State Department. Everything after that point is based off the assumption that the wood was a rock.

       How does this one incident show that? You can't satisfactorily say that the ambassador knew or didn't know the real provenance of the petrified wood when he gifted to the PM. Also, the chain of custody goes back only as far as the State Department, not NASA itself. There's no evidence to suggest whether the State Department knew the provenance of the rock from wherever it came. After all, it didn't have to come from NASA itself because their only documented role was during the vetting when they said it
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have been a moon rock over the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasoning that this story is reliable evidence that NASA could have faked the moon landings would not stand up in court.

       How could the entire Orion project be continuing if the predecessor Apollo and Gemini were faked?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything that is being put into both Ares rockets (the superlarge cargo rocket/the smaller crew rocket) and their lander technology, crew technology is based on being there. Everything we've learned about geology and formation of our solar system, everything we've experienced. How can you account for evolution of technology and understanding if the whole thing was a fake? Fake evolution of learning?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'd be spending billions on a suicide mission of unproven technology to perform a feat never attempted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which of course is ridiculous. So is the notion that literally tens if not hundreds of thousands of people world wide have been involved since the first manned rocket was sent into orbit and not one of those people are having second thoughts about being involved in the largest scam in humankind history?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, this theory was shot when the first photos of the astronauts tracks were spotted and sent home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read these posts and there's one guy talking about some well spoken articulate, (from the posts it appears these are new qualities of con men never before discovered), author claiming false landing with a close up photo of a lander made with cardboard/air ducts.
      </p>

       Why would someone taking the time and serious expense to pull off a master level plan to dupe the world into a moon landing (motive still horribly unclear)....and then make the key piece out of cardboard and airducts?
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't any logic to this conspiracy in anyway and I'm still astounded at the amount of seemingly intelligent people (they can type after all) who keep feeding this lunacy.

       The moon is a lot further away from here than the earth is from the satellites used to take photos of the earth. You'll note you can see an ant crawling on your finger, but not all the way over the other side of the room.

       I'm pretty sure the the moon landing was real, they just censored a lot of it so that it wouldn't cause a panic. (see original footage in which a ufo can be veiwed). There are still videos of ufos coming out from the space station. Unfortunately all of the good footage gets deleted from youtube so that people like me get to look like nuts.

       Good ufo videos on youtube? They just don't exist, it's usually people amazed by their new night vision camera, and how bright lights look in it.
That can't be a plane, it's too bright! It has to be a ufo, said the man with no knowledge of golfball effect.

       Also, we almost have the ability to not be seen, you think aliens would be ignorant to some basic technology a new species cooked up in a century?

       Yes your grainy footage from my freespace 2 hud is completely convincing, aliens have definitely visited us, to show us their impression of 2 lightbulbs attached with a string.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, I agree with Vitalianbeef that they look like organisms, specifically microbes that you can see at home with a microscope. They look like that, behave like that, and probably are just that imposed over a starry background.
      </p>
      <p>
       See I would love to start the hunt for UFO's, but even on the off chance a video is on youtube (which they would be, tons of them if they did exist in their claimed state) well in the off chance they ARE there, you first have to find them, and that's like searching for a needle in a haystack... except the hay is bullshit, and the pile is infinite, and ever changing, so you get new types of shit.

       Taken literally, that means there's a .1% chance that it
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       part of their spaceship. Of course, there are
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       two things it could have been, and those are either debris or aliens, and so this .1% chance that it was anything other than debris means it was
       <strong>
        definitely
       </strong>
       an alien craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you ever 100% sure of anything? Even if you remember, say, tying your shoes, even if you look down and see them tied, there's always a
       <em>
        chance
       </em>
       that you're wrong, because you could be dreaming. But that means you can never be more than 99.9% sure of
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       ! Which means, obviously, that there are aliens
       <strong>
        everywhere
       </strong>
       ! Put on your tinfoil hat and wait in the backyard for the craft to arrive and take you to their homeworld!

       or spread "disinformation." I never said something false, hoping other people would think it was true.

       Instead, I got to see you make an ass of yourself, which was almost as good. But like I said, I'm kind of getting bored of your progressively nonsensical responses, so I'm going to quit responding now that I've put my original comment into context. Feel free to continue rambling if you like talking to yourself, though.

       Ideally there are but not everything makes it to a torrent. There are some pretty good videos of ufos+nasa involvement still on youtube but they are buried within lengthier videos. (I'm going on memory) I did see a good video a while ago that was of one of the capsulls on it's return trip shooting out the window toward the moon during take off. In between the moon and the capsule a large metallic ball/disk flies quickly from right to left. Also I read an artical about nasa destroying nearly all original footage.

       There's a great close-up at the link of the lunar lander.  Looks like it was made out of air conditioning ducts and card board, and taped with some metallic tape where it ripped.  I definitely would feel safe and secure in that baby!

       the first landing was faked, that is fact But that was to convince the general mass that
       <em>
        fucking missiles
       </em>
       were the best form of space flight, and to hide from them the long researched well kept secret of alternative energy propulsion that MC's like Skunkworks and DARPA had been working on with the National Reconnaissance Organization and our
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       space program which doesn't have an acronym.

       Buzz Aldrin can be heard/read in the Apollo 11 DSE Transcripts talking about the various bases and roads on the moon, and the poor saps stuck down there in freezing conditions.

       NASA is a convenient way for the USG to develop advanced ICBM tech in the name of "research" (the scientists in this case happen to be useful idiots, playing around in Zero-G and performing High-school experiments) with tax money no-less, while pursuing

       space travel with their limitless black-budget from drug/blank-banks/Military Contracts.

       Good ufo videos on youtube? They just don't exist, it's usually people amazed by their new night vision camera, and how bright lights look in it.
That can't be a plane, it's too bright! It has to be a ufo, said the man with no knowledge of golfball effect.

       Also, we almost have the ability to not be seen, you think aliens would be ignorant to some basic technology a new species cooked up in a century?

       the first landing was faked, that is fact But that was to convince the general mass that
       <em>
        fucking missiles
       </em>
       were the best form of space flight, and to hide from them the long researched well kept secret of alternative energy propulsion that MC's like Skunkworks and DARPA had been working on with the National Reconnaissance Organization and our
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       space program which doesn't have an acronym.

       Buzz Aldrin can be heard/read in the Apollo 11 DSE Transcripts talking about the various bases and roads on the moon, and the poor saps stuck down there in freezing conditions.

       NASA is a convenient way for the USG to develop advanced ICBM tech in the name of "research" (the scientists in this case happen to be useful idiots, playing around in Zero-G and performing High-school experiments) with tax money no-less, while pursuing
       <em>
        true

       space travel with their limitless black-budget from drug/blank-banks/Military Contracts.
