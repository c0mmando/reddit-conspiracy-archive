    <div class="md"><p>You get an upvote, because I&#39;m glad you think it&#39;s possible. It wouldn&#39;t take that many people. The best way I think would be to riot in the top 5 major cities. How else would we ever get them to stand down? The internet would be the ONLY way to organize massive protests across the mass distances in America. Our hugest downfall is definitely geography.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the best tactic would be to blockade all major trade routes continent wide. Convince people everywhere to block the streets, the docks, everywhere. If say 10 million people (give or take a few million) all did it at the same time at major traffics points you could buy enough time to awaken the masses to the idea that &quot;progress&quot; is not infinite and their are limitations to growth.... If this actually happened, and the people actually stood our ground long enough, we could stop all trade to the point where the whole business world can&#39;t get coffee, then the walls would really start coming down. </p>

King&#39;s beating and the subsequent not-guilty verdict for the cops was the catalyst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, Americans overall are living better than most of the world. there are &quot;minor&quot; things here and there, but overall Americans live a happy life. Actually I would say that half of the US population&#39;s problems comes from their own wrong doing. People are not as rational and smart as one might think</p>

<ul>
<li>you might have 80-20% wealth distribution but not 99.9% - 0.1 wealth distribution</li>
<li>you don&#39;t have a stubborn dictator who hasn&#39;t bothered to increase minimum and monthly wages and after 30 years of rule, wanted to force his son and his lobby in for ever.</li>
<li>you don&#39;t have a united cause. The americans have managed to please everyone in a way they want to be pleased. For example, there isn&#39;t really one major cause that&#39;ll unite people in portland, ME, NEw york, Dallas, Arkansas, Oregon, California, and chicago, that&#39;ll drive ppl to go out in the streets and riks their lives, jobs, and criminal record. New yorkers have Lattees, Arkansas has corn, caliornia has fruits, veggies, and plastic surgery, and seattle has rain.</li>
<li>the US is not a country of institutions, rather nowadays, it is an interlock between lobbys, private business, foreign industry, politics, and some people interest. It&#39;ll be very hard to convince all of these parties to do any larger cause that doesn&#39;t really exist.</li>
<li>and above all, Poverty, although it exists, if you take away, ex-cons, and overdebted persons, the remainder of people in poverty/low income families, do not constitute the majority of the people, i.e. 50 to 80% population</li>

<p>-you don&#39;t have a stubborn dictator who hasn&#39;t bothered to increase minimum and monthly wages and after 30 years of rule, wanted to force his son and his lobby in for ever.</p>

<p>No, but I do have a government who hasn&#39;t increased minimum wage substantially in over 30 years. 7 bucks an hour in America is essentially poverty here. You will NEVER be able to afford a home/1 bedroom apartment on a single income at minimum wage. (unless you live in some nasty horrible neighborhoods)</p>

<p>-you don&#39;t have a united cause. The americans have managed to please everyone in a way they want to be pleased.

<p>This is fucking stupid, HOW ABOUT A CORRUPT GOVERNMENT THAT IS IN ILLEGAL WARS. PRINTING MONEY LIKE IT&#39;S GOING OUT OF STYLE. SUPPORTING DICTATORS AND OTHER REGIMES, DEVALUING OUR CURRENCY. WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING/SPYING, AND STRIPPING US OF OUR HUMAN RIGHTS.</p>
