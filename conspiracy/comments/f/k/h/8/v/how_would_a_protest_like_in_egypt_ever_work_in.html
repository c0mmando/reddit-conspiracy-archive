       You get an upvote, because I'm glad you think it's possible. It wouldn't take that many people. The best way I think would be to riot in the top 5 major cities. How else would we ever get them to stand down? The internet would be the ONLY way to organize massive protests across the mass distances in America. Our hugest downfall is definitely geography. We can't all get up and march to the White House or anything.

       I think the best tactic would be to blockade all major trade routes continent wide. Convince people everywhere to block the streets, the docks, everywhere. If say 10 million people (give or take a few million) all did it at the same time at major traffics points you could buy enough time to awaken the masses to the idea that "progress" is not infinite and their are limitations to growth.... If this actually happened, and the people actually stood our ground long enough, we could stop all trade to the point where the whole business world can't get coffee, then the walls would really start coming down.

       Just like in '68. They'll kill as many people as they need to, even your leaders, MLK and RFK, the ends justify the means, the only end they want is to keep control.

       Look to LA in 1993.  All it will take is a general sense of anger in the population, and a focal event to act as the spark.  Case-in-point, the LA riots weren't about King, it was about the perception that the system had purposely abandoned the people.  King's beating and the subsequent not-guilty verdict for the cops was the catalyst.

       On the state level, maybe. I think that this country is too fractured for a national movement.

       Not really, Americans overall are living better than most of the world. there are "minor" things here and there, but overall Americans live a happy life. Actually I would say that half of the US population's problems comes from their own wrong doing. People are not as rational and smart as one might think

        you might have 80-20% wealth distribution but not 99.9% - 0.1 wealth distribution
       </li>
       <li>
        you don't have a stubborn dictator who hasn't bothered to increase minimum and monthly wages and after 30 years of rule, wanted to force his son and his lobby in for ever.
       </li>
       <li>
        you don't have a united cause. The americans have managed to please everyone in a way they want to be pleased. For example, there isn't really one major cause that'll unite people in portland, ME, NEw york, Dallas, Arkansas, Oregon, California, and chicago, that'll drive ppl to go out in the streets and riks their lives, jobs, and criminal record. New yorkers have Lattees, Arkansas has corn, caliornia has fruits, veggies, and plastic surgery, and seattle has rain.
       </li>
       <li>
        the US is not a country of institutions, rather nowadays, it is an interlock between lobbys, private business, foreign industry, politics, and some people interest. It'll be very hard to convince all of these parties to do any larger cause that doesn't really exist.
       </li>
       <li>
        and above all, Poverty, although it exists, if you take away, ex-cons, and overdebted persons, the remainder of people in poverty/low income families, do not constitute the majority of the people, i.e. 50 to 80% population

       No, but I do have a government who hasn't increased minimum wage substantially in over 30 years. 7 bucks an hour in America is essentially poverty here. You will NEVER be able to afford a home/1 bedroom apartment on a single income at minimum wage. (unless you live in some nasty horrible neighborhoods)

       Maybe, like if some kind of major monetary collapse happens, or perhaps gas shortage. I don't know? Obviously Egypt got worn down over 30 years. If we had the same president that long, I'm sure it'd happen here.
However, isn't it true that most protestors were students? I really think it'd be possible to motivate a lot of people to do it. However, can I convince them? I'm not the right guy for that.

       This is exactly why you see the Fed scrambling to create the "soft decline" that will keep the people in check.  I think if you eradicate the wealth of 80% of the country in one go, you would quickly see the same kind of protests here as in Egypt.

       no, we do not have a dictator or anything resembling a dictator. whether or not the American government is oppressive is a matter of opinion, but the UN is definitely not urging it to abdicate.

       Youth make the revolutions.  There's a huge 20 something population in the Arab world.  Think angry oppressed young men.  That's exactly why large protests DID work in the US in the 1960's and 1970's.
