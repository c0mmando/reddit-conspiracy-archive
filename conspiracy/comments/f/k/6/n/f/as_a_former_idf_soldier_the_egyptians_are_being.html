       The Egyptian regime is in the best interests of the US and Israel. I am Pro-Israel but it is obvious to me that Mubarak gone or not doesn't make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through the planning by the government and Americans, they framed the revolution as being primarily anti-Mubarak. When he goes, the revolution wins. But he was never a King and the power lies throughout the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think America so easily said, "Mubarak, you should step down." Despite the billion a year they have been giving to Egypt for decades. Do you think the Americans would so easily risk all the money the threw at Egypt? Of course not, this was the backup plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be more democratic means in the country now but that wont change the powers that be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, it is better than nothing and a move in the right direction. But the lesson here is that when you go for revolution, you must be organized in groups and plan things out. In the end, the Egyptians won't see the true democracy that they have hoped for. ie: Egyptian Media are still censoring new articles and programs regarding the revolution, lol
      </p>
      <p>
       Most democratic countries aren't technically democratic but the populace of such regions don't seem to care enough to make their lives better.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem that this is was one of the most peaceful revolutions in human history, but the truth is it changes very little of what actually matters for the common people of a country that was once the epitome of human civilization.

       Israel is gonna' play the "were gonna' be slaughtered by the muslim hordes" card and launch a preemptive strike (with very powerful weapons) on the surrounding countries and than they will occupy their oil fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       there will be international outcry but Israel will say, 'Hey the U.S. launched a preemptive war with Iraq, why can't we?'

       I would say 2-3 years (maybe less).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pertaining to the question of how they would occupy the oil fields, I believe they would use very powerful weapons, like nothing the world has seen. It's possible that the Uncle Sam will help them covertly while condemning their actions publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again; Israel WANTS this war. They just need to look like the victim; that takes some time. In the coming news you'll see that the media won't even be able to talk about any situation in the middle-east without mentioning how Israel is affected.

       Far enough out that no one will remember you said it. Meanwhile I have been told for the last 3 years here that Israel is right about to attack Iran. Next week, next month for sure. I have been told that ships and planes were being put in place for the attack. And somehow nothing happened.

       Ok, right here and now, I want to take a bet on this. Let's get some trustworthy mod to escrow some funds via paypal.

      <p>
       Then, we'll set a time frame within which this will happen. I'll even let you have it as ANY country not all 'surrounding' ones. As you have three upvotes and a reply, I am hoping one of you guys is ready to put your money where your mouth is. I'm even open to odds which vastly favor you, as long as the amount you put up is worth me risking anything at all.

       Wishful thinking. The junta can be gone just as quick as Mubarak.

       Fortunately it seems the Egyptian people feel the same way, since they have not accepted military control and are demanding an interim civilian government.

        It may seem that this is was one of the most peaceful revolutions in human history, but the truth is it changes very little of what actually matters for the common people of a country that was once the epitome of human civilization.

       I fear you are correct, but at least the people have now seen that massive demonstrations can be successful.

       I have two concerns as of this moment.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Egypt went from having a dictatorial president to putting the military in control. That's not really a forward leap in freedom. It's more of a sideways step at best. Maybe the military will just be caretakers and then there'll be pure democracy... But Mubarak went into power after a military group assassinated the preceding president, so there's not exactly precedent for that happening. The Egyptian constitution will either have to be rewritten, amended or thrown out the window in order for there to be actual elections (since the Mubarak-approved Assembly has to ratify candidates on the ballots, which is how his party kept control forever). That's the sort of messy political stuff that militaries aren't good at, and it brings me to point 2
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The protests were so grassroots that the whole movement didn't have a clear leader. For a long time, no one knew who to interview to get the protester's demands. Grab a random guy; that's the closest you're going to get. That lack of a leader made it impossible for Mubarak to stay in power (he had no one to negotiate with, meaning he kept negotiating against himself until he was finally gone), but it also means that there's really no one who will naturally step into the power vacuum and help bring order to the political chaos. No politician really has the voice of that movement and can say "OK, everyone, go home, I got this". For all intents and purposes, it'd be as if Anonymous was in charge of Egypt right now. That's a lot of power swirling in the wind and, unless someone figures out how to harness it, you could easily see the same thing with a slightly smaller and slightly different crowd later on.

       If this has been engineered for the outcome we've seen, this seems like a pretty big risk.  If a genuine leader does come out of the woodwork, then Egypt might swing away from the preferred leader very quickly.

       so tell me, what is exactly it that "as a former IDF soldier" gives you this much insight into the situation? Just curious.

       This is all baby steps to what we're seeing as the arab equivalent of the end of the cold war. Egypt is the biggest Arab state and it fell. Tunisia fell. Right now there are demonstrations in countries we would've thought never possible. It has awoken a spirit amongst people and provoked a pan arabian erevolution. So far no country has turned round and said, "Fine, revolt, we'll just kill you and your families." - it's going to happen. When it happens the question is whether or not the revolutions will continue regardless or whether it dies down at that point. If it dies down then the incumbents have a way of stopping it in their country if they're strong enough. If it doesn't die down then every middle-eastern country needs to start worrying, because sooner or later it will get to them. My hope is that the Tunisians and Egyptians get genuine democracy. My fear is that they get something proscribed by the US as a suitable alternative.

       The $1.5 billion yearly that was given to is based on some open agreements that are publicly known. Like certain access to military ships crossing the Suez. The Military Aid must be used to purchase American military hardware like F-16s from American companies.
