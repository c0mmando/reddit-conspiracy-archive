I want to know what r/conspiracy&#39;s take on this is. I mean, I&#39;d think a lot of you would have thoughts on it, considering it originated from AJ.</p>

<p>Anyone else think a brigade is gangstalking Charlie on reddit? I can&#39;t really tell if he&#39;s off the deep end or not, but I do know that his kids are probably more than safe with their nannies. I don&#39;t really agree with taking his kids, and why now? If you were going to do that, wouldn&#39;t you have done already? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I don&#39;t care if you downvote this, but please give some explanation so we know why. </p>

<p>edit 2: LOL I&#39;m staying on exactly 1 vote. No comments about it either. This isn&#39;t going anywhere. Thanks for making me sure of whats going on. </p>

<p>He plead to a lesser charge after holding a knife to his wife&#39;s throat. Flipped out at a prostitute, that had to lock herself in a bathroom as he trashed the hotel room. Wanted to rent a neighbor&#39;s house so he could move in pornstars to have a porn family. Then a 36hr binge on cocaine that sent him to the hospital. Not to mention some ramblings in interviews that made no sense. To me he is the cause of his own character assassination.</p>

<p>Is it only considered character assassination in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because he questions 9/11? It&#39;s a valid question. There are other celebrities doing the same things, but there is no mention of their character assassination in here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>okay.</p>

<p>I can tell from experience that Charlie just recently &quot;woke up,&quot; &quot;unplugged,&quot; &quot;snapped,&quot; or &quot;broke through&quot; from a position of forcibly suppressing himself for the sake of conforming to the world, and that this process is largely responsible for his behavior. I will explain.</p>

<p>first of all, I cannot stress enough: this transition is very, very invigorating. It dispels a great deal of cognitive dissonance which, in itself, is very disempowering and self-prohibitive. Now, <em>because</em> it&#39;s invigorating, the immediate result of undergoing this process may very well be mania. <em>Intense</em> mania. That&#39;s what it was like for me. <em>Incredibly</em> similar, actually. So I look at how his earlier interviews were, around when the drama was just beginning. His radio call-ins, that sort of thing. And it&#39;s definitely, <em>definitely</em> consistent with mania in my eyes. Going on tangents in his own mind, laughing at himself, exaggerating himself on purpose, not giving a fuck at all who he&#39;s talking to like it&#39;s a joke. Incoherent, off and on. Just bouncing around like a pinball. That&#39;s what it&#39;s like. But <em>afterward,</em> in later interviews, he slows down some. Stabilizes. Still having a great time being himself, but not quite as <em>high</em> from it. If you look, you can tell.</p>

<p>the clearest indication he &quot;woke up,&quot; from my perspective, is what can be gathered about his <em>philosophy.</em> Self-consistency is suddenly very highly prioritized. Adhering to the rules of the system and even pretending to is suddenly devalued very comprehensively. Instead, he showcases himself. Evidencing viability, or trying to. Challenging the world of normalcy to stop pussyfooting around, stop getting their stupid fucking panties tied in knots over dumb shit that doesn&#39;t matter, and follow suit. Join in. That&#39;s what he&#39;s doing. He knows what&#39;s up.</p>

<p>definitely some of the most endearing shit I&#39;ve ever seen on television. I&#39;m seriously proud of this guy in a way that is comparable to having witnessed the birth of my own child. Not in <em>significance,</em> but in subject matter, yes, absolutely. I sure do hope he doesn&#39;t go back to doing drugs, or, at least, doing drugs in a way that matters. Guy is fuckin&#39; awesome.</p>

<p>anyway, this is going to sound ludicrous, but this really isn&#39;t the type of conspiracy you think it is. It&#39;s not about Charlie being discredited and ruined because he did this or that. It&#39;s about throwing the concept of waking up into the laps of the general populace because the audience is fuckin&#39; ripe. More <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fvrtf/what_are_some_conspiratorial_theories_on_the/c1j0f4g">perspective manufacturing.</a> Ultimately, we are supposed to believe our world is trivial, obsolete, and corrupt for vilifying good old Charlie Sheen despite the legitimacy of his modality. For suppressing <em>us,</em> inhibiting <em>us</em> from waking up, despite its legitimacy. And I happen to agree. It is.</p>

<p>how much of this is planned, and how much simply emerges naturally because the audience is ripe? I can&#39;t say at all, just yet. But I do assert that what I&#39;ve come up with thus far is an adequate approximation of the truth.</p>

<p>cheers if you understand. We are in for one crazy fuckin&#39; ride.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hard to say, for me. I know Tim Leary himself admitted to being a plant and accredited the CIA for his popularity. When I consider things like that, I can&#39;t help but suspect the 60s counterculture movement was a controlled experiment of some sort. Like they were testing the waters of the collective mind, gathering data on what it would take to make a revolution of consciousness fuckin&#39; <em>explode,</em> exactly according to plan.</p>

<p>might sound like nonsense, but really, think about it. You think the system, whatever the system really is, gives <em>any fuck whatsoever</em> about these societal constructs you mention? Do these constructs facilitate the system&#39;s rise to power in some way? No. You might say they keep us dumb, keep us well-behaved, but I know there are so many more ways to keep us dumb and well-behaved, so it&#39;s all negligible, really. I would have to conclude the constructs serve no real purpose beyond oppressing us and dulling our experience. Then, deeper: does dulling our experience serve some purpose? Well, no, not really; not in itself. But if it <em>inhibits</em> people, and you have the power to take it <em>away....</em></p>

<p>all of this is much more clearly illustrated by something <em>I</em> know, but that many will not appreciate. Namely, how <em>demons,</em> which <em>do</em> exist, will sometimes masquerade as physical or psychological ailments, then <em>withdraw,</em> when met with countermeasures of their preference, <em>specifically</em> to imply these countermeasures do good, verifiably, even though they do not, and are most likely doing the opposite.</p>

<p>yes, this happens. It is most clearly observable to a layman in reported instances of sleep paralysis, alleged alien abductions, astral projection, and strong psychedelic experiences. Look into them sometime. You&#39;ll see one common element jump out: profound dissonance, profound discomfort, but all the sufferers had to do was <em>submit,</em> or <em>go with it,</em> or something to that extent, and it immediately resulted in positive consequences. This is classic demon bullshittery 101.</p>

<p>anyway, I believe it is very plausible that whatever this authoritarian system <em>is,</em> that seeks to control our thoughts and our experiences, it will most likely resort to similar tactics, and almost definitely learned these tactics directly from the spirit realm, besides.</p>

<p>always be wary of where your oppression is coming from. Whoever imposes it will readily take it away if it inclines you to do what they want.</p>

<p>The media bringing Alex Jones on so much is the weird part for me.  I know the media also loves covering celebrity gossip stories so I expected them to dig into Charlie, but they don&#39;t need to invite Alex on (who they know is going to defend hm) to do it.</p>

<p>BTW I read awhile back that you can&#39;t trust the upvotes/downvotes totals on your submissions.  Reddit randomizes those to prevent gaming/spamming or something, while your final karma on the submission (in this case 1) is correct.  Your submission is only a hour old so it can go either way.</p>
