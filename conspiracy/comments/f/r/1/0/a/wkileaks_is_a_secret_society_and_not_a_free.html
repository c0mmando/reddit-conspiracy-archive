       I was once a supporter but having given it time and thought my views are changing -
      </p>
      <p>
       Point 1 - There are only a few people in the public eye representing Wikileaks, we are told to believe there are perhaps hundreds of members editing the information. The creation of Wikileaks is also a mystery. Who funded its beginning?
      </p>
      <p>
       Point 2 - Why oh why do they not release all of the cables? Why don't they release all the info on the Swiss banks? Information is key here, they do not trust the public with the info? People say fair enough for the protection of people who may get killed for releasing certain info, bullshit, that is what our government do to us day in day out, they keep truths and facts from us while telling us that it is to safeguard agents and national security. Why are we to believe a blonde Australian hacker does not subvert info from us while at the same time we totally accept that our government hides truths from us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Point 3 - Why aren't they standing up for Bradley Manning? Assange hasn't said one word. Don't give me that bullshit about protecting sources, they sure as hell aren't protecting Manning while he has anal probes shoved in him and music played 24 hours a day till insane. Remember he is in military prison different rules and a totally different game, plus we know what Americans do to enemies of the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point 4 - Isn't there an argument to say this is done for the benefit of finance rather than the morals claimed on the tin? Wikileaks is in partnership with some pretty large news organisations for distribution of material, why not just release on the internet and let people make their own minds up? Why the need for the telegraph or guardian to know before the people, so they can bang out headlines for their own agendas - IRAN/CHINA/LIBYA/EYGPT/TUNISA.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they disclosed all their information, disclosed that big encrypted file, stop releasing information that helps the western governments then maybe just maybe I could believe my title is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comments are most appreciated I am still confused and need questions answering.

       If what you say is true... so what? If the information they release is true then they are still doing a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're point seems to be 'they could be better', which is true, however there's nothing stopping other people from setting up their own leaking organisations (which they have).

       This is not necessarily true. Information without context is not "a good thing."
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say John Smith was a soldier and fought in Vietnam. He fought some tough engagements and killed some opposing soldiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, I tell you: "John Smith has killed people." Obviously, what I've said is the truth, but without context it can be extraordinarily misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think that Wikileaks is a secret society, but I do think that some of OP's concerns are valid. We are just trading one mouthpiece for another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, psychologically people give so much credence to the terms: wiki and leaks. Wiki implies crowdsourcing, user-contributions and all the trappings that come with it, while leak implies that something someone didn't want you to know is being revealed to the public. In actuality, Wikileaks is an overnight sensation. They're a news source like any other (their model is to get tips from sources and publish them), and yet everyone thinks Wikileaks is the future of truth. No, it's not. They choose what to publish.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, they could be getting hundreds of leaks per day, publishing the harmless ones and reporting back to the bosses of the ones who leaked dangerous information. I see no reason to trust Wikileaks at all.

       That's hardly wikileaks fault. If what you say in the last paragraph is true then, again, so what? They aren't doing anything to diminish information and there's nothing stopping anyone from starting their own leaking organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for 'information without context', they leak redacted documents. That is the context. We know that in the case of the diplomatic cables that these were messages sent from diplomats. If people choose to then think 'well then, it must be true' that's hardly wikileaks fault. they do provide context.

       They never asked for trust. Assange is up for rape charges. Now, even if  he is proven unequivocally guilty and only leaked documents in the first place to further his international raping adventures, no one seems to be denying that the leaked documents are real.

       How do you know if what Wikileaks "breaks" is true? They have no history of credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, really? My last paragraph basically posited a scenario Wikileaks is turning over whistle-blowers to their employers. So what? That is exactly the opposite of what they're supposedly standing for. You don't address one of the OP's concerns: why is Wikileaks only revealing some of the information they have, and why do they do it when they do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, redacted documents specifically
       <em>
        lack
       </em>
       context. Furthermore, when it comes to government documents or records, or the records on any organization, the circumstances surrounding its creation, the information on the creators, historical information of the time period, and other details are essential for understanding the story. Wikileaks provides little, if any, of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your example, all you know is that X was a document sent from Y to Z. Maybe person A forced Y to send it. Maybe Y had to send it as a legal requirement. Maybe the cable was hostile because Y and Z were tennis rivals. We have no idea. Wikileaks leaves out these contextual details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you want to argue that Wikileaks doesn't need or isn't responsible for providing this context, that's fine, that would be a philosophical disagreement. But saying that they do provide context, is, IMO, pretty untrue.

      <p>
       In the case of videotape, because it's on videotape. In the case of other leaks, say the embassy leaks, largely because none of the people who could have benefited from denying that the cables were real did so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't read the part in your last paragraph about turning the informers in. Fair enough, however we have no reason to think that they do. At all.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        why is wikileaks only releasing some of the information...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well you may have noticed the amount of trouble they've run into for the information they have released, it would make one cautious about releasing more.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, why are you arguing that information (without context) is not necessarily a good thing, then criticizing wikileaks for not releasing enough information? Which do you want? Them to be more or less careful about releasing information.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        redacted documents specifically lack context
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What? what possible definition of context are you working off. The fact that they are redacted documents is the context.
      </p>
      <p>
       That they don't provide history? They don't claim to. If the cables themselves don't provide history than that's the fault of diplomats (and not much of a fault either). If you want history read a history book. If you want something that claims to be factually verified news, read a newspaper. If you want what to know what diplomats genuinely think about X, Wikileaks provides that, AND, more importantly, it says 'This is what diplomats think about X', which IS the context.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like claiming that breaking Watergate lacks context because the DNC weren't actually communists. Wikileaks never claimed that the contents of the cables were necessarily true, only that they were what some officials thought.

       See, this is the problem. You see one document about X, and you assume that this is what a diplomat thinks about X. You know nothing about its creation, nothing about the authors, nothing about anything except the page that is in front of you, a digitized pdf page or image file or whatever format.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I took a page out of your journal, and posted it on the internet, that is not providing what you think about X, it is providing only that I posted something on the internet. You have to draw all the conclusions yourself, and certainly most of those conclusions will be, at best, incomplete, and at worst, wrong. By not providing context, Wikileaks presents an incomplete picture of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I argue that releasing info without context is bad, and then say they are not releasing enough, it is the additional context they need to release. WL has release A, B, C, F, and G. I'm not saying they should release H, I, J, K, and L. They should release D and E to fill in the blanks.

       And yes, sorry, Assange is claiming that what he is revealing is the truth. He even said so in an

       Ok then, to get out of the realm of abstracts, can you provide something wikileaks has released that, due to a lack of context, has lead to there being less information available to the public?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying 'If you can't provide one, you're wrong' or anything like that, it's just incredibly odd to debate whether A and C implies D without B.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I disagree with how you used the quote from the article. Wikileaks has released facts, i.e. videotapes. In the case of the documents it is a fact that said documents were sent.

       It is a fact that the words "I want to kill all the Republicans out there.." past my lips, yes. That's what a fact is, something that happens, not a meaning or theory behind what happens.

       OP is suggesting that they edit their leaks. And if they received 2500 pages and released 2499, they are editing them.

       That's not what editing means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had they, in the case of diplomatic cables, edited them, anyone of the thousands of people with access to the same information could prove Wikileaks to be liars by releasing the unedited version, including the embarrassed diplomats that had every reason to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: to clarify, if they received a 100 page report and left out some pages, fair enough, that's a form of editing. If they received 100 reports and only released 90, that's not. Not sure which meaning you were going for.

       Actually, it is what editing means.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you write a sentence, and I remove a word, I've edited it.
If you write a paragraph, and I remove a sentence, I've edited it.
If you write a report, and I remove a page, I've edited it.
If you write a report, and I rearrange the order of the pages, I've edited it.
If you have 10 reports, which are meant to be taken together (i.e. refer to other reports), and you remove some, you are editing. 
The
       <em>
        leak
       </em>
       itself should be considered as a single "record". It's made of many little pieces of information, but the leak itself needs to still be treated as one big item. By not releasing everything, they are editing the contents of the leak, and therefore editing the leak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your point about the diplomatic cables is very misguided. If I released a page of your journal to the public, and its meaning was misleading, you wouldn't respond by releasing your entire journal to prove your intentions. There might be other things in your journal you still don't want me to find out about. You might just say: "that doesn't accurately represent my position on things." Or you might just not comment at all.

       I would, however, release the same page with the preceding or following sentences.
      </p>
      <p>
       But more importantly, the US government never said 'that doesn't accurately report what our diplomats were trying to communicate' and they did comment
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        if you have 10 reports, which are meant to be taken together.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then it's not 10 reports, it's one big report with 10 parts to it. You can't give out to someone for writing a book on modern chinese politics on the basis that it leaves out the thousands of years of history before it. Adding the history would, of course, add understanding and, again, even MORE context, but unless the book is called 'a complete History of China', it would be a silly criticism.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Why? It's a bundle of different communications by different people about different topics. The only thing they have in common is that Wikileaks happened to get hold of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But moreover, what possible context could there be to 'Yeah, we've tortured prisoners' that would make it mean 'actually, no, we didn't torture prisoners.'

       Yes, it is a literal fact that those words came out of your mouth but because the words were taken out of the entire sentence you spoke (context), which has taken away meaning, makes the fragment simply false.

       The meaning most people would derive from the footage would be false, the video itself cannot be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facts are independent of meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, even if we were to concede on this point (I'm not, but let's say), there's no equivalent in either diplomatic cables or video footage to editing out the word 'Not'. Well, actually, i guess there is. It is literally editing out the word 'Not', which, again, no one is claiming Wikileaks has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, back to the main point is that by editing out 'I'm not saying' you wouldn't be leaving out context so much as directly editing. I'll admit, there's no clear line between the two, however when you say wikileaks leaves out context, that's a very different claim than saying wikileaks directly edits their leaks.

       The problem is that there's no way to know whether they've edited their leaks. Let's take the Bradley Manning incident. He stole many documents, and handed them over. Does anyone really know how many he stole? Does anyone really know how many he gave to Wikileaks? We only know how many they released. And there's NO WAY to test what they have. If you were the government, what are you going to say: "Wikileaks is editing their leaks because they have so much more on us?" No, you're going to keep your mouth shut and hope they only release what they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except, we KNOW they have more information than they're releasing. (see OP's original post)
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if you want to semantically drill down to the "facts" in a vacuum, go ahead. People are going to use these "facts" to support an argument, to support a political platform, to justify a lawsuit or police action or a war. So yes, their
       <em>
        meaning
       </em>
       is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, your point about "nobody has claimed Wikileaks has edited things" is untrue.

       Ok, say for example that the leaks are either edited or false, but the reason the government isn't denying it is because their afraid that wikileaks will release more, or at least, the Real, information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well then, we have a choice in scenarios
      </p>
      <p>
       A: the wrong people are being blamed, silenced, then made to act as fall guys. In which case, why has none of them come forward? It might be true, but we have no evidence where evidence should be available.
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       B: The right guys are being blamed, but for the wrong things. The actual things that they did were far worse. It's sort of like accusing someone of stealing when their alibi is that they were too busy murdering someone. In this case Wikileaks is still holding wrong-doers accountable. Not fully accountable, but moreso than they would be without wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If wikileaks doesn't have any information, as I said, the government would have no reason not to prove them wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your last point, I'd much rather have a 30 minute video with parts removed than no information at all. Now, there are hypothetical situations where this isn't true - i.e. the editing out the 'nots'. However, in the example you gave, though the footage removed may have painted the soldiers in a more positive light, in no way does it negate what we did see. Also, it says that they received the video already edited. What else could they do? All information gatherers work the same way, gather as many facts as you can and, if you don't have the full and complete story, say so - which is the context of these facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Facts are amazing. What they are used for is irrelevant, because they, literally, are truth. I'd much rather a few verified facts - stuff like 'Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction' - than any amount of unsupported hypotheses or ideologies.

       Or the things they actually did are top secret, endanger the lives of soldiers, endanger diplomatic relations, endanger the economy, etc. There are a whole host of reasons someone might not respond, not just 
a) the charges are fakes
b) they did worse shit
      </p>
      <p>
       I would much rather have fair, fully informative reporting. Wikileaks is biased, Wikileaks has an agenda, Wikileaks chooses what information to withhold, what information to release, and when to release it. Which is why I said they are just the same as any new source.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine that everything is a puzzle. Wikileaks releases pieces of that puzzle, with no background research as to what those pieces are, where they go, or how they fit with other pieces. Is it more information? Yes, of course, it is greater than 0, but it is only a piece of the puzzle of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, how facts are used is not irrelevant. I'm glad you brought up the Iraq War - it's a perfect example. The US did not have all the facts, they only had some of them, and they acted. Then, oops, they found out that some of their "facts" were not actually facts at all because they lacked context. They assumed they had all the pieces, or enough to act, and they acted. But, they didn't have enough information, they had some "facts" and no context, and went with it.  Prove to me that Wikileaks says their information is incomplete, that they might not be telling the whole story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before Copernicus and Galileo came around, it was a FACT that the Sun revolved around the Earth. Facts change based on how much contextual information we have and how reliable or verifiable the evidence is that supports those facts. Today, it is a FACT that Thomas Jefferson fathered children with slaves. 50 years ago, that was not a fact. Why? We have DNA evidence, which is reliable and verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that people want LESS information, because they can then justify their behavior with it. They want pieces, not the whole story, so they can cherrypick those pieces to form the basis of their argument. It's why politicians say things like: "This bill will cut taxes, and we need that to stimulate the economy" not "This bill will cut taxes, and force us to cut government services we can no longer afford, which we want to do anyway, and we need that to stimulate the economy."
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks gives us just enough information to support whatever we want to support, never the full story. You're left to jump to your own conclusions, which people hungrily do, supporting whatever conspiracy they believe in: 9/11, Illuminati, corporations controlling the world, etc. etc.

       So you're saying that wikileaks is saying 'Don't deny the accusations or we'll endanger the lives of troops' etc. Possibly, but then your conspiracy theory rests upon another conspiracy theory with no evidence for either of them. If they did that they would be extradited. They may even be considered traitors in their own countries -it's not much of a bargaining chip.

       So would I... but that's not Wikipedia is or claims to be. Don't give out to the delivery pizza man that they don't serve spring rolls, that's not what they set out to do. They also don't set out to reveal the truth about everything, just some facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right, clearly you're working off a completely different definition of facts, namely that they can be wrong. If Wikipedia are giving out 'Wrong-facts', then of course that's a bad thing, but that's not what this argument has been about. Facts didn't change because of context, they were revealed to not be facts at all. Even if we are to say 'facts change' (which I most definitely am not) it has nothing to do with 'context'.

       okay... so? Wikileaks is giving information into the public sphere. Not all information, not even more information than regular news agencies... but so what? They provide information that otherwise would be unavailable, that to me is a good thing. If people take what small amount of information that wikileaks provides and runs with them 'till they turn into massively wrong conclusions, well, so what? That's a criticism of people, not of wikileaks.

       Like, I dunno... all reality? Good. I don't want wikipedia's interpretation of the world, I want facts. True facts, not the ones you were talking about. The world is ambiguous, we don't have a lot of answers, any information that reflects reality reflects this too.

       So, you're saying, that Wikileaks is giving you facts, which may turn out to be not facts at all. Wikileaks is giving our information, which may turn out to not be true at all, but that's ok because they don't claim to be giving out truth, even though I linked an article where Assange claims exactly that?
      </p>
      <p>
       What part of that makes sense at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there's a conspiracy theory, I was just offering examples of why people might not come out and deny reports. Other ones might be that the shit is just not damaging enough to even waste their time. I'm just trying to point out that just because someone doesn't deny it, doesn't mean it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I disagree that any information is a good thing. People make decisions based off information, and I want people to make the right decisions off complete information. Information that is non-essential, information that is misleading, and even "facts that turned out not to be facts at all" all hurt society and hinder people's decision-making ability, and lead them to the wrong conclusions. There are so many hateful people in America and the world banding together because they have incomplete information. I have no reason to believe anything Wikileaks says, but they claim they reveal the truth, and other people buy it, so it's dangerous.

       It's okay that you're not saying there's a conspiracy theory - we're discussion this because it's good to discus things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should clarify on the first paragraph; it is a fact that, in case of the cables, they were sent and that is what they say, not that the information contained wherein is factual. All wikileaks can do is provide the context OF THE CABLES - i.e. that they were cables - not of what the cables describe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, it may indeed turn out that, if the conspiracy theory espoused is correct that it isn't a fact that cables were sent with said information, that they aren't facts, but that wasn't really what we were talking about when I said 'wikileaks provides facts'. We were dicussing whether context was necessary.
