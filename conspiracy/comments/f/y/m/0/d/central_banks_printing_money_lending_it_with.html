<p>Look up &quot;beneficial ownership.&quot; I was involved in suing someone who claimed they did not own a house. BUT they collected almost all the rent. So, in law, they are the beneficial owner.</p>

<p>This is why the &quot;ownership&quot; of the Fed does not matter. Treasury gets almost all the profit. Show me any evidence of the Fed disbursing profit to banks other than the statutory dividend, which is linked solely to the amount of money the banks paid-in to the Fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be fine if you could audit the Fed&#39;s dealings with foreign banks which they refuse to disclose - the nature of the transactions and the money flows resulting from them. The point being those operations are, for now, outside the review of the government. Obviously, that doesn&#39;t bother you being the Fed champion here.  </p>

<p>Personally, I think trying to get rid of the Fed could be disastrous given the result of the last US/private central bank battle. Bernanke already gave us a glimpse of that when threatened with a real audit bill;</p>

<p>“My concern about the legislation is that if the GAO is auditing not only the operational aspects of the programs and the details of the programs but making judgments about our policy decisions would effectively be a takeover of policy by the Congress and a repudiation of the Federal Reserve would be highly destructive to the stability of the financial system, the Dollar and our national economic situation.”</p>

<p>Biddle took the same course and nearly wrecked the US economy but lost in the end as Jackson rerouted US receipts to non-member banks that eventually filtered back into the economy, pulling it out of the nose dive engineered by Biddle.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to take a position that there is no undue influence on a private bank that controls the US economy seeing how they go out of their way to make sure that the information that would reveal it never sees the light of day.  It&#39;s harder to face the fact that this thing has had the country by the short &amp; curlies since 1913. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some people who object to an &quot;NGO&quot; running monetary policy. It is a semi-independent institution. The POTUS can&#39;t order them to do stuff. That is the only substantive difference between the Fed having control over monetary policy versus Treasury.</p>

<p>There is potential for corruption by people appointed to run it. There are activities by the Fed that seem to be outside it&#39;s charter. For example, the Fed &quot;holds&quot; gold for a lot of countries.</p>

<p>BUT ownership is not a conspiracy. Ownership and remittance of profits to Treasury are one of the things we can trust about the Fed.</p>

<p>Benanke&#39;s statement is a lot less dynamite than you think: &quot;...but making judgments about our policy decisions would effectively be a takeover of policy by the Congress&quot; That is the basis of the Fed vs. Treasury debate. Should we have central banking or not? He is arguing against a stealth takeover. That&#39;s all. As you point out, veering in the direction of Treasury control over money supply often does not end well.</p>

<p>Now the operations of the Fed could turn out to be corrupt as hell, but if they were, there would be some external evidence of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We simply don&#39;t know who owns it and the nature of their influence over it. All we see is their total dominion over the US monetary system and collusion with Wall Street without complete oversight. That is simply not a desirable situation for the country - period. You&#39;re ok with it - I see it as a threat to our sovereignty. We agree to disagree. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Anyone, anyone involved with the operation can potentially be corrupt.  All the more reason to know exactly who they are. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s such a lame turnaround and not at all what I pointed out.  I pointed out that when a private central bank is threatened with being dissolved, it <em>purposefully, with malice and forethought, wrecks the economy</em> to try to turn opinion against the attacker. That&#39;s enough reason to rid the country of that sort of infection forever. Jackson found this action particularly evil and hardened his resolve to rid the country of it and succeeded.   Read up on the Biddle/Jackson battle and the history of the formation of the Fed.   After the Second Bank of the US, a private central bank like the Fed,  was unchartered by Jackson, the US did just fine until the Wall Street engineered panics after the turn of the century designed to drive the country, by fear, into embracing another private central bank put together by the New York and European bank representatives. </p>

<p>Federal Reserve Notes are authorized by Section 411 of Title 12 of the United States Code and are <em>issued</em> to the Federal Reserve Banks at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</p>

<p>Further:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once the notes are put into circulation, they become liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks and <em>obligations</em> of the United States.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve gets these notes from the US Treasury at the cost of printing, typically estimated to be approximately 10 cents per note. <em>Only</em> when the notes are put into circulation do any profits or losses begin to accumulate. Who gets that other 90 cents? Is it actually even shown on the books?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Profits from the fed are really a negligible part of the conspiracy. A more insidious power comes from its ability to enable these banks to form a cartel and its ability to distort the economy through central economic planning. For the benefit of the privileged few at the expense of the rest of the whole world, of course. </p>

Therefor it&#39;s much easier if you have deep pockets, to get legislation that you want. Hence the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.</p>

Because we believe that posting our thoughts on an anonymous forum is less unsettling than looking someone in the eye and challenging their system of thought. Because we don&#39;t really give a shit. Because we like hamburgers and turkeys and gambling and sports and tits and dicks and heros and coffee and leather seats and kisses and beer and hot jeans and video games and awesome movies and bikes and cars and jets and boats and books and bras and thongs and linen and stainless steel and drugs and music and guitars and internets and paintings and orgasms and so on and so forth.

    <div class="md"><p>People sign on the dotted line for all sorts of reasons, but all those different reasons stem from the fact that people think they are a name.  If people think they&#39;re a name they will think they&#39;re required to pay what the name allegedly owes (bills, taxes, etc.); and since they think they&#39;re required to pay they take out &quot;loans&quot; to try paying all the name&#39;s bills.</p>
