<p>Everyone loves the fact that the people are rising up, but come talk to me when these new governments who hate the US and have no allegiance to us essentially stop the flow of oil.  The Suez Canal is probably the biggest oil transport waterway in the Middle East and you idiots don&#39;t realize the significance of losing control of countries in that region.  So remember that when your way of life gets turned upside down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, good point, cause its like our right to support violently oppressive regimes so we can have cheap gas!  Also, at this point no combination of Arab states have the military hardware to defeat Israel.  As long as we do not deny them new weapons, that will not change.  Aside from possibly satellite info, they would not require US involvement.  Also, any credible coalition against them would know that they were facing a nation armed with and likely willing to use nukes.</p>

<p>So, in short, Israel would not fall, and who the fuck are we to piss and moan that our lives may get &quot;turned upside down&quot; (read: more expensive gas; <em>maybe</em>) because the residents of other nations want what we take for granted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, nice etiquette...  Let me try to respond with a little more courtesy.  I understand that <em>oil</em> prices impact the prices of most or all goods, but that does not address my point at all.  You are still just saying: &quot;they need to just put up with a treasonously repressive regime so we can go on living the same lifestyle.  Hmm.  I guess in your view, our comfort is more important than their basic rights...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why your opinion of the way another leader runs his country should matter at all, actually.  If that is your issue with the situation, then why don&#39;t you go over there amid the chaos and try to establish power when the dust settles...Then you can do whatever you want.  But the facts are the facts.  Your issue with this situation needs to be the comfort, stability, and assurances that are now lost because of the fall of this regime.  Their regime may be tyrannical, oppressive, and abusive, but like it or not we were in bed with them.  Oil prices will effect you when you can&#39;t afford feed your family.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;why don&#39;t you go over there amid the chaos and try to establish power when the dust settles&quot;</p>

<p>What are you talking about?  This isn&#39;t about me, nor is it &quot;my issue&quot;.  I do however have a problem with my tax dollars going to support a repressive regime and with the justification being that life in America might get somewhat harder if we don&#39;t continue making life for people in other nations immensely harder than it has to be.</p>

<p>&quot;Your issue with this situation needs to be the comfort, stability, and assurances that are now lost because of the fall of this regime.&quot;</p>

<p>That would be perfectly true if I were a sociopath and thus lacked the ability to care about pain experienced by others.</p>

<p>&quot;like it or not we were in bed with them.&quot;</p>

<p>Uhhhh.  Free societies are not based on &quot;like it or not, your government does shitty things&quot;.  That is a lesson you obviously need to learn.</p>

<p>&quot;Oil prices will effect you when you can&#39;t afford feed your family.&quot;</p>

<p>Not that this is at all likely, but it clearly reiterates your stance that we are more important than them (i.e. bigotry).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im glad you&#39;re not and will never be in a leadership position of any capacity.  You dont seem to understand that we live the way we live and are afforded the luxuries that we enjoy because of strategic alliances with certain groups that are in power (among other things, of course).  Some of these groups in power are oppressive regimes, and may have policies you and people like you don&#39;t agree with.  Why don&#39;t you be proactive and research the other oppressive governments that the US spends your tax money on and call them out on it instead of waiting for a Revolution to be Mr. Know It All and spout your pussy be-nice-to-everyone bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;we live the way we live and are afforded the luxuries that we enjoy because of strategic alliances&quot;</p>

<p>Right.  Just like Scandinavian nation, who contribute billions to repressive regimes, invade other nations and repress their own citizens in order to enjoy the world&#39;s highest standards of living.  Oh wait, they do none of those things and still enjoy the world&#39;s highest standards of living; that is because they don&#39;t waste huge amounts of money killing people for no reason, don&#39;t allow large business interests to dominate their economic policy and actually push for the legal embodiment of human rights.</p>

<p>I would be glad that you will never be in a position of power, but the people in power in this country have moral standards no higher than your own (read: 0).</p>

<p>&quot;research the other oppressive governments that the US spends your tax money on and call them out on it&quot;</p>

<p>I do in my everyday life, but thousands of Americans with far more exposure and public credibility than I do so everyday with no appreciable effect.  I have no money or time or influence to set up a crusading organization that would accomplish nothing; just because I can&#39;t change it doesn&#39;t mean I have to like it or sit silently and listen to self-serving, immoral justifications for it.</p>

<p>&quot;pussy be-nice-to-everyone bullshit.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, being nice to everyone who has never done me any wrong makes me a pussy.  You are pathetically angry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the name of the geographic area in which I live in no way defines me as a person.  If I lived in Scandinavia I would be equally angry about what the US does.  You are simply stuck in a mindset that dictates that its <em>us</em> (whoever us is, Americans, Christians, bigots etc, etc, etc) against <em>them</em>.  It isn&#39;t.  The world is not a zero-sum game.</p>

<p>Why do I hate US policies so much?  Because almost all of them are to the detriment of mankind and most of them are also to the detriment of America and Americans.  Don&#39;t bother with that &quot;love it or leave it&quot; BS; it is the refuge of people who either think their government owns them or simply cannot justify their ill-formed opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AAAHAHAHAHA.  That is really funny because you think it makes sense.  I, who hate the policies of my <em>government</em> (because they are detrimental to me and most of humanity), must then obviously hate my own life.  You, on the other hand, who are ready to sanction violence against anyone threatening your personal, material well being must by inference love your life (except for everything therein that doesn&#39;t benefit you).  Do you see the irony?  You are full of anger against most things and you call it happiness; I am am angry at one thing and you call it self-hatred.</p>

<p>I am honestly beginning to wonder if maybe you&#39;re not shamefully misguided and are actually just a very subtle troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Risks worth taking. Perhaps the government will be forced to release the energy technologies they&#39;ve been hiding for decades, which we should be using already. Either way, if you believe in peak oil, this would have happened eventually anyway as oil is &#39;nonrenewable&#39; so... I fail to see how this would make a difference.

<p>If by &quot;threat&quot; you mean &quot;someone who rises to the brutal nuke-armed Israel&quot;, let Iran be a &quot;threat&quot;. However if you&#39;re trying to say &quot;Iran might be trying to develop nuclear weaponry and use it on its neighbors&quot;, then you&#39;re too bad at Iran-o-phobia.
