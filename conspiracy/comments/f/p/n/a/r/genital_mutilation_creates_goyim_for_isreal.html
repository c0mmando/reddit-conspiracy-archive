       The fact that is happens at all shows Zionist domination. Having mutilated babies shows a conspiracy to effect the future of these children before they can make an informed choice.

       Jewish religion (and its ritual of circumcision) is not the only religion that has weird guidelines that affect physical well-being. Some religions say you shouldn't accept blood transfusions. Others say pigs are not cool, so no pig heart for you, heart-failure dude.

       Other religions, such as Islam, had little or no effect on the practice of circumcising Christian babies in Western nations. The influence was Judaism.

       It is in the nature of the mutilation. Cutting the foreskin is directly related to the religious beliefs of the Zionist. Babies grow up to be adults so what you do to a baby you do to the future. This shows premeditation. The perpetrators of GM knew their actions would have long lasting effects many years into the future.  Other Semitic peoples practice Female Genital Mutilation which is also condemned.

       Yes but that's like saying "vegetarians don't eat pork so they're Muslim extremists". It's a long road from "people are doing stuff because of tradition" to "people are doing this because they want to indoctrinate the young for an world-wide secret movement".

       How is "I have no foreskin like that guy in Isreal" make people in North America fanatic Zionists ? Are all circumcised children brainwashed profoundly to think all that matters is whether you have foreskin or not ?

       And Jehovah's Wtinesses don't take blood transfusions leading to death, practice which probably kills a lot of people. Some countries in Africa practice Female Genitlia Mutilation for different cultural and religious beliefs. Given this, what's your point with circumcision ?

       My point is about Genital Mutilation not "circumcision" . So what is my point with genital mutilation? It is a cruel and barbaric practice of intimidation and domination. It's application to non believers shows predatory behavior.

       We agree: Yeah, of course, genital mutilation is tEh suck. Of course it's cruel and overall useless. Barbaric ? Sure.

      <p>
       Intimidation and domination ? Arguable.

       It's application to non believers, not ethical ? Agreed.

        You are mistaken if you believe there is an error in logic. We have a tradition of indoctrination into the secret world-wide Zionist movement. 2. Yes cutting the penis sends a definite message. The foreskin itself is not the point. It is the act and the fact that it was removed.

       See, that. I don't see that. You're equating circumcision with world-wide Zionist movement indoctrination. The leap of logic is of solar-system magnitude.

       Yeah, well, before you're part of a religion, you're technically a non-believer. So, of course, religious people were at some point not religious. This is an intricate point and really depends on lots of stats I just don't have and
       <em>
        lots
       </em>
       of definitions that have not been established (what is a believer, when is the decision
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       on them, what is their point of view of this act prior to it, what is their point of view after, do they even care, how many non-believers are involved, what chances do they have of escaping the circumcision, etc etc etc etc).

       Catholic Church “acquires its members through a compulsory act, namely, through the baptism of infants that do not yet have a will of their own”. This act was “irrevocable” and is buttressed by threats of excommunication and the fires of hell.

       It was “a grave impairment of the personal freedom of development and of a person’s emotional and mental integrity”. "

       Did you know that circumcision in Africa is being practiced more and more these days?  It has been proven to help prevent the spread of AIDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make the Zionists responsible for helping to stop the spread of AIDS?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is AIDS itself a Zionist conspiracy?
      </p>
      <p>
       But if AIDS is the fault of Zionists (Gay Zionists? -- they're extra-bad!) then obviously they figured that their circumcisions would save them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if having no foreskin saves you from AIDS why wouldn't the Zionists just let all the Africans die so they could steal their land?
      </p>
      <p>
       OHHH! now I get it...   Unless you are Jewish, having no foreskin makes you instantly into a Goy for Israel. (Does it also make your mind susceptible for being controlled by airplane exhaust and microwaves???)
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually AIDS will kill everyone who has a foreskin so eventually all people will be either a Zionist or a Woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then the Zionists will get all the land and all the women of the men who used to have foreskins!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow that's so diabolical a plan!!!  I bet a secret group of Jews Who Control The World came up with it.

       Good thing I'm a conspiratard or I'd never have caught on.

       We agree: Yeah, of course, genital mutilation is tEh suck. Of course it's cruel and overall useless. Barbaric ? Sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intimidation and domination ? Arguable.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's application to non believers, not ethical ? Agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is a continent away from "genital mutilation creates fanatics " or anything of the sort.
