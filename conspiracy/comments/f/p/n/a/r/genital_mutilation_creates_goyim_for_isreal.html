<p>Jewish religion (and its ritual of circumcision) is not the only religion that has weird guidelines that affect physical well-being. Some religions say you shouldn&#39;t accept blood transfusions. Others say pigs are not cool, so no pig heart for you, heart-failure dude.</p>

<p>Yes but that&#39;s like saying &quot;vegetarians don&#39;t eat pork so they&#39;re Muslim extremists&quot;. It&#39;s a long road from &quot;people are doing stuff because of tradition&quot; to &quot;people are doing this because they want to indoctrinate the young for an world-wide secret movement&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>How is &quot;I have no foreskin like that guy in Isreal&quot; make people in North America fanatic Zionists ? Are all circumcised children brainwashed profoundly to think all that matters is whether you have foreskin or not ?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And Jehovah&#39;s Wtinesses don&#39;t take blood transfusions leading to death, practice which probably kills a lot of people. Some countries in Africa practice Female Genitlia Mutilation for different cultural and religious beliefs. Given this, what&#39;s your point with circumcision ?</p>

<li>You are mistaken if you believe there is an error in logic. We have a tradition of indoctrination into the secret world-wide Zionist movement. 2. Yes cutting the penis sends a definite message. The foreskin itself is not the point. It is the act and the fact that it was removed.</li>

<p>See, that. I don&#39;t see that. You&#39;re equating circumcision with world-wide Zionist movement indoctrination. The leap of logic is of solar-system magnitude. </p>

<p>Yeah, well, before you&#39;re part of a religion, you&#39;re technically a non-believer. So, of course, religious people were at some point not religious. This is an intricate point and really depends on lots of stats I just don&#39;t have and <em>lots</em> of definitions that have not been established (what is a believer, when is the decision <em>forced</em> on them, what is their point of view of this act prior to it, what is their point of view after, do they even care, how many non-believers are involved, what chances do they have of escaping the circumcision, etc etc etc etc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you know that circumcision in Africa is being practiced more and more these days?  It has been proven to help prevent the spread of AIDS.</p>

<p>Does that make the Zionists responsible for helping to stop the spread of AIDS?  </p>

<p>Or is AIDS itself a Zionist conspiracy?  </p>

<p>But if AIDS is the fault of Zionists (Gay Zionists? -- they&#39;re extra-bad!) then obviously they figured that their circumcisions would save them.  </p>

<p>But if having no foreskin saves you from AIDS why wouldn&#39;t the Zionists just let all the Africans die so they could steal their land?</p>

<p>OHHH! now I get it...   Unless you are Jewish, having no foreskin makes you instantly into a Goy for Israel. (Does it also make your mind susceptible for being controlled by airplane exhaust and microwaves???) </p>

<p>Eventually AIDS will kill everyone who has a foreskin so eventually all people will be either a Zionist or a Woman.</p>

<p>So then the Zionists will get all the land and all the women of the men who used to have foreskins!!!!</p>

<p>Wow that&#39;s so diabolical a plan!!!  I bet a secret group of Jews Who Control The World came up with it.</p>

<p>Good thing I&#39;m a conspiratard or I&#39;d never have caught on. </p>
