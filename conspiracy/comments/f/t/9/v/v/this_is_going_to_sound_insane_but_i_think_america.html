       I can provide pictures if necessary. They're not very interesting, because there's literally nothing going on aside from peaceful marching.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I've got a close family friend in Tripoli as we speak. He's there on business work, but he couldn't help but check out the protests. What did he find? Peaceful, pro-Gaddafi marches all throughout the capitol. He sat on the steps of parliament as CNN reported that it was burning.
      </p>
      <p>
       He hasn't heard any shooting or seen any massacre, and he's been in the capitol for a week. However, this is what I thought you guys would find most-interesting; he says that the almost-unanimous local opinion is that the protests that we're hearing about on the news are all coming from extra-national mercenaries who are being brought in by a third party to destabilize the region. Everybody he's asked is blaming America and Britain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't downvote me to oblivion, but I thought this would make for some interesting discussion.

       I think they captured them from another part of the country that fell to the rebellion (seriously once they have tanks, it's not a "protest").
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it wouldn't be the first time that the US helped overthrow a country for its own interest.  Plausible.

       I never said that the protests were peaceful.  They may have started peacefully, but at some point it became a civil war.  I was just explaining how they could have tanks without foreign involvement.

       I think this is reasonable to think about. I did some checking... here are some facts about Libya that make me think we are not being told the whole truth about these demonstrations:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libya has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libya has one of the highest standards of living in Africa.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Average life expectancy in Libya is over 70 years old.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libya has no weapons of mass destruction.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In Libya, everyone has access to free health care.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Education in Libya is free and compulsory.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libya gives aid money to it's neighbors.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         3% of people in Libya are without access to clean water.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libya imposes certain restrictions on corporations, which means that the private sector is mainly made up of small businesses. This means that although there is corruption in the government, the wealth disparity in Libya is relatively small... this is not a polarized country.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Living in the US, I have to say, I'm no socialist, but Libya doesn't sound too bad by comparison. If they have any idea what we are going through over here, they won't be in a hurry to trade in their military dictatorship for a democracy like our one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit: Libya is known for imprisoning and torturing dissenters, and Gaddafi is no angel. This situation seems to have been slightly improving recently see

       Must admit the Libyan protests caugh me by surprise too. I had a friend at uni whose dad was an agricultural scientist who specialised in desert agriculture (Gaddafi was spending millions to greenify the desert) and he told me only positive things about Libya and how they they generally were better off than most middle eastern/African countries. This was about 20 years ago at a time when people in the US were wearing those scoped Gaddafi tshirts and when he was public enemy #1. It was was particular weird coming from this guy because he was also a full on Liberal (like your Republicans).

       WOW. This is
       <em>
        incredible
       </em>
       information. As is SteveDave123's similar post elsewhere in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already known for some time that we are in the middle of a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       elaborate psychological operation in which stimuli which prompts us to distrust world powers and revolt is being
       <em>
        made
       </em>
       accessible to us, on
       <em>
        purpose,
       </em>
       but in a way that is subtle, and seems to be fooling many into believing they are discovering this information independently. A bit of further elucidation can be found by
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ctoc8/shits_about_to_get_real_the_united_states/c0v6ske">
        reading this post
       </a>
       and following the links included within it.
      </p>
      <p>
       there absolutely
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a hidden hand in Libya, just as there is in Tunisia, and just as there was in Egypt. I do not know if it is exclusively American. Frankly, it does not matter. What I do know is that one purpose the visibility of the situation
       <em>
        intentionally
       </em>
       serves, if no other, is inclining us, as a population, to conclude revolutions of a nature similar to those being publicized will be successful when instantiated within the USA. They
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       be successful. It's part of the plan. Read my posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       listen to me. You are not insane. I know what I'm talking about. I've known for a
       <em>
        long time,
       </em>
       too; I'm especially good at it. I have written
       <em>
        lots
       </em>
       detailing my process of coming to understand what is happening and I will
       <em>
        gladly
       </em>
       play as involved a role as is necessary in helping others determine how it pertains if I am approached.
      </p>
      <p>
       keep your eyes
       <em>
        open
       </em>
       as
       <em>
        fuck.
       </em>
       Trust absolutely nothing of its own merit, including what appears to come from sources in opposition to the system, and including what appears to come from individuals. Like I said, this campaign is
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       elaborate. All means of verifying it even
       <em>

       The "benefits" are two-fold.

      <ol>

        <p>
         Easy and instant destabilization of Israel's neighbors and main contenders, they will benefit directly from the new leadership of Libya, and have been trying to shape Egypt to their liking for as long as their existence.   The Zionist run media is very good publicizing these "revolutions" as freedom-loving and beneficial.

         Subconsciously affect the US public into to thinking that semi-violent revolution is plausible, and stylish.   If the public incites violence first, that gives the government the ability to DROP the iron hammer on the public.    Bill Cooper was warning about the gov. trying this tactic forever, before he was killed for predicting Israel's involvement in 9/11.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Things aren't as they appear, and yes you are correct, there is a huge media backed psy-op to prepare the American public to incite violence to justify dropping the hammer.   Things are about to get messy.

       don't get too bold. I would definitely say you're on point regarding the destabilization of the region and the subsequent empowerment of Israel, but I would also say Israel is just a resource, a
       <em>
        tendril,
       </em>
       of the
       <em>
        real

       monster, and that facilitating this role Israel plays is the true reason the system wishes to keep it in power, rather than actually having a stake in Israel, or what we are led to understand of it.

       Zionism is also a cover. The more we

       </em>
       the more we specify this or that agency is distinctly affiliated, the less true our allegations are likely to end up. It is my firm belief the involvement of Zionism is both indistinguishable and ultimately irrelevant.

       false. Hard proof means something different to everybody. There's a vast number of people who think having this or that official source iterate something on the TV is hard proof, for example. And one tier above that is
       <em>
        you,

       predetermined by your suspicion of the mainstream, which is
       <em>

       Pfff. You are both in the same pocket. The psychological operation I mention most certainly exploits your reliance on this verifiability, while also having a heavy hand in how verifiability is

       I completely understand, you are talking about the logical evolution of consciousness and perception as spurred by the infinite amount of wealthy information available, by the new forms of communication not restricted by our current lexicon,   In order to evolve into proper Meta-Consciousness we need to observe the way that
       <em>
        we
       </em>
       ourselves think.  And to make and apply changes based on those observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The laws of nature have never changed from the time King Wang wrote the I Ching, and all forms of evolution and natural progression are predictable to a certain degree, it will start slowly but become an unstoppable force of joint realities collaborating into a new form.   Robert Anton Wilson has talked about these changes is human spiritual/psychological and conscious evolution for years.   Terrence McKenna also, but when it comes to breaking the Mask Reality that most people perceive, we need to provide evidence to them on
       <em>
        their terms
       </em>
       in
       <em>
        their language
       </em>
       so that they too can understand and contribute to this "new world".
      </p>
      <p>
       I never meant to get Esoteric in this subject, but you seem to think that is the only form of intellectual communication capable of explaining the current situation.   It is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot prove anything, all I have is what I perceive, and it may be different than what you perceive, but I can attempt to piece together a coherent storyline from the available resources that is enough to show people that what is occurring is planned event and who is planning it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have spoken to Isu, he says it is true (as true as any "time-restricted" event may be.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Reiki isn't enough these days, and channeling is easily intercepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have to turn logic, before we can even begin to think about explaining or preparing people for understanding the Logical PERMANENCE of a Paradox.   Reality itself is the product of a paradox, logic itself is paradoxical in nature (nothing is true except that that is true).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have crossed these boundaries, I've been down the rabbit-hole, seen the end of the rainbow etc. etc. So, please inform me what you know and we can skip the intellectual "holier-than thou" card.  I've been/seen that all before and now is not the time.  Not meaning to be rude, but I really can't stand that.   There's no reason we can't have a logical discussion about this subject.

       It's not just the wealth, it's the weapons, and control or public perception.   Israel and the US are the 2 most well Armed and propagated countries in the world.

       Follow the money; this is all being driven by a very deliberately implemented economic emergency, and it's entirely reasonable to assume all the unrest is a planned contingency. Plan A for Iran failed, and plan B necessitates a lot of dead wood be cleared from North Africa and the Middle East, as useful as it has been in the past. CIA/Mossad will now work over the next several years to steer the Sunni hay wagon the bankers have ignited (as righteous as the flames may be, they are hot just the same) toward Shia Iran by clandestinely supporting and encouraging militant Islam's efforts to co-opt the revolution. The ideal situation is a legion of hot, angry young Arabs locked in eternal combat with a similar legion of hot, angry young Persians, while Israel quietly mops up the rest of the Palestinian problem and prospers along with the various global corporate entities operating in the background.

       While I can see a lot of merit in what you say, I would be surprised if the powers-that-be were using revolution in the USA as a mechanism to change the world order.

      <p>
       Once these things get going, I imagine they're a bit difficult to control: they're as likely to end in mass murder as an improvement.  Look what happened in Iran: if the USA had a hand in that, they blew it badly.  I don't think Iran is that bad a country compared with lots of others in the region, but it's been maintaining its hatred of the USA for more than a generation now.

       Because America and Britain have the resources to stage hundreds of thousands of non-Libyans in Libya, right? The USA didn't even have enough Arabic translators after 9/11, where would they get hundreds of thousands of ethnic, properly dressed, language appropriate fauxtestors?

       Most stories coming out of foreign news state that it is not the Libyan army (which are defecting to Malta and other places because they refuse to kill their own people) that these are paid mercenaries, receiving (I have read) around $2,000.00 a day to go around and massacare the population.

       Noone is saying that the protesters are fake. I was trying to say that mabey we should pay more attention to those who are physically attacking the protesters. Are they Libyan army? Paid mercenaries? If so...paid by Gaddafi? Some outside force that would benefit from the overthrow of Gaddafi?
      </p>
      <p>
       After Egypt ousted Mubarak, more was able to be heard from the protesters there, and many of them feel that America had an influence in the protests. Not they didn't support the fall of the Mubarak regime, just that they didn't support our goverment's ability to come in and have such an affect in their country.

       I have heard this as well - interestingly enough, I work with a guy who 'has a friend in Bahrain' and sent him an email on FB. He forwarded it to me, and
       <del>
        this was pretty much
       </del>
       is what it said:
      </p>
      <p>
       Dear Sky News
      </p>
      <p>
       I am currently living in Bahrain. I have lived here for thirty years. I am a British born naturalised Bahraini. I am a businesswoman and a mother of two.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been watching your coverage of the current situation in Bahrain with increasing dismay. It is not the whole truth. You are not talking to any of the Bahraini's who do NOT support the rioters. At this very minute, our streets are packed with thousands of peaceful Bahrainis loyal to the King and the Government who are marching throught the streets to make it clear to the world we are happy with our leadership. It is being broadcast on Bahrain TV, on Al Jazeera News, so why are SKY NEWS ignoring this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your Headines even as I write this are talking about "Anger in Bahrain', well yes there is anger, but not just anger from the illegal rioters.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is even more anger from true Bahraini's who are sick of external forces trying to interfere in our affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at history, read Bahrain's Consitution, talk to Bahrainis and expats alike who live here in total harmony . I realise telling the truth may not be as sensational or provide such graphic headlines, but your handling of this is unfair and will only serve to jeopordise all the progress Bahrain has made since our King voluntarily brought about democratic and social reforms ten years ago. His Majesty had a clear vision for his country. Other Arab leaders who questioned his wisdom at that time now find themselves wishing they had emulated him. Bahrain is not Libya, Yemen, Tunisia or Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in the most free, open, liberal country in the Middle East, we have free education, and healthcare for all, women have equal rights under the law and there are jobs for everyone who REALLY wants to work. There are free Training Programmes, free business set up and development advice and grants, and press freedom that you will not witness elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rioters have lots of rights under our laws, they hold senior positions in lots of government posts, they hold 18 out of 40 seats in parliament and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drive through any of the shia villages either today or over the last four decades and you will find pictures not of Bahrain's leaders but of political and religious leaders of another country in this region. What does that tell you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite all of this blatent disloyalty to Bahrain, (some would call it treason) our government continues to do everything it can to meet their demands .
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike Britain, where David Cameron recently admitted that 'multiculturalism had failed', Bahrain is a shining beacon to the world that multiculturalism can and does work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has worked here for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Bahrain muslims, jews, hindus, christians, buddhists all enjoy religious freedom and we all live in harmony. Why? Because in Bahrain we recognise that abiding by the law and showing mutual respect for your fellow citizen comes before anything else. We are all "Bahrainis" before we are muslims, jews, hindus, christians, or buddhists and that is why multiculturalism works here in Bahrain. Of course multiculturism can only work where citizens respect the laws of Bahrain and love the country in which they reside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therein you have the answer to why we have illegal rioters .
      </p>
      <p>
       Many, many of Bahrain's wealthiest businessmen and women are Shia, why are they not amongst the rioters on the streets? Why do you not talk to some of them? I have many shia friends who are as equally appalled as I am at this current situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does your Reporter in Bahrain show only coverage of the injured rioters in hospital? Why not also the injured police?
      </p>
      <p>
       You showed pictures of weapons confiscated from the rioters, but you did not reveal that was where they came from. You have allowed your viewers to assume they were weapons used by police against the rioters. Manipulative reporting which does you no credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is more heartbroken than our King, that violence has been involved and that blood has been shed on the streets of our beloved Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       His Majesty has been incredibly patient, some would say too patient, he has freed political prisoners and convicted criminals many times over in the hope that his forgiveness and generosity of spirit would serve as an example and would allow these people another chance to live a fruitful life and offer them the opportunity to tread the path of their fellow Bahrainis, showing loyalty and respect to their King and country.
      </p>
      <p>
       All Bahrainis love their King, whether sunnis, shia, jews, christians. This love is the glue that holds our society together and will continue to do so even in our darkest hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please listen to both sides, please report both sides truthfully, fairly and professionally. It is what we expect from SKY NEWS.
      </p>
      <p>
       These rioters have every right under our laws to air their grievances and pursue their demands by legal, peaceful means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please read our Consitution and you will see what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, to the instigators of this turmoil. For decades, you have failed to achieve the destruction of our country. You will continue to fail, because the people of Bahrain will continue to stand unstintingly behind their Leadership.
      </p>

       Obviously I am sure our intelligence community has had its eyes on Libya, after all we have had a rocky relation with them up til almost a decade ago but I certainly do not think that they were a major player in instigating the revolution.  It also doesnt help the conspiracy when you consider that the protests that are spreading through the arab world are mostly happening to leaders that we have supported.  We must also consider all the people contacting channels like Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya seem to have eye witness accounts in many places in the country that contradict what your one family friend is saying.  Gaddafi is hardly a benevolent leader and he has ruled a police state for over 40 years, is it really hard to imagine that the citizens are honestly fed up with his rule?

       I think it's entirely possible that the United States is behind all the recent uprisings.  It strikes me as highly unlikely that things would actually domino like this without some help.  Too much coordination and logistics help is needed for all these various movements.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think about it, much more effective way of causing change without sending in the military.  If this is CIA/MI6/Mossad it's an operation done very well and the reason I support having these groups around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the same thing when all that Iran shit went down a couple of years ago. If it was CIA both times, maybe this is all to get back to Iran.  They got close but didn't quite succeed the first time, so now, get it going in other countries so there is a lot of momentum by the time you bring it back to Iran.

       I was at the gym, watching the TV without sound, and I saw CNN's Anderson Cooper covering the Libya story. Cooper is without a doubt a CIA agent. Read his background, joined the CIA, then quit, then miraculously was doing independent reporting all over war torn Africa. He is a gem in the CIA domestic media division. I could see the zeal in his eyes just watching without sound. Seriously, it's that simple, what else do I need to know about the story other than Anderson Cooper thinks its good and important, hence, the CIA thinks its good and important, hence the shadow government thinks its good and important. Draw your own conclusions about who is really pulling the strings, but I'm pretty sure its not Obama.

       Its all about controlling the release of the potential energy wells.  In the case of earthquakes the energy is built up through natural forces, the trick is making the energy transfer into another form at the moment of your choosing, ie an earthquake weapon.  HAARP stores energy in huge capacitors (energy wells) and then directs that at the atmosphere which releases an even greater energy source in the atmosphere towards different ends.  The glass sitting on the edge of the table is in a gravitational energy well and that energy can be unleashed with a tap of the finger to create a distraction.   For bullets a lot of energy is stored in chemical form and that energy is used in one moment to decisively change an outcome.  Who pulls the trigger and how the gun is pointed determines everything.  On a social level the potential energy has been gaining in the Middle East for some time and it is simply a matter of using that stored energy for a particular outcome.  The people are genuinely upset but how that energy is put to use is the question.

       I don't really enjoy WND, just thought it was somewhat relevant. It is good to get all the details, from all sides.
