       The rich and powerful hate Anonymous. That is why they are trying to regulate the internet and pass the killswitch bills.

      <p>
       These group of hacktivists are protesting corruption and illicit activities that affect our world. There are a minority in Anonymous that engage in activities that detract from the overall goal. But, you can't blame Anonymous for standing up for what's right in society.

       We can all help in our own little ways. It starts by recognizing that the people who hold the money and the power are the enemy -- that there is no external threat from terrorism or invasion, the threat is internal and comes from those who have designed and who run the system of oppression and extortion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once we recognize this, we can begin to communicate this awareness to others. When the realization dawns, it can never be extinguished.

       Let us not forget that the practise of terrorism is very real and has been evolving along with man for hundreds of thousands of years.  Indeed, modern terrorism is the direct result of our long-term foreign policy along with the incorporation of new technologies into warfare.  In a statistical context, terrorism should be of little concern as it doesn't kill many people relative to other causes.  Not yet at least.

       Terrible example. There is a difference between doing something for a cause and doing something because your a total idiot. Standing up for what you believe in is a cause, everybody driving over the speed limit is idiotic. From what I have read so far the majority of what anonymous is doing is for a cause(s). And they aren't bad ones either.

       How is it terrible?
Just because the cause isn't something you support. IMO it's identical. The regulation of information closely relates to examples which center around the creation, management, and usage of roads both public and private.
Traffic patterns, congestion, risk, management, enforcement...

       I'm not disagreeing with you that the idea behind both is the same just that the example was bad. I think what OP meant was we should stand together to make a better world. Not cultivate a million road fatalities a day. No offence.

       A cop can ruin your day even if you have
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       you can really be pulled over for. Your cocky attitude
       <em>
        will

       have him/her search for shit you didn't even know existed. Crooked light, too low light on bumper, 1 mile over the limit, swerved too much, saw you on the phone. Cops can and will make shit up. They can and will ruin your day and days after (court).

       I googled "anonymous internet crimes" and found
       <a href="https://cybercrimes.wordpress.com/category/anonymous/page/4/">
        this blog
       </a>
       that reports on some criminal behavior. One of the problems with Anonymous, other than being a tricky search term, is that it's easy to blame them for many things. I like what Anonymous does sometimes, and sometimes not so much.

       Thanks, I certainly don't agree with everything that Anonymous does, but seeing as it's anonymous I guess some crazies can get mixed up in with it which might explain some of the more radical stuff. I like anonymous for the anti-government and pro freedom parts.

       You have to expect government injections into what the entire world sees as Anonymous too though.  It's too easy to do since they don't need to fake credentials or anything to talk to Anon and get a movement going with random people.

       Wait... If you don't like what this group is doing, then do your own thing while using the name of the group; we're all part of the group whether or not we realize it, but we are most powerful when we are united...  I'm confused. Are we supposed to be united or are we supposed to do our own thing when we disagree with the unity?

       It is like being apart of the anti-war movement, if you don't agree with what the people with bullhorns are saying - get your own bullhorn. This is your generation - this is your short time on this planet - either work with everyone who is trying to make the planet better or criticize from the sidelines (but don't pretend like you don't have power to take over a movement without any leadership - the only leaders are good ideas).

       Terrible example. There is a difference between doing something for a cause and doing something because your a total idiot. Standing up for what you believe in is a cause, everybody driving over the speed limit is idiotic. From what I have read so far the majority of what anonymous is doing is for a cause(s). And they aren't bad ones either.

       Eventually they would just flip the switch and shut down the roads.
They pull you over, take away your right to drive, but they would NEVER change the law.
