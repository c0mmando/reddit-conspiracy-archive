<p>Every day I see the pieces coming together, and solidifying themselves behind illegal laws that were designed to destroy our Constitution and tear away our freedom. What do you think we should do (legally) to preserve our Liberty and destroy these criminal institutions that are destroying this great Nation?</p>

<p>Ron Paul read into record charges against the Bush jr and sr of war crimes. He is also auditing the Federal Reserve. And there is a public push against the Unconstitutional &quot;Patriot Act&quot; but it appears Congress is going to pass it in secret, and possibly try to make it permanent.</p>

<p>But people are waking up more and more, but will it be in time? How long do you think we have to stop this before we have to RECLAIM our freedom instead of preserve it?</p>

<p>And finally, do you think we can win this for freedom and the world?</p>

The media is controlled by Zionists. The entire money system with its inbuilt debt slavery is designed and run by Zionists. Remove the power and money from Zionist hands, and you remove the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Zionist people are war loving people, and they feel entitled to all things tangible. </p>

<p>We have a problem in this country, the Zionist constructed a wall of fear and blame. This has cause many news reporters to become actors, and the Main stream media, is completely Zionist controlled. </p>

<p>The truth is people are scared to be called anti-semitic, and this causes them to shudder when they must speak the truth. It is widely regarded as the Holocaust industry. They use the holocaust to guilt people into agreeing with them.</p>

<p>The issue will always be this: Who writes the laws, the books, the news, the movies, the entertainment, and the curriculum? and they even control the currency!!(via Federal reserve)</p>

<p>The problem is simple, stop the ZIONIST WORLD ORDER. </p>

<p>edit: forgot to mention the banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>and it sounds like before the &quot;zionist&quot; aspect you saw it, do still see the truth?</p>

<p>I ask because I thought you were being sarcastic.</p>

<p>I accept that zionism is just a name for a group, which their &#39;club&#39; has its rituals and belief&#39;s which resembles a &quot;religion&quot;. What they believe exactly I am not sure, I have gone the road of documentation facts and illegal activity... And I will explain why I have decided to leave the/their religion out of it: 1st) IF we pursue this in a religious ....conflict scenario, involve other religious figures, Pat whoever will need a roller coaster to fight the Zions. And choosing a &#39;holy war&#39; is laid out in the Bible, and it will wage for 1000 years. I am HOPING for a lil quicker!! 2nd) It would become a war on &quot;terrorists&quot; with no flags no faces and anyone pointing saying, &quot;Zionist&quot; and then the &quot;good people&quot; go all TSA on their asses, and we dont need that situation either because thats where we are right now. Same demon different face.</p>

<p>However if we attack them through organizations, groups, and associations we can then attack them in a legal capacity. And keep the religion OUT of it. Because face it. the people of America will not get behind a &#39;Holy War&#39;, BUT they will ban together against legal injustice!!</p>

<p>The farthest I have delved into understanding their belief&#39;s is Bohemian Grove movie (yes its Alex, him and one other man have ever gotten footage out during a closed ceremony, so if you want to see what happens inside there your choices are limited) and tit-bits here and there from other sources.</p>

<p>We need a group name for skull and bones, Illuminati and the Builderburg Group to bulk them into instead of by religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing that Zionists believe ( to the best of my knowledge, and correct me if I&#39;m wrong) is the second coming of Christ including Armageddon. They seek the end of the world as we know it in pursuit of their God.
 I find that to be an abhorrent  belief because they seek the end of what we all work for which is a better future for mankind. The willful destruction of the earth as we know it can be arranged by enough zealots working in concert ( a conspiracy)  but it is a criminal intent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have extremely low expectations for any sort of positive reform happening at the federal level at all, for anything.</p>

<p>We have an issue that everyone cares about, marijuana prohibition, that has broad support and transcends race, gender, age, etc. lines and we get no reforms in that area at all.  And everyone is ok with it.</p>

<p>So when I see things about people trying to bring attention to issues that are important... like foreign policy, the Patriot Act, monetary policy, etc. I have very low hopes for any improvement.  Even if we did an incredible job spreading the message and got everyone talking about it, like marijuana, nothing would happen.</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s a defeatist attitude but I don&#39;t see it being inaccurate at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not inaccurate, big part of why I made this post in the first place. And I do agree with legalizing marijuana and always have been, statistically its probably the LEAST harmful thing we can consume. Not to mention the MASSIVE industry that can be constructed around it. Creating MILLIONS of jobs, from fuel production, medical usage, rope, and a multitude of other products and materials.</p>

<p>But I am not one to give up, I&#39;ll be the frog half way down the pelicans throat with my hands around its neck preventing it from swallowing. Therefore I will persevere, because if we dont our children will grow up in hell. (I wish that was a pun) </p>

<p>The only thing I can do right now that makes me feel like I am able to do something is to find petitions to sign (hope those still work) and finding these individuals that are following evil orders on social networks and giving them hell on their pages, and explaining to their &#39;fans&#39; why We are upset. example: The DHS censored Jesse Ventura&#39;s show then ordered cable providers to go into customers DRV&#39;s and delete the program on them. Once Alex received the documentation from his source showing it WAS the DHS, HUNDREDS of people went to the DHS and several other people associated with the incident facebook profiles and filled anywhere they could find an area to post, to let others know the truth about these people. When 500 comments are all about the same thing the most skeptical person reading this would have to at least wonder. Otherwise they feel they are an outcast for not following the majority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you guys are right about these conspiracies it was too late a thousand years ago.  If the powers that be are as evil and powerful as you think - and as good as manipulating - the game is over.  Most of the populace doesn&#39;t believe any of this conspiracy stuff and the evidence that is put forward is vague and circumstantial.  It&#39;s not convincing people (even smart open-minded people) because it isn&#39;t convincing enough.  Maybe it IS true, but there is not enough evidence to convince me, or most other people.    If you can&#39;t convince at the least a very large minority of society you can&#39;t win, not within democracy, not within a revolution either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually our forefathers did bring this power to a hault.. for a time with the Constitution. I will refer to a large portion of their quotes. The Constitution prevented Government under restriction from growing and abusing their authority. The Patriot act basically decimates the Constitution. </p>

<p>First Thank you for being open enough to look at the possibility. Let me just say this; wikileaks hit the big news, now wikileaks has been doing this for years, only now America got burned. and that is why Ron Paul read charges of war crimes against Bush and Mini-Bush and this is why America went to war against Wikileaks and still looks to take out its owner if they get a chance. Take a day and search around &#39;believing its all true&#39; and digging deeper and deeper, start with Frontline, Secret America its a PBS publication and then on youtube they still have the Conspiracy Theory by Gov Jesse Ventura shows that DHS has censored and even ordered the cable companies to go into people&#39;s DVR&#39;s and deleted saved recordings of his Police State episode. There is no cure for the blue pill, or the red If you want some links let us know</p>

<p>And I agree, I am not expecting any remarkable revelations with this post, just open a forum to toss around Ideas of steps we might be able to take. And get others opinions on: chances of success, timeline, defensive, offensive, actions, organizations, legal means, anything basically. </p>

If the powers that be are as evil and powerful as you think - and as good as manipulating - the game is over.  Most of the populace doesn&#39;t believe any of this conspiracy stuff and the evidence that is put forward is vague and circumstantial.  It&#39;s not convincing people (even smart open-minded people) because it isn&#39;t convincing enough.  Maybe it IS true, but most people don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true.    If you can&#39;t convince at the least a very large minority of society you can&#39;t win, not within democracy, not within a revolution either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t look like controlled demolitions at all.  All the &quot;evidence&quot; suggesting controlled demolitions is based on faulty assumptions, distrust, and hubris.  Maybe they looked like controlled demolitions because buildings collapsed, but that&#39;s where the similarities end.  I&#39;ve seen every shred of proffered evidence against the official 9/11 story, and none of it makes any sense.  It&#39;s either outright fabrication or a complete misunderstanding of physics.  Every &quot;anomaly&quot; highlighted is easily (and more readily) explained by simple mechanics.</p>

<p>But that is no surprise to anyone.  All the claims have been thoroughly debunked; far more plausible explanations for all phenomena have been given; and the story has been put to rest with anyone with an iota of rational thought left in their body.  The only people who re-hash these &quot;zomg!!! demolition!!!&quot; claims are those who seem to ignore actual evidence that goes against their pet theory, and elevate anything in support of it to the state of divine revelation.  That is irrational beyond belief.</p>

<p>Building 7?  It&#39;s fucking obvious why it fell - the nearest tower shed loads of debris on it, which carved out the entire back side of the building, causing it to collapse.</p>

<p>Surely you mean: &quot;the only steel buildings <strong>THAT HAVE EVER BEEN HIT BY FULLY-FUELLED AIRLINERS AT CRUISING SPEED</strong> to ever collapse from <strong>BEING HIT BY AIRLINERS AND BURNING IN A HIGHLY-VENTILATED ENVIRONMENT, WITHOUT FIRE RETARDATION, SPRINKLERS, OR FIREMEN FIGHTING THE BLAZE</strong>&quot;, as that&#39;s the only logical comparison you can make.  No other buildings have been subjected to that, so your neat &quot;forgetting the planes&quot; argument is clearly completely invalid.  You are comparing apples with oranges.</p>

If you want to learn anything about conspiracies, it&#39;s not advisable to just make shit up and believe whatever shit others make up.  Critical thinking is essential to discern fact from fiction.  You seem to embrace anything that supports your already-formed conclusion, which is the antithesis of learning.

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about?  Are you really that bad at understanding logic?</p>

<p>Alex Jones professes to having the inside information on dangerous international cabals.  If that was the case, those cabals would want him dead, as he&#39;s doing them great damage by highlighting their existence.  The fact he&#39;s not dead means one of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li> Shadowy secret cabals which require invisibility don&#39;t mind being talked about on radio and the internet by hundreds of thousands of people</li>
<li> The shadowy secret cabals don&#39;t exist, and Alex Jones is wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p>It has nothing to do with your incredibly simplistic idea that I&#39;m suggesting &quot;dead = right&quot;.  You really, really fail at this logic stuff, don&#39;t you.  No wonder you believe the nonsense you do if my simple post overextended your logical ability.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh for fuck&#39;s sake.  The people who disagree with the official story have not investigated it.  They didn&#39;t get samples of the steel and perform tests.  They just got all paranoid-delusional and called foul without reason.</p>

<p>Building 7?  It&#39;s fucking obvious why it fell - the nearest tower shed loads of debris on it, which carved out the entire back side of the building, causing it to collapse.</p>

<p>Surely you mean: &quot;the only steel buildings <strong>THAT HAVE EVER BEEN HIT BY FULLY-FUELLED AIRLINERS AT CRUISING SPEED</strong> to ever collapse from <strong>BEING HIT BY AIRLINERS AND BURNING IN A HIGHLY-VENTILATED ENVIRONMENT, WITHOUT FIRE RETARDATION, SPRINKLERS, OR FIREMEN FIGHTING THE BLAZE</strong>&quot;, as that&#39;s the only logical comparison you can make.  No other buildings have been subjected to that, so your neat &quot;forgetting the planes&quot; argument is clearly completely invalid.  You are comparing apples with oranges.</p>
