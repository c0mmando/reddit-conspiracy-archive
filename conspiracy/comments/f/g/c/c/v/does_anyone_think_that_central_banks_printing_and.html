    <div class="md"><p>What about Jackson and Lincoln?  Andrew Jackson was well known for defeating a central bank in his time, and Abraham Lincoln created government printed money in defiance of private banks.  Also, JFK signed a bill instating silver-backed government issued notes (which was later nullified by Lyndon Johnson) and his face is on the silver half-dollar.  </p>

<p>I find all of this completely unnerving and almost seems like a big fuck you by the banksters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just had a realization along these lines the other day...</p>

<p>I&#39;m starting to think we really do collectively create our reality from a subatomic level, thanks to quantum physics, and if so it makes sense to me that we would all have an equal hand in the creation.  If you manipulate other people into wanting the same reality that you want, it might be possible to gain an upper-hand by using other people as an &quot;amplifier&quot; or whatever it would be called.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that it&#39;s much easier to get people to enslave themselves than to force slavery onto them, and in fact I wonder if it would even be possible to force a large group of humans into slavery.  Point being; the easiest way to enslave people is to get them to help enslave themselves.</p>

<p>I wonder if the signature for the &quot;loan&quot; is where people help enslave themselves.  As I understand it, the money and debt wouldn&#39;t exist without the signature.</p>

<p>The first step is to recognize the problem, and the second step is to find a solution:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best part is this was figured out way before our time:</p>

<p>&#39;‘The definition of an idea, as observed by someone who understands the events of the day, may shed more light on the historical process than many volumes.</p>

<p>‘History, as seen by a Monetary Economist, is a continuous struggle between producers and non-producers, and those who try to make a living by inserting a false system of book-keeping between the producers and their just recompense.</p>

<p>“The usurers act through fraud, falsification, superstitions, habits and, when these methods do not function, they let loose a war. Everything hinges on monopoly, and the particular monopolies hinge around the great illusionistic monetary monopoly.’</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah this... because the governments don&#39;t have any money, they create &#39;securities&#39; and sell it to the money printers for the paper.</p>

<p>They should be able to print it themselves of course, but thats why &#39;they&#39; built the system the way it is today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t understand why-why the government allowed &#39;them&#39; to arm-twist the government into making the system the way it is today. It is absurd, I can think of no logical reason why it must be this way and I don&#39;t understand why more people don&#39;t object to this farce?</p>

<p>I understand the process of money creation, I am unclear on some of the consequences however. For example, if the government were to start printing its own money without resorting to the central bank, wouldn&#39;t it eliminate government debt? rendering fiscal policy redundant? What about taxes?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>competent governments don&#39;t.  it just leads to problems, it&#39;s one of the reasons the government is hesitant to audit the fed, it&#39;s  the start of the process to politicization.  Kind of ironic really.  </p>

<p>money is a really interesting subject.  Don&#39;t make any judgments till you&#39;ve read more than one take on the issue.  If people claim it&#39;s a simple issue they are ignorant.  It&#39;s complex, and very fascinating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree its a very central issue to the security of this nation and others. Perhaps not THEE most important though. One problem I see arising is when some one starts to try and define a problem like centralized banking, they are attacked and distracted by accusations of racism. I worked side by side with typical racists before. They are capable of working for a common goal together with every one even if they believe backwards things. I think after dressing an issue and defining whats wrong in a system, the next step is to develop a solution, not continually argue about the details of a problem. When it comes to money issues, I&#39;m looking at people who have started small independent minting operations with gold silver and copper who have started using/circulating this currency throughout their communities. There is much more to learn about this stuff, but I want solutions not endless arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a long term thought, and frankly we are already running out of time.  If you think you can compete with a system that&#39;s been around for a couple hundreds years or so already, I gotta disagree.  Its a good thought, but they&#39;ll never just say to themselves.....&quot;OK, you have a better currency, we&#39;ll just bugger off now....&quot;.  I think that&#39;s a pipe dream.  how long do you think it would take to stand up to something like the IMF or European central banks?</p>

<p>The only way we can look forward and think long term for the sake of the rest of humanity, is to remove the current system and if another solution comes along, a SOUND money system is an option.  </p>

<p>I my opinion, we&#39;re not thinking big enough.  Technology can resolve a lot of this.  We aren&#39;t progressing at a rate that allows us to really grow.  That&#39;s a problem too, we don&#39;t progress at a rate we deserve because there is no money in providing everything for people.  If we thought about it, and it wasn&#39;t all about &quot;how much money will I make&quot; then we will truly have development for everyone.  Something that benefits everyone.  Not just some rich fuckers who happened to be born before us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The signature for the &quot;loan&quot; is where the whole mess starts.  Because there is interest owed for the &quot;loan&quot; that isn&#39;t created with the principle there will always be an ever increasing debt to &quot;money&quot; (debt &quot;obligations&quot;) ratio.</p>

<p>What really gets me going are the people that claim the central banks are the problem; is the central bank solely responsible, or are the people getting the &quot;loans&quot; responsible for allowing themselves to be &quot;deceived&quot;?</p>

<p>To learn more about the problem, these videos are great:</p>

<p><a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5352106773770802849#">Money as Debt</a></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/6822294">Money as Debt 2</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did drastically oversimplify the issue in Money as Debt. It was a difficult decision and a cause of argument between myself and Bob Bossin while recording the voiceover. But I did so because even a hint of the real explanation would open up this mind-bending world of complexities. That would have derailed the narrative and lost most of the audience for sure.</p>

<p>Criticism of my oversimplification is valid. But the theory that there is always enough money to make all payments cannot be true as long as money is borrowed from secondary lenders and lenders add interest income to principal. The world contains many such lenders. In fact, for a lot of people, it is their goal in life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.
The real failure is government regulators taking the stance that private corporations, in their own self interests, will develop their own risk models and protect their assets appropriately, better than government interference.</p>

<p>Instead, the risk models these people came up with, at least in the real estate market, were based on the assumption that housing COULD ONLY GO UP.  There was no scenario where housing would go down. These companies did not invest based on a rational risk model - hence the current kettle of fish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not writing anything others with sense don&#39;t already know. Sure, the bankers (using the term very broadly, for those who control the money in all its various aspects) are the problem, but the core of the bankers are Zionists. They are the ones who have led us down the garden path to ruin. They are the ones making the greatest profits from an economy based on debt slavery. They are the core problem, and they are the problem that needs to be fixed before any progress can be made to repair the economy. As long as the Zionists in charge of the money are fattening themselves like leaches at everyone else&#39;s expense, the economy is never going to become strong and healthy.</p>
