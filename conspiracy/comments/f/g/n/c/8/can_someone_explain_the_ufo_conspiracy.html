       I've read in multiple places about UFOs and how they are part of a conspiracy...but I haven't been able to get a through grasp of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed that UFO's &amp; Extra Terrestrials are being featured in a growing number of recent and upcoming movies coming out.

        does it have anything to do with the Elite / Zionists?

       I'm not about to dig through conspiracy theories and UFO sightings to track patterns and I don't know anything about the something something zionist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my opinion on UFO conspiracy. UFO (Unidentified Flying Objects) are from multiple differing sources. First of all is the traditional standard explanation when crazy shit happens; "weather". I'd agree that a certain percentage of "sightings" are simply "weather". I don't really want to speculate on the actual percentage but I'd say higher than 10% at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the UFO conspiracy about secret aircraft. I'd say that this is another (more major) percentage of UFO sightings. Hell, the US government tested stealth technology in secret for long enough that people could have seen stealth craft from a distance and assumed it was something paranormal or alien. That's the easy explanation of course because it's easy to believe and would prevent the trusting public from panicking about alien invasion. In my personal opinion we have space ships that are in testing that have technologies unheard of outside of the circles that are testing them. These include but are not limited to cloaking (visual and radar), force fields, and obviously much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last possible UFO conspiracy explanation I can think of is that there are alien visitors who are experimenting (with the help of government and media) on people for their own personal or perhaps scientific gain. Of course these alien visitors might be doing experiments like inducing hallucinations, altering body and brain chemistry, psychological experiments, actual medical experiments including autopsies, etc, and even social experiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side of the coin (for those who don't want to believe in higher life-forms) UFO sightings have been created by the military to keep civillians looking upward and being vigilant to report anything unusual. In a way I'm thinking that perhaps UFO reports exist to fulfill a want of the modern human to believe in something other than what we can prove and thus exploited for the purpose of national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       That last one was a shot in the dark kind of answer but it just came to me so check it out.

       Everyone here is completely off. Here is a simple an concise explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrial civilizations are engaging the human race and governments from around the world have hid this because of the chaos and panic it would cause. The first reason was WW2 and nobody wanted to admit they had no control of things in their skies. Then nobody wanted to do the same during the cold war. The third reason is because the world works on oil and people would immediately ask "what makes them fly?" and the government would be forced to release zero-point energy technology which we humans discovered a hundred years ago. UNTIL recently when governments have begun to release their documents. There are also many who theorize that they have been engaging us throughout our history however that is another thing entirely.

      <p>
       This is an incredibly serious issue and people are either ignorant or stupid enough to ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR Extraterrestrial races are engaging humanity and governments have been ignoring them up until recently to avoid panic.

        ever

       claimed that any scientist,
       <em>

       Harnessing ground state energy is akin to a perpetual motion machine.  You do understand that, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Get off your crazy horse, Tonto.  You show links to a website started by a dude who believes that he has been in mental contact with the Greys. He also believes that the government has the secret to ground state energy extraction "machines" but is not sharing it with the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before you start saying that he is getting his information from reliable sources just....please....stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody who is claiming to Dr. Greer that they have secret knowledge of this technology is a liar, a nut job or both.  Oh, and Dr. Greer is getting several thousand dollars to speak to gullible folks like you about this crap.

       Yeah, I am going to get downvoted with this comment but I really don't give a flying fuck.  Shit, with
       <em>
        zero point energy
       </em>
       I ought to be able to perfectly convert each downvote to an upvote without expelling any energy!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have already expelled to much energy here....energy which is wasted on a silly, fairy-physics-loving dreamer.

       you are quite pathetic as your evidence amounts to zero other than a hate filled rant with absolutely nothing to add. So your entire point falls on deaf ears. Yes just like they aren't sharing stealth bombers or anything else they develop in secret with us either. These hundreds of high ranking people in government who risk their careers, credibility and lives on these things and do not care, simply to tell people the truth and all you can do is call them crazy. Congratulations, you are the problem.

       Really?  Of course the government keeps secrets from us.  The manipulation and amplification of zero point energy is not one of them!  Dude, there are hundreds of brilliant, top of their game scientists that say that the concept violates laws of physics.  Show me one shred of evidence.  No, really.  You are claiming this shit so the burden of proof is on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, show me one shred of evidence.  Testimony from whack-a-doos doesn't count.  I could bring your cousin in who swears she saw a big foot in the hills of West Virginia but it doesn't make it fact.

       Yes- if Boyd is teaming with this dolt Hutchinson then he is either off-his-rocker gullible or a fraudster.

       This video  is soooo frigging stupid!  This guy Hutchinson can't repeat his experiments in front of scientists.  Did you know that?  Geez...why would he be able to

       I'm not linking to as scientific proof. I'm linking to it to show you that there are very smart, credible people who are involved in researching technologies that you are
       <em>
        sure
       </em>
       don't and/or can't exist.

       Hutchinson may not be 100% correct in his experiments, which is likely the reason why he wasn't able to reproduce it. However, to
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       inquisitive scientists, these findings can serve as a jumping off point to see where he went wrong. To me at least, this feels similar to what happened to the failed public
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion">
        Cold Fusion
       </a>
       demonstration in 1989. Fleischmann &amp; Pons didn't get
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       right. They found anomalous data in their experiments and, as such, 22 years later, we see this 'failed technology'

        making a comeback
       </a>
       after their careers were ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is ultimately to illustrate that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are probably not in the know as to what types of fringe science is being conducted. I wholeheartedly admire those who dare to look past all of the ridicule and punch 'mainstream' science in the face as they will be the people who push hardest to break old barriers. If that isn't inspiring, I don't know what is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       Yes, those pioneers who do legitimate research and who publish real attempts to sway those in their field do deserve all of our respect.  Where would we be without them today? :)

       However, Hutchinson's videos have been scrutinized by legit folks and have been proven
       <em>
        fraudulent
       </em>
       - which, in my mind, is far from the legit scientists who make mistakes in their research.  In one of Hutchinson's videos you could see the fishing line plain as day!  All this was exposed on a TV show several years back.

       Exactly, that's all I'm saying. You're probably right about Hutchinson, I just don't know much about him but I don't think that necessarily affects Boyd Bushman's credibility and the research he's doing/has done.

       No, it has to do with the difference between "conjecture" and "demonstrable fact".  Believers in UFO conspiracies tend to conflate the two ideas.  I'm not playing "reality cop", but "rational adult".  r/conspiracy would be a lot more useful if more people did that.  Some dudes saying they worked on alien UFOs or have something to do with aliens in the government does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       equal evidence.  Also strange unexplained lights do not magically mean aliens.  There is a wonderfully logical stance of "I don't know", which is also skipped right over by many conspiracy "theorists".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm motivated by my desire to get to the bottom of conspiracies, not to simply fan the flames of pet theories by lowering my standards of evidence to the point where random bullshit blog-posts found the cornerstone of my beliefs.  I guess I'm just not paranoid or delusional enough.  One can't learn unless one can distinguish fact from fiction.

       Technological civilization capable of traveling &gt;1-100 (low end) light years in a reasonable amount of time and/or capable of producing high enough energy yields to open "wormholes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Able to do that then they come here and crash. Or get taken prisoner. Or, stupid enough to show up on radar (lol, why u no stealth/cloak?)... it just defies logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why come to Earth at all? Need materials? Energy to open worm hole &gt; energy required to make materials.

       Are you retarded?

       An alien civilization with that level of technology could replicate the entire fucking planet, the Sun, the entire solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why come here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand anything about chemistry? or physics? Do you have any idea how much
       <strong>
        less
       </strong>
       energy/materials it would take to just build your own Earth? You think they're going to come here to study our biology? Maybe... but they'd be able to do it without alerting us. They wouldn't crash... have you heard of stealth technology? How about cloaking devices? Gee... wonder if the aliens have.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think the Earth is rare? Do you have any idea how fucking big the universe is? Rare to whom? It might be rare to some asshole who never left his solar system... it would be an extremely common thing to a civilization capable of light speed travel. Fuck, you could just make one. And that's if you didn't want to just fly around and find another one. Big fucking ball of carbon with some nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen. Real rare.

       You assume that if there were an advanced civilization that they could not be 100's, thousands, even millions of years more advanced then we are. Our knowledge expands every day with technology. 1000 years from now perhaps travelling 1-100 light years won't be that big a feat?

       Do you think a civilization 10.000 years more advance than us would have the same pathetic understanding of the nature of reality like we do? If you actually where to research occultism you would discover laws at the level of the soul and consciousness that make this very clear

       they come and

       Also is that hard to believe that ships can be shot down with our weapons especially since there is a possibility that we were in contact with other civilizations that know the technology behind them especial since physics doesn't take into account how advance you are,and most likely the ship didn't expect that type of attack?

       Actually, yes. That's the whole point of science. 1+1=2 here on Earth and anywhere else in the universe for that matter. Aliens would have had to discovered zero. Relativity. Quantum mechanics. They would understand all of these principles (and the philosophical ramifications they suggest)... even if they were so far advanced that their new understanding contradicts our present one, they would know why we think the way we do based on the science that we presently have
       <strong>
        because they would have done the same thing in their own histories.

       The universe is bound by laws and no matter how advanced you are you cannot overcome them.If the technology behind levitation were to have an inherent weakness it is not impossible to find make a weapon even if primitive, especially since whatever advance fairy dust you perceive this things would run on would most likely have an adverse affect on our system if it were to exotic,so there can be only a few optimal technologies that are most likely based on gravity and there have been documented effects on gravity for example the Hutchison effect

       This makes no sense at all.

       If they made sense, they probably wouldn't be unidentified - because we would be using them for international and interstellar travel ourselves.

       Yes- if Boyd is teaming with this dolt Hutchinson then he is either off-his-rocker gullible or a fraudster.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video  is soooo frigging stupid!  This guy Hutchinson can't repeat his experiments in front of scientists.  Did you know that?  Geez...why would he be able to

       antigravity but not be able to demonstrate it live to any respectable scientist?  You link to this video?  As scientific proof?  ha ha ha
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream scientists also laugh at this Hutchinson character who has made up a non-existent phenomenon and has named it after himself.  You can't make this shit up folks.

       Really, this is your argument?

       Exactly, that's all I'm saying. You're probably right about Hutchinson, I just don't know much about him but I don't think that necessarily affects Boyd Bushman's credibility and the research he's doing/has done.

       The universe is bound by laws and no matter how advanced you are you cannot overcome them.If the technology behind levitation were to have an inherent weakness it is not impossible to find make a weapon even if primitive, especially since whatever advance fairy dust you perceive this things would run on would most likely have an adverse affect on our system if it were to exotic,so there can be only a few optimal technologies that are most likely based on gravity and there have been documented effects on gravity for example the Hutchison effect
