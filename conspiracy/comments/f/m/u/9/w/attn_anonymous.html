    <div class="md"><p>I sort of assumed as much, however... I&#39;m not a &quot;hacktivist&quot;. I don&#39;t participate in their activities, but I appreciate them. I posted this because I know there are some of them (the active ones) here on reddit. If they&#39;re looking for suspect activity, it tends to follow me around in certain subreddits (encountered some just before posting this). I know from watching/lurking that others (possibly yourself from time to time) experience this as well - just rolling along doing what you do, when suddenly you get accosted by one of &quot;them&quot;, attempting to break your spirit or whatever.</p>

<p>It bothers me, however, when I&#39;m isolated in other subreddits with no support from like-minded people.</p>

<p>My post was intended as a suggestion to the activist Anon&#39;s to look at the active/outspoken redditors. Watch their comment histories and stuff. It&#39;s all open for public view. When one of &quot;us&quot; is speaking truth, yet get buried in downvotes for it, there&#39;s something afoot... something Anonymous should pay attention to.</p>

<p>At least that was my thinking when I posted this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re looking for conspiracy in the wrong places. You post a comment that is controversial and, since you&#39;re posting here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, is most likely to be against the mainstream/is a conspiracy theory. I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re surprised to find yourself being downvoted; conspiracy theories tend to have a lack of evidence, and a lack of support is a weak argument. That&#39;s why you get downvoted. It&#39;s not some grand scheme to silence the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The post I made wasn&#39;t controversial until the respondent made it so. It was the second highest voted initial comment (of about 10), until the respondent came along with the r/libertarian and r/conspiracy and Lol comment. Once the appeal to mockery was made, the hive started voting on that, rather than reason.</p>

<p>The reason I came here to r/conspiracy to draw indirect attention to it, is because I believe in the depths of my soul that there are Anon&#39;s here, lurking among us... in this subreddit. I wasn&#39;t attempting to recruit reinforcements to defend my comments (I&#39;ll take the downvotes until it becomes clear that my participation here is not appreciated). </p>

<p>As for whether or not there is a grand scheme to silence the truth, I&#39;ll only mention that just in the last day or two, reddit surpassed Digg as the most popular social networking and news aggregation site on the net. reddit is &quot;on the radar&quot;.</p>

<p>And as long as discussion of crookedness is conveniently nestled into a subreddit called &quot;conspiracy&quot; (the label characterized as &quot;nutcases&quot;), they don&#39;t meddle. But, any time the truths are discussed outside of this section, those truths become a threat... and &quot;their&quot; only recourse is to fall back upon that same characterization (ala the first response to my comment). They can&#39;t work any other way. They have to mock and ridicule FIRST, then they present their false justifications.</p>

<p>It may not be a concerted conspiratorial action with a well-considered plan or anything like that, but... like IAmJulianAssange said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you share common principles and ideologies you already are part of the &quot;group&quot;.</p>

<p>Reddit has been &quot;on the radar&quot; for a long time now. Did you forget that it is owned by Conde Nast? </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that talking about r/conspiracy topics in other subreddits is construed as a threat; more that a lot of conspiracies lack adequate amounts of evidence, therefore why would anyone believe them? Also, this subreddit does not help itself by people posting articles about vampires and lizard people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As near as I can tell, &quot;vampires&quot; and &quot;reptilians&quot; are codespeak. </p>

<p>From what I gather about David Icke, he was doing this long before anyone else and he was being very vocal about some extremely powerful people. It only makes sense that he would hide his outspokenness behind a facade of mild insanity -- calling the banksters and royals &quot;reptilians&quot;, and calling predatory lendors &quot;vampires&quot;.</p>

<p>It may not help this subreddit gain any attention, but it does allow the members to discuss these topics with a wink and a nudge.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong about this, and these people here actually believe some biological differentiation, then I&#39;ve been playing this game wrong and should probably turn around and leave now.</p>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m pretty sure that is wrong, the &quot;codespeak&quot; idea. He&#39;s never come out and said there&#39;s any symbolism at all behind it. Even Alex Jones says that Icke completely undermines himself with the reptilian peoples talk. </p>

<p>I was kind of bored and was willing to continue having this conversation to relieve that boredom, but some cool news just came down the pipe about the University of Wisconsin, and I now have better things to do. Um... maybe we&#39;ll continue this later... if I get bored again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s with the hyper-defensive, overreaction? What back-pedaling? You&#39;re the one who waltzed in here mr &quot;anonymous needs to help me with the downvote brigade.&quot; Right. Anyway, my point about the lizard people and vampires had nothing to do with mocking or attacking you, only a hyper-sensitive, thin skinned paranoid person like yourself would interpret it like that. It was about this subreddit as a whole. There are some genuine things in the world that we should question. But why would anyone take those claims seriously when they&#39;re positioned alongside articles about vampires and lizard people. There&#39;s an article on the front page about &quot;real vampires,&quot; in addition to an article about Dr. Ivins, the guy the FBI is trying to pin the whole anthrax case on. The Ivins case and the weak evidence behind it is important; it&#39;s something a lot more people deserve to know about. But why would you expect someone to take anything here seriously if, in the same subreddit, you have people claiming the existence of vampires. You ask for &quot;anonymous&quot; to help with the spread these ideas yet you won&#39;t recognize the fact that a lot of what&#39;s posted in here is nothing but fantasy with no supporting evidence or sources. That&#39;s why people don&#39;t take this subreddit seriously.</p>

<p>I asked you for evidence because, you claim to be a &quot;free-thinker.&quot; As far as I can tell, that means you don&#39;t (or have a hesitancy) to reject ideas the same way that other people do. If you don&#39;t reject the idea of reptile aliens are here, then please tell me why you don&#39;t. Many people believe that just as strongly as they believe that 9/11 was a false flag operation. And both can be found here in this subreddit. For the record, I think that lizard idea is absolutely absurd and anyone believing it should probably be institutionalized. But then again, I&#39;m not a free-thinker like you. </p>

<p>You are, without exception, the most transparent troll I have ever encountered. Normally, I have to do just a <em>little</em> bit of taunting in order to get to the heart of the matter. You, on the other hand, refused to allow me to escape this conversation without exposing your hand.</p>

<p>And, now you try to pretend like you can play a &quot;smart game&quot; by re-analyzing comments I made and then presenting them here, again, out of context. You really should quit now, you&#39;re only making a fool of yourself, and I sort of feel bad for continuing to comment to you while you do this. Y&#39;know? I feel like an enabler... selling... no... <em>giving</em> drugs to an addict. It really would be in your best interest to stop. I know it&#39;s in mine, so I won&#39;t respond to you further. My conscience couldn&#39;t take it.</p>

<p>I hope, somewhere along your journey, you are able to find Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And for the record, you&#39;ve ignored every point I&#39;ve made to stand on your soapbox and jerk yourself off about your &quot;intelligence.&quot; Your feelings of self-importance are dripping from your posts, so instead of giving yourself a hard-on talking about yourself, why not try and have a real discussion. How does r/conspiracy do itself any favors by having important articles (Ivins case) nestled alongside absurd ones (vampire stories.) </p>

<p>And what, might I ask, was the heart of the matter? I understand its easier to write someone of as a troll instead of trying to address an opposing view, but give it a shot. It won&#39;t hurt, I promise. I&#39;ve presented nothing out of context, we&#39;re in the exact thread where your comments originated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was on the road to becoming one, ten years ago. Then, Dubya won the primary, the NASDAQ crashed, 9/11 was orchestrated, War on Terror was declared, etc., etc., etc. and my tech career came to a screeching halt.</p>

<p>Five and a half (rapidly approaching six) years ago, I encountered an impasse with a corrupt government official, and whatever hope I had of ever resuming my tech career got buried in the landfull of bureaucracy.</p>

<p>March 7 of this year, I finally get to win one (defeating that corrupt government official) and choose what direction I want to go after that.</p>

<p>I certainly won&#39;t choose &quot;Anonymous hacktivism&quot; - that shit doesn&#39;t pay the bills. But, whatever I do choose, I will choose it with great gratitude in my heart for the PEACEFUL protests of this elusive, evasive, nebulous social movement named: Anonymous.</p>

<p>Why? Because <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMBZDwf9dok">I&#39;m as mad as hell and I&#39;m not going to take it anymore</a>. That&#39;s why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As near as I can tell, &quot;vampires&quot; and &quot;reptilians&quot; are codespeak. </p>

<p>From what I gather about David Icke, he was doing this long before anyone else and he was being very vocal about some extremely powerful people. It only makes sense that he would hide his outspokenness behind a facade of mild insanity -- calling the banksters and royals &quot;reptilians&quot;, and calling predatory lendors &quot;vampires&quot;.</p>

<p>It may not help this subreddit gain any attention, but it does allow the members to discuss these topics with a wink and a nudge.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m wrong about this, and these people here actually believe some biological differentiation, then I&#39;ve been playing this game wrong and should probably turn around and leave now.</p>
