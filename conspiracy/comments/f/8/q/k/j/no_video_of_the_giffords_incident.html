We live in an age where most of the cell phones out there have at least some video capability.  When almost anything happens in a crowd of even a few people, chances are someone&#39;s going to pull out their iPhone or whatever and start filming it.  Maybe it&#39;s just my own lack of initiative to go out and find it, but I haven&#39;t seen a lick of footage of the Tucson shooting or its aftermath.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even important, but does anyone else think it&#39;s even a little weird?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am confused here. I see reports that Duke Energy purchased the company that day, and I can&#39;t find any connection between J.P Morgan and Duke Energy. </p>

<p>The link you submitted, related to JP Morgan, is from 2002. The circumstances of the death are suspicious, but I cannot find the connection you are portraying. Also, the article speaks about J.P Morgan buying 600 million dollars in stock, which is more of an investment then a buyout. Especially when you consider the buyout price of 13.7 Billion from Duke Energy that actually did occur that day. </p>

<p>Any shareholder information on Duke Energy to suggest they are controlled by J.P. Morgan? I cannot find anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed there is video from the safeway showing everything. As far as I know,  the FBI  took possession of that video. According to them they will not release it because of fears that it will &#39;prejudice the jury&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand the term. To prejudice a jury is to cause them to prejudge; that is, to cause the jury to have decided the defendant&#39;s guilt or innocence before the trial. A prejudiced jury is grounds for appeal.</p>

<p>Once the trial has started, the jury is supposed to be judging. Showing them evidence that makes them decide guilt or innocence is the point.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The explanation is pretty simple. The shooting lasted about a minute, and most of the would-be cameramen <em>were being shot at</em>. There were less than thirty people in the crowd, and nineteen were shot. Anyone in a position to record the shooting itself was better off trying to dodge bullets.</p>

<p>The police arrived after only 5 minutes, and would have shut any aftermath recording down. I also expect that nearly everyone else at the Safeway that morning was either attempting to help or hiding.</p>

<p>There are a large number of surveillance videos of the incident, but they are in the hands of the FBI. While this opens doors to certain questions, it is not itself strange. A competent clean investigation would be expected to do the same to establish a chain of custody on important evidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new poster boy for this agenda is Joe Zamudio, a hero in the Tucson incident. Zamudio was in a nearby drug store when the shooting began, and he was armed. He ran to the scene and helped subdue the killer. Television interviewers are celebrating his courage, and pro-gun blogs are touting his equipment. &quot;Bystander Says Carrying Gun Prompted Him to Help,&quot; says the headline in the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>But before we embrace Zamudio&#39;s brave intervention as proof of the value of being armed, let&#39;s hear the whole story. &quot;I came out of that store, I clicked the safety off, and I was ready,&quot; he explained on Fox and Friends. &quot;I had my hand on my gun. I had it in my jacket pocket here. And I came around the corner like this.&quot; Zamudio demonstrated how his shooting hand was wrapped around the weapon, poised to draw and fire. As he rounded the corner, he saw a man holding a gun. &quot;And that&#39;s who I at first thought was the shooter,&quot; Zamudio recalled. &quot;I told him to &#39;Drop it, drop it!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>But the man with the gun wasn&#39;t the shooter. He had wrested the gun away from the shooter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s seems pretty stupid. If someone starts shooting wildly into a crowd that you&#39;re standing in, are you going to pull out your fucking cell phone?

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s weird. In a crowd like that at a political event, there were certainly half a dozen people taking pictures and videoing when the shooting started. Had to be.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  Someone would&#39;ve been filming it, even if they ducked and ran when the shooting started.  The pretty faced white girl born on 9/11 that was plastered on the news shortly after made me doubt the official story.</p>
