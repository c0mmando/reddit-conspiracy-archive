       I should state that I don't believe that 9/11 was an inside job. I think the evidence supports events that are fairly close to what the official story purports.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am, however, open to evidence and will judge each piece on its own accords. I have no interest in debunking claims, just better understanding how you've come to your beliefs.

       WTC7, a 48 story building collapsed at free fall speed in it's own footprint. It just happened to be home to some of the most important offices outside of DC for the IRS, CIA, Secret Service, and the SEC....which subsequently lost all the files for the cases against Enron.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fligh 93, disintegrated upon impact, yet left a debris field 6 miles away where investigators found all of the paper passports belonging to the hijackers. Same thing for WTC1 &amp; WTC2.
      </p>
      <p>
       The commission report claims WTC 1&amp;2 fell due to kerosene (jet fuel) fires melting steel columns, yet there are several published pictures of people in both buildings standing in the holes where the planes hit, waving flags to be rescued.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day of 9/11, all of the air force bases in the NE and possible across the country, I would have to look that part up, were running a simulation to prepare for an event where commercial airliners are hijacked and used as weapons to run into....wait for it.....the pentagon, the white house, and.....sky scrapers in NYC.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evening of 9/10 Donald Rumsfeld announced the DoD could not account for $2.3 Trillion in it's budget....the next day a commercial jet flew into the Armed Services budget office at the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are the videos of the Pentagon, besides the 10 or so frames the FBI release? There are many other locations that had security cameras with perfect views.
      </p>
      <p>
       At bare minimum, the 9/11 Commission did a piss poor job in it's report, and we need a new, independent commission to investigate....but that's not likely to happen.

       All that needs to be said is that the only clear directive the 9/11 Commission had was to IGNORE any evidence that may lead the investigation into territory pertaining to the actual events of 11 September, 2001.

       There are several mistakes here.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC 7 did not collapse into its own footprint. In fact it was laying in the street and damaged other buildings next to it. I can provide photographic evidence of it leaning while it fell. I can provide pictures of the damage is caused to the other buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did not find "all of the paper passports". I will be happy to list all the passports that were found, what condition they were in, and when they were found. And they were not "all of them". You ignore the fact that none of the 9/11 hijackers who lived in this country for months leading up to the attacks ever attempted to conceal their identity at any point. They had bills, credit cards, and residences all in their name. There is an extensive paper trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people were where the fires were not. Those who were near the fire jumped to their deaths rather then be burned alive. A person here during this time is not evidence that there wasn't fires going on in other places of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no stand down ordered, none of the war games of the day had anything to do with the white house, the pentagon, or the sky scrapers in NYC. This is just a lie. 9/11 deniers mix them all into one statement to confuse the issue. Anyone who looks at these action individually will see that they had no negative influence on the response that day. In fact, it has been cited that the war games going on had a positive influence on the response times because the people were already where they needed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       We lose all kinds of money in this country all the time. You are taking an entire speech out of context and reducing it to a sentence. Try actually reading the actual speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who said such videos exist? People used to cite the Citgo station and the doubletree videos as proof that the government was holding back evidence, but in fact those tapes were released and show absolutely nothing. Just because you think their may be other video evidence, that doesn't mean there is. There are tons of physical evidence, 70+ witnesses, bodies, and matching plane parts to the flight that crashed into the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be happy to go though any one of these points in fine detail if you like, I have researched them all and I am well read on every one of these subjects.

       its obvious you haven't reviewed the truth out there, you merely formulated your opinions based on what you saw on public media and refuse to accept what's true.
      </p>

       In the case of the videos, the only video out there shows the before and after effect of the plane hitting the pentagon, you don't see a plane at all....
      </p>
      <p>
       A huge Boeing jetline crashes into the pentagon and no-one can get visual evidence of it happening!? If a big jet crashes into the pentagon carrying a near full load of fuel, and only causes that small of damage what makes you Believe that a jet crashing into a top floor of a skyscraper can compromise the entire building's foundation?... was it the media?

       Actually I have reviewed "the truth" out there. I've read everything from Loose Change, to Judy Wood's no plane space laser theory.  What set me apart is I read the "truth" and the criticism of the "truth". I encourage anyone to do so, as it becomes really obvious on how
       <strong>
        real truth
       </strong>
       the truthers believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, of course you don't see a plane at all. It was moving at 500mph, and the camera capturing it was the equivalent of a webcam. A small, cheap, tiny res camera that you could pick up for less then 50 dollars at the time. The Pentagon has really good security. As in a large number of
       <strong>
        people
       </strong>
       working around the building. People are really good at spotting car bombs, and crazy people. People are really bad at stopping planes moving at 500mph. There is no need to have an extensive camera system around the Pentagon, because there are actually people there instead of cameras. Places that have a lot of cameras don't have a lot of people. The Pentagon isn't one of these places.
      </p>
      <p>
       The witnesses some as close at 50 feet away, saw a plane. I don't know about you, but you should drive to an airport and get as close as you can to the runway. You will still be further then 50 feet away. So how anyone can confuse a missile (essentially a flying telephone pole) with a really really big plane from 50 feet away is impossible. Just on that alone is enough to throw everything truthers say out the window. Seriously, go to your local airport and park near the runway.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/BisG3.jpg">
        Also, how does a missile zigzag like this?
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people say the plane flew over the Pentagon, so how did it disappear from radar? Are the control towers of every major airport in the area in on it too? They record radar data. You can watch it. It's there on youtube. The plane takes off, it flies toward its destination, it turns around, and disappears around the Pentagon. If the plane flew over the pentagon, how did it suddenly transform into a stealth fighter and elude radar detection?
      </p>
      <p>
       Small amount of damage? Really? Have you ever been next to the Pentagon? The building is HUGE. So if you look at pictures you really are missing the scale of the damage. Not to mention it was being reinforced at the time because of the growing threat of car bombs (Oklahoma City).
      </p>

       Just being devil's advocate here, but I'd like to point out that the Pentagon's perimeter was in fact guarded by over 175 cameras. I find it a bit mystifying that apparently not a single other one of them was able to capture something so large.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never mind the fact that it was supposedly also guarded by an anti-aircraft battery, but that's just an inconvenient fact to point out, I guess.

       I tend to agree that this is probably false for the following reason: If I were the people trying to create this false flag, there is no reason for me to use a missile when I can just use the plane. For the same reason the laser thing is naive, and probably meant to discredit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would however create the impression that I'm hiding something, like having used a missile, so that if things get serious I can simply release a video of the airplane and make fools of those people and have them loose their credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would try to do everything as close to the official version as possible, with some amount of intentional unneeded secrecy around things I can control.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I can't make like the official version is, for example, the explosions in the twin towers. I would need to have the buildings collapse completely to insure support for a long war, but airplanes alone won't (insure the) bringing down of 2 buildings designed especially for sustaining low-speed airplane impacts. Therefore explosives are used, and the people who point out the evidence that explosives were used will be mixed together with people who say that a missile hit the pentagon or lasers were used, and discredit them all as a group.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would cause me real trouble would be another investigation. So I would release all kind of naive seemingly-possible theories and have people repeat them, so I can use ad hominem attacks against the whole group.

       Also, I'd like to point out that those security cameras are more than likely pointed at points of interest other than a nearby highway, or the middle of the lawn, or the side of the building. Not only that but if you're going to a system of "175" cameras recording constantly and storing at least a couple days if not more of video you have to use some low res low framerate cameras. You don't use these cameras in places that you want to see people's faces, you do use them outside where you want to see big things, like cars. But they did have one camera that caught it! Guess why that camera was there? It was monitoring a point of interest. Guess why they aren't coming out to prove you wrong with data about where every single one of their camera's point, how many there are, and what frame rate they record at? I think you can handle that one on your own, but if not I can make you a youtube video.

       Prove me wrong about what? I merely pointed out that there are LOTS of cameras at the Pentagon, not "none", like _dimension implied.

       I like though, that you assume the Pentagon would be so technologically backwards that they'd be forced to use low-res, low-framerate cameras. And how you don't provide a shred of evidence to back up the claim.

       I like how you address only one of my 6 counter points to what you said and then ask me for citation on the quality of cameras that pentagon would use in for all-weather observation of large objects 10 years ago. Remember before 9/11 it was a bad thing to have a big "homeland security" budget. They weren't forced to do anything, they chose to. If you think they slapped high definition camera's in custom weatherproof casings and mounted of them on the outside pointing in every goddamn direction you've completely given up reason. But if evidence is that important to you I'm sure the type of camera they have installed is buried in their public budget records from before 2001, hidden with sinister intent obviously. Since you're the one that can't propose an argument that makes holds water and need it to believe in the obvious truth you can be the one to dig it up. While we're on the subject of citation I looked up the validity of your anti-aircraft claim.
       <a href="http://www.jod911.com/There_Are_No_Missile_Defenses_at_the_Pentagon.pdf">
        Here
       </a>
       is a paper that goes over every source of that information (none of it was government official) and discredits it. The paper then goes on to provide this contrary evidence to your statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The proof lies in the fact that the Pentagon was forced to emplace missile defenses at the Pentagon after 9/11, 
from CNN September 11th, 2002.
For the first time since the Cuban missile crisis almost 40 years ago, armed missile launchers 
will be protecting the nation's capital by day's end Tuesday -- a precaution that comes amid a 
heightened alert status on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
       </p>

       If you can't bother to read the other side of every conspiracy you have lost the ability for critical thinking and are simply a tool for people creating lies in order to make money off people like you. If you still believe in your 2 points after this then you're simply someone who has no place in a researched discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clear this up as well, _dimension implied simply that there is no need for an extensive camera system on the outside of a building that has armed guard around the whole perimeter on a 24/7 basis and I agree with his logic fully.

You can watch it. It's there on youtube. The plane takes off, it flies toward its destination, it turns around, and disappears around the Pentagon. If the plane flew over the pentagon, how did it suddenly transform into a stealth fighter and elude radar detection?

       To simplify it, transponders return a code when interrogated with a radar signal. Controllers follow two kinds of targets: primary and secondary. Primary targets are aircraft that lack a transponder. Secondary targets are aircraft that have transponders that respond to radar interrogation.

       I read up to the 500mph part in your comment and that discredited whatever you were building up.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you seriously believe a Jetliner that's FULL OF FUEL going at 500MPH (as you said) can only do the damage that was seen on the Pentagon... the foundation barley crumbled, most of it remained intact.
       <em>
        I urge you to watch the video I linked in my previous post

       ... You seem very opinionated but just LOOK AT THE FACTS, DON'T ASSUME JUST LOOK AT WHAT'S THERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       LOOK AT THE indepth analysis... If you believe that 9/11 wasn't an inside job I would [rationally] assume you believe there were [infact] weapons of mass destruction in Iraq (No conspiracy just BULL Shit)
      </p>

      <p>
       Just read a little bit more and realized that you stated

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       <strong>
        False.
       </strong>
       I don't think you realize how security works... especially the world "superpower's" secure central  hub... furthermore there are Numerous cameras that surround just that specific area &amp; this point is addressed in that video.

       The plane hit a section of the Pentagon that was reinforced with Kevlar shielding in the event of a bombing.  Damage would have been significantly higher if it had hit another section, but even then, the Pentagon is so close to the ground and so distributed that the totality of destruction would be significantly lower than a large tower.

       Many of the posts here point out inconsistencies which haven't been resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the posts are rehashing stuff over and over (Kennedy assassination, chemtrails, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only been here a little over a year and in that time I've learned a LOT (not all) about how this specific forum works.
      </p>
      <p>
       The long time regulars have their "agendas" (The "Joos" seems to be a recurring favorite for some, with others its chemtrails and flouride, and so on and so forth). But, every time it comes to 9/11, it's the same two crowds...
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who distrust the government (for a long history of somewhat glaring, obvious reasons), and those who want to argue with them. This is somewhat frustrating for the following reason...
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit is for discussion of conspiracy-related topics (it's "home of those who have theories about conspiracies").
      </p>
      <p>
       Inevitably, however, there are people who come here for the sole purpose of stirring up grief among an otherwise cohesive group of people (cohesive in the sense that they all respect each other's right to have their pet theory). These "muckrakers" aren't here to have a discussion... they inevitably enter into conversation threads with sarcasm, mockery, and namecalling... and when they get a heated argument brewing, they say "see? I told you you were irrational."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, krelian, why are YOU here? To learn stuff the mainstream media won't tell you? Or to point, mock, and laugh?

       I don't have an opinion on what hit the Pentagon but you cite the speed of whatever it was to explain the poor 'webcam' footage yet then cite the human eye (remember that people were not staring at a fixed point waiting for something like the camera was) as infallible.

       At no point did I compare the sizes of the various missiles to that of an airliner.  I produced images of missiles that have wings and markings similar to those on airplanes.   These could easily be mistaken for airplanes from a distance even if they were sitting motionless on a tarmac.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen many witness accounts from 9-11.  Some people claim to have seen airliners and even to have been able to read the "AA" on a plane moving at 500mph.  Others described a smaller plane or even 'a cruise missile with wings'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no firm position on this matter.  Eyewitness testimony is notoriously inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's wrong to cite the high speed of the object as a reason the cameras couldn't capture it clearly yet then imply that people could have clearly made out what it was (down to reading the letters on the tail fins) when it was only over the lawn for a few seconds while traveling at incredible speeds.

       I don't think that is unreasonable at all, although I do wonder about the existence of additional security tape from the Pentagon and surrounding businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       As my previous post stated, I am familiar with the many and varied eyewitness accounts.  They don't prove or disprove anything in my opinion.  Some people clearly saw the "AA" on the tail despite the 500 mph speed you keep quoting.  Others saw a small plane.  Others saw a 'missile with wings'.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep pointing to the 500mph speed with regards to the camera's limitations but don't  seem to think that human beings whose attention would not have already been focused on the point of impact (as the camera was) would have any trouble discerning an out of place object moving at that same speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I am not even of the opinion that a missile hit the Pentagon.  I have no clue what happened.  Your mind is clearly made up on the matter.  Mine is still open...and I try to look at both sides with interest and skepticism.

       So uh, the people on the ground in New York who saw a plane can't be counted on either. Not everyone saw it on TV, and they seemed to see a plane traveling at 500mph just fine, but maybe they didn't see it either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay fine, throw out the eyewitness accounts.

       I agree with your stand point on the pentagon.  There are tons of eye witness accounts.  However, I don't agree with you about the buildings collapsing.  The evidence with eye witness accounts is overwhelming about the buildings being "demoed".

       I posted above about my own eyewitness account.  In light of witnesses who were much closer, I'll say my view wasn' as good as theirs, obviously, so mine has a bit less weight.  At least I'm honest and fair about it, I suppose.

       How about me?  I'm an eyewitness to the strike at the Pentagon.  I lived in Alexandria at the time and was out on my balcony at a high-rise on 395.  I saw a flash out of the corner of my eye, looked north up 395, and zeroed in on a flying object crossing the highway and IIRC, at a slightly northeast trajectory from where I was standing. I watched as it zipped across the road and parking lot and hit the outside wall of the building.  The explosion wasn't nearly as large as the ones on tape at the WTC.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'll tell you something.  In some reports over the years, there's a claim that the plane tilted its wings toward the south or east as it went low.  From my viewing angle, above and south, the wings would have been instantly visible.  There were no wings at all anywhere that I could see.  And the the fuselage sure wasn't of the size or shape of the plane they claim was used, as far as I could tell after years of googling plane images and comparing scales and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as a person who drove or took the bus to the Pentagon for 3 years, sometimes as an employee there and sometimes as an employee elsewhere using the 7W bus to get to the metro station there, the facade at no time looked like it was hit by such a large plane, nor any form of wing marks evident.

       There were people at the World Trade Center who only saw the explosion, not the plane. Not every eye witness everywhere had a perfect viewpoint. It doesn't sound like you had one either. 136 people on camera say it was a plane.

       There was no interviews in that video, just quotes of people no one knows about.

       And why is the only footage of the attack a timelapse where you can't see for shit what actually hit the pentagon? Surely there had to be more cameras from different angles that could have seen an airplane coming.

       I'd be interested if someone can produce numbers on the eyewitnesses who claim to have seen a plane/missile. Because I would be far more impressed with such claims if it was 50-50 as opposed to 98-2 percent. or something, those numbers are just for illustration purposes.

       Ctrl-f "plane" and "missile," you'll find that voices an opinion one way or the other seems to think it's a plane. Everyone who says missile is saying something about how it WAS A PLANE that was, metaphorically "like" a missile.

       This is akin to how people describe tornadoes as sounding like "freight trains". They know it was a tornado, it destroyed their house, but they still tell people when asked that it sounded like a train. Why? Because people don't have tornadoes go over them everyday, and not too many people have a good idea of what they sound like.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many people here have heard a plane hitting a building? Probably none. How many, if they did, would be cynical enough to tell the reporter "It sounded like a plane hitting a building"? Most people would do the usual train/tornado thing, and say it sounded like a bomb, or a missile, or whatever, and use some analogy or something they have heard. A lot of the people who work at the pentagon
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       been in active duty at some point, and probably have heard a lot more missiles and bombs going off, than planes hitting buildings.

       I don't understand how you could take 'many people said they saw a missile' from that.  The rest of the arguments aside, this is not valid.  All but one or two mentions of missiles are something like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        saw the plane dive down and level off. "It was no more than 30 feet off the ground, and it was screaming. It was just screaming. It was nothing more than a guided missile at that point
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Suddenly, an airplane roared into view, nearly shearing the roof off the trailer before slamming into the E ring. It sounded like a missile
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But whoever was flying the plane made no attempt to change direction. It was coming in at a high rate of speed, but not at a steep angle--almost like a heat-seeking missile
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These all clearly say that what they saw was a plane, even if they draw up comparisons to a missile.

       I'm afraid I can't help you there. I, like most people, have seen the scattered video from news media after the incident, and usually the compilations are slanted by the people posting them to favor either the "I saw a plane" or the "I saw a missile!" camp.

       you are saying this based on the amount of "I saw a plane" eye witnesses. I highly doubt you've gone through every case of i saw a plane and "i saw a missile" - that being said i've read both, and logically speaking a boeing jet full of jet fuel would make an explosion way bigger then this, and would take out more then one side of the pentagon, should take out atleast two, one from the impact and the second from the explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this is a very good point, doesn't take a conspiracy theorist to use logic --&gt;
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A huge Boeing jetline crashes into the pentagon and no-one can get visual evidence of it happening!? If a big jet crashes into the pentagon carrying a near full load of fuel, and only causes that small of damage what makes you Believe that a jet crashing into a top floor of a skyscraper can compromise the entire building's foundation?... was it the media? (get-smart)

       not according to me, according to the size of a jet liner fuel tank, i'm sorry is that so hard to consider?

       The amount of bullshit spat at gullible viewers feels managed, and the whole "a plane hit the pentagon" thing feels like a misdirection. I side with the large number of non-viewable airplane video evidence to the approach and impact, as well as the plane parts that didn't seem to exist after impact.

       there are too many holes for a terrorist attack.. remember those oklahoma city bombings? was there ever such big speculation as to who and why and how did it? no it was down right and simple because it was a case of actual domestic violence, the news on it was straightforward as was the proceedings on dealing with it, etc.

       personally I really don't care, i never did care, i only posted that first post because what i was replying to seemed whack, and i felt like i should point out logic should be seen where logic is as simple as that, logic. perception has no place in logic, so yes my analysis was weak, and the big red-herring was not a specific distraction, just something i thought i'd put my 2 cents in

         from this demolition we can see that at various points the building looks to be leaning 1 way or another.  I want to see the pictures you were talking about, as I strongly suspect they may be cause of this issue.  A photo of it leaning is hardly enough.  And it doesn't take much out of the imagination to see debris flying out and hitting other buildings, so I don't really see that as something that trumps the controlled demolition theory.

         The fact that those war games went on at the exact same time and date with such similarities as 9/11 is the epitome of suspicious.  Calling it "just a lie" is an insult to basic intuition.  There are no documents to support one or the other (One wouldn't make sense, "These drills will have nothing to do with any similar attack that might happen on this day," while on the other side, this whole thing would be a closed case and we wouldn't be having this discussion to begin with), you'd pretty much have to rely on your own thought and reasoning.  With the many other strange happenings on 9/11, to simply pass off one of the biggest ones as if there's absolutely nothing to do with it, well, I told myself I wouldn't resort to petty name calling, but that's just stupid on your part.  Also, the war games did NOT make things easier.

         Listening to the people's voices, how they spoke, their tone, ect shows that they were left with their pants down.  You are very wrong in thinking that there wasn't chaos and confusion that slowed everything down, regardless of what citations you speak of.

         this is but 1 example of a video tape that the FBI confiscated that had some sort of video on 9/11.  The only reason it was released was because of a lawsuit.  If it wasn't for the lawsuit, we would've still not heard of it.  Again, basic reasoning goes into this, if you don't want to believe what is being said about there being dozens of security cameras that took videos of it (You can find several more tapes of ppl saying that the FBI took their tapes and whatnot on youtube as well), then just think of all the buildings around the pentagon with security cameras that just so happen to have the pentagon in view.  It is not that much of a stretch of the imagination.  If you live in a city, just choose some big important building, then look around that building at all the stores around it and how you would expect their security cameras to face.  Doesn't take much to think of that one.  On a side note, I sure hope you don't think that the FBI didn't take any tapes, you kind of inferred that when you were talking about the tapes.  Also, just because you think there isn't other tapes, doesn't mean there isn't.  Your argument can be swung both ways.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         there are also witnesses that have said stuff that it looks like a missile, they saw a plane fly above the pentagon, ect.  Assuming there was a conspiracy actually in place, it is no wonder why some of those interviews weren't put live on air.  The anchor on the ground could simply ask them before filming what they saw, and if it matched up with what they would want to put on TV, they then go live on the air and ask the person.  This is not really uncommon, many times reporters and whatnot would talk to ppl about how things will go in an interview before taping/going live.  Of course, some times things don't always go as planned, and live tv is more difficult to edit than regular tv.  At the same time, the reporter can tell them after they speak fo what was seen, "Alright, this'll be live on the air, I want you to say _____."  On a day like that, which the ppl would be very shaken up, it is not difficult to think that they would go along with it.  If they thought they saw a missile, and the reporter said "No, it was actually a plane, please say that," they would most likely do it.  On the other hand, if no conspiracy was at play, then why would the people be saying such random, untrue things?  That would not make any sense at all.

       This is just stuff I scrounged up in like a bit over a half an hour.  To be frank, you don't sound to be very well educated and well researched, from the sounds of it it was merely a case of you typing in &gt;insert conspiracy theory&lt; debunked in google then picking out a few choice sites.  That is not to say that a lot of 9/11 ppl aren't in the same boat, but this and your other posts make you sound too much like a pompus ass, and really THAT is what made me decide to scrounge up this quick post for you.

         Do you notice how loud a controlled demolition is? The only reason thermite is brought up is because it is much more quiet then conventional explosives. Truthers ignore the fact that you would need thousands of pounds and weeks to prepare a building for demolition. The way they try to get around this is by inventing nanothermite... a super secret version of thermite that deals with all the problems with conventional thermite. The only problem is nanothermite doesn't exist. It never existed. The only reason truthers bring it out is because a national laboratory theorized it, and that was good enough for the truthers.

         The war games had to do with Russian Bombers over Alaska and Canada... how does that have ANYTHING to do with 9/11? Oh I agree we were caught with out pants down, but there is a far difference between knowingly subverting our air defense and 9/11. Before 9/11 hijackings were not suicide runs. The link you provide supports my claims. We were unprepared for 9/11, that does not mean 9/11 was an inside job.

         The double tree hotel video was used as proof that there was a coverup. Then the government released the tape and truthers are still crying there is a coverup? You have your double tree video, you have your citgo video... they don't show anything... just because there is a lack of evidence, that doesn't mean there is any evidence.

         Kind of a change in topics, but alright.  I did in fact notice how loud the controlled demolition is.  As you said, thermite is given as an explanation, and a very legit one at that.  If it is more quiet than conventional explosives, then it would make perfect sense for them to use that one instead.  Truthers don't ignore that part at all, there have been some explanations covering those parts, parts which I myself have been sketchy about so I personally don't like to bring it up.  As with the rest of us on either side, I don't have all the pieces to the puzzle.  But I do know that the basic human hivemind would not ask questions if they saw some random official looking people around their building every now and then, they would just shrug it off, say its for another dept, and be on their way with their own business.  Now, I'm having some real big issue with the way you are describing nanothermite.  What you mean inventing?  It's been researched by the U.S. military since the early 1990's.  Conspiracy theorists didn't invent anything with that.  And it is not super secretive, nothing about it is.  Quit trying to muddy the issue by saying such random, made up things, that is all you are doing by saying such lies.  I have to admit, you made me briefly question myself and made me look up nanothermite to see if I've been following a lie.  This non-existent super secretive thing has a wikipedia page among other things.

        <p>
         Yeah, of course they're going to have to give a reason for conducting the war games.  While we should know why they wanted to do those war games to begin with, we shouldn't immediately be satisfied with the first reason they give us though.  The government lies, always has, probably always will.  If the conspiracy is right, it doesn't take much to figure out that they're going to say the war games were for a different reason.  Doesn't take much critical thinking here.

         You are taking the original point of the double tree video out of context.  There was no reason, ESPECIALLY if the video didn't have anything to show, to keep it from the people for so long, let alone requiring a lawsuit.  It is for that reason that I see that they had no issue releasing that particular video, much like that other pentagon one; because it had nothing to show.  Doesn't matter if there were hundreds upon hundreds of video cameras pointed directly at the crash site, if they confiscate them all but release the 1 or 2 tapes that don't show anything, that'll be enough to convince people such as yourself that there's nothing going on.  The hundreds and hundreds of tapes was just to illustrate my point, nothing else.  On the other hand, just throwing random theories out there, if the video did by chance show something like some other plane flying above the pentagon, a year would be more than enough time to remove it via editing.  But I don't really have much to go by that, I'm just using it as an example of things that could be done behind the scenes.

         Oh, hey, look, a website dedicated to debunking 9/11 truthers, I'm SURE they'll post evidence and testimonials against what they're trying to say.  That was just lazy.  Moving on.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Actually, my whole point about them being passively coerced into altering their stories ("I saw what looked like a missile,"  'It was actually a plane sir, please say that.") was completely ignored.  I'm not saying all of these are coerced testimonials, and I'm not ignoring them.  You, however, seem to be ignoring my other inquiry about the other eyewitnesses who for some reason said things other to the contrary.

       Just go on the web and search for thermite videos. Check out some of the aburd amount of thermite people have used for projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then imagine you had to use a record amount of thermite, sneak it all in, set it all up without being detected. Just the massive scale of loading up one of the largest buildings in the world with thermite becomes laughably monumental.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you see how much work just to get one bar seperated... you'll see how valid the thermite claims are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I'm not ignoring your elevator comment, just doing some research on it. I have heard this before, but finding legitimate sources on this claim is another story.

       They collapsed nothing like a controlled demolition. Controlled demolitions have very specific indications. There are explosions with visible squibs preceding the collapse; the explosions are at specific structurally important locations, almost all at the bottom of the building to allow gravity to assist; the explosions are extremely loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current record-holder for the tallest building explosively demolished is the
       <a href="http://www.controlled-demolition.com/jl-hudson-department-store">
        J. L. Hudson Department Store
       </a>
       , a building one quarter the size of the WTC towers. It took 12,000 pounds of explosives to do it, almost all located on the bottom floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at the WTC towers. Imagine what it would take to cause a top-down collapse explosively. Let's be generous to truthers and say only 4,000 pounds of explosives would have been necessary per floor. Let's say the phantom bombers who planted the explosives knew they wouldn't need explosives above floor 80 and below floor 10. If you're looking at a controlled demolition, you're looking at one that would have taken, by these highly generous numbers, 280,000 pounds of explosives. Per tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait, there were no sounds of explosives indicative of regular controlled demolition, so what about thermite? Well, it would take substantially more thermite to cut through those supports than it would regular explosives, assuming you could rig something like that up at all, so you're talking about around *
       <em>
        a million pounds
       </em>
       of thermite crammed into the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that had happened, today we'd be talking about the day the towers melted.

       There is evidence of a standdown.  There are statements from officials, 20 hours worth of audio from Norad, and the simple fact that three of the planes hit their targets without interception.  There is evidence for a standdown, interference from wargames, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are saying the standdown did not occur and that the wargames did not interfere.  I'm sure you are a bright person, but to me you are just some dude posting on the Internet.  Do you have a secondary source to backup your statement that the standdown did not occur and that the wargames did not interfere?  Did someone with someone with a reputation and investigative skills study this, and publish their work under their own name?  If so, where?  Because, if not, then it's just a seemingly false statement from some dude on the Internet.

       I'm not arguing with you, as I haven't read your sources nor do I believe that I know what happened on 9/11 either way.  But the lack of interception is very strange.  If a civillian jetliner goes off radar/course for even moments fighters will scramble to intercept it.  It doesn't take long, they keep them running on APU power at all times.  Pilot just needs to jump in, light up the engines and go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this because I worked on many flightlines during my time in the Air Force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, unless some major cock-up happens, an airliner that goes off course for any reason should have a fighter escort in a matter of minutes.

       There are fighter pilots all over the US waiting around for planes to go off course? (pre 911)?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not from the US so what do i know, but that just sounds really expensive and a little absurd to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The air controllers instantly call up a military base because he loses contact with a jet? and the pilots are suited up waiting for the call?

       They're not specifically waiting for planes to go off course, but there are always pilots on alert that could get to their jets in a matter of minutes.  It doesn't cost them much, APU's don't use much fuel (relatively speaking) and the pilots are paid the same amount no matter what.  At my base they'd usually sit and play Halo or Crimson Skies in the cool room they built with an HD projector and fully stocked bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I worked bombers mostly, so our combat launches took a bit longer than the fighters  (we could probably get a jet up in the air from a cold start in 5-10 minutes).  The fighter guys would laugh at us for being so slow, haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have numbers, but I'd imagine that when I would troubleshoot issues on the jet, and bring all 4 engines up to Aug (afterburner), that burned through a lot more fuel in those few minutes than a sitting on APUs all day.

       Just check out the timing of when things were reported and when the planes crashed into the buildings. You'll see how little time they had. Our guys are fast, real fast, but they just weren't fast enough :(
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll quickly break it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       First plane: 6 minutes before they crashed... they were just about to take off when the planes crashed...
      </p>
      <p>
       Second plane, they were alerted to the second plane almost at the same time as it crashed
      </p>
      <p>
       Third plane: was not notified until it was down
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth plane: was not notified until it was down
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, don't take my word for it, go read the timing for youself

       this are all true. e.g. before 2001 a small 2 seat plane flew off course for a few minutes over DC before airforce met up with him in the air. USAF people are suited up at all times all over the country waiting to be called, a waste of money maybe but it's going on

       A disputed Wiki page, a admittedly biased wiki, and the 9/11 Commission report is not what I had in mind when I asked for reputable secondary sources. Activist debunkers are just as deluted as some in the 9/11 Truth Movement. Find real information from trusted sources and present it, or analyze primary information if you have the time and skill set.

       Captain Chris Boyle
Engine 94 - 18 years
      </p>
      <p>
       Boyle: ...on the north and east side of 7 it didn’t look like there was any damage at all, but then you looked on the south side of 7 there had to be a hole 20 stories tall in the building, with fire on several floors. Debris was falling down on the building and it didn’t look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firehouse: When you looked at the south side, how close were you to the base of that side?
      </p>
      <p>
       Boyle: I was standing right next to the building, probably right next to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firehouse: When you had fire on the 20 floors, was it in one window or many?
      </p>
      <p>
       Boyle: There was a huge gaping hole and it was scattered throughout there. It was a huge hole. I would say it was probably about a third of it, right in the middle of it. And so after Visconti came down and said nobody goes in 7, we said all right, we’ll head back to the command post. We lost touch with him. I never saw him again that day.

       Pull, as in pull the fire team out because there's no hope in hell of putting the fire out and it's getting dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       After debris hit WTC7, small fires broke out. But the sprinkler system was poorly designed, and there wasn't enough water pressure for the firefighters that went in to put out the fires. So the fires spread out of control over the course of hours until firefighters noticed a bulge in the building which is an indicator of collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: The fires went on for HOURS, spreading uncontrolled to MULTIPLE FLOORS, before the fire chief finally gave up and pulled the team out.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't need to blow up the building; it was already in the early stages of collapse from the spreading fire.

       You can say there was no stand-down, and I can't prove there was one, but you can't deny that NORAD's response was uncharacteristically absent, and the excuses of lacking transponders doesn't carry weight considering the vast power of US military radar technology.

       If you don't buy their explanations, half-truths, or ignorance, then you're a sheep.  If on the other hand someone takes them up on it with another set of facts, they're not interested in rebuttal but just downvote you.

       This is why I have a hard time respecting truthers.  I don't doubt that we're not getting the full story on 9/11, but for as long as this is how they go about proving their case, we'll get no further, and people will continue to treat them as dingbats.

       Step back and think logically for a quick second.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was an inside job, why plant the hijackers passports 6 miles away? You wouldn't, plain and simple. So this argument does more to support the official report than debunk it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you run simulations across the country to prepare for the very event you're carrying out the same day? Why run the simulations at all? You wouldn't. Could it be that they were preparing for something like this because of intel they had received? Much more likely and logical.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're the government, and you want to get rid of incriminating files surely the obvious and logical course of action is to demolish the buildings they were in, killing thousands of innocent people and causing billions in damage while blaming a "fictional" enemy. Again, no, it is not. You're the fucking government. You just walk in and seize them. End of story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there are a lot of unanswered questions but that's what happens when there's a disaster with so much destruction. Assuming a clear and concise story of exactly what happens is possible in a situation like this probably means you should start seeing a psychiatrist about that schizophrenia problem you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all that said, did the 9/11 commission do a thorough job in reporting what happened? Of course not, they never were going to. That's what happens when a question of national security arises. Does it suck that complete transparency wasn't made? Sure. Would it have been better for us all if full disclosure was allowed? Maybe, maybe not, there's really no way to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: Try to use logic and reason to analyze your arguments first or else people will likely discredit the few decent points you might make.

       The point of the 9/11 attacks, at least from the point of view it's an inside job, is that they were done to get into an otherwise illegal and eternal war for the benefit of the military industrial complex. I don't know about the simulations the military bases, that's the first I've heard of it, but the debris field was needed to show and to build a memorial to rally around, with the passports to give us enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember too, one of the reasons for false flag operations is to create something for the country to rally around, in terms of martyrs or whatever. Sure, the WTC alone is pretty good for that, but Flight 93 was an example of how we fought back, initially. Well-written, if you ask me. It's not just about the files that were destroyed, it's about creating an eternal war to fund the complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other pieces of the puzzle include WTC 7 falling down, which is now the first and only instance of a steel-framed skyscraper falling down by fire alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there concrete evidence? No, of course no, because as you said, they're the fucking government, and have more money and power than you could imagine. But really, looking back, do you feel 100% certain you were told the truth about the whole thing? I don't, and the fact that there's any doubt about it scares me. At least Pearl Harbor (which it's been likened to) had a definite enemy and visible evidence of what happened.

       I agree with this.  The thing about Pearl Harbor though...do you REALLY think the US didn't know an attack was coming? Do you think we could build an atomic bomb, but not know a huge fleet from Japan was coming to attack? Surely, people knew an attack was coming and did nothing about it...

       I mean, the world was much... bigger back then, if you get my meaning. Without the satellites and other intelligence tools we have now, I could see it being missed especially in the Pacific, where we weren't so focused. The Japanese were running interference at the time too, diplomatically.

      <p>
       They were running several simulations that day, so let's analyze the possible motives behind each one:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Operation Northern Vigilance
       </strong>
       , was a NORAD operation which involved deploying fighter aircraft to locations in Alaska and Northern Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Possible motive:
       </strong>
       deploy fighter aircraft to the location in the US farthest away from the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Global Guardian and Vigilant Guardian
       </strong>
       , organized by United States Strategic Command in cooperation with Space Command and NORAD was a war game that simulated a hijacking of an American flight. The interruption of the war game with real word events led to some confusion for those participating
       <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2006/08/norad200608">
        as evidenced by the NORAD recordings
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Possible Motive:
       </strong>
       Confuse the experts.

       Actually it made it much

        less plausible

       The problem with your interpretation of events aren't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Vigilance did not change the amount of fighters on alert in the United States. There were 17 fighters for the entire United States.

      <p>
       If you listen to the tapes you can clearly hear they know the difference between real world and exercise.

       We were unprepared for 9/11? ABSOLUTELY. 100 percent UNPREPARED. But this is in no way a malicious action or an order to stand down.

       Yep, I was wrong, there were 20 for the United States. 12 were on the East Coast.

        When the Sept. 11 terrorists struck, the United States and Canada were defended by 20 fighter aircraft, arrayed in pairs in 10 locations, said Lt. Col. Roberto Garza, a NORAD spokesman. They were kept armed and fueled, with pilots nearby, ready to take off in less than 15 minutes.

       Before September 11th hijackings were not used as weapons against buildings. During September 11th, Dick Cheney definitely would have done it given the opportunity to have done so. But policy before September 11th? Bullshit.

       It's cool that you can admit you're wrong...a lot of people (especially on r/conspiracy) can't do that...or maybe that's just reddit in general.  So props to you.  My mother is a flight attendant, and according to her, if the plane is hijacked, it is protocol to have fighter jets scrambled

       Your first link is a unintentional civilian plane crash around the Pentagon, not a terrorist attack intentionally crashing into the pentagon. The pentagon is near an airport, so they prepared for the eventuality of a plane crash nearby. Had nothing to do with terrorist slamming it into the pentagon. Had everything to do with being in the flight path of an airport.

       Terrorists bombed World Trade Center in 1993. So why would it be on the cover of a 1997 manual? Oh yeah, terrorists bombed it in 1993.

       thinking logically. That's how I know that your first three arguments don't debunk anything: they all enlist the limited viewpoint of an outside spectator/civilian, with no access to the actual motives or mindset of the actual criminals, whoever they may turn out to be. While I can think of no reason to plant passports 6 miles away, I can think of no reason NOT to, either. I can think of plenty of reasons why "the government" wouldn't just walk in and seize incriminating files: reluctance to be seen as totalitarian in the public eye, legal issues, etc. 
And as for the simulations, well, that's actually quite interesting. You see, the exact same thing happened in London during THEIR bombings. And when you think about it, it does carry some real logistical benefits to set things up this way.

      <p>

       So you're saying that there was massive cooperation by the US military? So much so that "all of the air force bases in the NE and possible across the country...were running a simulation to prepare for an event where commercial airliners are hijacked..."?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the most compelling argument against the 9/11 conspiracy is that, logistically, it would take a huge number of people to have some form of knowledge about what was happening. To say all of the Air Force bases were involved just adds to that number. If this were in fact orchestrated by the government it could only have been carried out with a bare minimum number of people being involved. Getting all of these other parties involved just doesn't make sense.

       Lastly, I recommend reading up on what logic and reason actually mean. And while you're at it, look up fallacies of argument as well. You seem to be confusing the two.

       Just focus on building 7, forget about the rest. If building 7 could not have come down due to the fire and its minor structural damage, then it had to be explosives. If it was explosives then it was an inside job. The rest will fall in place accordingly.

       I don't take the "Official" story as gospel, but neither am I rushing to have faith in truther claims. I hope this gets read before getting downvoted, I want to foster an honest discussion here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WTC7, a 48 story building collapsed at free fall speed in it's own footprint. It just happened to be home to some of the most important offices outside of DC for the IRS, CIA, Secret Service, and the SEC....which subsequently lost all the files for the cases against Enron.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Circumstantial evidence- it smells bad, but doesn't prove anything concrete.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fligh 93, disintegrated upon impact, yet left a debris field 6 miles away where investigators found all of the paper passports belonging to the hijackers. Same thing for WTC1 &amp; WTC2.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       'Disintegrated' does not mean 'Disappeared from Reality'- of course something as large as a plane is going to have a great deal of debris.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The commission report claims WTC 1&amp;2 fell due to kerosene (jet fuel) fires melting steel columns, yet there are several published pictures of people in both buildings standing in the holes where the planes hit, waving flags to be rescued.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Jet fuel isn't going to instantly liquify the steel columns in a building, just soften and weaken parts of them to the point where they won't hold a tower up for long.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The day of 9/11, all of the air force bases in the NE and possible across the country, I would have to look that part up, were running a simulation to prepare for an event where commercial airliners are hijacked and used as weapons to run into....wait for it.....the pentagon, the white house, and.....sky scrapers in NYC.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Please look that part up, a citation is very important here. But if true, it's unsurprising, since the intelligence community had caught wind of possible 9/11 plans. And again, this isn't evidence- yep, it's fishy, but our brains seemed wired to see patterns in coincidence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The evening of 9/10 Donald Rumsfeld announced the DoD could not account for $2.3 Trillion in it's budget....the next day a commercial jet flew into the Armed Services budget office at the Pentagon.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think it's so crazy or out of the ordinary for the DoD (especially under Rumsfeld) to say "oh hurrr gee I have no idea where that money went". It's sad, and it shouldn't be that way, but I mean, come on, when has the US military budget been completely accounted for? Since when were Rumsfeld et al considered so competent that a fuckup like this is proof of a Reichstag fire? This is bad evidence- you've established a motive without any other evidence backing it up. This is like if a neighbor you despised was murdered mysteriously and you were convicted of it because you said you hated that dude.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Where are the videos of the Pentagon, besides the 10 or so frames the FBI release? There are many other locations that had security cameras with perfect views.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       classifiedvideos.pentagon.gov/pleasedontgointhisfolder/iwarnedyou/noreallytopsecretclearanceonly/okicannotstopyou/:(/insidejob.avi
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read the history of paranoia in the Department of Defense? And do you remember how crazy EVERYTHING got in the government in 2001? Here guys, we just got allegedly attacked by foreign nationals, let's put all our security footage online.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At bare minimum, the 9/11 Commission did a piss poor job in it's report, and we need a new, independent commission to investigate....but that's not likely to happen.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I completely agree! But... a weak commission doesn't mean that they were being manipulated or doing the manipulating, though. There is a shocking amount of incompetence in government, and not because the gummint is flawed- rather, humans are flawed. We fuck up a lot, but think of our politicians and celebrities as somehow above this. When they slip up in a very human way, it's a shitstorm or a conspiracy. In actuality, they're as susceptible to failure as the rest of us, and not some sort of omniescent gods sent from the moon to rule us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, none of this is
       <em>
        solid
       </em>
       proof of foul play. I empathize with the idea that the truth is out there and being covered up... I have not read a report of exactly what happened on 9/11 that's satisfied me. I'm just not convinced by Truther claims, most of which which start from the Hypothesis, skip to the Conclusion, and backfill everything in-between.

       Going to respond to your points 1 by 1
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         the Enron case wasn't condensed into a single building... If your saying that the Enron case is motive... you forget that A. Enron already collapsed, even if they were going to "protect" it by destroying the case, the company was dead already. B. Enron isn't or rather, wasn't a major player in politics, now if there was some major thing about Goldman Sachs, Coca Cola / Pepsi / Boeing / halliburton, MAYBE, but they still don't have the power to do that.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It disintegrates on impact because its entire fuel load burns at 1500 degrees. It was traveling at 500-700 MPH (MUCH higher then normal because it crashed after a sharp dive), do you know how a car crash works? Hitting the ground does not make stuff go to 0 mph, its still traveling at that speed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The jet fuel does melt steel columns, not sure what you mean to imply by your point, that nobody would be alive to wave flags? You sir are a moron... PEOPLE WERE FUCKING JUMPING OUT OF WINDOWS BECAUSE THEY WERE EXPOSED TO 500+ DEGREE TEMPERATURES JUST FROM BEING NEAR TO THE BURNING FUEL!!!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This point gives us a reason why it wasn't done by the gov... If they were doing drills to prevent this sort of thing, you would think it would be counter-intuitive because it would prepare them to stop this sort of thing. Show me something where they were told explicitly not to do these drills, then thats a sketch point still, but closer to logic. Also, air force bases to drills like this all the time. Air force bases actually go through rotations for certain events. Like one day they may be practicing what happens if Cessna crosses into restricted airbase, another day they may practice drills for lost contact with military aircraft. They go through these things all the time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You should really get to understanding economics and how defense spending works... He was referring to the fact that continually agencies don't log expenditures, he was talking about it because defense spending is excessive. The 2.3 trillion was over a period of 30 or so years probably. Even if your saying they took out money to do 9/11... your looking at this tiny piece of evidence in the face of all of the other money trails that show us that the taliban / al qaeda worked together (sorta) to train pilots in commercial jets... and it doesn't take 2.3 trillion to do any of this...
And really.... if we did this to ourselves, they would be smart enough to not announce shit like this THE DAY BEFORE THEIR ATTACK
If there such big criminal masterminds, how can idiots like you and idiots all over the interwebz find these ridiculous non stories that they say links the U.S. to direct involvement in 9/11.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There actually weren't any better placed cameras, and if there were, im guessing a planes burning fuel and impact force will knock those out...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You haven't read the 9/11 commission report... Its over 500 pages... It gives insight and recommendations and transcripts for ATC and everything... It was an independent commission. The reason new ones aren't formed is because A. they did their job properly, and B.  theres no reason to form a new one when the only people who think there should be a new one are idiots who can produce no actual evidence.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Also, to people saying 9/11 commission reports ignore all this stuff... they weren't going on the internet to look at theories... They were reporting on the facts explicitly and not some BS about a piece of wreckage with a slightly different trajectory (which by the way was a part of a jet turbine that was still spinning / had its own thrust) read all of the 500+ pages it has then talk to me.

       The only thing connecting Bin Laden to the attacks was a tape found in a bombed out building:

        "In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, in which Osama bin Laden is talking to Khaled al-Harbi."

       Bin Laden has never been indicted for the 9/11 attacks, check the FBI most wanted list, and check his profile... It's not there, atleast last time I checked it wasn't.  While your on his profile, check all the things he has been indicted for, then keep this in mind the CIA met up with Osama at a hospital in
       <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/nov/01/afghanistan.terrorism">

       .  Why not arrest him and bring him in?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that the "official story" is just as much of a conspiracy theory as any other theories out there.

       I'm not saying 9/11 was an inside job, although I do beleive that, my new tactic has been to show people who don't beleive in a 9/11 conspiracy, that the official story of 9/11 is a conspiracy theory as well... and it is.

       You're ending your theory too soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Afghanistan
2) Iraq
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take a look at what country is between Afghanistan and Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Iran
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how Iran is now the hot topic. Israel seems to want an invasion of Iran more than Obama does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at a map of the Middle East and think about it strategically. If we look at past world wars, we see major regime changes that are often marked by the shifting of borders on the map. Now let's say we do invade Iran while maintaining occupation forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. Meanwhile, Israel deals with Syria and Jordan. When all is said and done, you'll have a seamless path from Israel all the way to Pakistan (which the US happens to be stepping up aggression towards).
      </p>
      <p>
       I always like to think what the map of the Middle East may look like after the next war. There's certainly no saying which way it'll go, but it's very interesting to think about what each different side would like to see happen to the map.

       Near the end of 2001 the Taliban had all but destroyed most poppy fields in Afghanistan on moral grounds.  They're back in full production now that the US is in the area.  Check out the official statistics from the UN.

       by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie.  But the English version is censored, so you'll need to pick up a translation of the original French.

       I don't pretend to know what happened either way.  I can not say I believe the official commission report nor do I believe much of what the 9/11 truth movement brings forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that has always intrigued me though, who benefited the most from everything?  I'd say the CIA. Given that the CIA is known to do these kind of things (false flag attacks, etc), and they benefitted so heavily from it... it kinda makes you wonder.

       Define "benefit", though. Did they get money? Sure. Where did the money go, though? Into missions? That means people have to actually go out and do work, etc. Increased influence? I guess, but they already had major influence before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess, for me, that someone would have a personal gain in this to be motivated to murder &gt;3k people. I just don't see it in the CIA specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could you argue the government benefitted? Yes. But then the argument is, where's the evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Couldn't it just be that the government took advantage of a terrible thing that happened?

       What are the point of drills and exercises if they don't work?  I live in Denver and fighter jets "train" and fly all the time so they are ready for a scenario when it actually happens.  Military goes through extensive training all the time, so they are ready (ready as can be) when a scenario happens.  This is where I think your logic is faulty

       Just google it, it's about a supposed message threat that day that used the not-widely-known code name for Air Force 0ne, implying some inside actors. Like many details from that day events, it's hard to vouch for its' validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for N0RAD, what's suspicious is the number of emergency drills scheduled for that day, with scenarios very similar to the attacks. If we take as fact that external agents plotted the whole event, then they must have had an insider, a mole somewhere, and so far, that hasn't even been hinted at on the official reports.

       I think you need to look up what false flag really means. The King David Hotel bombers (Lehi/Irgun)
       <em>
        announced their intent
       </em>
       a few days before the bombing and took credit for it afterwords. And the
       <em>
        USS Liberty
       </em>
       was a friendly fire incident. Israel never tried to blame someone else for the attack.
      </p>

       Still not sure what this has to do with 9/11.

       A false flag operation means pinning the blame on someone else. In the examples that you gave, only one was a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were dressed as Arabs in the King David hotel not to put the blame on Arabs, but so that they could sneak in. They took full credit for the bombing as soon as it happened, and even warned them days before about what they were planning to do. Not once was an attempt made to pin the bombing on Arabs. Not a false flag. (not to mention the fact that this was the Irgun/Lehi that executed the attack. They were a separate organization that had nothing to do with the groups that eventually became the Israeli government)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Lavon affair
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a false flag attack, that I'll give you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not debating the circumstances of the USS Liberty and who you have spoken with and how many websites about it there are, I'm debating whether or not it was a false flag operation. Now, considering that it was patently obvious that the it was Israeli planes, with Israeli markings that attacked the USS Liberty, and how Israel took the blame for it right away and sent ships to pick up the survivors, I don't think that they were trying to blame Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are saying is because 50 years ago, you believe that Israel deliberately attacked the US, they did 9/11?

       In 1946 they dressed as Palestinians and bombed a hotel. Not a military base but a hotel!
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1954 they bombed the US embassy!

       This shouldn't be a discussion of theories of whether or not there was a plane at the Pentagon or if it was a missile. The government won't release the videos and there's nothing we can do about that. However, there are actual names that can be looked up. Not Mohammed Atta. Research Dominic Suter and his company, Urban Moving Systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       DOMINIC SUTER IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES OF EVIDENCE WE HAVE LINKING ISRAEL TO 9/11. AND HE'S BACK IN THE COUNTRY AS WE SPEAK!

       There's a vast, nearly insurmountable divide between the Gulf of Tonkin Incident and 9/11 in both its planning and scale of destruction. To use your analogy, if one had a history of auto theft, he still probably wouldn't come under much suspicion if an 747 went missing.

       If these supposed conspirators had wanted to enact draconian security measures and engage in foreign wars, they could've more easily caused destruction on a far lesser scale and still blamed Al-Queda. The sheer scale of the 9/11 attacks and the lasting economic impact, as well as the science debunking conspiracy theories, leave me to believe 9/11 wasn't an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you were to say that perhaps there were elements within the government that knew of the terrorist plot and allowed it to unfold, then perhaps I'd be inclined to at least see that as a reasonable conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still find it hilarious, though, that people continue to discuss 9/11 as a conspiracy when there was an obvious and proven and more recent conspiracy that threw us into war with Iraq. WMD, you say?

       No, it was that 40 years ago some idiot actually got a dumbass plan far enough that it had to be denied officially.

       i don't care about "controlled demolitions". i don't need that to convince me that the publicized official story is about as believable as santa clause. your utterly naive view of the events that happened that day are about as sad as the people who still believe there were WMD's in iraq. but you're probably right, the government would
       <em>
        never

       cause the deaths of thousands of people and lie about it.

       lets just say i've dealt with your type before. whether you realize it or not, the biggest obstacle in your path to truth/reality is the misconception that people in our government would never kill it's own people for their advantage. once you come to terms with the fact that our government has, and will continue to kill innocent people to advance their goals, it will be easier to look at the
       <strong>
        entire
       </strong>
       story behind 9/11. (and no, i'm not talking about explosives or radio controlled airplanes or even the jew world order).

       I have never said that, and you can't quote me as having said that, so why do you keep insisting that's what I believe? It isn't.

       I actually don't mind truthers that talk about theories that don't involve explosives or lasers or r/c planes, even though I disagree with them. It's the ones that come up with the extra-crazy theories that bother me, which is 90% of the truther community.

       My problem with truthers, and I hope truthers see this and think about what I'm saying, is that the controlled demolition theory has been shown to be invalid ad nauseum. I always wondered why truthers didn't just argue the government hired people to hijack planes. Wouldn't that have been easier to accomplish than months of wiring explosives in secret, with less chance of being caught? You basically hand off an untraceable wad of cash somewhere and the deal's done.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, the truthers have to go "crazy mode" and come up with outlandish theories about space lasers and mini nukes and remote controlled planes etc etc. It just doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I don't think the government executed the attacks at any level. I'm just saying that of the available scenarios, why did the truthers pick the crazy one to latch on to?

        /r/911truth

       , though. 99% of those submissions there are based on some complex theory, with 90% probably being about controlled demolition alone. I think in context of that and the truther movement on Digg that I came from seeing, it's fair to say a large amount of truthers believe a crazy theory.

       , digg truthers, etc get more traffic and views than any of the other sites. Yes it's true I'm limited to a few sites, but that's a LOT of traffic I've just listed out, there.

       You do realize that this thing failed because Kennedy wouldn't sign off on it, right?  If presented with a similar offer, would Cheney and Bush sign off on it?  Who knows.  How about if they were told that Haliburton would get first dibs on security?

       Nope, their petition is for a new investigation. They did not get added to that list because of the controlled demolition nonsense. Look at the careful wording of the site: They want you to believe that's why all of the engineers signed on, but that's not what they actually

       What if you had a speeding ticket 40 years ago, and a cop pulled you over, and didn't have to prove today you were speeding, he just said that you did it 40 years ago so obviously you are capable of comitting the crime now. Or to make it even more relevant, what if your grandfather got a speeding ticket 40 years ago, and you got a speeding ticket today because of it? It's the same standard of proof.

       False equivalence.  The survey wasn't about whether or not the Germans knew of 9/11's existence, it was whether or not they believed the official story.  It wasn't a survey about knowledge, as your 3 branches survey was, it was a survey about belief.

       In court, discussing a person's previous criminal history is used both by the prosecution to establish the character of the defendant, is it not?  The judge also uses this information when dishing out sentences, i.e., repeat offenders generally get harsher punishments.

       The most airtight argument I've heard is this: George Bush was notified of the events while visiting an elementary school, and remained there for nearly a half hour after this notification. His itinerary having been made public several months beforehand, the secret service should have assumed that the school was a target and evacuated it--unless, of course, they knew for a fact it was not a target.

       If you were pulling off an awesomely planned false flag operation, why would you have the president sit around in a school for half an hour? Why have him in front of the public at all? Why take that risk that he wont fake a good reaction.

       Part of your plan is for bush to lead us all to war afterwards right? So why not have him looking competent and awesome since it's all apparently stage managed? Having him look like a retard in public doesn't help your plan at all

       Having him look normal and doing stuff as scheduled is what makes everything seem normal and that he didn't know jackshit. 
One thing for sure they definitely knew the school was never the target. My question is how since they couldn't differentiate a hijacked anda normal plane that day remember?

       Basically there is an endless stream of evidence pointing to at the very least, complicity. You don't need to believe in controlled demolition, remote controlled planes or anything of the sort to have serious doubts about the legitimacy of the official story. Keep in mind that knowing the official story is a fraud =/= knowing exact details about how it was carried out.

       This is important. Much like people love for you to think you're either a liberal or a conservative, pro-life or pro-choice, etc., they love for you to think that you're either on the government's side or you're a conspiracy theorist. This simply isn't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts point toward a reality that is different from what the 9/11 Commission presented as the truth. There are heaps of evidence that something we don't fully understand took place. However, just because a certain party is wrong or presenting false information does not make them automatically complicit in the attacks or a large-scale coverup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that no one (other than any responsible and/or involved parties) knows what really happened, or why, but we do deserve an answer considering the actions taken by our government based on the incident. There is no doubt that, even if it was not directly responsible, the American government took great advantage of 9/11 to push its otherwise fucked up agenda forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think the reason the government doesn't want us to know more about 9/11 is because they're still using it as an excuse to kill people in the middle east every day. If they could've pulled off telling us there were WMDs in Iraq indefinitely, they would've. Their concern is selling immorality under the guise of justice (and let's not limit this to the government - how many bigots claim 9/11 as the reason for their racism, xenophobia, violence, and overall ignorance?). Just because 9/11 is an excuse and justification for horrific actions doesn't mean it was planned to be those things - people are opportunists.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       need to know the truth, though. So that no one may kill anyone else and rationalize it via a tragedy, basically.

       I think that if anyone, architects and engineers would know a controlled demolition when they see one. Over 1400 of them have signed a petition here:
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org">
        http://www.ae911truth.org
       </a>
       There are litterally dozens of these groups. Such as

       "they?": the PDF you linked to is authored by an individual.
Also, where did you get the impression that the author 'does' controlled demolitions? He is a writer/photographer. His company does not perform demolitions (inspections/recording/writing, yes; demolitions, no)

       "Really?

I make video games for a living and trust me that a lot of people writing/inspecting video games don't know shit about making them.

       Why did the FBI
       <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/pentagon/evidence/footage.html">
        confiscate security camera footage from a hotel and a gas station, both across the street from The Pentagon, immediately after the attack?
       </a>
       The guy who worked at the gas station said the FBI was there
       <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2001/12/1211_wirepentagon.html">
        "within minutes."
       </a>
       This would suggest to me that the FBI's top priority immediately following the attack on the pentagon, was to obtain and indefinitely contain any and all video evidence of what had really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago, the FBI released a
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paWiZ2Y8fRg&amp;amp;feature=related">
        few seconds of two videos
       </a>
       , although neither of them show a plane hitting the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the FBI, nearly ten years after "fact",
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       refuses to release any footage from
       <a href="http://infowars.net/articles/may2006/170506Pentagon_videos.htm">
        any of the 84 remaining surveillance tapes
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems kinda suspicious, that whole Pentagon situation does...

       Definitely suspicious, but I can imagine that they were deeply embarrassed by looking vulnerable.  Vivid footage of the Pentagon being hit would be symbolically very powerful.  From that perspective, an inside-job conspiracy actually serves them, it creates the idea that nobody can hurt the pentagon, except the pentagon.

       That's quite a compelling argument.  Why do you assume the only possible reason the pentagon would take the footage is because they themselves committed the act?  Crashing a jet, a missile, a truck, or whatever, into your own headquarters is a rather extreme proposition.  You should at least
       <em>
        consider
       </em>
       alternatives.

       No, it's not really like that at all, if you showed me something that made sense and was substantial I could be convinced.  Confiscating surveillance footage does not logically lead to shooting yourself with a missile.

       You are much more like a devout religious person, you have a strongly held belief and you look for things to point back to that belief.  Your thinking is backwards.

       Yes, I said "whatever" earlier because you weren't even saying whatever vague ass thing you were accusing the pentagon of doing, yet you were still accusing them of trying to blow themselves up and then trying to cover it up, I think.  You expect me to internet sleuth you in order to figure out what the hell stupid shit you're specifically alluding to?  I'd much rather be a douche than whatever kind of weird delusional stupid that you are.

       If the $3 Trillion defense system hadn't been designed to protect against Soviet missiles but hijacked airliners instead, I might see you point. As its purpose was to defend against an entirely different kind if enemy, I do not.

       The 911 commission was flawed, they were not even allowed to follow the money trail. Let me repeat that - - They were not allowed to follow the money trail. &lt;/sheesh&gt; Even the Warren Commission followed the money trail for Oswald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the co-chairs of the commission said the commission was "set up to fail":

       I find it incredible and totally unreasonable that anyone who agrees that the 911 commission was compromised for whatever reason would not support a new independent investigation of the biggest massacre in America since the federal government massacred the Indians?

       I majored in Mechanical Engineering. I was at home when the first tower came down. I remember thinking, "That's impossible!" But I had just seen it with my own two eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years later, "Loose Change." And it confirmed what was my instinct. Imagine that you're in park at a red light, and a car rear-ends you at about 10 mph, and both cars blow up and everyone dies. Seems like something else happened, right? Well, as an ME, that's exactly how it seemed to me. I would like to say that I am exaggerating, but I'm not. Neither of those towers should have collapsed. I don't know much about building 7, or I'd say "None of those 3 buildings".
      </p>
      <p>
       I've known about false-flag ops for some time. They've been around for a while. I read a ton of books about politics and political families and I know nothing happens by accident. (Very few things actually happen by accident).
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, apparently Yasser Arafat leaned over to Carter and asked him if he knew that Bill Casey and George Bush asked the Iranians to keep the hostages until after the election. (Reference:
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/American-Dynasty-Aristocracy-Fortune-Politics/dp/0143034316/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1296050762&amp;amp;sr=1-1">
        here
       </a>
       ). Just think about that for a minute. You're willing to leave Americans in a bind for an election. That's cold, man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, IMO, Americans (the govt anyway) have passed every such barrier. They're capable of anything now. Nothing's "cold" to them anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is not the tip of the iceberg. The media is a 2-d black and white photograph of that tip on a cloudy day. This ... ability to think freely ... is something that I was born with, so far as I can tell. I don't judge people who believe mainstream media, I really don't. Because I know why they want to believe that everything is A-OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you really need is to be willing to think about things. To not be afraid of looking under a rock, just because there may be some nasty critter there (there is). Don't be afraid of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I want to say that the 9/11 conspiracy is fairly tame. What I mean is that if you can't accept the evidence for the conspiracy (which is straightforward), then I'm not going to talk to you about space weapons.

       Quite objective. I can't claim to know but I'd imagine the books you've read are from one point of view (quite similar to how I mentioned Maintream vs. Alt media only showing one side). If you buy a book about flase flag operations then it's pretty obvious the author will have a bias leaning towards that fact.

       I don't call people sheep. I will say it jokingly sometimes. "You're asleep in the matrix, man." But as a Christian, I can't judge people by a different standard than I use on myself. And in many ways, I'm a sound sleeper also.

       Regarding your inquiry, I have to say "as an engineering
       <em>
        major
       </em>
       " because I'm a computer programmer. I never worked as an engineer. So my answer's not going to be as interesting as you'd hoped.

       When the towers came down I thought it was impossible because nothing really should have collapsed, just weakened. Buildings aren't made to withstand plane collisions (though now they may be), but they are made to withstand fire and heavy winds, even heavy oscillating winds. If you think of a single tower as a lever arm, the impact of a plane at the top is going to put a lot of very sudden force at the base. The same base that is made to support the weight of the entire structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concrete has severe compressive strength. But no tensile strength. Which is why they reinforce it with iron, or steel. Usually steel. The steel allows tensile strength to reinforced concrete.
      </p>

       Now this is where my instincts kicked in. When you're rock climbing, you're using woven nylon. Let's say you weigh 200 lbs. Well, fuck, the woven nylon has a 2 ton rating. It's overkill. That nylon would support a small truck. What would it take to duplicate a truck's sudden impact on the nylon? Well, dropping the truck from the top of the rock. In all honesty, depending on the size of the truck, I don't think the woven nylon would snap. Though I could be wrong. I'm actually not much of a climber anymore. But my point is that this overkill is very common in engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       The force required to do something is basically not a scenario. Let's assume the opposite to resume the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tower then should have collapsed into the base. This is what I was expecting to see. What I saw was that it collapsed from the top down. There was some discussion about the heat of jet fuel, but this is (IMO) nonsense. Complete nonsense. That steel was forged and quenched at much higher temperatures. It's been a while since I was in school, but the softening of the girders made no sense to me. So you're saying that the fuel was aerated enough to burn but not to cool? Bollocks! Even if it were, it wouldn't soften naked girders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, you have the collapse. Even if we assumed that I was in the wrong about the softening of the girders, the top of the building would collapse and fall off. They aren't dominoes. Each floor is made to withstand the weight of the floors above it. So am I to believe that the collapse created such dynamic weight that the other floors are going to collapse too?
      </p>
      <p>
       The overkill in the calculations of materials and strengths are such that you can fill the floors in with concrete and be okay. This is why no one cares how many people are in the buildings, or what they put in the buildings themselves, because they don't need to. So even if the heat made the upper floors collapse, you'd be left with 3/4 of a tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       This overkill is why they build skyscrapers in the first place. If the calculations were "close", they wouldn't.

       I agree about the misunderstandings, unfortunately it's more often than not idiots - it's refreshing to see I was wrong about you.

       I thought you meant an actually in the engineer field but it's still awesome having a majors in engineering, respect for that.

        When the towers came down I thought it was impossible because nothing really should have collapsed, just weakened. Buildings aren't made to withstand plane collisions (though now they may be), but they are made to withstand fire and heavy winds, even heavy oscillating winds. If you think of a single tower as a lever arm, the impact of a plane at the top is going to put a lot of very sudden force at the base. The same base that is made to support the weight of the entire structure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Concrete has severe compressive strength. But no tensile strength. Which is why they reinforce it with iron, or steel. Usually steel. The steel allows tensile strength to reinforced concrete.

      <p>
       I agree about the overkill - it's always better to err on the site of caution, especially in construction and planning. What you're saying about replicating the impact by dropping shows good
       <em>
        (Fuck, can't think of the appropriate word - Workaround-ing?)
       </em>
       skills which I find is a great way of dealing with problems like what you described with dropping the truck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose an apt scenario would be if the truck caught fire after being dropped. Say the nylon was coated with fireproofing material,
       <em>
        (I've never been a climber, can you get fire-proof ropes?)
       </em>
       maybe it could hold for a length of time. The stress of the hanging truck (loosely relating to the structural damage from having a plane inside a building) in combination with the fire might be enough to make the rope snap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously claiming that proves the 9/11 situation would be silly, but I suppose it's a fairly close example as to how extreme circumstances can affect properties of things.

       Quite a good argument, I suppose it rests on the claim that steel loses x% of its structural integrity at x Degrees. Care to discuss this at all? (although prolly not best on a week old reddit thread heh)

      <p>
       This comes back to a static vs. dynamic load I guess, or something along them lines. I think the hardest floor to go would be the first one that gave way, as it would've had the least dynamic force of each of the collapses (assuming a consecutive collapse of Floor 80 onto 79, 80+79 onto 78 etc...).
      </p>
      <p>
       Each floor would have more dynamic load than the previous floor did - I think the difference in dynamic and static forces explains why even though each floor descending would've been built to withstand more force than the one before.

       The 50th floor would have to support a force of:

       Yep. I agree with all of it. I am trying to remember how concrete behaves under dynamic load ... but drawing a blank.

       I think the biggest point about the 9/11 conspiracy (and conspiracies in general) is always missed. And that is we're not playing on the same team anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when POW's was a 'conspiracy theory'. The government said they didn't leave anyone in Vietnam unless they were MIA's, KIA's, etc.  I think in 2004 there were still 400 POW's, only they had integrated into Vietnam society. They settled down in Vietnam, unable apparently to forgive their country for having left them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that was the beginning of a splintering in America. You had people who wanted to be good, be ethical, here and abroad, and you had people who wanted whatever they wanted, damn it, and didn't want anyone thinking too much about it. Just action. War, in short. When you start breaking these important rules, such as never leave a man behind, it opens you up to anything, ethically.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it really interesting that it's so terrestrial, the 9/11 thing. I mean, it's not "Did we land on the moon?" where it's harder to get evidence. It's New York, only a few miles away for many many people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one that I thought about the most, that came from this thread actually, was the person filming the first plane crash. Just think about this. New York, skyscrapers, low visibility. Someone is camcording or cell-phone recording a narrow window of the world trade center at 8:15 am.?
      </p>
      <p>
       What was he doing, filming his dog pooping and ... whoa! what's that in the background a plane hitting WTC One?
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes me think that people knew about it. Well, it was
       <em>
        patently
       </em>
       a conspiracy anyway, based on the conspirator's plan, but the guy who filmed the first plane was expecting it, and this makes me think that a lot of other people knew and allowed it to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust is gone in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I tried to find the footage of the first plane, and I think my theory needs some work ;)

       Saying that "Neither of those towers should have collapsed" is an assertion that has to be left to people who have actually studied the data. The Purdue engineers who have actually studied the data demonstrated how the buildings fell with hard science. The report is publicly available and open to peer review.

       People have an illusion about incontrovertible evidence. Clearly, no evidence is or can be incontrovertible, because anything can be denied. If I had one wish, people would understand that we see what we want to believe. I would say that over and over again. Science doesn't really change that, because people interpret the results anyway they want to. (Global warming, anyone?)
      </p>
      <p>
       So I try to avoid discussions with people who believe that scientists are objective, or that science exists without scientists, as an abstract ideal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be interested in reading Purdue's study. Is
       <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/uns/x/2007a/070612HoffmannWTC.html">
        this
       </a>
       what you're referring to?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I don't know about space weapons. It's something that you see referred to in the literature from time to time, but like a lot of other things, until it comes from official channels, it won't be believed. I first heard about it from Noam Chomsky, then I wrote an email to Thomas PM Bartnett (
       <a href="http://globlogization.wikistrat.com/">
        his blog
       </a>
       ), and he said, and I quote "By and large, Chomsky is full of shit."
      </p>
      <p>
       He worked for the Pentagon as a middle-ranking guy for a long time, and he (apparently) never heard of any space weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       So either 1) they exist and they're a well-kept secret or 2) they just don't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       You remember star wars (Reagan) and the Columbia disaster. Some think that the shuttle was carrying a missile payload that detonated. Like all conspiracy theories, it needs evidence. That Feynman was able to explain the disaster in terms of cold O-rings speaks to me more about possibilities and less about truth. (And I'm sure it's going to be the same when I get around to reading that Purdue study.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Some say we never landed on the moon. But some others say that we did, but were chased off. By ET's. Some of this subset say that weapons in space are following a "plan." 1) Russians 2) Dictators 3) Terrorists 4) ET's. Star Wars would have been step # 1, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, anyone can plainly see that weapons in space would be ideal from a military perspective. Understanding the military-industrial complex (that it
       <em>
        needs
       </em>
       war to further itself), I am comfortable
       <em>
        assuming
       </em>
       that there are weapons in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may sound strange to some, but remember that Eisenhower warned us of the complex in '54 (farewell speech to the union), and look at what's happened since then. A false flag (Gulf of Tonkin) got us into 'nam. Skirmishes here and there.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22YnJxDFUQE">
        Here
       </a>
       is part 1 of 12 about our activities in Panama, which clearly paves the way to a future type of war, involving PsyOps. It's worth your time. And it fills in a couple of "blanks" between Nam and Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, there's a part in that documentary about future weapons. Some Nicaraguans said that cars were melted, cut in half. I think there was a mention of a green laser, but I would have to go back and listen to it. It doesn't speak so much about space, but about the Military Industrial Complex's need for war to develop and prosper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space has obvious appeal. Deploy anywhere in the world in minutes. Afghanistan featured a high level of satellite technology in deployment. In October 2001. It worked like fucking gangbusters.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there are a lot of evidence 'gaps' and holes when I say "there are weapons in space". Some NASA people have come forward and said that there are aliens, this and that, bases on the moon, UFO's, but until NASA itself says it, people aren't going to believe them. People see what they want to believe. I think if you're an astronaut, you're pretty damn credible. But never underestimate people's willingness to create illusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nixon has some things about NASA classified until 2026. I think there are probably going to come to light some things before 2050 or 2060 that will make it clear that there were weapons in space for a while, even pointed at our allies from time to time (who our "allies" are changes with the wind). But all of this is based on putting things together from literature. It's a long process, and I don't mind being proven wrong, but like I said, I just know these guys. They think in terms of war. It's how they see the world.

       I think there is much truth to what you said, which is why we need to rely on collective wisdom. There will always be outliers, but when those in the know tend to support a given conclusion, that conclusion is

       I like the fact that now there are other space agencies. I was disappointed when I looked for the Kaguya footage ... only to find that it had been manipulated by NASA via software. Hopefully every country will get into space and we can start getting lots and lots of data.

       Toploader, you are ignoring evidence; here is just ONE example because it is not worth my time to illustrate more than one fallacy
      </p>
      <p>
       6) Molten steel AND concrete were found at Ground Zero “remember, hydrocarbon fires do not burn hot enough to melt steel or concrete.”N.F.P.A. 921- 19.2.4 Exotic Accelerants states that molten steel and concrete could indicate the use of exotic accelerants, specifically Thermite.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did not test for these "exotic accelerants"....

       You provided no source, but I Googled it: Firefighters for 9/11 truth. The claim is that molten steel was found, but again, no source is provided for that. Who said it was steel? How did they know it was steel and not a metal that melts at a much lower temperature? Did anyone consider kilning effects?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to be one of the many claims that have been repeated over and over but have no evidentiary basis.

       It's probably one of the few times that a flight recorder was fired in to the top of a very large building and then collapsed in to a heap though too. Ie unusually hard to find, unusual potential for ongoing heat beyond just the aircraft fuel burn.
      </p>
      <p>
       But having said that, they found a lot of other stuff apparently, so maybe both recorders are in George Tenet's pool room or something.

       How were they able to identify victims from bone fragments and teeth, but not find the black boxes?  Every inch of that place was picked through and the rubble has been removed, yet no black box.  Are you going to say it burned up?

       “It was absolutely a plane, and I’ll tell you why,” says Kilsheimer, CEO of KCE Structural Engineers PC, Washington, D.C. “I saw the marks of the plane wing on the face of the building. I picked up parts of the plane with the airline markings on them. I held in my hand the tail section of the plane, and I found the black box.”

       I highly doubt that witnesses on the ground would be able to tell the difference between molten steel and other molten metals that melt at much lower temperatures.

       As I mentioned elsewhere, any paper that is blown clear would survive. Undamaged paper from the flight deck of the Challenger was found after the disaster, and that explosion was far more violent and explosive.

       That's simply untrue. The NTSB and FAA have many reports of black boxes that were not found or destroyed beyond usability. Even Googling the phrase brings up many instances were black boxes weren't found.

       The passport of Satam al-Suqami was reportedly recovered "a few blocks from where the World Trade Center's twin towers once stood";[22][23] a passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before the towers collapsed. The passports of two other hijackers, Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi, were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and a fourth passport, that of Abdulaziz al-Omari was recovered from luggage that did not make it onto American Airlines Flight 11.[24]

       hey smart one, that means the passport allegedly fell when the plane struck the tower. Now whether someone picked it up before or after the tower fell is not a critical detail to the absurdity of a passport being in one piece after a plane crash. get it?

       I hardly find that absurd.  Undamaged documents were found in and around the wreckage of both Space Shuttle disasters, and the Challenger explosion was far, far larger and more powerful than the crash of an airliner into a building. That paper can remain unburned when ejected away from fire is hardly unlikely..

       Alright, dude, I don't care about your position. I know for a fact those buildings came down demolition style. You can tell by just looking, and then building 7 came down like demolition for no reason. Passports shmassports, those buildings were demolished, how do you explain that? And if you contest that, you're going against the top 1,000 architects of the world.

       The 1000 top architects in the world? Sorry, that's just not true. AE911 Truth surely has some good people in it, buts it's also not an organization that checks the credentials of it's signatories. I'm one of them. Seriously. You can be too. When they submit a paper in a reputable journal for peer review, I'll very seriously consider it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assertive comments are ones that should be left to engineers and architects. The only studies done by engineers and architects and submitted for peer review support something akin the the official story: WTC 1&amp;2 fell due to catastrophic structural damage compounded by a weakening of the structure due to fire.

       And the series of exlosions that happened right before they feel being similar to actual charges going off in a building set up for demolition. Many eyewitnesses and firefighters share similar stories of boom boom boom boom explosions going down from the top to the bottom floors. go ahead.

       Again, the hijackers did not conceal their identity and they lived in this country for months. They used their real names and real ids to board the plane. They took flight lessons under their real names. Their families sure haven't seen them since. A report of someone living with the same name is not proof they are the same person. There is video of them getting on the plane....

       If presented with a similar offer, would Cheney and Bush sign off on it?  Who knows.  How about if they were told that Haliburton would get first dibs on security?

       Oh yeah, and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, you know, the incident that started the Vietnam war, actually never happened.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2005, an internal National Security Agency historical study was declassified; it concluded[7] that the Maddox had engaged the North Vietnamese Navy on August 2, but that there may not have been any North Vietnamese Naval vessels present during the incident of August 4. The report stated:
       </p>
       <p>
        [I]t is not simply that there is a different story as to what happened; it is that no attack happened that night. [...] In truth, Hanoi's navy was engaged in nothing that night but the salvage of two of the boats damaged on August 2.[8]

       Then you never walked from tower 1 and 2, across the massive plaza that took almost an entire city block, around the two story steel sculpture in the plaza - that was still standing after the towers collapsed - across church street, and the parking lot for Century 21 clothing, to building 7. As I did many times. They are nowhere near each other. And the Federal customs building, 200 feet (across the street) from tower 2 was damaged but still standing.

       I thought a lot about this.

       It might be hard for you to watch, but take a look of the videos of both collapses. Both initial collapses start right at the points of impact(the holes). In some of the tower 2 videos (south), you can see the upper floors remain intact as they fall.  Not until it passes the point of impact does the top of the tower get obscured.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first tower (north)was hit much higher up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the key to why this tower had ejected material further out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both towers when they collapsed had upper sections intact as they collapsed through the lower floors, but the North Tower (wtc1) this collapse initiated HIGHER then the South Tower and therefore the ejected mushroom cloud effect of debris ejected further out. The weight of the upper mass of floors ejected the material outwards. The initial point of collapse was higher, so material fell from a greater height and was ejected out further then the south tower.

       WTC 7 is definitely anomolous, but the evidence supporting nefarious intent is weak in my eyes. Why? Better explanations, such that WTC 7 straddled a substation and had a very atypical (read: less than ideal) design, and the massive fire that burned for hours (

       The "first time in history" deal is thrown around a lot but is demonstrably untrue. There are several examples of modern steel and concrete structures collapsing solely due to fire. Just a few:

       Interstate 580
Kader Factory
Dogwood Elementary
Mumbai High North Platform
Windsor Building
      </p>

       None of the above collapses were compounded by massive structural damage.

       "Inside Job" is a pejorative.  It implies a massive conspiracy of government bureaucrats to plan and execute the attack.  This, of course, is not the case, but sugesting this is what "the conspiracy" entailes makes it easily dismisable.  There was a massive governmental conspiracy, but this was with the distruction of evidence and suppresion of an honest investigation.

       You could not, in your wildest imagination, concoct an event that benefits the military industrial complex, big brother government programs, and corporate cronyism, to the degree of 9-11. From the very moment that event occurred everything has fallen right into place, and right into their hands. That is all the evidence I need. I believe the planes were hi-jacked, I believe that two of them flew into the World Trade Towers. Everything that has happened apart from those events is suspect.

       To make an argument that someone other than those flying the planes was involved in 9/11, I think Building 7 is the smoking gun. Forget about missing Pentagon videos, Operation Northwoods or even the theory of controlled demolition of the first two buildings - all of this is based on circumstantial evidence and for every item supporting these theories there is an equally valid counter-argument. You could debate these theories for years and never prove one side or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are a few facts about Building 7 that, in my opinion, show that something is wrong with the official story. First, Building 7 was not hit by a plane and was across the street from all of the other WTC buildings, yet still collapsed. The official reason for this was fire, yet there was a relatively small fire compared to other buildings that didn't collapse (Building 6 was located between No. 7 and 1, engulfed in flames and hit by debris of both towers falling but didn't collapse) making it the only steel-frame skyscraper EVER to collapse solely because of fire. This building was also in between two other large buildings that were also on fire but only sustained moderate damage and are still standing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, Building 7 was not mentioned AT ALL in the 9/11 Report. In fact, it took several more years for the federal government to finally acknowledge Building 7 in an official report. This was a building that was the third largest of the complex and would've been the tallest building in 33 states, and it didn't even get a sentence about it in the government's "comprehensive investigation."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not saying that 9/11 was an inside job, or even that the government played a part in the collapse of Building 7. I'm not hypothesizing about why this building collapsed or who was the cause. What I am saying is that this part of the story doesn't fit in with the rest and that a more thorough investigation is needed.

       Funny how nobody here brought up the Israeli connection. This is not to say that Israel acted alone, but evidence shows that much of the expertise involved with 9/11 came from Israeli agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fox News did a great report on Israeli spying before and on 9/11. Granted, this report does say that there is no evidence linking the Israelis to 9/11, but this will give you some good background knowledge of the operations in place to make this happen.
      </p>

      <p>
       Then you have articles and police interviews regarding Israelis arrested "dancing and cheering" across the Hudson River in NJ on 9/11. The September 12, 2001 edition of The Bergen Record (NJ newspaper) has a great article about this. It was never discussed again. I personally own the hard copy of this article and can confirm that it has been transcribed correctly.

      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have one man in particular who was arrested that day. He had a moving company and warehouse in NJ that were left completely abandoned when he fled to Israel following his arrest. This man was linked to the Zoomcopter ring centered in New Jersey malls. These malls acted as a way to funnel spies and explosive experts into the USA undetected.
      </p>
      <p>
       This man is now back in the US, using the same name, and operates a business linked to the vast Israeli locksmith ring. If you have the time, look into that.

       If the police went to the scene of a murder and saw the victim's husband standing across the street dancing, cheering, and having his friend photograph him with the murder scene in the background, I would say that is very relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of the Israelis who were arrested that day were on an Israeli talkshow and made it very clear that they were not responsible for the attacks. They told the audience that their purpose that day was "to document the events". Well that settles any debate on Israeli foreknowledge. But to the more important question, were the actually involved?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the story of Daniel Lewin on the plane and one account saying he had a gun. He was left out of some of the passenger lists, but on his company website was touted as a hero. He also has a very interesting history with the Israeli military and was conveniently omitted from several passenger lists published on 9-12 in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look into details surrounding the agents arrested, you will see that several were explosives experts.

       The evidence that 9/11 was an inside job is very difficult to come by - it's a theory. But to believe that 9/11 happened according to the official story is ludicrous - there are massive gaping holes in that argument that one has to conveniently ignore in order to accept the official story.

        The fact that an official investigation was fought tooth and nail and hampered once finally "a committe" was set up that then omitted most of the important issues. In fact Dick Cheney made the ridiculous claim that they shouldn´t waste time on it as they should instead be focusing on preventing new attacks.

       How stupid is that? If you´re a basketball coach and your team plays a game where the defence is letting everyone through and not getting any rebounds, would you ever make the claim that you didn´t want to study the game in question to find out what went wrong? Who was playing particularly bad and what areas you needed to focus on improving? Absolutely ridicilous.

       Most of the alleged hijackers had been tracked for a long time by the Defanse Department in this program, Mohammed Atta from 2005. All the documents on it was then destroyed... Even Fox News reported on this eventually:

       But there is so much more, everywhere you look there is more inconsistencies, blatant lies and ridiculous claims that fly in the face of all logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is obviously Operation Northwoods, the military drills designed to deliberately confuse the defense system, building 7 brought down in a controlled demolition, The Bush/Bin Laden family close financial relationship, Pentagon missing 2.3 TRILLIONS on september 10th, multiple warnings before the event from foreign agencies (
       <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/essay.jsp?article=essaytheytriedtowarnus">
        http://www.historycommons.org/essay.jsp?article=essaytheytriedtowarnus
       </a>
       - If all these foreign intelligence agencies could smell something was up, how come the CIA didn´t? And why having had all these warnings, some even very specific, such as the August 6 memo titled Bin Laden determined to strike in the US and mentioned hijacking aircraft, why did the Bush administration feign ignorance about the nature of the first plane hitting the tower? Why, at the very least, were the people in the second tower told to keep working and not at least told that there were warnings of this nature??)... also google project for a new american century and their report "rebuilding americas defences" from september 2000 for a clear picture on who had motive to do something like this

       I may continue this later, breakfast is due. Please watch one of the many detailed documentaries on this issue. Who benefitted? War mongers benefitted.

       I believe that at least some of the 'put options' were indeed investigated and traced to an unnamed source.  The government said that because this source could not be connected to Al-Queda, the transactions must have been innocent in nature.  Kinda scary logic there...I'd like to know who the unnamed trader(s) were.

       The "truth" of 9/11 will debated endlessly as there are as many forces arrayed against discovering it as there are trying to find it. That alone speaks volumes as to where the truth might be hiding.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are basically two camps that wrestle over what "the truth" is.  One camp decides they wish to believe the Commission and will accept remotely plausible explanations of what the other camp sees as a stonewalling investigation, glaring inconsistencies, coincidences too odd, physics manifesting itself in ways so rare and unusual that the explanations offered are contested by legions of highly qualified professionals, and a requisite confluence of events beyond the bounds of reasonable probability of coming together necessary to allow it to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The former camp sees those same set of rare oddities and decides, with help from the government, that it all jibes, is all tied up in neat package, and tries to cast out disbelievers, not as healthy skeptics, but as tin foil hatted lunatics trying to tear down the government. The latter group looks at those same oddities and says, "I smell a rat. Let's keep looking at this". I would think the casual observer would agree the latter group has the more forthright agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've said few other times,  I don't believe the government, as we know to be, was responsible. But I do believe there had to be some people in key positions to allow this to happen and with enough clout to scare anyone else who knew into stone silence.

       The people that orchestrated the plan did is so well that even 10 years later people wouldn't be able to see through it [easily]... especially the American people. People get their dose of American Propaganda everyday while watching the news etc. and it that constant state of worry / fear  what keeps them from questioning the so called truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't see someone being convinced when they come in saying, I don't believe anything thusfar but you should try and tell me something so you can fruitlessly attempt to convince me... in other words, one can infer that your merely Trolling.

       No, I'm challenging my beliefs. We ahould all do that.

      <p>
       I'm waiting for the piece of evidence that doesn't have a more reasonable non-nefarious explanation. No, I haven't seen it yet.

      <p>
       I do think that many people simply believe that which they wish to believe, and that goes for people on both sides of the debate. I'd rather accept the world as it really is than persist in delusion, no matter how reassuring that might be (Sagan paraphase). Frankly, I don't see good evidence. I see anecdotes, conjecture, and a lot of very bad armchair science by laypersons. Thats about it.

       AND the one time that one of NIST's peers over at Underwriters Labs did take a look at what they were doing, he raised concerns about the value of the testing at NIST and the fact that Underwriters Labs was now claiming they had never tested WTC steel samples which they had actually tested and found to perform perfectly at the WTC fire temperatures. Then a week later UL fired the guy who had raised the alarm.

       Define reputable?  You are aware the NIST is a government funded agency, correct? You are aware that no report linking the WTC collapse to controlled demolition would ever get accepted into a conference, right?  Conferences are research driven.  There's no research contribution to such a study.

       Same thing with global warming.  Numerous advocates of AGW have even said that there is an overly selective and unscientific process when it comes to reviewing papers that go against AGW.

       Regarding the NIST, just because they funded the Purdue research doesn't mean that had any sway in the results. Do you really think that all the professors, grad students, engineers, software architects etc. would sway the results based on who funded it? Where are the ridiculously wealthy Purdue professors paid to keep their mouths shut?

      <p>
       That's actually not true, at all.  At least in computer science, a significant portion of funding comes from HP Labs, Google Labs, Microsoft Research, Intel Labs, IBM, etc.  They fund significant research projects in academia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, Microsoft Research has one of the best computing labs in the world, and they don't just do R&amp;D, they do research for the sake of doing research, with no direct profit motive like with R &amp; D.

       Just because NIST didn't publish it in a journal doesn't mean that it can't be countered in a relevant journal. That happens all the time. If AE911 Truth has hard evidence to the contrary, it should be published to disseminate the information and improve the information through review.

       Yes, but no private donor is funding 9/11 research, at least to the size required to do a Purdue-style simulation. Why not? There are no shortage of well-healed celebrities who believe in some level of the conspiracy: Charlie Sheen, David Arquette, Rosie O'Donnell, Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin. Can't they fund an independent investigation?

      <p>
       What AE911 reports? I'm on their page now, and I don't see a single report that isn't self-referential and doesn't cite other sites which pre-suppose a conspiracy. Many, maybe most (I didn't count) of the reports on their site support a collapse due to structural damage and fires, not controlled demolitions.

       These conspiracy theorists probably have the most ironic beliefs of anyone on earth. They feel like they understand the world better than everyone else, yet the more educated you are the less likely you are to agree with them. A dramatic example is the AE911truth site. Their whole premise is that architects and engineers should know better than anyone and support them disproportionately. Yet they've only got 1400 signatories out of millions. They think this vindicates their views, while it actually only underscores their delusion.

       Hmm, let's think here for a moment.  Which is more likely:
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who took the time out of their day to make a post saying fairly genuine, reasonable things like "I am open to evidence" and "I have an interest in understanding how you've come to your beliefs"...is actually trolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <p>
       There is insufficient evidence that 9/11 was an inside job, and you are too lazy to even
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       defending your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a test.

       No, it's really not evidence at all.  It's establishing that false-flag ops have occurred in the past.  But that's not really in dispute.  You could argue motive, but that's a hypothesis, not evidence.

       no need to sell you anything. you may believe you have the entire "official story" but you probably have a skimmed version of it. if you had all of the stories available to you condensed into one non-sensationalist documentary, you would see that the
       <em>
        entire
       </em>
       official story is laughable. no need for conspiracies or theories, just raw facts that will make you question why you would
       <strong>
        ever
       </strong>
       believe what the government tells you.
       <strong>
        9/11 press for truth
       </strong>
       is the most honest look at what took place before, during, and after the event. a warning though, you will never look at your government the same.

       Just an FYI, did some quick math. Cruising speed of a 757 is about 500 mph, give or take a few, and Shanksville, PA is 267 miles from New York, making the flight time from Shanksville to New York about half and hour. The South Tower collapsed at 9:59, while the North collapsed at 10:28. Flight 93 crashed at 10:03. However, if it hadn't it would have arrived in New York, on the right flight path and at the perfect time to fly right over the two collapsed towers and into WTC7.

       Well, if you believe the official account is true, I would recommend you study the official account in detail. I've read the 9/11 commissions report, and it's nicely written, it reads like a Tom Clancy novel (sorry Tom). What immediately catches your eye, is that there are a whole array of axioms on which it's conclusions rest. For one, they never even question that the 20 or so terrorists did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm not a professional investigator, but I'm pretty sure that what you do, when investigating a crime, is to consider all possibilities and let the evidence speak for itself. Motive is important, but physical evidence is even more important.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the official account is true, then there are a lot of issues that still need to be explained in order to support its conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you're asking the wrong question. Perhaps the right question is: What exactly makes me trust the official account?
      </p>
      <p>
       That it comes from authority?
      </p>
      <p>
       That any other explanation would require us to entertain some uncomfortable possibilities?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it really the evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I've found it impossible to believe the official account once I looked at what it actually entailed in terms of incredible coincidence upon coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself: Where does the knowledge, you think you have come from, and upon what evidence does it rest?

       Connect the dots, look at everything which has been put into place because of the events on 9/11.... It doesn't take a genius to see whats going on. Sure it can be discomforting, but its obvious and its something we will have to deal with sooner than later.

       WTC 1 &amp; 2 cannot both collapse unto itself causing it to pulverize itself into dust AND fall at free fall speed. Pulverizing requires resistance, resistance disallows free falling. Again, free-falling means no resistance, no resistance means no pulverizing. One or the other but not both.

       There is no such thing as "free fall speed". There is something called terminal velocity, but that's entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free fall is an acceleration, not a speed. It's roughly 9.81 m/s/s on earth near the ground. The towers did not fall at free fall acceleration. Now that you have the number, you can actually time it yourself and see that your comment is untrue.

       This is not inconsistent with the rest of the NIST report in any way. The area demolished by the airplanes would have offered much less resistance than the structure below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technically, it's a "near free fall" drop between 1.75s and 4s and the wording should have said as much. Just take the difference of 2.25s at t=1.75s and t=4.0s to determine what the accelerations were at those points. The numbers support that it was not pure free fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, all the evidence you need to see that the towers didn't come down at free-fall acceleration is the fact that debris thrown clear of the buildings actually fell at free fall (terminal velocity if we're being technical) as physics predicts.

       Yes. WTC6 stood between WTC1 and WTC7, but was a much, much shorter building than the rest. WTC6 was severely damaged, but failed to fall due to an insufficient number of stories (weight) above the damaged sections.

       WTC2's debris has a straight path between WTC6 and WTC5. Sure enough, the corner of WTC that was so severely damaged is the one in the direct path between WTC6 and WTC5.

       The FEMA report actually say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The effects of the collapse of WTC 1 and WTC 2, the ensuing fires in WTC 7, and the collapse of WTC 7 are discussed below...
      </p>
      <p>
       At 9:59 a.m., WTC 2 (the south tower) collapsed. The approximate extent of its debris is shown in Figure 5-12(A). It appears that the collapse of WTC 2 did not significantly affect the roof, or the east, west, and north elevations of WTC 7."
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we agree that at least one WTC tower, and maybe two, resulted in structural damage to WTC7?

       I'm in a very similar spot to you.  Like many have said, no one will ever really know the truth for 100% certain, except those involved directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I am a very logical person, and examine things from various angles.  The official reports leave too many questions for me, and the official/media story leaves a lot of uneasy feelings of incompleteness for me.  But at the same time, I'm not an engineer, or a demolition expert, so I can't say how it should/shouldn't look.  But that being said, one of the things that has never sat right with me is the images from after the collapse (not the ones from after cleanup started).  They show me (in my untrained eye) evidence that supports both sides of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are LARGE sections of the outer walls standing up from the piles of debris.  If this was a controlled demolition, my mind says that these shouldn't exist in such large chunks.  But if it was just a building collapsing, with the floors pancaking on the way down, the floors could have separated from the walls in large sections like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing is that there seems to be very little twisted/bent steel girders.  Most of the steel girders are straight and look more like the bolts were cut/missing/whatever.  To me (again, not an expert) this would be something I would be more expectant to see in some sort of controlled demolition.  In just a "weakened structure collapse", my mind is expecting to see a lot more bent/twisted steel girders since the entire bottom half of the towers would have only been crushed by the upper floors (where the fires were and where the weakened steel was).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just one thing that makes me wonder.  I can't say it's evidence one way or another since this is just how I see this, and how I see it supports/disproves both stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because you started this thread, and seem genuinely open to actual evidence (if someone can show you some), it suggests that you may not fully believe the "official/media story" as well.  No one would start a discussion looking for someone to convince them of another option if they were fully committed to their own opinion.

       I think that 19 terrorists hijacked four planes and crashed two of them into WTC 1 &amp; 2, one into the Pentagon and one crashed in Pennsylvania. The evidence supports at least that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the investigation sufficient? I don't know. I do know that some people will never be satisfied as they bring their preconceived notions to the table and will reject anything that is counter to their presupposition. That goes for both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it exploited as a pretext for war? Probably. Had 9/11 never happened, the Iraq war probably would not have happened. If it were a conspiracy, and the conspirators could blame it on anybody they wanted to justify their ends, why not blame it on Saddam Hussein making the connection and justification for war clear?
      </p>
      <p>
       More than anything, I'm curious as to what it takes to convince people of anything. I am of the opinion that many people who believe the conspiracy are credulous and view the evidence with presupposition that it was an inside job.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a COMPLICATED event. Physics and understanding it is HARD. It requires a lot of work. On the other hand, looking at the towers falling and saying, "that looks similar to a controlled demolition" is easy. I think that if most believers took the time to understand the science behind the collapses, they'd change their tune. But again, that requires a lot of hard work.

       In your opinion, did the towers pulverize as they fell or fall as they pulverized? Did they pulverize and the dust fell or did the floors fall and pulverize from falling? If the fall caused the pulverizing, wouldn't the resistance slow the fall down considerably? And if they fell because they pulverized, what caused the pulverizing? Also, if the planes hitting the towers caused the towers to fall, what force caused the burned-out cars all over the place? How did planes or falling buildings generate enough heat to burn cars completely blocks away? Why was the basement so hot for days after the collapse, hot enough to melt steel? What caused WTC 7 to fall? How did those amateur pilots fly those planes without radar, ground support or navigational aides? Do you believe a fertilizer bomb could really do that much damage to the Murrah Building in OK City? What about the other two bombs that were discovered inside the building? What is your name? How long have you worked for the government? Isn't it true that "engineer" is really just a codeword for government disinformation officer?

       You have the most dependable and  thorough secret service on the planet. There is nothing your government does not know about anyone they want to know anything about. It's been that way for decades, and you're trying to tell me that so many hijackers were able penetrate US security, fly jetliners (for which they didn't have the experience to handle properly...unless you seriously count microsoft flight sim die hard experience) very precisely into the buildings, and with the freefall collapse of wtc7 (the middle of the building collapses first...you can see the penthouse disappear thanks to sloppy editing on most footage...also, how did it catch on fire again?) you can't honestly say that you don't think that there was something else behind the spectacle?
      </p>
      <p>
       Zeitgeist, there was a conversation recalled by one of the rockafeller's close friends who said that there was going to be an event that was going to change the landscape of the US and that the ultimate goal was have citizens outfitted with a biometric chip that would contain all of your personal data thus allowing total control over your life and guess what surgical procedure your new healthcare covers?  The Obama Health care bill under Class II (Paragraph 1, Section B) specifically includes ‘‘(ii) a class II device that is implantable." Then on page 1004 it describes what the term "data" means in paragraph 1, section B:
      </p>
      <p>
       14 ‘‘(B) In this paragraph, the term ‘data’ refers to in15
formation respecting a device described in paragraph (1),
16 including claims data, patient survey data, standardized
17 analytic files that allow for the pooling and analysis of
18 data from disparate data environments, electronic health
19 records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the
20 Secretary"

       Of course, there's also the conspiracy that the economic funk will only be solved by a North American Union, which Harper is basically already trying to turn Canada into the US for the last 5 years...

       This will be a bit different than the typical posts here.  I will not talk about all the mechanics of 9/11 or anything like that.  I will show other sides to certain topics.

         He later on said that the paper was wrong, they spreaded lies, ect.  Which is possible, it is after all a relatively large paper, and like most other mainstream media, spreading lies isn't that much of stretch.  However, for them to have said such a big lie like that and not get investigated which the country was so sensitive on this stuff, it doesn't make sense to me.  I'm sure the FBI would be all over it if they heard a random person received warning 8 hours prior to 9/11.  For the paper to not even be touched on this issue, first off if what they said is true that doesn't make sense to me that it would go ignored, and second off if what they said is false it makes no sense to me that there was no reprimands for doing something as horrible as using 9/11 to spread lies like that.  Assuming it was a conspiracy, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch of the imagination to think he would be threatened or coerced himself after the article to stfu about it.  But that's just speculation.

         FEMA was for some reason at NYC a single day before 9/11, ready to take action.  No, this doesn't mean every single member of FEMA would be in on it, as most lower level people they'd just be following orders.  They get told its some training exercise, they're gone.  Hell, considering the attitudes of people I've worked with in the past, I personally can see them simply being told "Go here." and not thinking it suspicious at all.  I find FEMA being there to be a big coincidence by itself, let alone with everything else.

         listening to that news piece, you can tell there was a lot of chaos and madness with them that day.  For them to be running a drill so similar to what was actually going on that day, it cannot be overlooked.  Yes, they had another reason for doing the war games listed, but that's not really surprising, of course they're going to give a reason for holding these war games, they're not just going to call it "Training drills done to distract us from actual terrorist attacks."  So anyone pointing out that the war game's original purpose was something else is just bringing up a very bad argument.

         Larry Silverstein's famous "pull it" comment.

         By itself, fine, you can make the case that he WASN'T talking about exploding the building, he was talking about pulling the people out of there.  I have a very hard time swallowing that one, because pull it is a general demolition term, and that is a very odd way of saying "Get those people out of there."  The overlap is worth noting.  To add to that, though, as it was accidentally exposed by fox news on a 9/11 conspiracy hit piece (
         <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/04/22/jeffrey-scott-shapiro-jesse-venture-book-lies-truthers-ground-zero-sept-shame/">

         ), they said this revealing bit:
"Shortly before the building collapsed, several NYPD officers and Con-Edison workers told me that Larry Silverstein, the property developer of One World Financial Center was on the phone with his insurance carrier to see if they would authorize the controlled demolition of the building – since its foundation was already unstable and expected to fall."
As it's been pointed so many times by the opponents of a conspiracy, it takes WEEKS to set up a controlled demolition.  If he thought the building was unstable and ready to fall, why would he want to risk workers going in and out of the building for a few weeks to set up the explosions?  This for me reveals a lot.  On a side note, there was that whole him putting an insurance policy on the buildings bit.

         First I'm actually going to argue the other side.  The order may still stand, but he at no point said which order it is.  It could be as likely the order was to shoot it down as it is to stand down.  It could go either way, to be weary of this one.  In fact, listening to the full interview, the order is more likely for "shoot them down" than "stand down."  Does this argue against a conspiracy?  Yes.

         Why did the 9/11 commission omit various parts of his testimony?  And why does it go so much against what Norman Mineta is saying?  While on this subject, another little tid bit is that there's a bit of a controversy over whether or not Cheney had direct control over NORAD based on something Bush signed into law May 8th of that year.  It didn't directly state he had Norad, but it could've been interpreted that way.  According to Mr. Mineta, it sounds to me like at the very least, on this day, Cheney was calling the shots here.  But, again, for the other side, that can almost be considered a mute point if the order was to shoot the planes down instead of stand down.

         The Chairmans themselves thinks they were set up to fail.  For such an important commission, you'd think they'd get more funding and time.

         Why would people lie like this about this topic?  In the same article, ""I was shocked at how different the truth was from the way it was described," John Farmer, a former New Jersey attorney general who led the staff inquiry into events on Sept. 11, said in a recent interview. "The tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public for two years. . . . This is not spin. This is not true." "

       This is  the one part which I will be stating my view bluntly and directly, without worrying about sides.  With all of that that was just said from the horses mouth, if you don't want to believe the govt was behind it fine, but if ANYONE actually believes the 9/11 commission report, they're stupid and brainwashed.  Period.  There's no nice way of putting it.  "This is true!"  'Actually, we're the ones who wrote this, this whole thing is full of lies...."  "That can't be, because it's true!"  Is what it basically comes down to.  i have no nice thoughts for people this stupid.

       Sorry, I think we've misunderstood eachother. You said you downvoted him for saying he could "debunk someone else's facts". Debunking facts is nonsense, because facts are facts. So had he said that, I'd agree: downvote is in order. But he didn't say that, he implied he would debunk
       <em>
        arguments
       </em>
       , which is perfectly valid, and not a reason to downvote IMO. Now, maybe you think he shouldn't debunk arguments either, and that's where we'll have to disagree.

       I, too have probs w the Truther angle on this story.
Could someone please explain to me how a "controlled demolition" could have been prepered for a 36-storey occupied tower with no questions asked? I've seen those Discovery Network shows about building demolition: it's painstaking, intricate work, involving exposing ALL support columns, placing and wiring TONS of explosives. It takes many days, usually weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I understand it, the jet-fuel didn't "melt" the steel of the WTC structure, it merely softened the steel until the various joints lost integrity, then each floor pancaked onto the one below leading to the poof-poof-poof out the windows that Truthers think is "controlled demolition"...again, there was a really excellent 2-hour doc about it on TLC about a year after 9/11, I dunno its name.
      </p>
      <p>
       So is it really possible for a small army of workmen ( cuz that's what it would take) to prepare a large building for demolition without the residents noticing...?

        As Margie Burns reports in The American Reporter, an electronic daily newspaper, Marvin P. Bush, the president’s younger brother, was a principal in a company called Securacom that provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles International Airport. The company, Burns noted, was backed by KuwAm, a Kuwaiti-American investment firm on whose board Marvin Burns also served.

       <p>
        According to Wayne Black, head of a Florida-based security firm, it is somewhat unusual for a single firm to handle security for both an airline and a airport. It’s also unusual for a firm linked so closely with a foreign-owned company to handle security on such a “sensitive” international airport as Dulles. “When you have a security contract, you know the inner workings of everything,” he said. “Somebody knew somebody,” he added, or the contract would have been scrutinized more carefully.

       Well, in order to place them, they'd need to expose the steel of the columns....it's clearly not as simple a matter as placing one of these thermate-boxes next to the wall: much cutting, drilling and jackhammering would be necessary, just as you see in professional Demolition vids. No way that wouldn't be noticed by lots of people who work in the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the "911 debunked" vid on the bar to the right takes each part of this tape and provides reasonable and sound alternative explanations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, what the TLC 911 doc said was that the towers collapsed NOT because of damage to the external framework. It was not necessary to 'melt steel' only to soften the bolts that suspended the floors, leading to a domino-effect. This is probably why the pilots were instructed to hit the top floors of the towers not the bottom half.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I'm sure you have reems of info that proves your various points, and that those who oppose your theories can provide counter-evidence to every point. It doesn't seem any minds are being changed here.
      </p>

       My main prob with the whole "911 Inside Job" conspiracy theory is the conspiracy itself. Too damn many people would need to remain silent about the most heinous mass-murder in American history. It's just not credible to me. Sure the Manhattan Project was kept secret....for about 2 years, during wartime, when even the dumbest janitor knew that loose lips sink ships. Here we are 10 years after 911 and not a single one of the hundreds if not thousands in on the conspiracy has stepped foreward...no cut-out dupe has gone public with his suspicions ("I wondered why we were demo-ing that building, but I needed the job so just did as the boss said...").

       Some see "squibs". As an engineer, I see conservation of energy. The volume of air in the building had to come out somewhere. If those were squibs and the building was brought down with controlled demolitions throughout the structure, why do we see just a few puffs of debris? A few puffs is consistent with blown out windows due to a dramatic increase in pressure, not controlled demolitions.

       Somebody else posted this a few months back and I found it rather amusing as well as poignant. Consider this a bit of comic relief:

      <p>
       Government Spook 1: Hey Carl, we should also demolish WTC 7, I don't think blowing up the two largest, iconic buildings in the heart of the world's only superpower is going to be enough to scare people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government Spook 2: Frank, you're a genius! But we'd better give the reporters a script to read before we do it, otherwise nobody will notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government Spook 1: So your suggestion is that we give some of the world's foremost journalists, the kind of people whose job it is to investigate and break stories about corruption and murder and intrigue, whose names would go down in history for exposing the biggest conspiracy in the history of the planet, prior confirmation that we're going to blow the building up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Government Spook 2: Exactly. We can't rely on the BBC using their cameras or eyes at any point to confirm that the building has collapsed, so it's best we pre-warn them. We'll be fine, unless BillyPilgrum uses his incredible powers of deduction to figure it all out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government Spook 1: Foolproof.

       The question in and of itself connotes an ignorance of the issue. I don't believe that "9/11 was an inside job". However, that is only one view on a fairly broad spectrum of views about how events unfolded on that day.  The easiest way to show the points on that spectrum are the acronyms that used to be used in the truth community. "LIHOP", "MIHOP".  "Let it happen on purpose", "Make it happen on purpose". There's a vast number of "theories" associated with both extremes, but the more you look into the evidence reasonably and rationally, a "LIHOP" theory becomes more and more likely - not involving the entire government, but rather a very small handful of people (probably five or less) who were in a position of sufficient power (and significant benefit from the attacks) to create the conditions where normal procedures that would have stopped such an attack became ineffective.
      </p>
      <p>
       These include curiosities like the fact that in the months before 9/11 Cheney (or it might have been Rumsfeld, I honestly forget) changed the longstanding policy that fighter squadrons automatically had the authority to shoot down passenger planes that had been hijacked. The policy was changed so that the order had to be directly given by him - something which in a crisis situation would take precious dozens of minutes.  Interestingly the policy change was reversed not long after 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       The still mysterious and inexplicable absence of the President, or indeed any transcripts of what the President was doing during the attacks, despite the fact that all the transcripts show that Dick Cheney appeared to be acting as Commander in Chief throughout the entire debacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the head of the Pakistani Intelligence Services or ISI was in Washington during the attacks, and just days earlier had been wired a large sum of money by the US authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The confirmed presence of Israeli "Students" monitoring the attacks from a rooftop, and cheering as the planes hit the towers. This is not, as has been suggested, a hoax, if you search for them on Youtube, they were actually interviewed on Israeli TV about the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       The speed with which the "PATRIOT" Act was introduced into the house and congress (the document was over 1500 pages long, and had clearly been sitting on a shelf waiting for just such an event) - the fact that Senators who demanded time to actually READ the bill were sent Anthrax in the mail (a strain that originated from a US Biowarfare lab).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now.. Notice I haven't said
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       about "no planes", or "a missile", or "controlled demolition", or any of the normal wackiness associated with nutcase conspiracy theories. The fact is those elements, the physical evidence, are a distraction. One doesn't have to focus on those to find a clear paper trail that leads to the fact that there were most
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       people who were aware that this event was going to take place - to what extent they knew, we'll never know, but the second takeaway is that there are clearly groups and interests who not only benefited, but profited massively on the back of the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the story of
       <a href="http://justacitizen.net/">
        Sibel Edmonds
       </a>
       , as a very good starting point for a highly credible witness that will begin to take you down the rabbit hole. Among many other things, she found evidence that the FBI had been infiltrated by Turkish Intelligence, and not so indirectly implies that this is one of the major reasons why 9/11 was able to happen. Mind you, for being a whistleblower she basically had her life destroyed by the FBI, who tried desperately to stop her.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally. The planes were hijacked by 19 SAUDIS. The US invades AFGHANISTAN. Sorry. Doesn't add up.

       I'd love to hear someone explain why, if the government (or whoever) wanted to bring down the towers, they would would make up such a complicated scheme involving multiple planes being flown into multiple buildings with explosives wired in such buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many possible points of failure, what happens if the hijacking is stopped or the planes miss the tower?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, but if you wanted to pull off a conspiracy it would be far easier to plant explosives and then claim there was car/van bomb.  Especially given that that already happened 10 years earlier, very plausible that someone would try it again, this time would more powerful bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, we're supposed to believe they picked a conspiracy with lots and lots of points of failure instead.

       Why wait?

       Plane crashes. You have your finger on the button to detonate your secret thermal charges... and you wait while people get out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you are going to wait for people get out before you implode the buildings? Wouldn't they have killed a lot more people if they just collapsed right after the crashes? That would have been a nightmare. Right after the second plane crashes, I'd implode both buildings at the same time and building 7. Why wait?

       Exactly, and what happens if one of the planes hits and the other doesn't, just blow one and hope there's enough debris that you can plausibly claim it knocked down the other?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure part of the response will be "the planes were remote controlled so it was 100% sure they'd hit".  And if that's true, why bother with all the fake hijacking, having people call from the planes to report what was going on during the hijacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just layers and layers of complexity for no good reason.  Government do a lot of stupid things, but I don't believe they would come up with a hugely complex conspiracy when a very simple one would have done the trick just the same, been much easier to plan, and be much less likely to fail.

       The World Trade Center was destroyed just days after a heightened security alert was lifted at the landmark 110-story towers, security personnel said yesterday [September 11]. Daria Coard, 37, a guard at Tower One, said the security detail had been working 12-hour shifts for the past two weeks because of numerous phone threats.
       <strong>
        But on Thursday [September 6], bomb-sniffing dogs were abruptly removed.

       I like the idea of another investigation, but who do you propose should do them? Purdue University did their own analysis (admittedly under NIST funding, but the engineers and university stake their reputations on the result of their work - which is free for other engineers to use and criticize).

       I've said it before and I'll say it again. Worked in the WTC for years.. WTC7 shared no underground connection to the other buildings, yet burned from bottom up. WFC3 was in closer vicinity to the towers that WTC7 and only suffered broken windows and dust on those floors. I could never see how WTC7 started on fire in the first place.

       All you have said this entire thread is "I want more scientific evidence" and then when people reply with what they think is proof you just say "that evidence isn't good enough for me to believe it, because i'm a smart engineer".
      </p>
      <p>
       You never started this topic with any intention of being convinced of the 9/11 conspiracy, you have made this topic to claim to fame your scientific background and give yourself an ego boost by knowing how smart you perceive yourself to be.

       I think everyone here has done a pretty good job with their supporting evidence and to be honest you're failing at trying to prove how smart you are.

       That is the end of the story.  Maybe you should write a story about how Al Quaeda was able to wire 3 of the countries most secure buildings for demolition on 9/11?

       there is a very strong similarity to the reichstag fire and the enabling act, where hitler blamed the jews for torching a state building then pushed through laws that furthered the nazi objectives. the patriot act is oh so suspiciously similar.

       I have no proof, and reading about it does not affirm any exact belief I have about the events of that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I do know, is when I was watching the day unfold, my gut instinct was one of suspicion for the official story. I've always felt in my heart that this wasn't just the work of a bunch of Jihadis. Whether there was help or blind eye turned, I have no idea... but the reaction of the powers that be has not changed my belief.

       I don't believe it was an inside job. I think there's a possibility it may have been, but I don't know for sure. It has nothing to do with "belief".
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems most likely that a lot more happened than what they told us, some very high up people made some very poor decisions, and a lot of greasy underhanded things were happening behind the scenes. Stuff those in power would never want to let out, even if they themselves had nothing to do with it directly.
      </p>

       tl;dr. I don't know bout no inside job. But there's

       they ain't tell'n us.

       I'm not a fan either of the term either, but people know what we're talking about when we use it. Sure, there are various LIHOP and MIHOP hypotheses, but the net net is that either required nefarious intent by some people on the "inside".

       I want you to convince me that it happened the way that the 'official' story explains it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want to understand how you think it was all possible, including the fact that on the very day it happened the entire US NORAD air defense system was essentially out to lunch and was tricked into being unable to respond to what happened.  I make note that, for some reason, Dick Cheney was in charge of things that day, and he was on no other day.

       I have yet to see good evidence that NOARD ever stood down. I hear it repeated all the time, however. I am open to well-sourced evidence that NORAD actually stood down.
      </p>
      <p>
       NORAD was designed to thwart external threats, specifically incoming Soviet missiles and bombers. They were completely ill-equipped for such an attack as that which (probably) happened on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Cheney was in charge is oft repeated, but sources are never given as far as I've seen. If you can come up with a reputable source, I will look at it.

       which shows the confusion about where key people, including Cheney,
       <em>
        even were

       during that morning, so you would have us believe that while it isn't even possible to ascertain who was where, and when, at The White House, that these same people are absolutely certain of how 9/11 happened and who did it, right down to the last detail.

       NORAD's lack of action is circumstantial at best. If NORAD had actually stood down, it speaks to the size of the conspiracy that would have had to be perpetrated (and yet nobody has come forward?). Again, NORAD was never designed to thwart a threat from within. That protocol didn't exist.

       Black boxes were found. The only sites that claim otherwise fail to link to sources for that information.

       You are basically saying that confusion on the most confusing day in modern history is evidence of a conspiracy. That's what it boils down to.

       But the evidence that I've seen previously, and have seen since I started this thread, just doesn't make for a compelling case. What I have seen is little more than anomaly hunting, and better explanations for these anomalies exist that what has been forth. But again, show me that smoking gun and I'll believe...

       I am noticing a lot of downvotes in this thread pertaining to posts that don't fit a certain hypothesis- y'all are welcome to downvote, of course, it's your right, but I'm seeing very little response and discussion. I just have one request, not to start arguments or bad blood, but if you downvote, tell us why!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about the other skeptics in thread, but I'm genuinely curious as to the viewpoints of everyone. A downvote without a reason why doesn't teach me anything. Look, I feel no rancor or disgust at people who have what might be considered strange beliefs- we all walk around in our own realities, after all. It's sharing those realities with each other that gives us interesting windows into each others' lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main point is that I'm disappointed that a group of people that I haven't always agreed with, but that I have respected as independent thinkers, are quashing dissenting opinions as quickly as the mainstream fact-quashers in the media and our national capitols.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also disappointed in that run-on sentence I just made.

       I think this obsession with conspiracy theorising about 9/11 is crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm from the UK, one of scores of countries to be hit by terrorist attacks in the past few years and there is much,
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       less of 'something's not right here' mindset than there is in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the USA so infallible that the only way for you to succumb to an act of terrorism is through an inside job?

       Given that the BBC article came out only 12 days after 9/11, I don't think it's a stretch to assume that in the mess and confusion following the attacks that errors in the investigation were made. The other link is light on reputable sources and heavy on conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       If some of the hijackers were thought to be alive in the weeks after 9/11, where are they now?
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, if "they" are manufacturing the whole plot from scratch, why not pick somebody known with absolute certainty to be dead?

       Ok, so you admit that errors in the investigation were made, however you find it hard to believe that maybe those "terrorists" were not even the ones that carried out the attack? I don't think we will ever really know who was on those planes and I highly doubt you will ever believe any of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       By all means, go track them down. If they are alive and well then, why are you concerned about right now?  Then is what matters. That is like saying, well the towers aren't there anymore, so 9/11 never happened. We were told these were the guys and they died on those planes. Then it turns out that some weren't even in the country when it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if I were plotting to do something like this, I would either set someone up or find someone to blame that is missing and most likely dead. Blaming a person that died 6 years ago is harder to fake then say someone with no record trail to follow. How would it look if on the news they said "Bomber in shopping mall identified as Bernie Mack". A little less then convincing.

       There is a difference between "errors in the investigation" and the investigation being bunk. Anything of the magnitude of the investigation that was done is bound to have errors. It's just the law of large numbers. It doesn't discount the entire investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the investigation and the Purdue study are available for any engineer or architect to analyze and criticize is a good thing. Alas, were are the papers written by experienced engineers that reject it?

       I'm not sure where you're going with, "By all means, go track them down. If they are alive and well then, why are you concerned about right now?"

       I think you are getting off on a side note with this errors and investigation being "bunk". Maybe other people are saying the investigation is "bunk". However, I think the people investigating were limited and cut off from all the facts. I have done investigations, some small some large (not 9/11 large). Without the big picture, they wouldn't know what was true and what was false as far as who was on the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go track them down is in response to "If some of the hijackers were thought to be alive in the weeks after 9/11, where are they now?" I don't think it matters where they are now (what if they are dead now?), the real fact that you need to walk away with is that they were alive after the attack. Which would mean they didn't do it. So if they didn't do it, why were their passports found there? If they were planted, then who planted them and for what purpose? The thing you learn while investigating is that made up stories don't hold as you keep pulling at new areas and keep asking questions.

      <p>
       Save for the confusion that followed in the days after the attack (let's be honest, that's understandable), there are no credible reports of alleged hijackers actually being alive. My simple explanation: The guy found to be alive was simply thought to be a suspect based on the little information that they had at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I will objectively look at any evidence contrary to this.

       There is one simple proof that it was an inside job. Just the way the buildings collapsed demolition style goes to show you it was an insider job. Jet fuel doesn't burn that hot to melt the re-enforced steel columns. Jet fuel is essentially highly-refined kerosene. As a normal hydrocarbon it is limited to burning no hotter than 1200 degrees. Thermite, on the other hand, burns at 2500 degrees celsius, hot enough to melt those steel columns; they used Thermite to bring down those buildings. All 3 buildings collapse in demolition style manner, plus you got all these eye witnesses claiming they heard constant explosions while the buildings were collapsing. The list goes on and on, just accept the truth man; no need to defend it. Their plan worked just as well, we're at war, and war = money for corporations. End of story.

       Tell me, are you 100% sure that heated steel beams could not possibly be weakened enough to fail when they have the stress of a building on them? You don't need to melt them, you don't need to cut them, you just need to weaken them enough.

       So, many of us here are IT dudes (and dudettes). One thing that tuned me on to the conspiracy was dust that was forcibly exploded INSIDE computer hard disks. We all know how well these things are sealed. Would a simple collapse allow dust inside? Maybe. But maybe explosive force was to blame. That's what the recovery experts seem to believe.

       The collapse was "explosive" in force. The total potential energy of buildings that size converted to kinetic energy is comparable to what would be found in a large explosion, so it's no wonder the damage is explosion-like.

       Concentrate on recent history. There are tons of released classified documents on events long passed. Reports on covert operations undertaken from WWII to today. If you know about all the shit that has been going in the shadows of secrecy, for a fact, you're more open to alternative conspiracy theories on current events that yet remain classified like 9/11.

       Hey Toploader. Quite a response you've got here! I've no doubt that my comment will be buried but I thought you'd should have a look at two things. No.1. There is very persuasive evidence that the U.S. Government have a dedicated organization in place to neutralise the "conspiracy movement", in particular with regard to the events of 9/11.

       It is not possible for experienced pilots to turn an aircraft around in the time required between the time that the planes went off radar and then reappeared. It may have been a fluke for one of the inexperienced hijackers to keep the plane in the air during a turn, but not two,

       In order to fly the aircraft the hijackers would have to be in the pilot seat. The black boxes show that the locked doors to the pilots cabins were not opened between takeoff and the crashes.

       Let's not forget about the Pentagon and the crash in PA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both "crashes" did not produce any plane debris and no black boxes were found (never before that day had no black boxes been found).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the Pentagon, there was no evidence of the engines which should have made impact holes of their own.  In fact, the nose of the plane is quite fragile compared to the engines.  If anything, the hole on the side of the Pentagon should have been very wide representing the engines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the flight path of the plane which flew into the Pentagon.  No pilot has ever been able duplicate that flight path, and the supposed hijacker pilot who failed flight school was able to do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's just way too many magic bullets that day.

       Do you have reputable sources saying that no black boxes or debris was found?

      <p>
       It seems the black box for flight 93 was found on 9/13 (or at least reported on that day):

       A quick GIS of "pentagon debris" brings up lots of pictures of aircraft debris.

       I dont understand why people dont believe actual investigative journalists and instead believe some guys on the internet. How can you possibly believe that, what, all journalists are in on this huge plot? If there was this blatent trail that led back to the government then I would actually believe this conspiracy. There are many fine investigative reporters not linked to the mainstream organisation such as Bob Woodward, but none of these have written a book linking the US government to the attacks.

       Show me a book written by an actual investigative journalist and I might believe these conspiracies.

       This, combined with the engineering and architectural analysis, is what it would take for me to believe the conspiracy. Lots of armchair engineers and "researchers" make claims on the internet, but they fail to back them up.

       With all due respect to William Rodriguez, the seismic data collected at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory do not support his version of events.

       I trust independently acquired data over anecdotes.

       Google "Emad Salem" - the FBI informant who was involved in the first WTC bombing in 1993, and how he not only told the FBI about the bombing beforehand, but offered to exchange the bomb material with non-explosive stuff...but was rejected. Then, ask yourself why there were so many "blunders" in preventing the second WTC bombing.

       There was on conspiracy about 9/11.  It was a tragedy that took advantage of the US not being prepared.  The only "possible conspirarcy" would be if it was announced that Flight 93 was shot down.  If that came out tomorrow, I wouldn't be surprised, but the crap about the towers being taken down by explosives or was planned borders on insane.
      </p>

       It's one thing to question the official story of what was missed but a whole other to think that this was organized by our government.

       WTC7 has been discussed in this thread. My TL;DR position: structural damage to WTC1 and/or 2 debris, a less than ideal design due to it straddling a power substation, both compounded by hours of fires is a reasonable explanation for why WTC7 fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all, firefighters anticipated that might WTC7 fall while they were fighting the fires. Why is it such a surprise that it did?

       The "fire brought it down" scenario is complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off the smoke seen around building 7 nearly all came from the two main buildings.the damage was all on one CORNER and could never have caused a completely symmetrical collapse. since it was anything but symmetrical.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was an intense fire that could bring down a building that size, this thing was huge,  how in the hell did this much diesel fuel not catch fire when it was located  mostly in the elevator shafts
      </p>
      <p>
       “A cleanup is underway to remove tens of thousands of gallons of oil that spilled from 7 World Trade Center when the 47-story office tower collapsed on Sept. 11, according to a published report.
Citing an environmental impact report made public by the Empire State Development Corp., Newsday reported Thursday that 130,000 gallons of oil leaked from the Con Edison substation contained within the building. 
Additional oil leaked from two 6,000-gallon storage tanks owned by Salomon Smith Barney, and conduits beneath the building may have contained asbestos and feeder lines wrapped in a material containing toxins, the report said. 
Two 11,690-gallon diesel fuel tanks operated by Silverstein Properties were also inside the building, but were removed in March and April and showed no evidence of spillage, Newsday said. “

       I don't believe it was an inside job, because I think our government is too dumb to pull of such a seamless operation without one person talking. I am not saying its not possible its just that this whole explosives thing I don't buy. We all saw the planes hit. I think alot of people subconciously don't want to believe it was that easy to hijack a couple planes and kill 3000+.

       Well what i meant by perfect is that it was so convenient and too many people in our country benefited from these attacks. You're right it was not perfectly executed but the incident it self was perfect for the corrupt, crooked and sociopolitical individuals in our government to benefit. No way was this a coincidence.

       That is a judgement that should be reserved for engineers to make. I'm aware of AE911 Truth, but I have yet to see an actual demonstration/simulation from them that counters the very comprehensive (and peer reviewed and publically available) study done at Purdue University that shows how and why the buildings fell: airplanes and fire.

       Watch a few videos documenting controlled demolitions of buildings and tell me how the collapse of the twin towers was different. Then, learn all about how controlled demolitions work. Then, rationalize for yourself whether one plane, with fuel that cannot melt through I-beams, caused the building to fall like that.

       I'm starting to feel like a broken record:
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel yields at a much lower temperature than its melting point. At 1500 F steel loses roughly 90% of its strength. The steel didn't have to melt before it became incapable of supporting the weight of the structure above.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really doesn't look like a controlled demolition. Controlled demolitions have a sequence of explosions that cut main support structures, usually from the bottom up with clearly visible detonations. WTC 1&amp;2 got crushed from the top down just as if the weight of the structure above the fire was more than the damaged area in the fire could support.

       But then, Newton's 3rd law. The energy that the upper section exerted would destroy itself and a same sized section beneath it. For the whole building to collapse like that, extra energy would have to be added. There was a vid I saw, where a guy takes a stack of a few cinderblocks on a vertical track. He lifted a brick up (which would create a lot of energy) and then dropped it. The brick destroyed itself and the block it struck.

       Hey Toploader
I agree with you that the evidence here is not good. 
Rather an open call for evidence, I would suggest watching Zeitgeist or Loose Change (both free on google video). Then if you have issues with any part of either movie, I'm sure many of us will be happy to discuss them with you. 
And if neither of those movies can convince you, then I wouldn't really bother much more about it really... seems like it would just be a waste of time... they are the best we've got so far.

       I've seen both movies. I've also seen several different sites/films debunking them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loose Change is very good at making the viewer think, "hmm, that's weird" over and over. Most of the oddities have reasonable explanations. Even if we take the best of the best evidence from Loose Change, it still fails to reach a preponderance (in my admittedly subjective point of view).

       Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. I don't see extraordinary evidence.

       If you want to debate a specific issue from Loose change that you consider to be debunked, I'm down. I'm not promising I can convince you, but it might be instructive for either one or both of us to take just one issue and inspect it closely from both sides. Let me know.

       "Belief"? sell me some facts instead. Its quite simple terrorists flew planes into the twin towers. the fuel caused a fire the weight of the plain combined withe the fire damage weakened the structure it the collapsed. debri from the towers landed on or near WT7 causing fire damage if you look at the footage you see the small building on the roof collapse first. a small number of people planed this and excited it you have to ask why they would do this instead you are ignoring the real issue.

       Steel yields at a much lower temperature than its melting point. At 1500 F steel loses roughly 90% of its strength.

       Why do you think that it has to be molten before it collapses?

       Posted elsewhere, and I'll post it again or you:

      <p>
       There is no such thing as "free fall speed". There is something called terminal velocity, but that's entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free fall is an acceleration, not a speed. It's roughly 9.81 m/s/s on earth near the ground. The towers did not fall at free fall acceleration. Now that you have the number, you can actually time it yourself and see that your comment is untrue.

       From video evidence, significant portions of the cores of both buildings (roughly 60 stories of WTC 1 and 40 stories of WTC 2) are known to have stood 15 to 25 seconds after collapse initiation before they, too, began to collapse.

       It is more than simple.  No decent video footage of the Pentagon attack has been released, just a doctored up couple of seconds is all we got out of hours of video.  What says inside job more than that.  I hope WIkileaks gets hold of the real footage.

       I think it was an accident. Through some unbelievable statistical improbability, two airplanes crashed into the World Trade Center entirely by accident. Authorities freaked out: no one would ever believe that is was accidental crashes. So they said it was terrorists, and they fired a missile at the pentagon and gunned down an extra plane to make it look more believable, and add an heroic layer to the story. But the first two planes in the towers were a freak accident.

       What are the somewhat convincing parts? Let's build on that. You dont have to be a Alex jones nut to be  suspicious of 9/11. Alex jones, loose change people just adds some extra bullshit stuff to sensationalise it.

       I'm not saying 9/11 was an inside job, although I do beleive that, my new tactic has been to show people who don't beleive in a 9/11 conspiracy, that the official story of 9/11 is a conspiracy theory as well... and it is.

       I don't pretend to know what happened either way.  I can not say I believe the official commission report nor do I believe much of what the 9/11 truth movement brings forth.

      <p>
       One thing that has always intrigued me though, who benefited the most from everything?  I'd say the CIA. Given that the CIA is known to do these kind of things (false flag attacks, etc), and they benefitted so heavily from it... it kinda makes you wonder.

       Definitely suspicious, but I can imagine that they were deeply embarrassed by looking vulnerable.  Vivid footage of the Pentagon being hit would be symbolically very powerful.  From that perspective, an inside-job conspiracy actually serves them, it creates the idea that nobody can hurt the pentagon, except the pentagon.

       I like how you address only one of my 6 counter points to what you said and then ask me for citation on the quality of cameras that pentagon would use in for all-weather observation of large objects 10 years ago. Remember before 9/11 it was a bad thing to have a big "homeland security" budget. They weren't forced to do anything, they chose to. If you think they slapped high definition camera's in custom weatherproof casings and mounted of them on the outside pointing in every goddamn direction you've completely given up reason. But if evidence is that important to you I'm sure the type of camera they have installed is buried in their public budget records from before 2001, hidden with sinister intent obviously. Since you're the one that can't propose an argument that makes holds water and need it to believe in the obvious truth you can be the one to dig it up. While we're on the subject of citation I looked up the validity of your anti-aircraft claim.
       <a href="http://www.jod911.com/There_Are_No_Missile_Defenses_at_the_Pentagon.pdf">
        Here
       </a>
       is a paper that goes over every source of that information (none of it was government official) and discredits it. The paper then goes on to provide this contrary evidence to your statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The proof lies in the fact that the Pentagon was forced to emplace missile defenses at the Pentagon after 9/11, 
from CNN September 11th, 2002.
For the first time since the Cuban missile crisis almost 40 years ago, armed missile launchers 
will be protecting the nation's capital by day's end Tuesday -- a precaution that comes amid a 
heightened alert status on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the September 11 attacks.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you can't bother to read the other side of every conspiracy you have lost the ability for critical thinking and are simply a tool for people creating lies in order to make money off people like you. If you still believe in your 2 points after this then you're simply someone who has no place in a researched discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to clear this up as well, _dimension implied simply that there is no need for an extensive camera system on the outside of a building that has armed guard around the whole perimeter on a 24/7 basis and I agree with his logic fully.

         Kind of a change in topics, but alright.  I did in fact notice how loud the controlled demolition is.  As you said, thermite is given as an explanation, and a very legit one at that.  If it is more quiet than conventional explosives, then it would make perfect sense for them to use that one instead.  Truthers don't ignore that part at all, there have been some explanations covering those parts, parts which I myself have been sketchy about so I personally don't like to bring it up.  As with the rest of us on either side, I don't have all the pieces to the puzzle.  But I do know that the basic human hivemind would not ask questions if they saw some random official looking people around their building every now and then, they would just shrug it off, say its for another dept, and be on their way with their own business.  Now, I'm having some real big issue with the way you are describing nanothermite.  What you mean inventing?  It's been researched by the U.S. military since the early 1990's.  Conspiracy theorists didn't invent anything with that.  And it is not super secretive, nothing about it is.  Quit trying to muddy the issue by saying such random, made up things, that is all you are doing by saying such lies.  I have to admit, you made me briefly question myself and made me look up nanothermite to see if I've been following a lie.  This non-existent super secretive thing has a wikipedia page among other things.

         Yeah, of course they're going to have to give a reason for conducting the war games.  While we should know why they wanted to do those war games to begin with, we shouldn't immediately be satisfied with the first reason they give us though.  The government lies, always has, probably always will.  If the conspiracy is right, it doesn't take much to figure out that they're going to say the war games were for a different reason.  Doesn't take much critical thinking here.

         You are taking the original point of the double tree video out of context.  There was no reason, ESPECIALLY if the video didn't have anything to show, to keep it from the people for so long, let alone requiring a lawsuit.  It is for that reason that I see that they had no issue releasing that particular video, much like that other pentagon one; because it had nothing to show.  Doesn't matter if there were hundreds upon hundreds of video cameras pointed directly at the crash site, if they confiscate them all but release the 1 or 2 tapes that don't show anything, that'll be enough to convince people such as yourself that there's nothing going on.  The hundreds and hundreds of tapes was just to illustrate my point, nothing else.  On the other hand, just throwing random theories out there, if the video did by chance show something like some other plane flying above the pentagon, a year would be more than enough time to remove it via editing.  But I don't really have much to go by that, I'm just using it as an example of things that could be done behind the scenes.

         Oh, hey, look, a website dedicated to debunking 9/11 truthers, I'm SURE they'll post evidence and testimonials against what they're trying to say.  That was just lazy.  Moving on.

       Actually, my whole point about them being passively coerced into altering their stories ("I saw what looked like a missile,"  'It was actually a plane sir, please say that.") was completely ignored.  I'm not saying all of these are coerced testimonials, and I'm not ignoring them.  You, however, seem to be ignoring my other inquiry about the other eyewitnesses who for some reason said things other to the contrary.

       Fire plus

      </p>
      <p>
       The "first time in history" deal is thrown around a lot but is demonstrably untrue. There are several examples of modern steel and concrete structures collapsing solely due to fire. Just a few:
      </p>
      <p>
       Interstate 580
Kader Factory
Dogwood Elementary
Mumbai High North Platform
Windsor Building
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the above collapses were compounded by massive structural damage.

       Upvoted. What has happened since alone should cause everyone to be suspicious of 9/11, it handed a few at the top a hell of a lot of power.
