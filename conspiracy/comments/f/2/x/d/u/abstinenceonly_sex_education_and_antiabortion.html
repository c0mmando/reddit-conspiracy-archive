        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Education about birth control and anti-abortion propaganda are instituted from the very highest levels. It&#39;s not about religion. Religion is only the front. The rich need a surplus of poor uneducated people to continue working at minimum wage. The best way to do that is to make sure the majority of people have a lot of children at a young age, prevent them from getting an education, and trap them for life.</p>

<p>*<em>Edit: *</em> Regarding planned parenthood are you guys even paying attention? Planned parenthood is something the rich have constantly been trying to shut down for ages. The institution has been around for 90 years, things have changed. Have you ever seen a media piece glorifying planned parenthood? I haven&#39;t. Look an article from 2 days ago talking about how the rich are <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/213607.php">trying to shut it down</a>.</p>

<p>*<em>Edit: *</em> Regarding abortion: the reason Roe V Wade isn&#39;t overturned is because the rich still want exercise their right to abortion. They say one thing but do another. The rich want to continue having abortions but don&#39;t want the poor to do the same. So they brainwash the poor into thinking it&#39;s bad. And this is why Roe V Wade will never ever be changed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good idea, bad logic.  What we&#39;re seeing instead is a reversal of the trend created after industrialization, where labor unions first managed to rise up and start demanding rights thanks to their superior numbers and united mindset, which as a result led to higher standards of living which decreased the number of children being born.  By reversing this trend, then sabotaging higher education with tuition hikes until college is no longer seen as viable (plus federal control over college loans and placing them under the jurisdiction of the IRS making them seem more dangerous loans to take), deconstruction of labor unions, sabotaging of lower education (which is essentially what no child left behind has become), and trapping the most violent of our generation in either endless wars or prison, plus pacifying and disuniting the rest of us (television for pacification, and reality shows which generally promote conflict between cast members to gain viewers), they can recreate the industrialization&#39;s era of relatively low wages and poor standards of living while actively preventing the return of labor unions.  </p>

<p>Also, I would disagree that it&#39;s completely separate from religious belief; the people who pass the laws probably believe in their dogma.  The people who provide the election funding, though, like the Koch brothers, are the ones who benefit from having a higher populated but less educated America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you said. Which is why I said it is &quot;one of the ways&quot; the rich control the poor. The rich have intertwined their social agendas into typical religious rhetoric so that they have faithful zombies doing all the brunt work for them. The distrust of science with the failing  of education goes hand in hand with anti-family-planning to create a class of people trapped in minimum wage forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Abortion remains a capital crime under Islamic Law!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>danxmason says;</strong> The rich need a surplus of poor uneducated people to continue working at minimum wage..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as being on the wrong side of the capital strictures of Islam, Dxm is pushing a BS agenda re the status of workers!! The trade unions were infiltrated by Jews, who received support from the same Zionist sponsored media that turned a blind eye to Jew crime.</p>

<p>Jew Abe Saffron described as Australia&#39;s most notorious crime figure, was behind the fire that killed seven school students at Sydney&#39;s Luna Park ghost train in June 1979.</p>

<p>The same Jews sent selected traitors to the Zionist operated Lenin Institute in Moscow, they received the &quot;Old Man of the Mountain&quot; treatment, named after an Afghan warlord who plied his delinquent followers with hashish and prostitutes.</p>

<p>They then went on errands at his behest, killing looting and plundering before returning to the Mountain for another toke, and a further session with a poxed up whore! </p>

<p>These same Lenin Institute scabs were endorsed as trade union leaders, whose role was to drive the respective unions into the ground, simultaneously Skull &amp; Bones type recruitment was underway at schools and universities.</p>

<p>They got the same Ziomedia treatment that elevated their personas to cult status, witness the elevation of Bob Hawke from zero to hero by the mainstream Rupert Murdoch owned press, with staged industrial front victories that were as transparent as his claim to represent the workers.</p>

<p>He became Prime Minister, and broke the Airline Pilots strike with Air Force pilots, then brought in legislation that eliminated ninety two out of one hundred and forty nine trade unions in this country, whence wages and conditions went backwards</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working with a welder Goonyella Coal Queensland Australia 1995, on union rates I was paid $509.00 for a ten hour overtime shift on Sunday night, he was on non union rate and got $180.00 for the same shift, despite a welder is on a higher pay rate than my classification as rigger / crane driver! He had rung the union who hung up the phone!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.dockersunion.net/journals/Page6.htm">http://www.dockersunion.net/journals/Page6.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Canberra 3 May 1993, John Howard&#39;s office: In an interview conducted by Tony Blair later to   become Prime Minister of Great Britain. We tell Blair on Howard&#39;s, then Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations behalf, of corruption, murder, hijacked union elections, and of zero response from the police, the government and the CJC. </p>

<p>That we had gone through the range of resources and options available in Queensland  to have these matters raised in the parliament. While Bob Reed, the source of much of the trouble on the docks, was then a solicitor employed by Wayne Goss the Labor Party Premier of Queensland. </p>

<p>Of the Costigan RC report recommending Packer be charged, and the National Crime Authority; stating the CJC and the NCA perform similar functions in that both are sham, spuriously appointed organizations, founded when the political allies of criminals who were being thus exposed at the FI in Queensland, and the CRC Federally, </p>

<p>Claimed those Inquiries were too costly and the good work they had done was to be taken up by those respective organizations. <em>Mr Blair said he thought Sir Peter Abells was the Mr Big in Australian crime,</em> and assures us he will make known to Howard the union&#39;s wish, that he take  our cause up in parliament. </p>

<p>He gives a date on which to ring back, when we do so he assures us he has briefed Howard of our concerns and wishes, and puts one through, click ...Howard&#39;s voice, &#39;I&#39;m not talking to him&#39;… clunk, dead phone. Proving the bi partisan nature of murderous corruption as it exists at a state and federal level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well Hawke was an associate of Jew Sir Peter Abels, described by former British PM Tony Blair as the &quot;Mr Big&quot; of Australian crime, and the great champion of abortion genocide that has near totaled the Australian landscape, while Irish, Dutch, Albanian and New Zealand scabs are flown in to take the jobs of those Australians  who stuck by their union principles.</p>

<p>Too bad &quot;they&quot; are on the wrong side of capital 911 legislation, means the same politicians that turned from the fire at the Ghost Train, and put immigrant scabs into the workforce, that killed Australia in abortion clinics,</p>

<p>Then brought the same Tamil terrorists wanted for capital terrorism in Sri Lanka, and murderous African blacks into the land while local blacks kill in groups fifteen strong, and no one is prosecuted .. too bad for the same blacks and their fancy pants lawyers that they are on the wrong side of the law .. diligent prosecution should hang the lot! </p>

<p>Also, I can&#39;t really hire non-english speaking immigrants to sell clothes or hamburgers can I?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the opposite is true. If I am a rich business owner employing unskilled labour, then I want as many unskilled labourers looking for work as possible. If I engineer a society so that there is always a surplus of unskilled labour, then I never have to worry about paying above minimum wage. </p>

<p>Therefore, one would expect the unemployment amongst unskilled labourers to always be above zero. Thus proving the rich do want poorly-educated citizens.</p>
