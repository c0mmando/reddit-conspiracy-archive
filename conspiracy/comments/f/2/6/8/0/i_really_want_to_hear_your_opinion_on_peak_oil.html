    <div class="md"><p>although I agree that oil may be &#39;replinishable&#39;, I doubt it it is being replinished at a rate fast enough to keep up with our demands.  If it were, we would be finding large oil fields consistently, or our current oil fields would never really dry up at all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question, is drilling in the earth for oil - good for the earth?
If someone stuck a needle in you and started draining your fluids how would your body react? The earth is &quot;alive&quot; isn&#39;t it? If oil is abiotic is taking it out of the earth the right thing to do?</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe earth is trying to get rid of oil by pushing it to the surface. In which case - should we be burning it in our atmosphere?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s worse for the abiotic theory, old oil wells don&#39;t become magically full after they&#39;ve been exhausted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is nothing in abiotic theory that states that a well will refill itself 24 hours after draining. Even though the origins are not organic, the natural process to create it may still be tens of thousands of years (if not more).</p>

<p>Moreover, let&#39;s take something like Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia. Even if we assume 100% efficiency in converting dead dinosaurs to oil, the 
size of the field would imply that there was a stack of dead dinosaurs several miles high to account for it all. Does that sound completely logical? In a desert?</p>

<p>It may not. However, it does at least defuse some of the Rockefeller&#39;s scarcity hype. </p>

<p>it&#39;s not dinosaurs that created oil, it&#39;s plant life. Plant fibers are clearly visible in a lot of heavier oil samples.</p>

If hydrocarbons really are made from the earth though and we have a somewhat unlimited supply then why doesn&#39;t price reflect that? Why is it raising?

    <div class="md"><p>note that gas prices in the US have so far been ridiculously lower than i.e. europe. i think the main reason for that is taxation. i don&#39;t think this has necessarily to do with the amount of oil that is produced. maybe the US fakes scarcity of oil to raise prices, but maybe they just begin to realize that there are a lot of hidden/indirect costs (environmental damage, etc.) thus they raise prices. if opec is solely responsible for high prices then prices would go up in europe aswell. but i never heard that this is going to happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have been and are lower because of taxes you are correct but the reason they keep them so low is because of a lack of public transit infrastructure. Most places in America barely have buses let Aline and way to transport its populace around, so they don&#39;t have a choice.

    <div class="md"><p>what scares me most about peak oil (if it&#39;s 100% real) is that no economy can instantly adapt to an alternative (let&#39;s say there is an adequate one). because it&#39;s not energy, gas, etc. alone but a very wide spectrum of products that use oil, such as plastic, .. even cosmetic products! we just can not sustain the current infrastructure and goods we use.. oil is everywhere!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Peak oil is definitely a real problem that needs to be addressed. It is not going to be here forever and I think 2015-2025 is a realistic estimate for when we will reach it. Yes, the perception of scarcity inflates the price but it does have merit because there is no possible way there is an unlimited resource underneath our planet that we use for everything. There have only been so many plants/animals decomposing in our planet&#39;s history - eventually we will reach the point where we have used it all. We are already fast approaching the point where the easy supplies of oil are gone and what is left is hard to get.</p>

<p>We need to get on to alternative energy sources as soon as possible. </p>

<p>Oh and edit - the theory on abiotic oil is all well and good but it still doesn&#39;t address the problem that oil is incredibly bad for the environment and to get most of this oil it costs a lot more money and is very unsafe. &quot;Finally, theory advocates aver that the impressive record of recent ultra deep drilling in the Gulf of Mexico supports their idea.&quot; Impressive returns, yes - but its incredibly dangerous because when the rigs blow up for whatever reason its basically impossibly difficult for us to close it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>note that gas prices in the US have so far been ridiculously lower than i.e. europe. i think the main reason for that is taxation. i don&#39;t think this has necessarily to do with the amount of oil that is produced. maybe the US fakes scarcity of oil to raise prices, but maybe they just begin to realize that there are a lot of hidden/indirect costs (environmental damage, etc.) thus they raise prices. if opec is solely responsible for high prices then prices would go up in europe aswell. but i never heard that this is going to happen.</p>
