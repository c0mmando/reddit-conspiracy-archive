       The fact that it won an Oscar should be evidence enough that it's to someone's benefit that the movie is seen by many people. (Yes, I know, EVERY movie maker wants his movies to be seen by as many people as possible.) This is either one faction trying to crush another, or, more probably, final blows to a failed system of domination that needs to be
       <strong>
        publicly
       </strong>
       crushed before being replaced by a new one, one that has already been thoroughly planned but that few are yet aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like in Inception, you will only accept an idea if you've fully understood it and agree with it. It has to grow from a seed. I'd bet my ass that this movie is probably a dandelion full of such seeds, as are many such documentaries of the past decade.

       A trained thinker can differentiate between the payload and the information.  If it wins an Oscar then it is obviously meant for the masses to nod their heads for an hour and then to be uploaded into.

       They even make Oscar winning FILMS about how fucking corupt everything is, and we're all powerless to do anythign about it.

       When the 9-11 truth comes out, it will probably just be a tame news story about a few old men who abused their elected power, and endless news coverage of their trails.  And they will continue to laugh

       I am regularly disgusted by how little value truth has in modern society, but I think saying that it used to be better in the past is seeing history through particularly rose-tinted glasses.

       I agree with this statement, It may be worse now than in the past, or it may be even better. For all I know, politicians could have held more power over the media in the past than in the present.
      </p>
      <p>
       If things were better in the past and worse in the present. Don't you think at some point in the future things will climax and who knows, maybe even things out?

       Truth was valued more highly in the past. The only period in Western history as corrupt as ours was the Roman Empire under the Caesars. The Zionists and their lackies, who run the West, have a complete disregard for truth. They don't even know what truth is. Truth is an alien concept to them. The idea that you should admit to something because it is true, even if it does not benefit you in any way, must seem laughable to them.

       Just because they may wish to conceal certain truths does not mean they are ignorant to them. Indeed I reckon they simply are amongst the few that believe that the best place to hide the worst secrets/truths is in broad daylight. If I rob you and then tell you that I have done a good thing because I liberated you then it is up to you to decide whether to believe or not believe and then to take or not take action .

       Isn't it curious how there is almost always this kind of evidence, something that would at first cause you to discount the credibility of the films information?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same with other documentary makers and writers, there is almost always a skeleton waiting to taken out and shown around.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not in a position to judge the CFR or Ferguson, I simply don't know enough about them. I haven't yet watched this film either.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do know that many people who are on the fence about these things will take the first semi-credible counterpoint they find and use it to justify their dismissal of all other evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like we are all aware of how fucked up things are, but to varying degrees. We each will impose different burdens of proof on the information, and each of us will find a reason to stick to our preconceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very few of us have the capacity to properly grasp and judge information like this. (I'm not saying I have, I wish I did). Even fewer of us have the time, or inclination to make the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have one group of people, lets call them progressive for want of a better term. They are the ones that are already aware of this information, and they might corner you in a pub and have a little rant about the CFR, or the Bilderbergers or whatever. This film will allow them to say "Ha, I told you so!". It moves them from the fringe more towards the center. It adds legitimacy to their worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, we have the people who are for want of a better term, conservative. What does this film do for them? It is upsetting to their worldview, they are not as cynical as the "progressive" bunch. They are the ones that go to mass, and buy the same daily newspaper, and vote for the same candidates and parties. They like stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       These kinds of people would not have encountered this film if it hadn't won an award. But now it's in the news cycle and they will read a review of it with their chosen bias applied. (Just like everyone else does).
      </p>
      <p>
       And within that bias will be the nugget that can make or break the credibility of the presenter. It's always there, it's always presented to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what is curious to me. Are these exposés fabrications or distractions, do all filmakers walk in such dark shadows, or is it simply human nature to attack the messenger?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think the goal of a film like this is to educate. Why then would the backers allow that to be jeapordised by such an obvious thing like the director being pally with the very goons he is exposing?
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, the effect of this is to further discredit the "progressive" people. If there is such an obvious link between the director and the goons, then this legitimisation of the progressive persons worldview can't/won't happen. Any conservative person can easily counter their entire argument by just saying "well yeah it's just like global warming and Al Gore all over again!, this Ferguson guy is another charlatan".
      </p>
      <p>
       And then all further discussion by the progressive person makes him look more like a militant leftist fringer. The value of his evidence is diminished by the credibility of his source.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like arming both sides of the war at once. You acknowledge the information in the public domain but you also provide the means to discredit it. And all this happens without the information itself being the major factor, it's importance becomes diluted in the argument over credibility.

        But I do know that many people who are on the fence about these things will take the first semi-credible counterpoint they find and use it to justify their dismissal of all other evidence.

       And to gain the trust they need to identify with the current state of affairs.  If they portrayed everything as rosy as an old black and white sitcom then people wouldn't be having it, since things suck balls these days.

       So basically it goes as follows;
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are ugly (nods, yes I am ugly)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You are fat (well maybe just a little)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're wife is ugly (yes actually)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You smell bad (nah I don't)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         You're kids are ugly (well damn now they are really understanding my problems)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then professor Goldmanlevineburg says that everybody who disagrees should be ignored
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Then a person then testifies about how they follow this advice
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Therefore, the only obvious solution to these facts is to have a GPS brain chip implanted.  There is not other way.

       Hopefully the fact that it did win will convince some people to actually watch it, and not be fooled into simply thinking it is the stuff of the tin foil hat. Of course I fully expect to see another documentary come out in the next year funding by some interest in bed with the banks to "debunk" this.

       Umm so have we CHOSEN A DATE YET? For when we're all going to stop paying rent/mortgage and declare our current living spaces as OURS and then move on to solving the rest of the real world problems like how we are going to feed ourselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously food shelter good friends and good times is all we need. Do not need money. Fuck the money. Fuck the banking system, fuck their institutions we need new everything and we're going to have to do it ourselves and ain't nobody gonna have the money to stop us. If they come for us with guns, we'll move on. They'll burn themselves out trying to hunt us down while we build the future. And we'll win.

       Only 21 million coins will ever be made?  Adding the numbers thats not even a coin for each person.  What the hell?  Why not make a billion of them total?  The market value will get sorted out in the end so the total quantity won't matter for the coins to have value.  Not even everybody can have one at once.  Its stupid.

       Does anyone else feel homicidal impulses in his heart watching this? I found myself thinking that all these bastards in their nice suits need to be lined up in a warehouse on Valentine's Day.

       Why they don't investigate Democrats' misdeeds is beyond me.  That is the real scandal regarding this movie.  They ignore the role of Democrats altogether and if you can't see that you're a fucking fool.

       Have you even watched the movie?

      <p>
       They pointed out plenty of Democrats who contributed to the crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didnt say anything about Democrat politicians making laws to force banks to loan to poor people who couldn't afford to pay it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason is because THAT DIDNT FUCKING HAPPEN.

       Some folks seem to be under the impression that "fair and balanced" means you always have to assign an equal amount of blame regardless of whether the parties involved were equally responsible. Can't imagine where they would get such a notion. -rolls eyes-
