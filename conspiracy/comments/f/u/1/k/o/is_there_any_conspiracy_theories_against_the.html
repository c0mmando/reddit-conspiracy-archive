<p>Britney Spears: After leaving disney becomes promiscous and crazy she shave her head bald</p>

<p>Lindsay Lohan: Gets addicted to crack.</p>

<p>Miley Cyrus: After leaving Disney, he music suddenly becomes more adult and becomes promiscuous like Britney</p>

<p>Vanessa Hudgens: Posted Nude photos 2 times by her own.</p>

<p>and the list goes on. So why are we putting these people on a Kid&#39;s television shows? Does Disney wants us to teach good morals and success or total failure? I just don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong> sorry for my grammar, I&#39;m tired right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the 1950&#39;s, Disney offered the ODM to help publicly &quot;rehabilitate&quot; the image of Wernher Von Braun, who had been a top nazi scientist brought to the US after the war (Operation Paperclip). </p>

<p>In one of the videos that von Braun and Disney did together, they dramatize a rocketship exploring the dark side of the moon. At 33 degrees, they see an anomoly, and drop a flare. Structures are revealed, and then never commented upon again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, along the lines you suggest, that Disney stars are mind controlled sex slaves. I don&#39;t believe that but it is out there. There is also a theory that Disney uses language in certain ways to divert attention from certain ideas by priming and other methods. Again, I don&#39;t believe it but at least one person has developed a complex theory describing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is very true. My school had to cancel homecoming dance because all of the grinding. Than I went to Minithon which is a all nighter supporting for cancer. Anyways there is a dance room and since there were no guys dancing or grinding, the girls were dancing with each other. And I&#39;m not talking about Chicago or New York or anything, I&#39;m talking about freakin Lancaster, PA where all the Amish live!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you pushing some conservative agenda. Promiscuous and being single is fine just as long as your responsible. </p>

<p>Japan has tons of sex shit but they have the lowest rapes and sexual assults in the world. On the other hand alabama is the highest in this country when it comes to rape. </p>

<p>It goes to show how fucking stupid people are these days where sex is evil or somthing yet most of the country are becoming athiest. </p>

<p>Go watch 16 and pregnat and almost all the girls are southern rednecks. They are the conservative people in the country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sort of agree to your statement. However I&#39;ve lived in Japan more than I did in the US so I know a lot about it. I wouldn&#39;t say that Japan has the least people who are raped, it&#39;s probably more that since Japanese people are shy, there are lesser people who are known to be raped. I went to a Japanese middle school and it was god aweful. People would try to jerk each others wangs off in the CLASS ROOM and the HALLWAYS. They also gang up on a particular person and Jerk off and that&#39;s probably considered raper, it&#39;s just that Japanese people don&#39;t like to admit that that&#39;s rape. Well anyways I&#39;m not against promiscuous singles because of rape and stuff, but it degrades science and the advancedment of technology. In woodstock it was very peaceful, but do you think they made any inventions? probably not (except for rock maybe). If every girl becomes a porn star would we ever get things done? Probably not. If you have sex once in a while it&#39;s fine, but if your life is revolved around sex (in which these disney artists seems to portray), than life gets worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is Disney doing something illegal? What?</p>

<p>Britney Spears in a bad marriage with a dead beat husband, two very young children and a career to juggle. </p>

<p>I&#39;d shave my head too.</p>

<p>Lindsey Lohan, I blame her attention-whore parents. </p>

<p>Miley Cyrus is 18.</p>

<p>And Fergie smoked methamphetamines. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget Christina Aguilera is a Disney brat too.</p>

<p>Why are they on a kids television show? Because there they stood out from all the other children that auditioned. They were easy to work with, had some talent or someone saw something in them that was star material. All of the above.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I would consider Spears, Cyrus, Fergie or Aguilera to be total faliures. These women are at the top of their game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol.... ok? I don&#39;t know where did America got an idea that doing drugs and having sex is being in top of the game. In japan (which I lived in and is 99% atheist) No one considers doing drugs as being top of the game or having sex and showing nude pics... etc. I think this is what disney is trying to do, trying to make people think that it&#39;s ok. Well I respect your opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doing drugs and having sex and posing for nude pics what average people do.</p>

<p>When you sing, dance and write and pull it off in front of a camera that is a feat in itself.</p>

<p>There are millions of people in the world that probably have worthy voices to sell records but they don&#39;t do the work that it takes or have the ability or persona that the music industry is looking for. </p>
