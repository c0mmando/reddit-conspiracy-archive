        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Yeah, I realize that&#39;s saying something - the guy seems like a nutcase as it is, but... </p>

<p>It&#39;s always struck me that he&#39;s definitely intelligent - he may believe in some rather far out stuff (only a small percentage of which I can agree with), but he seems to come to his conclusions from his own intelligent investigations.</p>

<p>So recently he&#39;s been going on and on and <em>on</em> about some new film, &quot;The End of America&quot;. I realize his station advertises some &quot;related&quot; subjects of interest to the conspiracy community - things like survival foods, and alternative products. But this one seemed a little bit different. </p>

<p>So when you actually check out the video - it is, as he promises, an hour long &quot;film&quot; (really just a narration with graphics) talking primarily about the supposed imminent collapse of the US dollar. The video uses all sorts of made up graphs and makes some ridiculous statements, but it draws upon fairly well known positions of &quot;doomers&quot; speculations about the fate of the US dollar in the next few years. Above all though, it spends most of the first 45 minutes or so trying to scare the SHIT out of the viewer. I&#39;m watching and thinking ok I see where this is heading. Sure enough, the final fifteen minutes or so are talking about how this guy who made the video (&quot;Porter Stansberry&quot;) knows the secrets of how people have survived currency collapses throughout history. Only HE knows the right things to invest in and &quot;protect yourself&quot; against the societal chaos and martial law that is <em>imminent</em>. But of course - he won&#39;t tell you - you have to subscribe to his newsletter (which of course, costs actual MONEY).</p>

<p>Now... I understand, at this point, it&#39;s a simple &#39;scare and profit&#39; scam. But then, I did some digging into this guy. It turns out he&#39;s been associated with some pretty shitty stuff in the past - he&#39;s allegedly been associated with &#39;pump and dump&#39; scams, and at one point, Stansberry was actually <em>convicted</em> by the SEC of securities fraud, for a really similar setup - telling people that he knew something massive about the future, and people need only purchase his &quot;report&quot; to get the answer of what stocks to buy etc,. He scammed something like 2 million dollars.
<a href="http://briandeer.com/stansberry/stansberry-investment-1.htm">Here&#39;s a pretty interesting expose of Porter Stansberry</a>, including information about the fraud conviction.</p>

<p>So - to get to the point - I realize that Jones has at least partially always been in this for the money (even though he and his fans deny that violently), but even someone as him is <em>surely</em> intelligent enough not to so heavily associate himself with a <em>CONVICTED</em> fraudster?  I mean, he&#39;s <em>literally</em> championing this guy during his talk show now - not just running his ads.</p>

<p>Even for someone like Alex Jones, it seems a little crazy and like career suicide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast majority of his fans don&#39;t have your critical mind, or worse, they had it and shut it off. </p>

<p>People who have learned that the Government tells lies often see it as discovering one great holy truth - an epiphany of sorts - which for some reason ends their search for other truths.  </p>

<p>They view Jones and his ilk as trusted brethen in this grand realisation and are very receptive to all messages from him and his associates - so these guys get to avoid inital skecpticism that would normally be applied.</p>

<p>This makes them a grreat market for snake oil salesmen which Jones &amp; his mates undoubtedly are.</p>

<p>For every pair of eyes he opens, he keeps another ten shut tightly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I figured that quite a while ago, but in the past he&#39;s tended to stick to &quot;mainstream&quot; conspiracy theories - this is the first time I&#39;ve seen him  associate with (and aggressively promote) convicted fraudsters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been listening to Alex Jones for years. His regular guests are world class - Paul Craig Roberts, Catherine Austin Fitts, Max Keiser, Webster G Tarpley, Bob Chapman, Mike Adams, Joel Skousen, Ray McGovern, Marc Faber, Lindsey Williams and lately, Porter Stansberry. There are other great regular guests but I&#39;m tired of typing.</p>

<p>There is one consistent theme with these people and that is that The United States of America is doomed. Porter Stansberry is only the latest person on the guest list to say so. I&#39;ve listened to the evidence and I tend to agree. The End of America means the end of the US Dollar as the world reserve currency.</p>

<p>Already China, Japan, Russia and others have stopped buying out debt (Treasuries) because they realize its mathematically impossible for the USA to pay off its debts. If every US citizen was taxed at 100% it would not be enough to pay our current debt load.</p>

<p>This is why the Federal Reserve is doing this Quantitative Easing, as they call it. What this means in plain English is that The Treasury Department issues Treasury bonds. Treasuries are US government debt instruments that allow the US government to continue to function because our taxes taken in are less than our ridiculous spending level.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve makes an accounting entry on their ledger to buy those Treasuries (in effect just running the printing press by printing money). This is a Ponzi scheme. The only difference between this Ponzi scheme and any others is that the Conman and the Victim are the same group. You see how crazy that sounds?</p>

<p>The only reason this is allowed to happened and the dollar hasn&#39;t gone under already is because we are the world reserve currency. That means that everybody else has to buy US Dollars to buy commodities, like oil, gold, wheat, porkbellies, etc. Everything is priced in Dollars.</p>

<p>When the world finally wakes up, loses all confidence in the US Dollar and the world starts buying commodities with a basket of currencies (Special Drawing Rights), the Dollar will need to be revalued, aka devalued, in order to go into the SDR basket of currencies, itself.</p>

<p>When that happens, you can expect for food and gas to become ridiculously expensive because your Dollars will be, for all intents and purposes, worthless. Even more exciting, when it happens it will happen quickly. The Banks will simply shutdown (banking holiday). When they reopen. Your dollar will be slashed in value 50% or more and you will be greatly limited to how much money you can pull out.</p>

<p>How do I know this? Look at Argentina. Look at Zimbabwe. Look at the Weimar Republic. This has all happened before. Stansberry is just the latest guy stating the obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad you could join us, Porter.</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn&#39;t add Stansberry&#39;s name to that list of distinguished guests in your first paragraph. Most of the rest of them are pretty serious people, Stansberry is just a snake oil salesman, and a convicted fraudster actually.  You&#39;re &quot;tired of typing&quot;, yet you managed to type an entire page of stuff, which is just basically regurgitating information from Stansberry&#39;s video? </p>

<p>Information, which, by the way, is hardly revelatory, and any schmuck with half a brain is already talking about.  You actually said it yourself : &quot;Stansberry is just the latest guy stating the obvious.&quot;</p>

<p>And it looks like he&#39;s making lots of money doing it. I wonder what his &quot;magical asset&quot; is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he not only runs commercials for this guy about 5 times an hour, he&#39;s now actually actively spruiking him during the <em>talk</em> segments of his show - last show I heard he was ranting and raving about how the commercial TV channels in the US had &quot;pulled&quot; their commercials, as if somehow it was a massive conspiracy to hide the truth - when I would bet you 100% it was because they looked into the product, and Stansberry&#39;s criminal history and decided they didn&#39;t want to get involved with a possible scam in the making. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol I wrote that while waking up. My head is a lot clearer now.</p>

<p>I have always felt that Alex Jones is harmful to the conspiracy theory community in general. While some of what he says makes a little sense in the grand scheme of things, his messages tend to get &quot;Over the top&quot;. </p>

<p>By appearing worked up, and emotional, and claiming some pretty terrifyingly insane ideas, he&#39;s causing the whole conspiracy theory movement to appear to be insane by proxy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right.. I always thought that was just his unique way of monetizing conspiracy theory - it&#39;s worked pretty well for him. The specific reason I made this post is that it seems with this Porter Stansberry stuff, he&#39;s about to kill the goose that laid the golden egg. So far he&#39;s stuck to advertising/selling predictable stuff, like water filters, home remedies, survival gear, and of course his videos and subscriptions to his sites. This Stansberry character has a proven history of defrauding his customers, to the tune of <em>millions</em>. So I guess that&#39;s why I was asking whether he&#39;d lost the plot - Jones is making a lot of money through is existing (admittedly weird, but not illegal) franchises, waving the flag for this Stansberry guy just seems nuts. And I mean <em>really</em> nuts - that&#39;s saying something with Alex Jones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to listen to him a lot when I first discovered him, and his rhetoric worked pretty well on me for a while. I was impotently enraged at how <em>screwed</em> we all are. Then I started to notice that he never offers any kind of solution, only <em>more fear and anger</em>. </p>

<p>Now I see him for what he is--the exact same as Fox News, only his boogeymen are different. </p>

<p>What finally clued me into how cynically he&#39;s gaming gullible folks, is how he talked repeatedly about how we need to &quot;impeach Bush and Cheney for their war crimes&quot;--while Bush/Cheney were in the WH. The very day Obama was inaugurated, his rhetoric changed to &quot;impeach Obama, watch out for Obama, OMG look at these schoolkids singing their &#39;song of worship&#39; to Obama!!&quot;</p>

<p>now that <em>it&#39;s actually easier to really prosecute Bush</em>, Jones never talks about it, only &quot;removing Obama&quot;, etc. </p>

<p>that all being said, I still think he&#39;s right to question 9/11; I just don&#39;t think he&#39;s all the way right, and he&#39;s cashing in on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I caught up with him during the Bush years, when he started preaching 9/11 truth. It seemed interesting, and definitely opened my eyes to a lot of those issues. </p>

<p>But I had the same revelation as you - in terms of him only offering more fear and anger. The other thing I noticed - and this is extremely telling - is that he NEVER, EVER admits to being wrong about <em>ANYTHING</em>, <em>EVER</em>. That right there is a great big red flag. </p>

<p>Even in the last few months, as all the world watches Charlie Sheen <em>obviously</em> unravelling and going down in a drug induced burning crash, there&#39;s Jones on &quot;The View&quot; swearing that Sheen doesn&#39;t take drugs anymore. The guy is either completely deluded, and arrogant, or an amazing actor - most probably all three. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, I&#39;ve heard him admit he was wrong a couple times, but it&#39;s <em>never</em> humble. it&#39;s always justified with some sort of chest-thumping righteous indignation, so in the end, it doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s admitted anything except &quot;keen discernment&quot;. Plus, the way that he deliberately panders to whoever is talking to him says a lot, not to mention the method he uses to sell gold (which Glenn Beck has copied)---spin for about 25 minutes about how &quot;the dollar is gonna collapse TOMORROW!&quot;, and &quot;YOU CAN&#39;T EVEN IMAGINE THE HELLSCAPE WAITING FOR YOU YUPPIES!!&quot;. Then he starts talking about how gold prices are shooting thru the roof, then he cuts over to &quot;his friend&quot; selling gold, and spends another 10 minutes letting his &quot;gold guy&quot; agree with him and shill his gold pieces. </p>

<p>it&#39;s like he and Fox news have a symbiotic relationship--they take cues from him, he takes cues from them, in terms of style/rhetoric/delivery/content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>very true, as do Beck, Limbaugh, Blitzer, Williams, Scarborough, Jennings, etc. The problem with Alex is that he is, like Limbaugh and Beck, acting with a specific agenda that is diametrically opposed to a <em>UNIFIED NATION</em>. Blitzer, Williams, et al are just paid hacks reading a script, but Beck, Limbaugh and Jones write their own scripts based on the agenda of divisiveness, and reaping the dollars that they whip their glassy-eyed followers into a panic to spend. They are totally aware of what they&#39;re doing. </p>

<p>I do think that Jones, at one time, was on target, but he&#39;s spent so much time trying to &quot;counter&quot; what Fox news has done to the soul of our country, that he&#39;s <em>become the same as Fox</em>-- will not tolerate dissent, will not let people <em>finish a fucking sentence</em>, LOVES his high horse and rides it proudly, stoking impotent rage for profit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been listening to Jones for almost 10 years. At one time I thought the man was the cats ass cutting edge of hard core reality and truth. About three years ago I began to take notice of what he WAS NOT talking about. For one, he definately appears to be a gate keeper for Israel. When it came to 9/11, he was all about the truth. He was the first to declare &quot;controlled demotion&quot; and &quot;inside job&quot;, but that is also where he stopped. The hardcore researchers and investigators kept on and soon found that Israel was HEAVILY involved, but Jones absolutely refuses to talk about it and insists that it was US government and British counterparts that were involved. I don&#39;t trust him anymore....there is something in his speech patterns and his &quot;conditioning&quot; people that America will be laid to waste that is not sitting right with me as well. Creating fear profit? Definately. Waking people up to the evils of the world? Only to a certain point. He dances around the Third Rail like a drunk chick at Mardi Gras.

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is very good at compiling early news footage of events.  For instance, the local newscasts of the Oklahoma City bombing are fascinating, speaking of finding more bombs strapped to pillors inside the building, of a more than one man leaving the Ryder truck in front of the building, etc.</p>

<p>But then Jones takes a shit on that good groundwork by speculating and beating his one note drum: New World Order, which is bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones has always seemed to be in it for the cash and fame, not the enlightening of the masses. This seals the deal for me on Mr. Jones. I was weirded out when he had Charlie Sheen on his show recently (that&#39;s one hell of a red flag), but have long suspected Jones of being insincere and perhaps even intending malice. He&#39;s a fearmonger, his role being similar to Glenn Beck&#39;s role, just for a different part of society. Boo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you&#39;re another one of these crazy Jones supporter who&#39;s just assuming that I&#39;m alleging that Jones has &quot;said something false&quot; - without reading a single thing in my original post.</p>

<p>Unless you take the time and intelligence required to do so, I&#39;m under no obligation to answer your question, which is based on complete fallacy, and your readiness to blindly stand up for a demagogue, even when he&#39;s not actually being attacked by me. </p>

<p>IF in fact you&#39;re talking about Stansberry, then my answer to your question is that it&#39;s got nothing to do with what him saying as being false or not. It&#39;s got to do with his past history of operating a business in this way (pump up fear, dangle a false solution, then ask for money), one which has in the past resulted in a criminal conviction. The most obvious way to perpetrate a scam of this nature is to suck people in using easily available information (such as the talk about the crash of the dollar, and China&#39;s dollar denominated holdings), which they can then verify as being accurate, then take that to mean the seller must be telling the truth. This is exactly how conmen work - an all out blatant lie would be foolish. The entire reason for this thread is my assertion that Alex Jones seems smarter than to expose himself to &quot;guilt by association&quot;, but his fans seem to blinded to the extent they don&#39;t get that. </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not a fucking idiot.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Commodities prices fluctuate in cycles. The last time food prices skyrocketed was before the global financial collapse, and Jones and his ilk were predicting similar disastrous food shortages. What happened? The world economy crashed and <em>surprise</em>, so did the price of food. The high cost of commodities has as much to do with rampant futures speculation as it does with how well a growing season is. There is nothing &quot;logical&quot; about a conclusion that predicts food riots and anarchy in the US, even with a crash or correction of the dollar. The last time around when food prices got high, much of the world DID suffer, and there WERE food riots - but they were in poor countries that were under the IMF and World Banks&#39; thumb, such as Indonesia and Pakistan. The US did not suffer such a fate.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure - whatever floats your boat. </p>

<p>First of all, such information is FREELY AVAILABLE to anyone with more than even 1/4 of a brain. In the age of Google, such information is but a mouse click away - FREE OF CHARGE (remember this people). Secondly, if you watch the video, what you describe is NOT what the man is offering. He spends at least 45 minutes trying to terrify the viewer into believing that not even &quot;normal&quot; preparation of the kind you describe will suffice. That somehow, one has to invest (yes, he said invest) in particular items, or commodities, or <em>something</em> (we don&#39;t know, he keeps alluding to it as the ONLY solution, without describing what it is) in order to &quot;survive the apocalypse&quot;. Already such tactics are the common tools of conmen, but let&#39;s move along. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You can go fuck yourself - I&#39;ll post whatever I goddamn please, and while you&#39;re free to argue against it, calling it arrogant, prickish or trollish just because you seem to be suspiciously defensive about it is simply childish. Look at the facts, not your ego. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>to address the previous history of Stansberry, I am don&#39;t know if the allegations are true or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The allegations that he was convicted of SEC Fraud? They are true. Verifiable, you know, <em>facts</em>, that sort of thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can just say that a conviction doesn&#39;t necessarily mean guilty</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um. Perhaps you misunderstand how the law works. <em>YES IT DOES</em> If you are &quot;CONVICTED&quot; of  crime - that means that the court, or the jury, has determined beyond whatever standard of evidence that applies, that you <em>are</em>, by definition, &quot;guilty&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and guilt in a previous situation doesn&#39;t necessarily mean he is conning this time around.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but his previous associations with other scams - such as the company prosecuted for a &quot;pump and dump&quot; scam involving a phony cure for AIDS (pure class), would tend to indicate that he has a pattern of being involved in such behaviour.  In short, on the basis of statistical probability, you&#39;d have to be a moron to give this guy any money and expect to see any back.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you can really do is keep watching the news over time, see if what he has predicted seems to be happening or not, and judge for yourself whether you should if you believe his conclusions or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You haven&#39;t watched the video, have you? You are so missing the point. The predictions are <em>completely</em> irrelevant. Sure - they&#39;re pretty spot on, and pretty well stolen directly from the mouths of at least half a dozen economists who are far smarter than him. But that information is simply being used to sway people to spend their dollars. If people look into it, they&#39;d find that there is a school of thought out there that believes such predictions are credible. This is how pump and dumpers throughout history have always worked - they start with the truth,  so the &quot;mark&quot; naturally thinks - hey, this person is credible. Then the conman hits them with the lie.  Usually that lie is that whatever &quot;incredible&quot; investment being offered, is simply something that the conman stands to benefit from directly if it is sold en masse. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to work this model out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And if you want to spend your money in buying his product or not is entirely up to you, just as it is with whomever else listens to the ads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And it&#39;s entirely up to you to do your due diligence, which I did, and it&#39;s entirely up to you to warn people if you believe your due diligence has turned up information that should be shared with the public. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But making rash generalizations of Alex Jones&#39; listening audience-- as you do in your post</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I guess you missed the thread in here where a guy spent seven or eight messages accusing me of being CIA, FBI, a COP, or &quot;COINTELPRO&quot; ?
Did you also happen to catch all the people agreeing with me, with a nudge and a wink, then linking to all sorts of Anti-Jewish propaganda (but they&#39;re <em>NOT</em> anti-semitic - they&#39;re &quot;anti-zionist&quot; ;P ). I&#39;m not generalizing about all his listeners, I&#39;m generalizing about his most vocal and crazy listeners - of which there are quite a few. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nocubir, whatever that means, I already responded to your points once.  You refuse to acknowledge this.  And I said that people can do whatever they want with their money. You act as if people will purely respond mindlessly when an ad comes on.  And let me add that this particular advertisement plays on the cnn and msnbc xm radio channels as well.  An ad is an add. You take it with a grain of salt.  People know this, but you talk as just because someone says anything on the radio, everybody other than you is going to believe.  Give the public, and the listening audience of all these channels a little more credit, and enough respect to make their own decisions.  You just seem inclined on being continuously argumentative and unwilling even cite that irrefutable fact that what you&#39;re saying is just your opinion.  In fact, I would even go as far to say that even all economics is opinion.  As much as economists would hate to admit, the subject is not a science, and they have incredible physics envy.  There are just too many unknown inputs. The only thing that can be done-- within an understanding that any prediction is just an opinion, is look to the past of trends of cause and effect.  But like you say, America is different, yet we cannot possibly know the effects of all the subtle effects that today&#39;s different laws, world neighbors, etc have on todays events when so called dire previous trends occur in America presently. </p>

<p>Acknowledging that there is no re way to really know.  One could either prepare or not prepare, right?  It&#39;s just a cost/benefit analysis?  Which has the worse risk, buying a stupid 50 dollar book? Investing a little in metals?  Or doing nothing and possibly taking a loss and feeling pretty stupid for procrastinating on taking action?  Sure Stansberry may have a record on the books, but as you cite the court &quot;how things in the real world actually work&quot;, are past convictions, admissible when deciding this case, if this particular argument were in a trial?  My guess is no, so you really shouldn&#39;t bring that up, though I know this isn&#39;t a court of law.  </p>

<p>So that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say.  I really don&#39;t like coming on reddit and seeing letters from you.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I researched that Sansubuy guy and came up with the same results. He’s a scheming conman. So the question remains, why’s Alex working with him?  Maybe Alex is giving him a second chance because he likes his shpeal in that it&#39;s aligns well with the Info Wars theme. That’s my best guess in favor of AJ. Of course I don’t agree with everything AJ says but I always like his attitude about 911 and how he stands up to police corruption. The dude has huge balls I’ll say that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect he just didn&#39;t do his due diligence. He hears Stansberry&#39;s message about the decline of the dollar, hears his doomsday rhetoric and figures he&#39;s found a like mind. Why would he need to ask any questions beyond that? Not to mention I&#39;d say Stansberry is paying him a fairly decent chunk of change to spruik him on air at every opportunity. Money talks. </p>

<p>As for Stansberry, &#39;scheming conman&#39; doesn&#39;t even do it justice. When you look into the earlier stock scams he was involved in (before he was convicted of fraud), it was some pretty despicable stuff. </p>

<p>It&#39;s completely tarnished what little reputation Jones had left, imho. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll see if i can find the link to the Stansberry story I found and yes i read about his stock scams too, real nasty stuff. Also, I was wondering if this topic ever came up in the Info Wars official forums (of which i do not frequent). I for one would like to hear Jones&#39;s side of the story or if not his then maybe someone who works for him. An explanation is definitely in order. Perhaps someone should start a thread there if one hasn&#39;t already been created and if it has, keep bumping it until someone comes clean. And hey, do you have a link to the Stansberry story you found, I like to read that.</p>

<p>As for the infowars official forums, I used to post there many years ago, but it became obvious that Jones must have been employing a couple of monkeys who did <em>nothing</em> all day but sit there and censor anything (and I mean <strong><em>anything</em></strong> ) that was even remotely critical of Alex Jones or his contributors (particularly the &quot;Watson Brothers&quot;). So yeah, good luck with that. </p>

<p>Let me know if you have any success. I think the more obvious thing to do would be for somebody to call him during open lines on his radio show, and very politely ask him whether he knows anything about Stansberry&#39;s criminal history, and what he has to say about it.  But once again, if the show is on a delay (which is more than likely), I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be cut off within seconds.  Worth a shot though huh? </p>

<p>Somebody should do it. I would but I live in a completely opposite timezone to the USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh, that&#39;s the same one I read. Pretty damning evidence if you ask me but I&#39;ll still listen to and like the show. Alex is usually pretty likable even when I disagree with him. For example he doesn&#39;t believe in over population which denies simple mathematical realities of how growth works. or his stance on abortion but even with those things I still manage to like him, in fact the only time I&#39;ve ever seen him act like a total asshole was when he interviewed Peter Joseph, the creator and narrator of Zeitgeist. There was no reason for those two to not get along but Alex just wouldn&#39;t let Joseph have his say in peace. I know this makes no sense but this interview made me dislike AJ more than anything. Joesph is basically a futurist and Jones is more topical so there&#39;s no reason for the conflict yet for some reason Alex appeared very threatened by the mans ideas. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9K6xzchl6M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9K6xzchl6M</a>   (5 parts)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of Emmanuel Goldstein in 1984 was a fictitious &quot;Rebel Leader&quot;, much like &quot;Osama Bin Laden&quot; in our world. This served the dual purpose of having an boogeyman the state could use to scare the population into submission, and as a lightning rod to draw in any who might be rebellious or fifth columners.</p>

<p>Now how exactly would the short term goal of &quot;money&quot; outweigh keeping a &quot;credible&quot; agent like that in power? </p>

<p>I get what you&#39;re saying, I just think that until now, Jones has done a pretty good job of keeping the money making operations to those which fulfill a niche, but not ones which are actually borderline criminal. This  thing could bring down the whole game, if it is, in fact as you suggest, a game. </p>

<p>As for Stansberry - his conclusions are simplistic and not at all unique - dozens of analysts have been saying similar things for years. Where I take issue is where he builds them up into a boogeyman, then proclaims that he has the answer, and he won&#39;t reveal it unless the viewer parts with some of their cash. I would like to point out also that the reason he was convicted of fraud was in <em>precisely</em> the same situation - he lied to a whole pile of people in order to convince them to buy into something that he would profit off of. That&#39;s called theft! :P </p>

<p>As for your claim of the SEC&#39;s <em>evidence</em> (not &quot;claims&quot;, as you put it misleadingly) - I&#39;m sorry, but between the SEC, and some random fuckwit on the internet, I&#39;ll side with the SEC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you seem really bent out of shape about this. The fact remains that Bernie was only caught after people lost their entire life&#39;s savings. This Porter guy claimed that a stock would double, and it only went up 40%. Between losing my entire life&#39;s savings, and making a 40% return, I&#39;d choose the latter. </p>

<p>As for Stansberry&#39;s arguement, you still haven&#39;t levelled any counter-factual claims to somehow prove the contrary - that the US is <em>not</em> headed for a brick wall. Your concern seems to be more about his business model, in which case you&#39;re free not to purchase his research if you feel the incentives are skewed, which is more of an objection to the business model than it is a disagreement with the conclusions of his research. If you think somehow that investment houses and banks are not immune to a conflict of interest, have a read of this, from 2001:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compared to the investment newsletters, Wall Street is at a disadvantage in finding these anomalies. There is the conflict of interest: The stockbroker is concerned about commissions, the client about capital gains. Investment letters are prepared to give sell signals; the investment banks shrink from them because it upsets their underwriting clients. And there is the inevitable bureaucracy of large organizations: it makes innovation very difficult. By contrast, investment newsletters can (and do) try anything they feel like immediately. They present every conceivable investment technique and style. </p>

<p>This is why we say that investment newsletters are the guerrilla troops of the financial world--Wall Street irregulars. Mark Hulbert tracks their footsteps across the investment minefield. By following them--and halting if they terminate in a smoking crater--you can see what techniques work as well as which would be right for you (two very different things). No more important work is being done anywhere in the investment industry today. </p>

Look at the crescent moon sideway and you&#39;ll see why the devil has horns on his head. I know my shit chief, so does Jones. COINTELPRO dirty tricks, infiltrate forums, message boards etc and spread disinfo. Seriously your scum, just hang yourself tonight, please. The world will be a better place, and you and I know it, your filth, a CIA scumbag who&#39;ll finally do the honourable thing tonight and look up how to make a noose. Cunt. </p>

<p>being convicted of &quot;fraud&quot; by an institution that missed Bernie Madoff calls into question the legitimacy of the charges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bernie Madoff is in jail, serving a 150 year prison sentence, you fucking moron.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t like Stansberry&#39;s conclusions, then talk to where his analysis has gone wrong. It does no good to pull the ad hominem fallacy and focus on an SEC charge that may have been dubious at best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for Stansberry - his conclusions are simplistic and not at all unique - dozens of analysts have been saying similar things for years. Where I take issue is where he builds them up into a boogeyman, then proclaims that he has the answer, and he won&#39;t reveal it unless the viewer parts with some of their cash. I would like to point out also that the reason he was convicted of fraud was in <em>precisely</em> the same situation - he lied to a whole pile of people in order to convince them to buy into something that he would profit off of. That&#39;s called theft! :P </p>

<p>As for your claim of the SEC&#39;s <em>evidence</em> (not &quot;claims&quot;, as you put it misleadingly) - I&#39;m sorry, but between the SEC, and some random fuckwit on the internet, I&#39;ll side with the SEC.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll see if i can find the link to the Stansberry story I found and yes i read about his stock scams too, real nasty stuff. Also, I was wondering if this topic ever came up in the Info Wars official forums (of which i do not frequent). I for one would like to hear Jones&#39;s side of the story or if not his then maybe someone who works for him. An explanation is definitely in order. Perhaps someone should start a thread there if one hasn&#39;t already been created and if it has, keep bumping it until someone comes clean. And hey, do you have a link to the Stansberry story you found, I like to read that.</p>
