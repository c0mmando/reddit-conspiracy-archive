        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Shortly after 9/11, George W. Bush made the most peculiar statement in an address to the United Nations. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOMKdILRM5I">He said</a></p>

<p>&quot;Never let us tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the eleventh.&quot;</p>

<p>I do not wish to argue about whether or not this was specifically stated for the purpose I&#39;m about to describe; I&#39;m perfectly willing to leave that as an exercise for the commentors (Why say such a thing? What was the purpose of making this statement to the United Nations? It seems very out of place in that moment in time - since there weren&#39;t <strong>yet</strong> any conspiracy theories). I only wish to point out the result that it has had (deliberate or otherwise).</p>

<p>And that result is this: Anyone who objects to being lied to by the government, rather than being labeled a &quot;patriotic protester&quot;, has been pre-defined as &quot;crazy&quot;.</p>

<p>And, this has been extended well beyond the realm of 9/11 into every aspect of in-your-face covert government operations.</p>

<p>So, my point here is this:</p>

<p>Cower in your closets/basements/attics/wherever and let the government silence your dissent, or...</p>

<p>Ignore the labels and seek the truth for yourself. You are not alone in seeking truth and you are not &quot;crazy&quot; for disbelieving lies - especially lies as big as the 9/11 Commission Report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem, I feel, is that even we - the conspiracy nuts - call them &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;. That&#39;s already become shorthand for &quot;crazy idea&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;alternative history&#39; implies that the other stories hold water, when they don&#39;t. We&#39;re not an alternative reality, we&#39;re reality. The problem with the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; is that it&#39;s a non group of ideas - anyone can join in the fun and come up with a conspiracy theory. We&#39;re like anonymous in that sense.</p>

<p>Science has due protocol for new theories, and they are published after peer review. The alternative history, or &#39;free thought&#39; community need to unite under one voice AND one strict policy for offering their conclusions.</p>

<p>This removes the charge that &#39;conspiracy theorists say&#39; because, unless the organised body said it, we didn&#39;t actually say it. Everything else is just useless information anarchy.</p>

<p>We need to get official on their pathetic asses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories are alternative histories until they become mainstream. But my point is that the name &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; immediately results in our points being dismissed. Any other name would be better. </p>

<p>Labeling is critical to communication. You hear &quot;Republican&quot; and you think (if you&#39;re American) of a right wing, conservative politician. In my country (Ireland), the term &quot;Republican&quot; means a violent terrorist. Naming is very important. If we use a name that already means &quot;nutjob theory&quot; to people who hear it then we&#39;re just shooting ourselves in the foot. </p>

<p>I remember very well when he made that statement a little less than a month after the operation, and there where already <em>many</em> theories regarding Sept 11 in full force. As a matter of fact, there were many (myself included) who knew from the moment the planes struck that there was no way it would have been allowed to happen without high level complicity, and we were all pretty vocal about it online.</p>

<p><em>NORAD was unusually prepared on 9/11, because it was conducting a week-long semiannual exercise called Vigilant Guardian.</em></p>

<p><em>On 9/11, North American Aerospace Defense Command&#39;s (Norad) Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) was fully staffed, its key officers and enlisted supervisors already manning the operations center &quot;battle cab.&quot;</em> -Aviation Week</p>

<p>I think those who noticed this amazing &quot;coincidence&quot; knew from Sept 11th on that something was rotten in Denmark, and we bombarded the web, message forums, and usenet making a hell of a spectacle. This is why Bush said what he said to the UN, because the people were starting to see through his bullshit <em>way</em> earlier that he and his bosses had expected.</p>

<p>Just wanted to point that out- that the &quot;theories&quot; have existed since the moment it happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you are saying... that there were suspicious circumstances and questions were being asked (I was even asking them, and I was, at the time, just an avid internet gaming junkie -- in fact, I knew the US would be going back to Iraq when Dubya won the <em>primary</em> - six months before the election, and over a year before 9/11).</p>

<p>That having been said, I think this quote - this statement .. at this particular place and time (the President&#39;s first appearance before the UN immediately following The Event).... is just, in and of itself, suspicious.

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, very interesting theory! If you are correct in your thought that Bush was using actually reverse psychology to get people to look into the matter, one could interpret it as a blackmail situation. The powers that be basically said to him &quot;We are doing this, and there is nothing you can do about it. If you don&#39;t go along with our plan, we will expose you and your family for your past crimes. Your father, being a <a href="http://www.jfkmurdersolved.com/bush.htm">high ranking CIA official</a> at the time of the Kennedy assassination will be exposed as being complicit, and perhaps <a href="http://educate-yourself.org/cn/martinbormannphotostocompare02jul07.shtml">exposed as not being who he says he is</a>, your <a href="http://www.rense.com/general77/acrow.htm">mother as well</a>, and your grandfather will be exposed as a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar">financier of Hitler and the Third Reich</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>If accurate, there can really be only be one explanation of who those &quot;powers that be&quot; that were blackmailing Bush really are, and who <a href="http://theinfounderground.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5367">really perpetrated 9/11</a>.</p>

<p>I will admit, I never really thought of it that way before. Excellent post!</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn&#39;t give Bush credit for it. That&#39;s quite a stretch, considering I don&#39;t think the man&#39;s IQ is above moron. However, I do think it was a premeditated thing... by whoever wrote the speech (Rove with his giant &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot; cranium, perhaps?).</p>

Get ready for an intense, surreal, and disturbing up-close personal experience with the famous taxicab driver Lloyde England who claims the windshield of his cab was speared by a light pole that was allegedly hit by the plane that allegedly hit the Pentagon on 9/11. The physical impossibility of Lloyde&#39;s story is exposed as CIT deconstructs the details and takes a road trip with Lloyde to physically examine the actual cab that he still has preserved under a tarp on his 30 acres of woods in rural Virginia. In light of the now proven approach of the plane on the north side of the former Citgo gas station, proving it was nowhere near the downed light poles, it has become painfully clear why Lloyde&#39;s story doesn&#39;t add up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried that with several other accounts to no avail. Trolls must be called out and exposed or they win. It happens every day on reddit (where there <strong>is no</strong> moral high ground). I made my choice (a willingness to accept the fact that usernames and karma are irrelevant) and stand by it - I refuse to accept the role of &quot;downtrodden&quot;.... to just &quot;roll over and take it&quot; when the trolls and bury brigades make their random appearances to discredit Truth.</p>

<p>I would offer you some background for my unique perspective on this, but inevitably someone would show up just for the sake of characterizing me, based on that info. In summary, however, I learned (the hard way) that &quot;simply accepting that evil exists&quot; and ignoring it (in the hope that it will go away) is lame and stupid. No one should be taught to do that. The true moral high ground is to expose lies, liars, and trolls for what they are, and to refuse to permit their abuse - not to simply &quot;accept it&quot;.</p>

<p>Although I once appreciated your naive idealistic method, I no longer do... because it led me to ruin. I allowed corrupt government officials to walk all over me... to deprive me of my rights... and to reduce me to a mere shell of a man. It wasn&#39;t until I decided to defy abusiveness that I truly came to understand that I have value... and I can be of value to others.</p>

<p>Rose colored glasses make for pretty speeches, but... in the end, they bring about the demise of the naive.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice. But... I&#39;m close enough to death&#39;s door now to understand that my life can either be meaning<strong>ful</strong> or meaning<strong>less</strong>. I choose the former.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time (and concern) to comment here, but... rolling over and taking it (in the poop shoot) isn&#39;t my preferred method of dealing with oppressors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, I&#39;ve already explained this. You are a known troll. Anyone who&#39;s spent more than a few weeks in this subreddit knows this. The scorekeeping works like this.</p>

<p>I have nothing better to do, so I entertain trolls. You are a troll. I entertain you. You, being oblivious to the truth of this situation, are, therefore, losing.</p>

<p>How many accounts do you have on reddit? I&#39;ve never hidden the fact that I use multiple accounts. This one is my &quot;conspiracy&quot; account. I have others that I use for other purposes. This is the one I use to expose corruption and trolls. Another question...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/NotTheRealHortnon">This</a> is not one of my accounts. In fact, I didn&#39;t even know someone had created it (about an hour ago) until I saw their post appear in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>I rest my case (see the original post under which we&#39;re currently commenting).</p>

<p>Game over.</p>

<p>EDIT: I could, comfortably, delete this account now - as I have done with several before, once I achieve a relevant objective. However, I think I may hang on to this one for a while. It has a nice ring to the username. And it hasn&#39;t accumulated as many downvotes as I thought it would when I created it. (Surprisingly, I&#39;m getting ever closer to that precious 300 comment karma threshold... which would allow me to spam... not that I would... but I know that&#39;s the bar to make).</p>

<p>*<em>sigh</em>* Ain&#39;t life full of surprises... I think I&#39;ll just savor this moment for a few hours before making my final decision on this matter. You know... to give you a chance to make a further fool of yourself and stuff.</p>

<p>Off to work now... will be back later to pick up where we left off.</p>
