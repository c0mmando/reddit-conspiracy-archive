       Yes, I have some question. s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see a lot of videos and read a lot of articles or first person accounts from people who claim to have escaped the clutches of the shadow government, or the satanist kabal of the catholic church that seem to end in either a plug for a Hip Hop website, or a with a lot of ultra-Christ worship. I find these ties in UFO videos, FEMA camp websites, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What gives?
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, the African American community is still very much at odds with white America, let's face that. My point being that there are definite divides in culture even though we share so much common time and ground with each other. I guess the same can be said for the Church, especially mega-Churches or sects who share beliefs.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         So do these groups exploit their own people to profit by fostering or creating these conspiracies, or do the conspiracies exist and they are cashing in on them while they can?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What is with the either born-againism, or just puppy-love style worship of Jesus by some of these people who claim to have escaped? (Svali) From a psychological point of view, could it just be a desperate attempt to be closer to the opposite of what she was raised around, if it happened?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'll share my quick views on a few conspiracies:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Shadow government exists. It's called a power structure and it fucking sucks for the majority. Life on planet Earth for the human has not changed much in thousands of years. In the distant past, our leaders were no more educated than the masses, just more publicly ruthless. How things have changed... I think the money game has been perfected, I think the system of slave consumerism and Rhodesian political farce is alive and well in this country, and I think we're only going to transfer from it into a new system of near forced buying, where we have fewer and fewer options if we want to be what we're sold is 'True America.'
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         UFO's, aliens. They're out there. It's just stupid (I love that word, it really means a hell of a lot when said with the right inflection) to assume we are alone. Amateur astronomers can see distant, distant shit. Though I think the possibility of them visiting us is slim, I do not rule it out. I would have to assume someone I admire, Carl Sagan, lied to us all by withholding evidence of life out there, and he is someone who would know. I think it's more likely that we have life forms that are earth bound and native that we may just be discovering for the first time, or are just now making their presence known. The earth is is still very much unexplored and the oceans could be home to things that blow our entire view of aliens away.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The coelacanth was probably just hidden from white people because it's delicious.

       I consider myself a realist about what happens on reddit, but this may not suit your definition of "grounded".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's start with your inquiry about religion, Jesus, and being 'born again'. As near as I can tell, "the church" (institutionalized religion) has never had a low, so low that they wouldn't stoop to it. As such, it wouldn't surprise me if, at some low level, they're influencing/supporting specific ideologies of recruitment.
      </p>
      <p>
       That having been said, I'm probably one of those people you would categorize into the niche you've described, because: I believe that one's relationship with Jesus/God/The Universe is a personal one and shouldn't be dictated to you by any institution, but also that such relationships have personal value and meaning, and that they shouldn't be ignored. I've written about this numerous times in the past under various usernames, the first of which was
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/AmIsGod">
        AmIsGod
       </a>
       , wherein I abandoned that account when I felt I had completely delivered the appropriate message (that you have, within you, the power of God - the power to assert your own essence of being - that "god power" which exists within you).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, though, I also believe that institutionalized religion is simply another means of social control (all institutions are this, whether they be religious, governmental, or clique-clubs such as Freemasonry and/or the Bilderbergers), and that they are all owned, lock, stock, and barrel, by the international banksters.
      </p>
      <p>
       My greatest international interest, at this point, is how China (and its allies) will play against the Rothschild family banking cartel. This one is only now beginning to get interesting (I didn't think I would actually live to see it, so it is very exciting to me, in a perverse 'better late than never' sort of way).
      </p>
      <p>
       For every cult-like ideology, there will be dozens of self-proclaimed cult leaders. Recently, a small handful of people have even attempted to label me as such a person. This is truly bizarre for the simple fact that I have no desire to be such a person - my only desire has been to free peoples' minds from the dumbing-down that mainstream media (TV) has imparted upon them (one of my close friends calls his television set "the intelligence leveler" -- it puts everyone on the same level of stupidity). I simply want to encourage people to look into those things which these institutions of control are attempting to discourage/forbid. If that makes me a "leader", oh well... it's not something I was aspiring toward, it is something being imposed upon me. DISCLAIMER: If "leading by example" makes me a leader, so be it - I confess.

      <p>
       This certainly describes my perspective of "born again atheists" over in r/atheism, that subreddit which espouses an ideology nearly identical to Judaism (i.e., my belief makes me superior to you).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the African American references, I'm probably the least qualified person on the planet to discuss this. I have three nieces (white, blonde, blue-eyed) married to black men, with offspring from those unions. I love my nieces, I like their husbands, and I dearly love their children. This, however, has made me an outcast among the racial purists, who claim my nieces have insulted 10,000 years of racial purity of my ancestry - to which I can only respond 'whatever' (I treat every individual as a new, fresh instance of potential friendship - take it or leave it. As Socrates/Plato said/wrote, 'a friend is simply a single soul dwelling in two bodies'.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonetheless, I do see the signs of ongoing division (ala those racial purists)  on both sides of this black/white divide. From where I stand, there's only one race - the human race. As an individual, I find all racial/ethnic slurs mildly offensive (I say mildly, because they're just words - it's the intent of the person using them which I find disturbing).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my "grounded" perspective.

       I could not agree more with that. I have been guilty of such crimes and have struggled with balancing being vocal against what I believe is wrong and allowing others to live as they see fit. Socrates might grumble with me slightly on that one though, it's hard to tell as all we have are thousands of years of interpretation. Live and let live works for those who are empathetic of their own actions, not selfish of them. But hey, life to me is about at least constant contemplation, so
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       harm is caused and corrected, I can't complain too much about people's actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it's a black/ white divide or simply brother v. brother at this point, everyone v. everyone? I grew up in a multicultural urban environment with friends of all creeds and colors, but I sometimes wonder if things have reverted, only because I don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       What history do you know of the banking cartel prior to and after the fall of the Roman Empire? The Roman's took a high road in deciding money was the root of all evil, and the Jewish people of the time basically took over that racket. Am I remembering history incorrectly? People at that point were probably more than happy to adhere to their system, just as they were after the collapse in the 20's.

       Yes, to all three. And, no, I'm not trying to be funny. I believe the current state of information warfare in the world has reached a point in which it is basically the banksters vs. everyone... and the way they play dirty is to create division (the abortion debate, immigration debate, etc.) - to keep everyone debating issues which are readily personalizable (I just made that word up, I hope you understand what it means) and highly inflated. I don't mean to downplay these issues; rather, I'm pointing to the fact that they are
       <em>
        maintained
       </em>
       as unresolved... to keep the divisiveness an ongoing tool. The point: As long as we're all fighting each other, we won't be fighting the banksters.

       I've known about divide and conquer since I was young, though I always looked at the political landscape as where the corruption lied. Only over the years since 9/11, when shit really started to either add up or not for people in this country, have I realized our system is the garden and the international regime of lucky 'got-here-first' inbreds are the soil. Besides communism and Islam, what rivals do the banksters have internationally?
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm assuming this video will explain the politics, but maybe it gets into what I just asked. Now, brass tacks. Who's giving the orders from the 5th dimension? During a vision of my own my reality split in geometric shapes, like the tiles flipping over on an advertising board to a new image and I was beckoned to the abyss that was pulsing between and beyond them. I was told I would be told everything. That was some trippy shit. So, can I assume there are malevolent beings and benevolent beings and possibly possessing us like other people have mentioned here? What do you think? I'm enjoying this exchange. I'm late 20's by the way, and usually high as shit when I surf reddit. So please excuse grammar, candor, and tangents. If I'm naive about anything it's because I've been doing other stuff too, ha ha.

       First, let us come to an understanding of what a being is. We'll start with a thorough
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being">
        definition of being from wikipedia
       </a>
       , accompanied by a complete conjugation of the word
       <a href="http://www.verb2verbe.com/conjugation/english-verb/be.aspx">
        be
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I will now summarise, in my own words, what all of that means (to me, at least). Being is that quality of assertable self-awareness which allows one to be not only aware of one's own self, but also to be aware of other beings like oneself. I am not talking about 'mind' (as in the ability to utilize advanced reasoning techniques). Rather, I'm talking only about the ability to be aware of one's own awareness... as well as to be aware of other such 'aware entities'. And, further, to be able to assert this overall awareness unto other beings. This is what constitutes a 'being'. (i.e., I not only exist; I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       .) I could write volumes on this topic alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, just for the sake of being clear about the significance of this word/concept (being), let's now briefly glance at monotheistic religion. The 'big four' monotheistic religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism) all define their 'God' as this exact thing: Being. For specific reference, look to Exodus 3:14, wherein "The Lord" identifies itself by name unto Moses, saying its name as "YHWH", which is technically four separate concepts/words which translate literally as "I being [&lt;--] that being.", and further instructs Moses to tell them "I AM has sent you." Additionally, there are other scriptural references which make this absolutely clear that this is, indeed, "God" (uppercase) - e.g., It is written 'You are gods.' (lowercase; i.e., You are
       <em>
        beings
       </em>
       .) Christianity, Islam, and Judaism share this concept (The Being) more clearly than Taoism, but Taoism isn't all that different. "The Tao" translates literally as "The Way (of Being)". And, furthermore, if one steps back from the detailed inspection of tiny quotations of scripture and looks at the stories and story morals, it becomes even more clear that this notion of "calling upon the name of The Lord" is truly self-assertion (to assert one's essence of being) - Three readily identifiable examples: David did this when he felled Goliath, Samson did this when he tore down the pillars of the temple. Ester and her husband did this when they prevented the slaughter of the Hebrews (Ester when she entered the temple without an invitation, and her husband when he prevented her execution for said transgression).
      </p>
      <p>
       And, lastly, just to clarify the profound significance of this, let us look briefly unto Plato. Plato tells us that, for all things/concepts, there is a pure
       <em>
        form
       </em>
       of that thing/concept. This form exists, not as a tangible, empirically measurable thing, but it exists nonetheless; because, without these forms -- these defining concepts -- we would all just be babbling gibberish unto one another. Thus, there is a "form of being" - and this -- the pure form essence of what it actually means "to be" -- this is GOD. And, this is a very POWERFUL thing to KNOW. Thus, why it is cautioned in the Bible (ref: the 10 commandments) to not call upon the name of God out of vanity (or, not to misuse [one's knowledge of] God's name)... thus, bringing us to this concept of "good and evil", and the answer to your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are, indeed, benevolent/malevolent beings... because people are beings and it is quite apparent that there are benevolent and malevolent people (beings).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the second half of your question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        possibly possessing us like other people have mentioned here?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm going to say outright "no", but now I'm going to qualify that and say ...
      </p>
      <p>
       There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       benevolent and malevolent
       <em>
        forces
       </em>
       in the world which can possess a person/being. The malevolent forces are called "sin" in Christianity (lust, greed, sloth, etc.). But, it really comes back to understanding what a 'being' is... and understandig that
       <em>
        you are one
       </em>
       . And, specifically, there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a very real thing called "personal accountability". In the US Legal System, there is a notion of "not guilty by reason of insanity" - this concept is, in and of itself, a voluntary punishment in that one is taking responsibility for one's irresponsibility. We've all experienced this at some point or other and to greater/lesser degrees of significance (the lesser versions being 'brain farts', the greater versions resulting in therapy... or worse). So, to review/restate/summarize my answer to this second half of your question, I say...
      </p>
      <p>
       No, there are no
       <em>
        beings
       </em>
       which "possess people", because people, themselves, are the beings; and they can be, themselves, benevolent or malevolent. Yet, also, there are benevolent/malevolent
       <em>
        forces
       </em>
       in the world such as altruism (benevolent) which provides good unto the world at no expense to the world or anyone in it, and stupidity/denial/selfishness (malevolent) which may provide some good unto the world but at a cost to someone/everyone and which is self-serving (Ayn Rand, real name Alisa Rosenbaum, is a self-confessed proponent of this, especially in the form of self-serving greed as a measure of a successful life). People become 'possessed' by things such as greed (money/mammon), lust/covetousness (constant desire for that which someone else has), and addiction (meth addicts are "possessed" by their addiction, for example).
      </p>
      <p>
       And, my final notes on this specific topic pertain to hallucination. Certain situations can cause 'false impressions' to be implanted upon one's consciousness. LSD is notorious for this... the "memories" of a false impression are just as real as the memories of any other experience, except that the experience of the former didn't exactly happen as remembered. The stereotypical example is that of "seeing the walls melt" or whatever. I guarantee that, for those who have seen/sensed this while tripping on LSD, the
       <em>
        memory
       </em>
       of it is as real as any other memory (their first kiss or whatever), but
       <em>
        the event being remembered never happened
       </em>
       . The mind/brain (to which is attached the self-awareness) is a tricky and often misinterpreted thing, which we may never fully understand. Thus, I am quite comfortable understanding when someone says "it was real! I saw it!" about something that may not have actually happened (e.g., I have memories of dreams that were as real as a kick in the nuts -- but they were just dreams, not corporeal, empirically measurable/recordable events).
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that having been said, I'll finish with this...
      </p>
      <p>
       This comment does not do justice to your question. To fully be able to answer your question, I would have to add (to my BA in Philosophy) a Masters in Psychology and a PhD in some topic that probably doesn't have course offerings (like: how to understand life, the universe, and everything [reality or otherwise])... and then transcend all of that and become God (not just 'a god').

       I am an athiest and I have an interest in UFOs, deep politics/reality politics, and conspiracy related stuff. I have tracked Christian sects that deal in deep politics and conspiracy just because they had information that wasn't hitting the frontpage or getting traction else where.

       I think that you have to weigh all news sources from a wide spectrum of sources to get a full view of things. Reading news shouldn't be a passive activity the value comes in the interpretation and analysis. I take news in from the internet, NYT, Harpers, Hustler and the Enquirer. They all break news and report factual information. The less mainstrean the publication the less likely its goverment propagada or echo chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that the naive single dimensional government and history that is taught in school gives ministers a lever with which they can establish authority in their parishes because its easy to refute what is taught in school and by society at large and set your self up as the source of straight facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read any John Henrick Clarke or Ray Haygins they are good for opening up the mind concerning ancient history and religion.

       Thanks. I haven't read them, but I'd like to. You seem like myself in knowing that you really can't take anyone's word for shit, you have to piece ideas together. I could go on and on about the school system. It's a recruiting mission on a national level for everything that helps the few lucky elite. Recommend a book or two, I'll tell you you're awesome for doing so.

      <p>
       John Henrik Clark is what he is, a black man who grew up when Jim Crow was still in full effect  Who questioned the society around him and educated himself. He may come off a little bitter or racist in some of the other interviews you see him in but I take it in perspective. He has influenced my views on Christianity greatly.

       As for good reads I like Thomas Pain, and Asimov for Science, History and Speculative fiction.
I have also read or watched alot of stuff from people you have probably heard of, Webster Tarpley Alex Jones, Howard Zinn. But my education is broader than just those folk, I recommended reading far and wide and not turning a deaf ear to people that you don't like some times they can present  a perspective you would otherwise never get.

       The thing is with Jesus is that (as far as I can work out) he is real. Everyone from Osho to Eckhart Tolle refers to his teachings; and the Romans used to put Christian's to death - even before the Roman Catholic church began... so there has to be something to it. Also, it appears that Christ is a force for good and manifests in all dimensions. It also appears that evil spirits are scared of him. To manifest his power though, you must believe in him. (impossible to prove, I know, sorry.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is with Satanism is that it is real too. Very powerful people are involved in satanism. This fact is very well hidden. I think Bohemian Grove is as far as we have gotten to proving the reality of Satanism at the highest levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people are involved in a satanic cult, they are usually possessed, by interdimensional/demonic/alien/whatever entities. Also, they are often mind controlled on various levels (for instance through fear and threats). For some people, the only way they can escape satanic cults is by "finding" Jesus, and surrendering themselves to belief and trust in him. This way they can find the spiritual authority and strength to leave the cult. This will often mean getting involved with some wacky Christian organization. It doesn't mean Christianity is necessarily bad, but Christians, like all humans, are a little crazy. The thing is with Christians is that they do not care how crazy you think they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possession is not a new concept, it is old and crosses over many cultures. Many 'scientific' people don't believe in it, but it is too well documented to really ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if this sounds grounded, but I've been looking into this a lot and this is where I've gotten. Of course, I could be wrong, but the above is my belief framework and it seems to work well for me right now... You might want to google Ted Gunderson to get started on researching some of this, but there is so much more and it can be very disturbing and sad because it involves the torture and ritual sacrifice of very young children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and 'aliens' are probably interdimensional beings as far as I can gather... a lot of them anyway... which means that they would not necessarily have to come from far away... they could already be in the room with you. Perhaps what science calls 'Dark Matter' is other dimensions occupying the same space as ours...

       hey. I've seen you post for a while and this is the first time I've seen you concede that Jesus may well be legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I happen to be a Christian. Evaluating Christianity can be very confusing because all kinds of people with all different beliefs and priorities who all employ different manners of self-justification for different reasons all conveniently insist on being identified by the same labels. I, personally, consider many self-professed Christians very dishonest and very poorly representative of Christ whilst also believing and considering important some of the most outrageous claims of the Bible, which many would prefer to ignore or reinterpret. What I have seen as a result of taking these positions is I am chided, disregarded, and dissociated from almost unanimously by all purported Christians I reveal my disposition to. This has served to further evidence to me that the true merit of a belief in Christ should in no way be evaluated by proxy through the conduct of its alleged mouthpieces. In many circumstances, the two aren't even related at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't intend to go overboard with my assertions beyond providing a personal testimony that the
       <em>
        mainstream
       </em>
       Christianity you see, which is a lot of nonsense, is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       grounds to dismiss the Bible, which I am absolutely convinced is not just good teaching, not simply divinely inspired, but a
       <em>
        sincerely magical relic
       </em>
       through which God is
       <em>
        objectively
       </em>
       revealed. I don't want to preach or jump down your throat because, first of all, I know a lot of it can be obnoxious, and second, I can already tell by your post and by your willingness to realistically consider such subject matter you are sincerely interested in what is true and do not require I hold your hand. I only mean to direct you to the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, after that little outburst I doubt you'll be hearing much more like that out of me, but feel free to bring some shit up if you want to talk on some common ground or whatever; it's hard to find people willing to go way out there.

       I am not in a position to talk authoritatively about the bible and Christianity, although I did grow up as a Catholic years ago, which was not very inspiring for me personally. Lately, I'm starting to revisit the whole Jesus topic with a new perspective. I now look at Jesus Christ as a metaphysical entity; perhaps as a face of God, but I'm not sure; certainly as an agent of God at least. And a force for good (whatever that is).
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently I am unsure as to the validity of anything in the bible (I'm not 100% clear on who decided what went into the bible), but I have recently started to listen to some biblical interpretations that I have found interesting, and I have started to realize that there is a far greater depth to the bible than I would ever be able to explore in one lifetime. You describe it as a 'magical relic' which I'm beginning to think it is. The teachings of Jesus are especially significant to me personally, but beyond that there seems to be a lot of hidden world history and a lot of hidden knowledge (especially in the old testament). I think the full meaning of the document is beyond the ability of our minds to fully comprehend... I don't know even if it was truly meant for us. What I have been finding interesting lately is that where conspiracy theories meet the metaphysical, all these Christians start cropping up talking about some really interesting stuff... I've learned not to be too dismissive of Christians, even if I don't agree with them in general on certain issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, it is all a bit of a mystery to me still at the moment. I think it is likely to stay that way, but if you have any interesting links or insights then I'm open. I pretty much agree with/sympathize with what you are saying, and I'm sure we can find a lot of points of agreement between us.

       The thing is, possession is not well documented. It's well speculated. Demonic possession is a total farce in my opinion. I refuse to believe that inter-dimensional beings would 'fuck' with us. If we are to believe we are lesser beings than others that exist, what benefit do they get from us by simply scaring other people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that possession seems to happen in trailer parks, or to people with histories of meth use, and trans-dimensional body-snatching happens to politicians? Something doesn't add up for me there.
      </p>

       I feel like I'm getting painted into a corner with Hidden Hand's explanation.

       Possession really does span many faiths and cultures. Sometimes it's revered and sometimes it's something to be exorcised, but in any case, if you're to believe the masses it does exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's begin with something. Do you believe in the concept of a soul?
      </p>
      <p>
       (for what it's worth, if it makes my opinion credible, I am not of a religious denomination, am pretty skeptical about most things, and am somewhat well-read about certain things. Also my friends think I am both smart AND pretty.)

       Before I can say whether or not I believe in a soul, I would have to ask you to define what you mean by that word so as not to cause confusion.

       I'm always suspicious of anyone who says they have all the answers; but there are still a lot of unanswered questions. I obviously have beliefs that you don't, although I probably had pretty much the same views as you have before I took the plunge and started really looking into the metaphysical. But my beliefs change over time; it's more interesting to keep an open mind. No condemnation without investigation.

       From what I have gathered, the foundations, and I mean the ORIGINAL (13,000+ years ago) foundations, of most religions is rooted in something real.  The idea that we are all one, and that our differences are something to be embraced rather than disgraced. Obviously, over the millenia, these original truths have been distorted and skewed to such an extreme that members of the modern religions are either casual, meaning they support the religion, but don't necessarily follow the book tooth-and-nail, or zealots.  This, is all a part of the power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those in the know, or those often referred to as "The Powers that Be" use religion as a tool to keep us from realizing our unity, rather than it's original intention to bring us together.  This is how money is made, as war is easily the most profitable activity that we take part in as humans.  But it's only profitable for those "powers that be."  The rest of humanity, meanwhile, continuously gets the shit end of the stick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it's important to realize at this time that many of the priests, nuns, monks, etc, are very much unaware of this.  The only people who truly know the reasons behind the whole orchestrated world we live in are those at the very top.  Peter Hans Kolvenbach, for example, is the self-proclaimed "Black Pope" and is believed to be the kingpin of everything.  And I mean everything.  From CIA to KGB to M16 to NSA to the Catholic Church to the Black Budget.  You name it, this guy has had his hand in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I can't state that last bit with any certainty.  While it's intriguing to believe that a single person is behind the entire cabal, I feel there must be something more to it.  I therefore don't necessarily "believe" that Kolvenbach is the head honcho, it's an interesting path to follow and observe.  There is a lot of info on the net about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I would recommend is to check out DivineCosmos.com, a site run by David Wilcock.  He has some interesting ideas that attempt to bridge the gap between science and spirituality, and I must say that a lot of his information is quite interesting and worth the read.

       Yes, to all three. And, no, I'm not trying to be funny. I believe the current state of information warfare in the world has reached a point in which it is basically the banksters vs. everyone... and the way they play dirty is to create division (the abortion debate, immigration debate, etc.) - to keep everyone debating issues which are readily personalizable (I just made that word up, I hope you understand what it means) and highly inflated. I don't mean to downplay these issues; rather, I'm pointing to the fact that they are
       <em>
        maintained
       </em>
       as unresolved... to keep the divisiveness an ongoing tool. The point: As long as we're all fighting each other, we won't be fighting the banksters.
