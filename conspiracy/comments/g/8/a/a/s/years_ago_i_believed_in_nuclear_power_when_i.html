       the "actual numbers" HA! As if the deaths from nuclear, many of which happen years later and are completely untraceable (because they look like average, run-of-the-mill cancer and disease cases) could possibly be tracked. The numbers from this website probably also use the LOW Chernobyl Numbers. Anyone who has watched the independent PBS documentary on Chernobyl knows how bad the situation really was. Probably at least 40,000 dead. Some say up to a million, but I know those numbers are debated, even to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Land uninhabitable for hundreds of years around the plant. NOBODY lives in Pripyat anymore. A town of 43,000 people completely destroyed!
-Kids with massive deformities (missing arms, legs, thryorid cancer)
-Contaminated land from the UK to Corsica to France and Germany
-Contaminated ground water
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not only the human toll that is the problem. It is the economic and social toll.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Farms forced to shut down. 
-Massive costs for ongoing monitoring and testing. 
-$18 BILLION in cleanup costs for Chernobyl alone. 
-A sarcophagus that is having to be replaced for a billion dollars. 
-The cost, danger and uncertainty associated with dealing with spent fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it also doesn't address how many accidents have happened over the years and how many were covered up. For anyone interested, here is a list of accidents around the world from the 1950s forward:

       This info blew my mind. There are that many reactors going right now.  I think a little perspective on the scale vs the reactor problems.

      <p>
       The new technology in nuclear power is looking very cool.  dramatic reduction in potential for catastrophe and cheaper/cleaner to boot.

       What are the best options. I think it's solar, wind and water. next would have to be nuclear.  WTF with coal... stop using that. It's awful on a lot of levels.

       The other way to go after your first sentence is .... keep researching until we can develop small, safe, solid state nuclear to electricity tech.  Steam engines with nuclear fire is just way too messy.  Keep it on the drawing board until nobody without a phd equivalent education can comprehend how the magic gets from the atom to the toaster.

       nuclear is awesome, just dont build it in 2nd world countries that are on a fault line and are historically earthquake prone, by that i mean the russia take down that plant in armenia, im scared for my country, we are much more careless than the japanese, we are poorer, its not near an ocean , its built for a 9.0 earthquake and will be closed soon but a new one might be built

       I used to belive in nuclear energy when I thought the buildings &amp; equipment were well designed.

       After a 40 year old reactor survived japans two biggest natural disasters, much more than they were ever designed for I don't know what to think.

       I like how you think it is a "triumph" when 3 buildings explode, fuel rods are exposed to the air, dozens of workers are heavily contaminated with radiation, numerous fires are started and then extinguished, people are having to ingest iodide pills, cows milk, spinach, beans and now sea water are contaminated, iodine is found in the tap water of a city of 35 million people over 100 miles away, AND the plant is permanently ruined.

       What we need is a different type of nuclear reactor, one less prone to catastrophic failure. But now is not the time to turn away from nuclear energy.

       Solar is many decades away from being ready to power the world. It's okay for rooftop solar projects and self-supply, but it's too inefficient and expensive to power an industrialised nation right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day we'll be able to effectively harness solar energy and transport it cheaply, and that will be fantastic and will do away with nuclear and coal fired power plants, but until then we shouldn't just settle for coal when nuclear power is vastly superior.

       Solar is already competitive with coal.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the development of plastic and dye based cells it is projected to get cheaper.

       The link you provided quotes solar at around 15c/kwh, which is about three or four times more expensive than coal energy. In no sense is that competitive.

       Sorry zhivago, I was basing my figures on the cost of coal-fired power in Australia (where I'm from) because I'm most familiar with those figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, coal energy comes at a cost of roughly 3c/kwh and solar is nowhere near that price, but I stand corrected regarding international prices.
