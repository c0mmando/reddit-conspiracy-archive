    <div class="md"><p>the &quot;actual numbers&quot; HA! As if the deaths from nuclear, many of which happen years later and are completely untraceable (because they look like average, run-of-the-mill cancer and disease cases) could possibly be tracked. The numbers from this website probably also use the LOW Chernobyl Numbers. Anyone who has watched the independent PBS documentary on Chernobyl knows how bad the situation really was. Probably at least 40,000 dead. Some say up to a million, but I know those numbers are debated, even to this day.</p>

<p>-Land uninhabitable for hundreds of years around the plant. NOBODY lives in Pripyat anymore. A town of 43,000 people completely destroyed!
-Kids with massive deformities (missing arms, legs, thryorid cancer)
-Contaminated land from the UK to Corsica to France and Germany
-Contaminated ground water</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not only the human toll that is the problem. It is the economic and social toll. </p>

<p>-Farms forced to shut down. 
-Massive costs for ongoing monitoring and testing. 
-$18 BILLION in cleanup costs for Chernobyl alone. 
-A sarcophagus that is having to be replaced for a billion dollars. 
-The cost, danger and uncertainty associated with dealing with spent fuel. </p>

<p>And it also doesn&#39;t address how many accidents have happened over the years and how many were covered up. For anyone interested, here is a list of accidents around the world from the 1950s forward:</p>

<p>This info blew my mind. There are that many reactors going right now.  I think a little perspective on the scale vs the reactor problems.  </p>

<p>The new technology in nuclear power is looking very cool.  dramatic reduction in potential for catastrophe and cheaper/cleaner to boot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/348/">http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/348/</a></p>

<p>What are the best options. I think it&#39;s solar, wind and water. next would have to be nuclear.  WTF with coal... stop using that. It&#39;s awful on a lot of levels.</p>
