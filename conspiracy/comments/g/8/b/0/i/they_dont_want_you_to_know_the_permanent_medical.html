       The issue isn't the panels, its the batteries. You know a power plant will produce a certain amount of power as well as being able to raise or lower the output. Solar does not have these luxuries. You therefore need power storage to over the downtime and provide for peaks. It's these bits that currently scupper solar as a supply backbone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern nuclear designs are also a LOT better than old ones. The ones we have right now were mostly designed to produce plutonium for bombs. The power output was a useful by-product. The newer designs are almost totally fail-safe. They are also capable using long lifespan nuclear waste as a few source. In effect they eat the waste from the older ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the battery situation improves, then solar and wind become far more viable on a large scale. Until then, it will continue to be an issue.

       you only need to replace the nuclear plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also solar panels peak output at mid day which is typically the highest demand time so you need less storage to provide for surges.
furthermore batteries aren't even the most effective means for supply storage.
compressed gas storage, liquefied air (which is 70% efficient) and many other alternatives work great but batteries are cheap and easy for home use.

       So when you have a week of excessively cloudy days? A long cold dull winter where lots of people are putting on heating?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are aware that they have to bring entire power stations online based on the TV schedules? Everyone gets up at the adverts and puts the kettle on.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for power storage, we have very little in the way of large scale options which aren't hideously dangerous or damaging in their own right. Can you imagine the damage with a compressed gas system big enough to provide power to a city ruptured? There is almost no inherent stability to the storage mediums.
      </p>
      <p>
       Batteries on the other hand have minimal capacity, short lifespans, are highly toxic and the materials to make them are limited. However they are the only thing ready for large scale roll out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong. I'd love to see large scale usage of renewables, but most of them have a lot of new and unsolved issues. Nuclear on the other hand, can compliment renewables, while clearing up the mess it made previously when the military had control of it.

       But you're forgetting the big disadvantage of solar panels.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they reach the end of their lives you can just dump them, just about anywhere. Where's the fun in that? At least with nuclear you get to bury the waste material underground for half a million years, which is far more exciting. Our descendants will surely thank us for bequeathing them such a fine legacy.

       Wind, solar and wave (tidal power)  please don't try to tell a rational person that the wind, and water only work when the sun is out.  If we took, for instance, half of what we spend on war, it says here that we have enough power from those sources in less than twenty years, and have created millions of jobs in the meantime.

       Nuclear power is the STUPIDEST form of power ever conceived and exists only by the mechanical efforts of men driven by greed and lust.

       The 20% of power generated by nuclear fission in the US can be taken offline in one swoop by getting rid of the televisions.
