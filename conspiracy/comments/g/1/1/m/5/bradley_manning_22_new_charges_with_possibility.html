        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is my recurring &quot;hunch&quot; when I encounter information regarding Bradley Manning. I sometimes wonder if he&#39;s a real person. I wonder if he&#39;s a complete digital fabrication and not a real person <em>at all</em>. Then I wonder... If he <em>is</em> a real person I don&#39;t think he leaked information, but perhaps a soldier following orders to be portrayed in the media as such. The question may arise to you &quot;Why&quot; do I (the poster) think this?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve not seen any video of Manning speaking or doing anything. I&#39;ve also not seen many photos of Manning. A 23 year old (born in 1987) should have hundreds of photos of himself in his own, his friends, and his families cameras and computers. </p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mQF2YdqK78">news report</a> prompted me to write this. The interviewer didn&#39;t ask &quot;How did you come to know Manning?&quot;, it&#39;s simply stated that Bradley Manning and this guy &quot;David House&quot; are friends. </p>

<p>Where are Bradley Manning&#39;s parents? Do they not care?
Where are his ex-girlfriends, or ex-boyfriends?
Where are his friends? 
Why have we not seen any video footage of Bradley Manning?</p>

<p>Here is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Manning">Manning&#39;s Wikipedia page</a> </p>

<p>If I&#39;m totally mistaken, fine, good even. But, I won&#39;t ignore my intuition for fear of being totally, or partially inaccurate.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, same here. The whole thing just doesn&#39;t feel right. I think after their success with &quot;Al-Qaida&quot;, the CIA decided to create another phantom organization... Wikileaks, whose chief purpose is to discredit US&#39;s enemies, act as a third party confirmation of US propaganda and make you feel like someone out there is doing something so you don&#39;t have to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Where are his parents&quot; has been the first and foremost question running through my mind.  His camp has been eerily quiet save for a few &quot;friends&quot; that get to visit once in a while. OP you raise a most excellent and VERY probable theory on the matter.  Damn!  Can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t think of it myself!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree you have some vaild points, but I have to ask the question. IF he was a fabrication... Didn&#39;t the whole plan backfire? Plus, if that were the case, don&#39;t you think the Gov would have made a more solid case to have him persecuted and demonize him as a traitor? I dunno, I don&#39;t see how this all worked in anybody&#39;s favor, except for the people finding out whats going on behind closed doors.</p>

<p>But you are completely right... You would think that his parents would be on TV giving statements on how he loved his country and he did this because he loved his country, and he&#39;s a great soldier that should be released... Hell, nobody from his personal life has stood up and said anything at all... That is very questionable to say the least.</p>

<p>But, knowing the internet, with in the next 24 hours, Mom and Pops Bradley are probably going to receive a thousand pizzas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although not totally mistaken about your premise that Manning doesn&#39;t exist (or is a contrived posterboy), you posted the wrong link.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman">Here</a> is Manning&#39;s Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>FTA:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was a face that didn&#39;t have a care in the world, except mischief,&quot; recalled Kurtzman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They had a model, they found a face that fit it, and they&#39;re playing public sentiment like a haarp.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wonder if he&#39;s a complete digital fabrication and not a real person <em>at all</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s definitely a key element in the fearmongering campaign (the seemingly harmless and endearing boy-next-door pranksters are a national security threat).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quick search on Google and I found 4 different photos of &quot;bradley manning&quot;. now this doesn&#39;t prove that he is or isnt a real person in the way you&#39;re describing it. However these photos do prove that the person we&#39;re seeing in the photos labeled &quot;bradley manning&quot; is absolutely a real person. we are seeing many different photos of this same person and he has the exact same facial features (blue eyes, short blonde hair, cranial structure, larger ears...)</p>
