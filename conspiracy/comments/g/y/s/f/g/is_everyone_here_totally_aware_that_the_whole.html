       People don't seem to understand that this is a planned distraction. American politics is a fucking soap opera of bullshit. Whilst you're arguing about birth certificates Obama continues to work for his masters and Trump is only too willing to play his part in this fucking pantomime. This birther debate is leading you on a wild goose chase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me make it really clear for you......
      </p>
      <p>
       America as you know it is
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       finished, there will be an unimaginable drop in the standard of living for ordinary Americans. At best you'll come out of this as a 2nd world country but at least by then you'll have settled Obama's origin. You don't deserve it fucktards but you're so easily distracted.

       "Second World" refers to the former communist-socialist, industrial states, (formerly the Eastern bloc, the territory and sphere of influence of the Union of Soviet Socialists Republic) today: Russia, Eastern Europe (e.g., Poland) and some of the Turk States (e.g., Kazakhstan) as well as China.

       You mean "referred-to", as in past-tense; China is no longer a "second" nor is the better part of the E Bloc - you seem to be reading and citing Political History from 30 y/o texts.

       There are a lot of fake conspiracy theories. Sometimes I think they are deliberately created to muddy the waters, and divert attention away from real conspiracies. After all, the more conspiracies floating around out there, the less likely the true conspiracies are to be noticed, or taken seriously. So we have all these people fluttering around about Obama's birth certificate, yet almost nobody worrying about the occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq, and why they even exist.

       Global warming conspiracy is pro-coal astroturfing propagated in part by infiltrated conspiracy sites such as rense.com by the right.

      <p>
       Like the birther frenzy, the least common denominator of the population was targeted with baseless bullshit and the result is delayed action against global warming and further denigration of the legitimacy of "conspiracy theories" in the mind of the general public.

       For the sake of clarity, I'm going to deconstruct your comment.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Global warming conspiracy is pro-coal astroturfing...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       By 'Global warming conspiracy' you appear to be suggesting that you believe global warming is a scientifically supported theory that links the man-made production of 'greenhouse gases' to an increase in global temperatures and resulting unpredictable changes in our climate. As a result, those that challenge this establish theory (the pro-coal lobby) are perpetuating a 'conspiracy' that this is a hoax. They use 'astroturfing' to generate artificial public support for this 'conspiracy' in an attempt to artificially sway public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is what you mean, we are in full agreement.

       You can copy the pdf from the white house site and open it in paint and see for yourself. I got flamed like hell in another thread for doing this, yet I opened pdf images in paint all the time when I worked in the mortgage industry (images from appraisals that I wanted to extract without printing out all the pages). Just to be clear, I dont give a fuck where he was born or even whether he is eligible or not - he's just another President paid for and installed by the same corporate establishment that put in Bush, Clinton, etc. What gets me is that the CIA would know for sure if he was born in another country, and if they wanted to, they could readily forge whatever documents were necessary and could have squashed this long ago - if they wanted to. They had to know that releasing this "document" in the state that it is in would only create more discussion on the matter; and that is the point here I guess. It is an issue because
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       want it to be.

       The more that I look into it the more that it seems to be a psyop about a conspiracy.  Inserting a ruler not born in the nation would be a great way to signal that the people have been completely subjugated.  Then they have put it in our face in a way that creates division.

       According to
       <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/obamathelovechild.php">
        this theory
       </a>
       the whole "Kenya" thing is a distraction anyway. WRH thinks the real babydaddy was an American and this new "birth certificate" is just a rehash of what Hawaii's put out in the past.

        Look carefully at the bottom. What you are seeing is a certified copy made just a few days ago. There is a date stamp from April 25th 2011 on it. See that phrase, "I certify this is a true copy OR ABSTRACT OF THE RECORD ON FILE?" An abstract means that the current registrar just made a hand copy of the exact same information seen in the computer-generated record Obama already released, then certified it as an exact same copy of the computer-generated record Obama already released. There is nothing new here. There is nothing to suggest that this document was was actually created in 1961.

        Kenya (listed as Obama's father's nation of birth)
        <em>
         wasn't called Kenya in 1961. It was the British East Africa Protectorate. It was not known as "Kenya" until 1963.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1961, the hospital Obama was born in was NOT named the Kapiolani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital , as shown on the above certificate. In 1961, the hospital Obama was born in was named the Kauaikeolani Children's Hospital. It did not change its name to the Kapiolani Maternity &amp; Gynecological Hospital until it merged with the Kapiolani hospital system in 1978.

       B.Obama was born in Russia.  He is a splinter cell working with the Greys to make a single world government.  Also, if you can get your hands on the surveillance tapes form the WTC you will see him going in to a janitor supply closet dressed in a Molly Maids outfit and carrying a backpack full of explosives.
