<p>edit: Ok, can someone explain to me what lateral force would have caused the WTC towers to fall <em>over</em>? There wasn&#39;t one.</p>

<p>There was some slight listing especially on the South tower as the beginning of the collapse (If memory serves me correctly the plane took out more exterior columns on the east side of the tower than west) however, this tilting was negligible to the downward momentum of the skyscraper. Towers are mostly air (and don&#39;t get me started on that &#39;squib&#39; bullshit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, throw out all the evidence of the south side damage, the eyewitness reports of the building leaning, the reports of the sounds it was making, the reports of its expected collapse, the photos of it damaging adjacent buildings, the &quot;quiet&quot; collapse(no audible explosions), no flashes, no huge amount of thermite sparks, and the rubble in the street...</p>

<p>The thing that bugs me about your statement is you seem to have a preconceived notion that tall buildings can&#39;t fall the way they did.</p>

<p>It is almost like people expect them to topple over like a jenga tower or a tall tree. People fail to see the difference between a tall solid object like a tree, and a complex tall structure like a 47 story building. </p>

<p>There is a reason why a collapse looks like demolition and vice versa. That is the easiest way to demolish them... by causing them to collapse. The idea isn&#39;t to blow up the whole building, the idea is to remove supports and have gravity do all the work. The explosions initiate the collapse. So the reason why they look similar, is because controlled demolitions are supposed to essentially BE a collapse.</p>

<p>So people like to say, &quot;The collapse looks like a controlled demolition!&quot;.</p>

<p>How many of you thought of to say, &quot;That demolition looks like a collapse!&quot;? Maybe the reason why collapses look like a controlled demolition is because that is how efficient controlled demolitions are conducted? So the reason why the collapse looks like a controlled demolition, is because all the source material you see are controlled demolitions which happen to use the same principles as a collapse?</p>

<p>So I contend the reason it looks like WTC7 was demolished, was because demolition so closely resembles a natural collapse of a tall building by design.</p>

<p>No one is denying the wasn&#39;t any damage to the building. But a lot of people have a problem with a building imploding in on itself at free-fall speed. buildings of this size have taken similar damage before, but there are only 2 other cases in history of a building totally collapsing after taking damage - that&#39;s right WTC1 and WTC2.</p>

<p>Maybe you have a link to these &quot;witness reports&#39; ? In any case there is more then enough video evidence that the building was not leaning right before the collapse.</p>

<p>That one is rich, I like to know who these experts are that predicted the collapse of a building, when a building had never collapsed due to structural damage before that day.</p>

<p>First: I for one have never heard of, or seen pictures of this damage. secondly: So what? Thirdly: I remember a building being demolished by controlled demolition in Canberra Australia, and a girl was killed from flying shrapnel who was about a kilometer away.</p>

<p>Funny, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRaKHq2dfCI">this guy</a> (Deputy Director of Emergency Services Department, NY City Housing Authority) that was in the building said he heard explosions, and it was like the building was gutted when he and a co-worker tried to leave. Weird how a building that received damage on the outside, ended up with nothing in its interior. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DuSeuxjiJQ&amp;amp;feature=related">Here is another interview he did</a> Oh yeah, Barry Jennings is also dead now, not long after he came out with this information.</p>

<p>This is a common problem with conspiracy theorists. You guys try to say that just because it never happened it should never happen in the future. That is purely logical fallacy because nobody ever flew 757s into skyscrapers before. Henceforth not even experts can say whether the building will collapse or not because it has never happened before!</p>

<p>It&#39;s also important to note, that even controlled demolitions aren&#39;t uniform in their collapse. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK50So-yYRU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK50So-yYRU</a></p>

<p>An explosion large enough to take out support columns of a 47-story skyscraper would be audible for at least half a mile. If you have ever watched a building demolition this would be obvious. To date there is yet to be any video with said explosions.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>No, you want an investigation that comes to the conclusion that 9/11 was a conspiracy and agrees with the theory of controlled demolition. 9/11 conspiracy supporters don&#39;t want another investigation unless it agrees with their views. I mean the government, NIST, MIT, Purdue, Berkley, Pop. Mechanics, and tons of other reputable sources have all done simulations, tests, and reviews of 9/11 and come to the same conclusion. There <em>has been</em> plenty of investigations and studies, but the CT community rejects them because they didn&#39;t agree with their theories. The worst part is, most people will say those are all bullshit, they were in on it, paid off, shills, whatever. But all that does is make the theory that much more unbelievable and complex. So now Popular Mechanics was in on it, and MIT/Purdue/Berkley students, everyone in NIST, etc. If another investigation was carried out, on a grand scale, and the results turned out to be the same as the previous investigations, the CT crowd would just want another &quot;fair&quot; investigation until one finally agreed with them. It&#39;s kind of a dumb situation to ask for an investigation, but only want to hear one outcome or reject it. I believe that most 9/11 conspiracy supporters don&#39;t want a fair investigation, they just want an investigation that agrees with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not anti CT by any means, but I really hate how the 9/11 believers keep pushing for a new investigation, when there have already been tons of them... just none that tell them what they want to hear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is also my point, my point is that it is ridiculous to write them off. Most of them were from middle/upper class Saudi families with ties to leadership and wealth.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think the terrorist suspects were idiots, morons, or complete retards. The case against Moussaoui showed that they took flying lessons, bought computers, flight yolks, and flight simulator software to train on. They had funding and wire transfers from over seas, fake documentation, etc. They were somewhat organized, had a goal, and worked towards that goal, and eventualy (I believe) accomplished that goal.</p>

<p>Barry Jennings was inside the buildings during the attack... what he heard when is completely arbitrary. He could have been hearing 1) the planes hitting the building 2) the collapse of WTC 1/2... he said he heard explosions, not really knowing when or where because he was inside the building and moving around from floor to floor. His testimony about explosions is completely arbitrary and unreliable. We do know he was in the building after all 4 events occurred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, for the fuck&#39;s sake, NIST itself in their report (and I mean the actual report the people signed with their names, not the fucking anonymous comments afterwords) could only show that, with overstretched parameters, only the worst case scenario of those considered (that means everything that could go wrong, did in the worst possible way) could <strong>initiate</strong> the collapse. That&#39;s actually far from showing that the collapse itself would happen the way it did.</p>

<p>Now, you want us to believe the very improbable collapse happened not once but twice, and the manner of the collapse itself was pretty much defying physics. When you damage the structure to the point of collapse, it will fall towards the path of the least resistance. That means, unless the damage is exactly symmetrical in all directions, it will fall asymmetrically. That&#39;s why the controlled demolition requires much skill and precision - it&#39;s purpose is to make sure the structure&#39;s support is removed <strong>symmetrically</strong> at once, to avoid asymmetrical collapse.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why all the other recorded buildings&#39; collapses (even some controlled demolitions) were always dramatically different from WTC collapses. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t wrap your head around the differences between a small solid structure load and a tall building load. Once the weakest link in the chain fails and the rest of the load is distributed among the leftover columns which are also weakened by fire...the pressure builds until the next fails and the next and so on...then it gets to the point to where the whole upper part moves an entire floor and you get a collapse. The path of least resistance is straight down because of the massive amount of force you would need to sheer off a portion the building and the mass above the point of failure. </p>

<p>You also fail to see how the collapse wasn&#39;t symmetrical at all. When you watch the collapse you can see the tilt towards the hole in the building.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot figure out if you are willfully deceitful or simply ignorant. Let&#39;s suppose the Murphy and Allah conspired to bring about the initiation of collapse as per NIST worst case. At this point we have three sections of the building: the structurally sound top floors, the damaged vicinity of the crash and still structurally sound bottom floors.</p>

<p>Since, as you seem to grasp, the damage was not symmetrical, the most damaged corner of the building is supposed to give first. As the elementary physics shows, the forces of gravity would find not enough resistance at that corner and the top of the building would start leaning towards this corner. </p>

<p>As the center of gravity of the top section shifts, the damaged corner would be subjected to even more force, while the opposite one to less. </p>

<p>The top of the building would start gaining even more momentum and would simply topple over, certainly damaging floors below <strong>at the affected corner</strong>. The entire building might or might not collapse but it would not collapse the way WTC towers did (baring other, intervening forces.)</p>

<p>And, incidentally, one of the towers <strong>started</strong> collapsing exactly that way. If you watch the video you can see it happening... and then something does intervene. If you look closely at the antenna, you will see it <strong>straightening up</strong> as if something started to pull on it from below.</p>

<p>The only explanation for that phenomenon I can think of is cutting in timely fashion the load bearing central column(s) at the base (or close to it) of the tower. No longer being supported at the bottom the steel columns would certainly be able to shift the center of gravity back.</p>

<p>But perhaps you have alternative explanation. BTW &quot;big buildings are different than small ones&quot; is <strong>not</strong> an explanation...</p>

<p>This is where you are wrong and shows you don&#39;t understand the physics involved. I can&#39;t explain it to you. You need to be able to visualize the difference between a solid object and an object that has hundreds of thousands of pieces with different load tolerances. You are over estimating the ability for the different columns to hold up the rest of the building. </p>

<p>Once the mass above the holes gets moving there is no way the lower floor can hold it. None. Zero. That is why it is impossible for the top to fall off. The upper section mass is simply too great to be held and it just collapses through the lower floors. One the upper mass falls one floor, the mass involved causes the next floor to collapse and so on.</p>

<p>Remember, sky scrapers are built to withstand earthquakes and are not &#39;fragile&#39; structures as you might believe.  If they really do fall as reported, where are the massive retrofit projects happening?</p>

<p>Here are the support column locations:</p>

<p>It is not a house of cards, columns are redundant.  Even if the outer columns were compromised, it is physically impossible for the building to pancake.</p>

<p>You&#39;re comparing a (what looks like) 9 floor reinforced concrete building with a 47-floor steel highrise? <em>Really?</em></p>

<p>This is a concrete support structure where there are no main columns or supporting columns. The entire building is it&#39;s own support structure so of course it didn&#39;t collapse.</p>

<p>I&#39;m well aware columns are redundant. However even with redundancy, after a column fails the load is instantly reapplied to the nearest columns. If that exceeds their capacity (consider the fact that most steels lose half it&#39;s strength when heated above 100C), then it too fails and simultaneously the rest. Keep in mind we&#39;re talking about fucking skyscrapers here. They aren&#39;t exactly a house of cards because they&#39;re extremely heavy.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They did have insulating foam surrounding around support columns as well as elevator shafts however apparently these were blown off by the impact itself. It isn&#39;t surprising to me honestly, as it isn&#39;t easy to test.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I need to correct my temperatures. I got a chance to look up the numbers once I got home. The temperature at which structural steel loses much of its strength is between 700-1100 degrees C.</p>

<p>Jet fuel normally burns much lower in controlled environments but with enough oxygen it can burn at temperatures up to 1000 C. It&#39;s possible the WTC could have survived just the fire alone but having several support columns removed over several floors and it compounds the damage considerably.</p>

<p>P.S. Your graph doesn&#39;t really help. Ultimate Strength (or Ultimate Tensile Strength) is a poor measurement in this case because it&#39;s beyond the yield strength (this means it&#39;s already undergoing plastic deformation which is very bad).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think arguing about any of this is necessary 10 years later. It is tremendously more important to me, and I hope we can all agree on this, that one or more people in positions of US political leadership had prior knowledge of the attacks and allowed them to occur in order to facilitate the invasion of Afghanistan in 2003. This false flag attack mimicked Pearl Harbor and the Gulf of Tonkin in its intended purpose for the 1%. Although it is important that guilty parties be held accountable for this abuse of power, there is much fishier business going on right now under current leadership that warrants our attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen reports of people who heard large explosions.  </p>

<p>Here are the facts that the engineers and architects have stated don&#39;t jive with the official story: </p>

<p>WTC Building #7, a 47-story high-rise not hit by an airplane, exhibited all the characteristics of classic controlled demolition with explosives:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Rapid onset of collapse</p></li>
<li><p>Sounds of explosions at ground floor – a second before the building&#39;s destruction</p></li>
<li><p>Symmetrical &quot;structural failure&quot; – through the path of greatest resistance – at free-fall acceleration</p></li>
<li><p>Imploded, collapsing completely, and landed in its own footprint</p></li>
<li><p>Massive volume of expanding pyroclastic dust clouds</p></li>
<li><p>Expert corroboration from the top European controlled demolition professional</p></li>
<li><p>Foreknowledge of &quot;collapse&quot; by media, NYPD, FDNY</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the the aftermath of WTC7&#39;s destruction, strong evidence of demolition using incendary devices was discovered:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>FEMA finds rapid oxidation and intergranular melting on structural steel samples</p></li>
<li><p>Several tons of molten metal reported by numerous highly qualified witnesses</p></li>
<li><p>Chemical signature of the incendiary thermite found in solidified molten metal, and dust samples</p></li>
</ol>

<p>WTC7 exhibited none of the characteristics of destruction by fire:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Slow onset with large visible deformations</p></li>
<li><p>Asymmetrical collapse which follows the path of least resistance (laws of conservation of momentum would cause a falling, to the side most damaged by the fires)</p></li>
<li><p>Evidence of fire temperatures capable of softening steel</p></li>
<li><p>High-rise buildings with much larger, hotter, and longer lasting fires have never collapsed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For the twin towers: </p>

<p>Destruction proceeds through the path of greatest resistance at nearly free-fall acceleration </p>

<p>Improbable symmetry of debris distribution</p>

<p>Extremely rapid onset of destruction</p>

<p>Over 100 first responders reported explosions and flashes</p>

<p>Multi-ton steel sections ejected laterally</p>

<p>Mid-air pulverization of 90,000 tons of concrete &amp; metal decking</p>

<p>Massive volume of expanding pyroclastic-like clouds</p>

<p>1200-foot-diameter debris field: no &quot;pancaked&quot; floors found</p>

<p>Isolated explosive ejections 20–40 stories below demolition front</p>

<p>Total building destruction: dismemberment of steel frame</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What happened to all the barium nitrate, then? Besides, thermite was used in the cleanup effort, so don&#39;t you think it&#39;s natural to find material from that?</p>

<p>If you hear hooves, expect horses, not zebras.</p>

<p>Edit: &quot;Separate from the WTC towers investigation, NIST researchers estimated that at least 0.13 pounds of thermite would be required to heat each pound of a steel section to approximately 700 degrees Celsius (the temperature at which steel weakens substantially). Therefore, while a thermite reaction can cut through large steel columns, many thousands of pounds of thermite would need to have been placed inconspicuously ahead of time, remotely ignited, and somehow held in direct contact with the surface of hundreds of massive structural components to weaken the building. This makes it an unlikely substance for achieving a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Analysis of the WTC steel for the elements in thermite/thermate would not necessarily have been conclusive. The metal compounds also would have been present in the construction materials making up the WTC towers, and sulfur is present [approx. 19% by weight] in the gypsum wallboard that was prevalent in the interior partitions.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are also &#39;plenty&#39; of engineers and scientists who have stated that it is not only possible for the planes to be the cause of the collapse of the twin towers (and debris the cause for WTC7 - inclusive of the subsequent fire).</p>

<p>But I think we are at a point now where people who believe it was explosives need to come up with evidence. I have seen the &#39;evidence&#39; presented for explosive demolition and it is all along the lines of &quot;this is how it <em>could</em> have happened, and it is in line with observations&quot; - but no actual evidence.</p>

<p>Why has no one been able to find a paper trail? Why have there been no whistleblowers? </p>

<p>Slightly off tangent - almost EVERY single person who prescribes to the demolition theory also promotes the &#39;missle hitting the pentagon&#39; theory. Are you with them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so let&#39;s break it down:</p>

<p>Planes were hijacked. They hit the towers. Shortly after the towers fell. Debris hit WTC7. There were fires in WTC7. The fire suppressant system failed and the building burned.</p>

<p>So; what part of the above do you disagree with? At what point in the above do you insert other agencies or people to account for the above?</p>

<p>There ARE satisfactory explainations for the buildings falling that do not require additional events (explosives for one). What evidence specifically makes you believe that there were additional events?</p>

<p>I am not saying that the &#39;official story&#39; is 100% factual. I am SURE it has been &#39;tweaked&#39; to put the actions of the government in the best light. However, it is a massive stretch from &quot;cover up incompetence&quot; to &quot;cover up conspiracy to cause thousands of deaths&quot;. </p>

<p>Can you show me the specific things that lead you to believe that members of the US government plotted and carried out 9/11?</p>

<p>I  never said you could not.</p>

<p>I find it strange that you even have a &#39;I don&#39;t know&#39; position. Most people, who are merely aware of events would connect the dots between the planes hitting and the towers falling. By suggesting that you &#39;do not know&#39; is saying that you do indeed doubt that story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, I didn&#39;t feel like explaining what I thought might&#39;ve happened on 9/11. It&#39;s a long fucking story.</p>

<p>Yes obviously planes hit the tower and there were real people on there and all of this really happened, but, Bush does have connections in the middle east and has for a long time, so I thought maybe he &quot;fucked something up&quot; with them so they attacked. I dunno. Then I also see that WTC 7 collapsed without being hit. Fire? Collapsing a building? It&#39;s not like the whole building was on fire I&#39;ve seen the videos. It&#39;s crazy how this building falls. It looks like it was blown up. I&#39;m not saying it was. I&#39;m saying it looks like it was.</p>

<p>Why is admitting that I don&#39;t know such a ridiculous thing? If anything, you should respect the fact that I admit to not knowing instead of jumping onto one of the many conspiracy theories and claiming it to be true, or by claiming that all conspiracy theories are bullshit. Either way, saying that you definitely know what happened is a lot more ignorant than admitting you have no idea and that you only know what the government has told you, and what scientists/others have told you.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s just as ignorant to say &quot;all 9/11 conspiracies are bullshit&quot; as it is to say &quot;a particular 9/11 conspiracy theory is definitely true&quot;.</p>

<p>It certainly is something I respect. I would not say ALL conspiracy theories are bullshit. I am sure one or two have aspects that may well be true. However I would rather see some evidence before I entertain them as plausable. </p>

<p>The idea that explosives were used - or that a missle was fired at the pentagon - is something I find to be complete bullshit and should be actively countered. </p>

<p>Oh, I am sorry. I didn&#39;t realise that that was rude. I shall not challenge anyone in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ever again. Hopefully this subreddit can return to a circlejerk and people like me will no longer interupt.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who anyone on Reddit is - unless of course they forward that information. Does this mean I should not debate anyone on the issue? </p>

<p>You seem sort of level headed - certainly more so than the usual crowd around here. I am also willing to say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; about certain aspects. I do not know whether the US government covered up certain things that made them look bad. </p>

<p>But you should not get personally offended just because I take an interest in challenging the idea of explosives being used on the twin towers.</p>

<p>What did raise my suspicion was the lines of evidence that would disappear from the news as quickly as they appeared.

    <div class="md"><p>This is a new one, collapse looks like demolition. Funny thing is I&#39;m not sure there has ever been a collapse of a steel frame building. We have seen earth quake damage, but never a spontaneous collapse. Indirectly, you can see the mechanics of the cover up. This thread alone has two new theories to explain away anomalous facts, and I have been reading these for 8 years. The thermite in the cleanup is a new one to me and the free fall explanation are amusing. The one I liked the best was how pouring water on the basements caused them to heat up. You can see the brainstorming during their meetings, OK, what is a plausible way to explain away free fall speeds, thermite residue, and melted steel in the basement. They throw them out in forums such as these and analyze the arguments, iterate, and try again with a new twist. It really is a three pronged attack, disinformation, putting out conspiracy theories that don&#39;t match with the evidence, counter arguments, that rewrite the laws of physics, and a general appeal to authority, these groups are on board with program, you should be too. It&#39;s almost like a comic strip, and every week there is a new punchline for your amusement.</p>

<p>What was NOT found was several of the byproducts of thermite combustion that are not used in construction. Without those byproducts, no thermite can have been used.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s worth emphasizing that <em>everything</em> that was claimed to be thermite found in the wreckage is commonly found in construction materials, and there was no sign of any signs that thermite was used. Saying that oxides of aluminum and iron along with zinc and sulphur and plastic compounds were found proves only that there was a building there that had plastic inside.</p>

<p>Thermite cannot be used to cut vertical columns without special equipment that doesn&#39;t actually exist, because nobody uses thermite to cut vertical columns. No thermite combustion products were found. It would have taken literally thousands of pounds of thermite, contained in equipment that doesn&#39;t exist but would have to be capable of resisting 4000 degree temperatures and impacts from a 767 to do what the truthers claim.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t happen that way. Google the NIST report for more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s one with no chain of custody or thermitic combustion products to be found, published in an &quot;open&quot; journal, meaning no peer review.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t use thermite without generating some fairly esoteric combustion products, which are NOT found in regular construction materials (unlike unburnt thermite, which is built of common stuff), and those combustion products were not found in the wreckage.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to &quot;explain away&quot; their motivations - you can ask them why they insisted on publishing unsupported conclusions. What matters is that their conclusions are specious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an investigation of what happened to WTC7.  An extensive 3 year study by NIST.  <a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/NCSTAR1Aindex.htm">http://wtc.nist.gov/NCSTAR1/NCSTAR1Aindex.htm</a></p>

<p>And it is a pretty good one.  Have you read it?</p>

<p>No I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s necessarily the final word, but anyone who calls for an investigation I think needs to at the very least read the one that was already done, formulate specific criticisms, and make justifications about why this investigation was insufficient and we need <em>another</em> one.</p>

<p>And no &quot;It sure looked like a demolition&quot; doesn&#39;t count as a justification.  If that&#39;s all you got, I&#39;ll stick with the 3 year exhaustive study by hundreds of experts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For starters, from the FAQ:</p>

<p><a href="http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm">http://wtc.nist.gov/pubs/factsheets/faqs_8_2006.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The responses to questions number 2, 4, 5 and 11 demonstrate why NIST concluded that there were no explosives or controlled demolition involved in the collapses of the WTC towers. </p>

<p>Furthermore, a very large quantity of thermite (a mixture of powdered or granular aluminum metal and powdered iron oxide that burns at extremely high temperatures when ignited) or another incendiary compound would have had to be placed on at least the number of columns damaged by the aircraft impact and weakened by the subsequent fires to bring down a tower. Thermite burns slowly relative to explosive materials and can require several minutes in contact with a massive steel section to heat it to a temperature that would result in substantial weakening. Separate from the WTC towers investigation, NIST researchers estimated that at least 0.13 pounds of thermite would be required to heat each pound of a steel section to approximately 700 degrees Celsius (the temperature at which steel weakens substantially). Therefore, while a thermite reaction can cut through large steel columns, many thousands of pounds of thermite would need to have been placed inconspicuously ahead of time, remotely ignited, and somehow held in direct contact with the surface of hundreds of massive structural components to weaken the building. This makes it an unlikely substance for achieving a controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Analysis of the WTC steel for the elements in thermite/thermate would not necessarily have been conclusive. The metal compounds also would have been present in the construction materials making up the WTC towers, and sulfur is present in the gypsum wallboard that was prevalent in the interior partitions.</p>

<p>Have you read the report?  I&#39;m not trying to antagonize.  Just curious where you&#39;re coming from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever thought any of the NYC collapses were caused by demolition has never seen a demolition.</p>

<p>That said, no one has any idea how damaged the south side of WTC 7 was except those who were at Ground Zero before it collapsed. There is no photo or video of the south side of WTC 7. All we have is a picture from the northwest angle that clearly shows significant structural damage to the southwest side of WTC 7 for 10-20 stories. Furthermore, dozens of floor swere on fire for hours and surely the collapse of the Twin Towers may have caused further structural failure.</p>

<p>Even the WTC 7 is quite a tall building, but never before has such tall buildings been dealt the cards those 3 towers were dealt that day. You can&#39;t look at other buildings that were 20-30 stories which were demolished, with different structural material and design, and say that it could not collapse the same way.</p>

<p>The reality is, none of the 3 buildings collapsed in any manner like a demolition except that they collapsed near free fall speed. However, to assign resistance arguments as evidence that they were demolished is contradictory to the fact that the same argument can be applied to demolished buildings...</p>

<p>WTC 7 did not collapse uniformly. We can see the south side collapsing (from the top angle) before the front side (from the video perspectives) began collapsing.</p>

<p>Next, a demolition that brings down a building starting at the lobby, means there would have been explosions going on at the lobby immediately prior to the collapse. Furthermore, demolitions typically have explosions going off on multiple floors in a synchronized manner within seconds prior to the collapse. Having explosions going off hours before the collapse is nonsensical. If there were explosions it could have been collapsing floors, hydrogen explosion, falling elevators, etc...</p>

<p>Another theory is that the building was &quot;pulled&quot; down, and without even entertaining the idea that the firefighters were in on it, I want to point out that pulling a building down requires cranes, massive cables, and months of preparation.</p>

<p>The firefighters themselves suspected the building was going to collapse as a result of the damage it sustained during the North Tower collapse and the fact that the fire was uncontrollable, on dozens of floors, and there was no water pressure left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a materials engineer and I believe it&#39;s quite possible a steel structure could collapse from fire/debris. Structural steel, like many other materials looses half it&#39;s strength when heated above certain temperatures. WTC7 was on fire for <em>seven hours</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, a demolition with explosives would have been audible for at least half a mile and yet there are no reports of audible explosions in witnesses or in any recorded footage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/EngineeringandHomelandSecurity/ReflectionsontheWorldTradeCenter.aspx">The two towers were the first structures outside of the military and nuclear industries designed to resist the impact of a jet airliner, the Boeing 707. It was assumed that the jetliner would be lost in the fog, seeking to land at JFK or at Newark. To the best of our knowledge, little was known about the effects of a fire from such an aircraft, and no designs were prepared for that circumstance. Indeed, at that time, no fireproofing systems were available to control the effects of such fires.</a></p>

<p>Take off wasn&#39;t a part of the consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is also my point, my point is that it is ridiculous to write them off. Most of them were from middle/upper class Saudi families with ties to leadership and wealth.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think the terrorist suspects were idiots, morons, or complete retards. The case against Moussaoui showed that they took flying lessons, bought computers, flight yolks, and flight simulator software to train on. They had funding and wire transfers from over seas, fake documentation, etc. They were somewhat organized, had a goal, and worked towards that goal, and eventualy (I believe) accomplished that goal.</p>

<p><em>I</em> did not imply that the terrorists were cave dwelling morons, I implied that&#39;s what most conspiracy theorists like to believe and parrot and post around here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the multi-storey gash extending a quarter of the building&#39;s girth into WTC 7, starting around the 8th floor and the bits of the towers found on site got there....how? Carried over somehow?</p>

<p>Debris from the towers, including 400 meter support piers, went high and/or long enough to reach WTC 7 <em>without</em> hitting an 8-storey building - which didn&#39;t happen in any case, WTC 6 was hit by a shitload of debris as well. </p>

<p>In fact, almost the entirety of WTC 7 was visible from the north tower. Debris easily travelled <em>over</em> WTC 6.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not personally offended that you challenged the idea of explosives being used on the twin towers. I&#39;m personally <em>annoyed</em> because after saying &quot;I don&#39;t know what to believe&quot; you act as if that&#39;s such a crazy thing, to admit that I don&#39;t know how to explain 9/11. Comparing it to &quot;not knowing&quot; whether the Earth is round. That&#39;s pretty close to just saying &quot;you fucking idiot, you can&#39;t have no opinion on this&quot; so that&#39;s kind of rude. Someone else even responded and was offended as well. They also said that after reading your conversation with matttebbetts aka myself, that they figured you must be a troll and I have to admit at this point it seems like you kind of are.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t challenge the conspiracies; I was asking if you need a full explanation from every new person you encounter in this subreddit regarding &quot;what they think happened&quot; on 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who actually built the towers that now says they were so flimsy a plane could take them down? </p>

<p>I listen to engineers, (real engineers, structural engineers) because they know what they&#39;re talking about when it comes to buildings falling down. </p>

<p>Jesse Ventura knows about demolitions because he was a UDT and trained in explosives. I listen to people like that. Have you seen the massive steel structure that supported the Towers? Check out the pictures under construction. It has a massive core. Jet fuel cannot destroy beams as thick as a man. </p>
