<p><a href="http://www.southernstudies.org/2011/04/epa-plan-to-raise-radiation-exposure-limits-sparks-internal-debate.html">EPA: </a>&quot;This guidance would allow cleanup levels that exceed MCLs [Maximum Contamination Limits under the Safe Drinking Water Act] by a factor of 100, 1000, and in two instances 7 million.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/031963_radiation_exposure.html">Canada: </a>&quot;Please note that as of March 25, 2011, the frequency of data collection by NRCan using the mobile surveys has been decreased due to the low levels of radiation being detected.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.alexanderhiggins.com/2011/04/03/eu-secretly-implements-large-increases-food-radiation-limits-informing-public-13636/">EU: </a>&quot;The EU implemented a secret “emergency” order without informing the public which increases the amount of radiation in food by up to 20 times previous food standards.&quot;</p>

<p>I personally think the effects of this disaster are going to be much more widespread and longer lasting than the governments of the world and the media they control would have us believe. There is still no end in sight for Japan, IMO it is likely this contamination will continue for months at best, decades at worst. Either way the entire planet is going to be far more radioactive in the coming years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Checks into the claim that &quot;Canada has simply turned off its nuclear monitoring network&quot;....)</p>

<p>Oh, look!  The claim is pure BS!</p>

<p>Canada <em>increased</em> it&#39;s nuclear monitoring when the crises started.  It scaled back when significant radiation failed to appear, but it&#39;s still running a network of monitoring stations all over the country.  And they&#39;re <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/ed-ud/respond/nuclea/_data/surveil-eng.php">published on the web</a> for anyone else to monitor too.  No doubt your other claims are equally &quot;honest.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one where you rely on facts rather than intuition.</p>

<p>The person who posted this conspiracy theory is relying on intuition alone - that every government and corporation and media organization and scientist is part of one massive conspiracy theory, somehow not having any opposing interests at all, not even to protect their families and friends.  </p>

<p>And the conspiracy theorist tries to get you to believe it by telling easy to disprove lies.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean trusting the government.  There&#39;s no need to.  There are plenty of geiger counters out there.  People have been putting them on the web.  Media organizations have them, and most <strong>want</strong> to print a scoop and prove the government wrong.  Heck, Fox News goes out of it&#39;s way to fabricate stories to make the current government look bad.  There are thousands of scientists and high school science teachers and university professors and students out there with access to geiger counters.</p>

<p>If radiation levels were higher than the governemnt monitoring stations say, there are a great many people and organizations who will point that out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps it would help if you didn&#39;t pretend that THE WHOLE PLANET EXCEPT FOR YOU is one massive conspiracy.</p>

<p>The crisis in Japan isn&#39;t the Canadian Government&#39;s mistake in any way, shape or form.  They have no reason to participate in any cover-up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, plenty of private Japanese citizens who don&#39;t trust the Japanese government, have put their own geiger counters online.  Plenty of North Americans have them too.  And every high school science teacher on the continent has access to one, plus a great many university science professors and students.</p>

<p>And you can bet that plenty of newspapers have them now, wishing that they&#39;d show a high reading that they could put on the front page in huge letters.</p>

<p>And guess what:  No-one has detected a significant increase in radiation in North America.  What they&#39;ve detected, is on the scale of the increase you get during an ordinary rain storm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why is the EPA/EU changing their guidelines on what is safe? It&#39;s not their fault this has happened either. Why are they going to let people ingest radiation multiple times in excess of what would have been allowed a few weeks ago?</p>

<p>With the increase in what levels or radiation are acceptable by the EPA the media are going to be able to report that radiation levels are far, far below minimum safety standards, while they may be millions of times above what was acceptable earlier this year.</p>

<p>I&#39;m interested to see the information regarding the radiation increase only being the same as a typical rainstorm, can you post a link? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exposure to radiation is only part of the problem. The real problem, which is not being discussed in the media, is that isotopes are spread via smoke, steam, and explosion.</p>

<p>I have no concerns that I&#39;ll be exposed to excessive radiation by going outside. I won&#39;t be. But what will happen, for example, is cesium-137 will be dropped via rainwater, end up in food and consumed by me. My bones and muscles will confuse it with phosphorus and keep it around. I will then be irradiated nonstop from inside my body from an isotope with a biological half-life of 70 days (and environmental half-life of 30 years.)</p>

<p>The FDA (and similar foreign agencies) will be unable to prevent this so instead they are raising the levels of acceptable radiation to continue to pretend like they can keep us safe. Why keep them around if they are powerless to protect the food they claim to protect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>60% of Cancers are caused by Oxygen. Does that mean we should stop breathing?</p>

<p>Firstly, I don&#39;t think there has been an Plutonium or Uranium leaked from the reactors. Most of the leakage has been Iodine, when they flushed the reactors with seawater. This has a half life of 8 days or so. While it can be dangerous, it decays away quickly and not much was leaked.</p>

<p>Secondly, Plutonium and Uranium are fairly inert unless you put a lot together. Uranium used to be used as a yellow glase on pottery. It&#39;s more likely to kill you for being toxic than radioactive, and there are far worse toxins we are exposed to daily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s up with the last link to the charts, is this legit and meaningful?

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s legit and meaningful:  It&#39;s a simulation of where the radiation has travelled (via Xenon 133) and how much there was.</p>

<p>What it lacks, is <strong>context</strong>.</p>

<p>Health Canada provided some:  <a href="http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20110321/health-canada-radiation-levels-110321/20110321/?hub=CalgaryHome">(CTV News link)</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Health Canada&#39;s radiation monitoring stations have detected a minuscule increase in radiation levels along the West Coast of Canada. This increase is a variation less than what we would see naturally when it rains.&quot; </p>

<p>They claim that Canada has shut down testing altogether when they only needed to click on TWO links to see that in fact, testing continues daily: <a href="http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/ed-ud/respond/nuclea/_data/surveil-eng.php">http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/ed-ud/respond/nuclea/_data/surveil-eng.php</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I upvoted because I keep seeing posts such as this being downvoted into the great black hole. The armchair nuclear analysts run in assuring everyone its going to be just fine, using western media as sources of info. With all these distractions it&#39;s becoming hard to see the path, its hazy out here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been downvoting many of these posts because most of the information sources come from shitty blogs who don&#39;t deserve the traffic.  Natural News is the Fox News of the &quot;natural living&quot; community by publishing scaremongering trash while promoting their products in the same articles.  These are the same people who blamed the Arizona shooting on TV and high fructose corn syrup!  We bitch when the mainstream media publishes blatant bullshit and propaganda, and we should hold &quot;alternative&quot; media to the same standards.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so let&#39;s back up for a second and forget all the hype and use some basic common sense. Remember Chernobyl? That was just about as bad a meltdown as you can get, right? Full on explosion, scattering the nasty nuke debris all over the place. No doubt the people in the immediate vicinity continue to pay a terrible price, but did the world fucking end? Do we all have massive cancer increases and deformed children around the globe because of Chernobyl? I don&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>I&#39;m as freaked out by nuclear accidents and incidents as anybody else, and I think we should absolutely be focusing first and foremost on energy sources that aren&#39;t incredibly dangerous unless everything is running perfectly. But I also don&#39;t want to get sucked into the fear bubble. There are enough legitimate things to worry about. </p>
