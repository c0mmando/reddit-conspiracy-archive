<p>Why are most people so apathetic?
Your Ad Here</p>

<p>Its getting bad. There exists people who spend most or all of their time indulging in all the sickness of this society, willfully ignorant of all the suffering they cause. Ignorant to the betrayers they place in power to protect them, cold to those who would open their eyes.</p>

<p>“It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.” -Krishnamurti</p>

<p>Most parts of this culture attempt to glorify all those that our vaunted holy texts proclaim as evil. How hard is it to find something that makes light of causing another pain or makes violence seem exciting? Is it difficult to find a company that chooses profits over safety and the well-being of those it employs? Care to point out someone in power who exploits his position for personal gain? Can you think of an example of avarice, greed, or pure fucking tragedy?</p>

<p>From Libya to Tunisia to Egypt, and the larger part of Africa to Palestine, up through Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, south to Yemen, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, east through Afghanistan and into Pakistan, we have War. Not to mention all the other places I not getting off the top of my head. Call it what you will... &quot;occupation&quot;, &quot;peace actions&quot;, &quot;internal conflict&quot;, it all looks the same when its your house thats in rubble, and your son in a box. So many people totally fucked before they ever had a chance to do it to themselves, so many wrongs by any stretch of the definition just piling up and all everyone is doing is seeing who can look away or forget it the fastest.</p>

<p>Solutions? We have them. We have resources. What we don&#39;t have is any desire to do anything about it. Its way easier to just catch another TV show, play another game, crush another beer. We are all so tired from our long hours at our stressful jobs, and our disappointing and unfulfillable personal relationships; or maybe we are one of the lucky to be able to be satisfied with just making sure that our own are cared for. No one else ever did shit for me so why should I do anything for them? Who knows, you might even be able to come up with a reason that justifies these averted eyes.</p>

<p>It makes me wish for the &quot;end of days&quot;.</p>

<p>No, I should take an eighty thousand dollar loan to go to a &quot;decent&quot; college to study advanced mathematical concepts so I can live that dream of discovering a cheap clean energy source that will bring warmth to all the cold little feet on earth. But what actually happens is I can&#39;t afford to fucking eat, so I take that degree and go work for some massive defense firm manufacturing new ways to depopulate the poor. Meanwhile the CEO of my company is touring the earth in his 80 foot yacht with an entourage of young girls, likely purchased from the same poor people he is blowing up. Then I&#39;m told that this is &quot;Successful&quot; and that this is what I should aspire to be. So i tell my congressman that hey maybe this kind of thing shouldn&#39;t go on, but he feeds me some form letter about how he values all the donations of his constituents, but he can&#39;t talk right now because he&#39;s touring the Bahamas on some other asshole&#39;s boat.</p>

<p>I call up my friends, we meet at a bar. &quot;Sup guys... man, did you hear about-&quot; Interrupted by &quot;HERP MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL DERP!&quot; &quot;Derp, Charlie Sheen Herp&quot;. &quot;No man, fuck those people, we should just turn it into a glass desert&quot;. &quot;It don&#39;t matter they ain&#39;t Christian&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyone else looking around and feeling a bit disgusted? As if suddenly the whole thing looks like some kind of ridiculous farce designed to beat the best out of all of us?</p>

<p>(reposted from something i submitted earlier on GLP today.)</p>

<p>Just felt i had to get that off my chest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you kidding?  I&#39;ve never been more hopeful.</p>

<p>The web is allowing us to say GTFO to the major controlled news networks, technology is advancing to the point where even small rebel groups have access to UAVs and ELINT, fiat government currencies are getting slapped around left and right with truly decentralized money coming into being (bitcoin), encryption is enabling dissident groups to communicate and find information more easily than ever before, we finally are getting a realistic private orbital space launch capability, more and more states/countries are questioning/rolling back the racist/classist war on drugs, more states are dropping the racist/classist albatross of gun control, we&#39;re one step closer to real universal healthcare in the US, microloans are lifting more and more people out of poverty, the rise of the cell phone is vastly enabling to billions of third worlders, etc., etc.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t work or travel to the third world, then you&#39;re not seeing the many many positive changes that are going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people who advocate cleansing the planet automatically assume they will be spared. It&#39;s more self-preservationist than conversationalist. How many must die to support your lifestyle? </p>

<p>Would they still die if you had to kill them yourself? How about killing an entire family of middle eastern people every time you go to fill up your SUV. Just right there at the pump. The father hands you a pistol and asks you to take the children first so they don&#39;t have to see their parents die. That&#39;s more of a courtesy than we&#39;re extending them now. </p>

<p>How about every time you buy a diamond, you also buy an underfed African child that is attached to the ring with a chain. Won&#39;t <em>you</em> be the envy of your socialite bridge club/rap posse!</p>

<p>Maybe every time you buy something from a company that uses third world labor, you must renounce your citizenship for a month, and see what it&#39;s REALLY like to live in this country as an illegal. You might find the news is as sensationalist as all those &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; say it is. </p>

<p>America CANNOT continue. Not as it is. Drastic changes must be made because the world can&#39;t sustain the inequity. It&#39;s just not possible; all things move towards a balance, and right now things are VERY unbalanced. And a lot of you aren&#39;t gonna make it without showers, televisions, iAnything, electricity, plumbing, fast food, social services, and day laborers.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this, Americans: who is more worthy of life? Someone who has all the modern conveniences and does nothing but contribute to corporate sharecropping and enslavement? Or someone who has nothing but a desire to achieve and learn and grow and help those who were also saddled with nothing achieve?</p>

<p>Time is short, learn your worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is actually a constant question for me. I can clearly see how I could be called misanthropic from the tone of the thread (pretty drunk when that went down) but on a personal level it doesn&#39;t necessarily feel like that.

    <div class="md"><p>You lack historical perspective.  It&#39;s not getting worse.</p>

<p>As a percent of the population, fewer people now are as poor, hungry, diseased, malnourished, and yes, at war than any time since the dawn of agriculture.</p>

<p>And most humans have throughout history been lemmings.  They never deviated from the religions, philosophy and culture into which they were born due to isolation.  Now ideas are accessible to all not just merely the aristocrats and the priests.</p>

<p>That said, I find this world to be a mostly miserable place.  I suspect many agree which is why most religions think of life as a trial to get to the good stuff or so many geeks pin their hope on a future technological utopia (e.g., the Singularity).</p>

<p>And awakening to how profoundly sick our society is, doesn&#39;t make it any better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t give up on hope- even if it&#39;s a fool&#39;s hope. I used to struggle with the hypothetical - &quot;Is it better to have false hope, or no hope at all?&quot;. I see that question as irrelevant now.</p>

<p>Seriously, carve out a space for yourself and create the life that YOU want to live. Fuck what everyone else is doing and saying. They don&#39;t matter. Find something that motivates you and fucking DO IT.</p>

<p>I went through a similar process starting about 3 years ago and I ended up spending more time by myself than I think 99.99% of even Reddit does. I went backpacking every single weekend for about two and a half years. I spent all my time by myself and I spent all my time at work listening to my iPod.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t sit on my ass in front of the computer. I traveled (all over the damn place), I went backpacking, hiking, and just generally exploring. I worked out, I produced creative photography and Blog posts, investigated reality, considered the human condition, delved deeply into both Krishnamurti and Carlos Castaneda&#39;s works, as well as a variety of other pseudo-spiritual-philosophers like Alan Watts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a practicing Buddhist, a personal Taoist, and I even accidentally joined a cult by accident in college, but I&#39;ve never let ANYONE do my thinking for me. (Thank you Mr. Anderson, my middle school science teacher for pointing this out to me very clearly!). DO NOT LET ANYONE ELSE DO YOUR THINKING FOR YOU. Fuck them AND their ideas!</p>

<p>I came out the other end of my experience feeling much better about myself and the planet once I realized how little all this frustration meant. Remember: You and everyone else are going to die. There&#39;s no point in taking anything too seriously. You should focus on the positive, do the best you can, create the live you want to live and treat other people like you want to be treated.</p>

<p>Read Carlos Castaneda (I read the series from start to finish three times in a row) and get over yourself and your fucking illusions. You&#39;re not important, you never were and you never will be. You barely even exist, outside of your head I mean. Get over yourself and everyone else too. Never forget this: No one here gets out alive.</p>

<p>&quot;Enlightenment? Close enough.&quot; - Me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reality is what you make of it. Can you stop the powers that be? If you think you can, then you&#39;re out of your mind. People have been fucking each other over since the dawn of humanity, it&#39;ll continue for the rest of our reign.</p>

<p>Find someone to love or something to love doing and ignore the rest. You&#39;re going to go through life no matter how pissed off or depressed you get, so you might as well do the best that you can to improve things for those around you, but you should forget about trying to save the world.</p>

<p>As don Juan says - &quot;We either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.&quot;</p>

<p>Stop being miserable!</p>

<p>EDIT: Fixed the quote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t lose hope, man. i&#39;ve been where you&#39;re at, and it doesn&#39;t do a lick of good to yourself or to those around you.</p>

<p>you are able to see all this shit, and you will play an active part in helping others when it really starts to fall apart. </p>

<p>just keep your head up. It&#39;s OK to take a breather from focusing on all the negative. try meditation...it definitely saved my life...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;why&quot; is so important because a crime is not solved until motive is established.  The motive is the key because it is the <em>beginning</em> of all human activity.  We don&#39;t do <em>anything</em> without <strong>why</strong>. Therefore, it stands to reason that if anything at all has been done, there had to be a motive to drive the activity.  There is always a <strong>why</strong>, whether or not you know precisely what that motive is is another issue, entirely.</p>
