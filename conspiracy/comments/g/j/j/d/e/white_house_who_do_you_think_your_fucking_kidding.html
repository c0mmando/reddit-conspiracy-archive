       "Think for yourself.
Question authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in
this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality. To think for yourself you must question authority and
learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness; chaotic, confused, vulnerability, to inform yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think for yourself.
Question authority."

       People aren't ignorant. Like Jrad27 said, some people HONESTLY can't cope with the concept you're putting in front of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short story: I used to work really late nights at the old job, so there was a lot of time to sit around and bullshit. There were three of us that would discuss these things all the time. One guy was a total conspiracy nut, I was the moderate, and the third was a Marine ex-cop debunker. Basically, when it came down to it, the Marine told us that he COULDN'T accept that his Government was involved in 9/11, because for him that would mean he would need to change EVERYTHING about the way he lived. He would need to get his family to safety and spend all of his resources preparing for whatever was sure to follow next. So, he chose to believe the State line because it meant he wouldn't have to throw his entire life into upheaval.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there you have it. What we're up against is an entire populace that has never, and doesn't really expect to have to experience any strife. Americans are raised to believe that if they toe the party line and keep their nose to the grindstone, they will be rich just like the powerful some day. This is reinforced by every conceivable media outlet that Americans are exposed to on a daily basis. Some people are too weak to forgo the promise in front of them for the reality behind them, no matter how urgent.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an American that is aware of all of this, I'm beginning to accept that some people are just going to march face first into whatever the Corporations have planned for us, while shrugging their shoulders and accepting it. Because they feel that if they are good boys and girls then the boogeymen can't touch them and they can lead happy, fulfilling lives. The only reason people are becoming aware is because of the Information Age showing us that not only is The American Dream NOT REAL, but it is also not a viable way for an entire population of 300B+ to live on this planet of finite resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country is a house of cards, and the people that are going to deny that reality the hardest are the ones that have the farthest to fall. That explains the corporations, the politicians, and the people who played by all the rules who are still waiting (mostly in vain) for their

       Some people just aren't open to suggestion. They don't want to think for themselves, and they don't want to believe that their own government would fuck them over. If you want to spread the word about this you're better off talking to people you actually know, they are more likely to listen to you as you already have rapport with them. Don't waste your time trying to convert sheep, they will change their opinions only when the truth become more popular and mainstream. I remember how angry and involved I became after researching 911. Thing is it's just a small blip in all the injustices and corrupt practices going on in the world today. If you continue researching it will lead you on to much more interesting/unbelievable stuff. Keep up the good work.

       Actually, I think you guys don't think for yourselves.  You never actually question your own sources.  Just because you question the mainstream media sources does not mean you're a free thinker.
      </p>
      <p>
       100% of r/conspiracy comes from 3rd-tier universities anyways.  Just about every 9/11 conspiracy has been debunked, from squibs to "no plane debris at the pentagon".

       True, but even so, it's amazing how relentless use of 'terrorist' and 9/11 by the MSM (especially the scumbag Fox 'News' channel) have already turned people into Muslim-hating monsters. These mainstream outlets never deviate from the script, ensuring that people will be beaten into believing it through repeated indoctrination.

       Not sure why you're getting downvoted. This thread adds nothing original, nothing new, offers no interesting take -- nothing. It's a statement (that isn't even remoooootely true), and then a list of comments.

       People aren't ignorant. Like Jrad27 said, some people HONESTLY can't cope with the concept you're putting in front of them.

       Short story: I used to work really late nights at the old job, so there was a lot of time to sit around and bullshit. There were three of us that would discuss these things all the time. One guy was a total conspiracy nut, I was the moderate, and the third was a Marine ex-cop debunker. Basically, when it came down to it, the Marine told us that he COULDN'T accept that his Government was involved in 9/11, because for him that would mean he would need to change EVERYTHING about the way he lived. He would need to get his family to safety and spend all of his resources preparing for whatever was sure to follow next. So, he chose to believe the State line because it meant he wouldn't have to throw his entire life into upheaval.

       And there you have it. What we're up against is an entire populace that has never, and doesn't really expect to have to experience any strife. Americans are raised to believe that if they toe the party line and keep their nose to the grindstone, they will be rich just like the powerful some day. This is reinforced by every conceivable media outlet that Americans are exposed to on a daily basis. Some people are too weak to forgo the promise in front of them for the reality behind them, no matter how urgent.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an American that is aware of all of this, I'm beginning to accept that some people are just going to march face first into whatever the Corporations have planned for us, while shrugging their shoulders and accepting it. Because they feel that if they are good boys and girls then the boogeymen can't touch them and they can lead happy, fulfilling lives. The only reason people are becoming aware is because of the Information Age showing us that not only is The American Dream NOT REAL, but it is also not a viable way for an entire population of 300B+ to live on this planet of finite resources.

       This country is a house of cards, and the people that are going to deny that reality the hardest are the ones that have the farthest to fall. That explains the corporations, the politicians, and the people who played by all the rules who are still waiting (mostly in vain) for their

       Why do I always get such ridiculous, and senseless, responses in r/conspiracy?  Must be the 3rd tier education part.
