<p>It irks me to no end when people refuse to learn about the evidence that has been building up, showing that the entire situation was probably a domestic terror incident (committed by the extremely wealthy and/or the government against the citizenry) and that the only thing an international terrorist group had to do with it was being handed the blame. It&#39;s as if the horror of the event excuses them from having to be willing to read about the scientific facts surrounding the fall of the buildings.</p>

<p>I make F7U12 &quot;wtf&quot; and &quot;abhorrent&quot; faces all the time when I realize that there are redditors who actually think terrorists in planes took those buildings down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well how could the events be any other way than they are? How could the official story be bogus, and yet many many many many people believe it to be true?</p>

<p>I had to ask myself &#39;Are there any other instances of a mammoth amount of relatively smart people believing a lie?&#39; and to this I could not answer because my own life, traditions and trajectory were solidified in beliefs that I could not question.</p>

<p>And if I could not question my own life, I could not question anything else. Yet I still felt uneasy when looking at videos and reading discussions about 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan and other military endeavors. </p>

<p>So I began a 2-year journey (this involved lots of bible reading) into how rational and worthwhile my relationship with Christ was... and really, who WAS Christ? </p>

<p>Once my faith began to crack, it was made crystal clear to me how people could believe a lie and how people could fight to make sure nothing shakes that lie, lest their whole lives and understanding of reality come crashing down...into their own footprint.</p>

<p>Today I would not consider myself a truther, nor would I call myself an atheist. In both the sense of God and that faithful day, I remain to be an agnostic and unless proof descends from the sky regarding either matter, I will likely expire as an agnostic.</p>

<p>edit: between 2001 and 2005 I was <strong>very</strong> interested in going to war for revenge... now I am going to University to study political science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I commend you for searching your soul for answers to the questions you are not allowed to ask.</p>

<p>Maybe this will help you: Atheist has, unfortunately, a broad connotation in modern society. It&#39;s become a religion of its own in many senses of the word. I am not Atheist.</p>

<p>I am non-theist. I prescribe to no religion nor God nor gods. I am human, and live my life in ways that I feel are a benefit to society, because I benefit greatly from society myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re missing my point. Society, which is dominated by theists, defines atheism a specific way. And Atheists (capital A) adhere to a specific set of beliefs, as defined by Atheism. And as much as Atheism is a correct viewpoint (as I observe the universe), the term has a very negative connotation even in modern society. That is changing, thankfully.</p>

<p>I call myself non-theist specifically to avoid being cast as a <em>follower</em> of someone else&#39;s viewpoint. I have derived my views of the universe from my own experiences, not because I believe someone else&#39;s experiences are correct.</p>

<p>You can choose to be offended by that if you will. That&#39;s up to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;jadedness&#39; is a phase of it too, it&#39;s the ego lashing out at the world it sees as <em>unfair &amp; unfavorable</em>.  It&#39;s the ego that needs to distinguish between right &amp; wrong (leading to judgment)...rising above that you might notice there is no difference (only actions and consequences, good comes from evil).  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I have an ego too and it gets the best of me many times...but I believe true inner-peace is within <em>everyone&#39;s</em> grasp.</p>

<p>A somewhat related question: what&#39;s the goal once you&#39;ve established inner peace? I mean, is it just a waiting game after that? Or what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Goals are based on time, which is an illusion created by our mind so the ego can exist...there&#39;s only <em>now</em>.  Start watching your thoughts, and you&#39;ll notice just how often you spend outside of &#39;now&#39; (past, future).  Time is <em>always</em> haunting us, your ego will continually punish you for mistakes in the past..but only if you let it.</p>

<p>This book really helped me...might help you too:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, very true about the gain.  Just trying to clarify for ayb without looking up the details.</p>

<p>I own both, and I do not hold any US stocks right now, other than some indexes in my 401k.</p>

<p>The problem with gold and silver is that the value doesn&#39;t really go up.  The value of the dollar is going down, but you are not really gaining any purchasing power by holding gold and silver.</p>

<p>Say you have $10,000 USD in Silver in 2008, and the value of that doubles to $20,000 USD in 2011.  Well, the value of the dollar has dropped almost in half, and the cost of buying/selling silver and the risk of storing it, might make it a zero sum.</p>

<p>That is to say, for $5 you could have gone to McD&#39;s in 2008.  Today it cost $10 to go to Chipotle.  A silver eagle in 2008 would have bought you three meals, and today it will still buy you three meals of the same quality.  In the 1890&#39;s it would have likely got you enough whiskey to get a good buzz.  But, it&#39;s value hasn&#39;t changed.  The value of the currency measuring it has changed.</p>

<p>So, the decline of the US is sad.  And, holding gold and silver is a good way to avoid the decline; but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a great way to get ahead.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend <a href="http://dont-tread-on.me/the-silver-bullet-and-the-silver-shield/">this article</a>. You will see that silver has enormous upside potential for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>With both silver and gold, historically their increase in price has more or less reflected the depreciation in the value of the currency they are priced in, as you say. However, there are two additional effects at work in recent times:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The prices of gold and silver have been artificially suppressed for ten years or more and have yet to catch up to fair market value.</p></li>
<li><p>The dollar currency bubble is in the process of popping, and it may be the biggest market bubble of all time. When it pops, as when any bubble pops, there will be an overreaction that will take precious metals temporarily far above their fair market value, even relative to the collapsing currency. The last time there was a spike like this was in 1980 when silver hit $50. This time will be much crazier.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There is yet a third unusual condition that applies just to silver, which is both a monetary metal and a heavily used industrial metal with special, inimitable properties.</p>

<ul>
<li>Much more silver is used and not recycled than is mined, and the supply of silver available to mine is running out. Silver may be the first element to go extinct, by the year 2025 according to the USGS.</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://dont-tread-on.me/the-silver-bullet-and-the-silver-shield/">This is the best up-to-date and comprehensive article available about silver</a>. I&#39;ve researched it all myself, and been in communication with the author Chris Duane. The article covers every aspect of buying silver, including the political and philosophical dimensions.

    <div class="md"><p>I once had a great evening discussing 9-11 with my Grandfather who is probably the most conservative member of my quite liberal family, and my cousins husband who was currently on leave from his third assignment in Iraq. I have made it well known to my family and friends that although I can not tell them exactly what did happen that day, I can tell them that what we were told happened is bullshit. The three of us discovered that even though each of us had to publicly display different opinions, or lack there of, we all in our hearts and minds knew we we&#39;re being lied too, and that only one group of people could truly be blamed for lying to us... our government. People know, they just don&#39;t necessarily feel the need to play those cards just yet, or they are incapable of dealing with the knowledge still. What struck me the most was that of the three of us, my grandfather was clearly the one who was most fearful of the knowledge, the Marine seemed relieved that he could talk openly with someone who knew as much or more about it as he did... but my grandfather, the no bs, take care of business type... you could see the strain in his face as he accepted what his heart and mind had been telling him the whole time. Talk about it, be rational... don&#39;t approach people like they are mentally incapable of understanding the grand conspiracy... you will be amazed at what is really behind many peoples cocksure dismissal of any type of conspiracy. </p>

<p>Disclosure: I was a rabid Truther from Square One. When I saw the second plane hit, I screamed &quot;Bullshit!&quot; and read every theory I could find. A lot of people on message boards and sites like this one have opened my eyes to what is plausible and what is wide-eyed catshit. So this works both ways. Remember to LISTEN when you talk too. Enlightenment can come from the bottom of even the darkest pit. And the thing the terrorists who pulled this off fear most is agreement amongst the underclass.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey lafeeverte17,</p>

<p>You are not alone in your observations. But allow me to pull you back from the brink of irreversible irritation..</p>

<p>I started looking into 911truth around 2003. Back then to hold such an opinion that 911 was an inside job, or that the towers came down due to cd was very much a quietly held affair. The information was coming in but it was all quietly brewing on message boards and infowars.com style websites. You couldnt mention the idea to people around you without people completely freaking out, and calling you a terrorist.</p>

<p>Things have changed MASSIVELY since then.</p>

<p>911Truth is now a world wide phenomenon. People are talking about it with a level of ease between themselves now that back in 2003 was at a level I could have only dreamed of.</p>

<p>Reddit, by it&#39;s nature is a hive minded populous - not helped by it&#39;s affection for karma too. There&#39;s a lot of clever people on the site but what 911Truth requires of people on Reddit and the world is really quite a leap of perspective, and as open-minded and as intellectually savvied as many Redditors like to think of themselves, they still reflect an underlying banal stupidity that afflicts the rest of the &quot;modern&quot; world, incapable of making the leap required for taking 911 on board.</p>

<p>The important thing to realise is that you are going through a process of accepting the &quot;question&quot;, and to accept that others may be yet to go through it.</p>

<p>Your irritation comes from knowing that what you know can be realised by others on Reddit, but that they don&#39;t comes as a disappointment.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take it personally. Some fuckers will never get it. Just like there&#39;ll be some things that you&#39;ll never get.</p>

<p>I take a lot of strength from Ghandis quote with regards to this: &quot;Even if the truth is known by a minority of one, the truth is still the truth&quot;.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve found through the process is that the longer you stick with investigating it, the more at peace you become with it. Sometimes the frustration and horror we find when others let us down in our expectations for them to understand something is actually a residue of our own doubts still lingering that we are still uncomfortable with our findings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s imperative to keep doing the research, finding peace, seeing the way through, and in doing / demonstrating so - joining with the others who are persistently removing the bricks that will let 911Truth make its way to the surface.</p>

<p>At the end of the day - I think the 911 Truth movement is motivated by a very noble urge for Truth and the peace that can be gained from it. Keeping your eye on the ball with regards to this is your job as an individual without letting the trolls get in the way.</p>

<p>Take a look at the 911Truth movement - it has it&#39;s own vociferous infighting between camps - if we in the 911Truth movement were to simply stand strong on our basic premise that there are simply serious questions to be asked, and we will not be moved in asking them, 911Truth would end up on every cereal box around the world.</p>

<p>The fact it hasnt happened yet doesnt mean it&#39;s not going to happen, just that there&#39;s more work to do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in no doubt the day is coming. Since getting involved with it back in 2003, all I can see is a pressure cooker of information, bursting increasingly at the seams.</p>

<p>I expect when it comes, it&#39;ll be as quick as the Berlin Wall coming down - but until then amuse yourself with the amazing psychological insights you can have with this phenomenon - because once the damn bursts, this seemingly unassailable mountain of ignorance will have evaporated.</p>

<p>Eat it up. It&#39;s a smorgasbord of opportunity to not just study 911, but a myriad of topics - hypnotism, propaganda, cognitive dissonance, belief, nationalism...the list goes on.</p>

<p>Sorry for the splurge! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people wouldn&#39;t be opposed to admitting that they just don&#39;t know what happened on 9/11.  And most people would agree that it&#39;s certainly possible (however unlikely) that 9/11 was a live version of Northwoods.</p>

<p>But everyone feels helpless, so why even talk about it.  Look at it this way... something like 80% of the US wants marijuana either decriminalized or legalized, but it won&#39;t happen and people accept that.  And this is something that affects millions of Americans every single day.  It&#39;s probably the biggest single example of how the wishes of the people don&#39;t really matter.</p>

<p>In that context, look at something like 9/11... do you ever think anything will come of it?  We&#39;re still throwing people in prison over a plant that grows out of the ground.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nationalism is taught at a very young age, and one of the most important aspects is <em>we are better than they are.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy for someone trained by American media to believe that 9/11 was an <em>outside</em> job but they&#39;ll feel a primal abhorrence when you suggest that Americans were involved, because <em>we are better than they are.</em></p>

<p>Not too long ago I asked my mom (a staunch Republican, and 9/11 official story proponent) the following question:</p>

<p>If 19 people planned and trained to kill 3,000 others to promote their agenda, why couldn&#39;t they have been Americans?</p>

<p>Her only answer was a look of confusion that read: &quot;<em>we are better than they are</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>We are not. We are humans, just like <em>them</em> and any one of us is just as likely to be as evil as the worst of us.</p>

<p>The follow up question, and the one that sealed the deal for me, was:</p>

<p>If you believe 19 conspirators could execute the attacks from <em>outside</em> the power structure of America, why is it harder to believe that 19 conspirators couldn&#39;t execute the attack from <strong>inside</strong> the power structure of America?</p>

<p>I could tell that I was shaking her ground, and being as old as she is, it&#39;s not worth it so I discontinued the conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not, there are well funded groups within the US that have a very active interest in controlling public opinion. In fact, as reddit has grown, I&#39;m sure their interest in spinning reddit opinions has grown. Your reddit sample is probably not a true sample, but is designed to give to appear as a significant number of true believers. It is by design, they are working on their public opinion models and have devoted a large number of human and monetary resources to attempt to disseminate disinformation, cloud discussions, and spin the issue in the public airwaves outside of the MSN. They can&#39;t control the internet, so they are attempting to spin it. It took me a while to catch on to their tactics, but once you are aware, it is clear as daylight. A significant number of redditors are paid to astro-turf certain topics, and this is one with a high priority from day one. Think about the implications if the full truth were to be widely disseminated. It&#39;s quite a mindboggling thought experiment. </p>

<p>How can they be peer reviewed if the editor quit when she found out something got published and she didn&#39;t know about it?  What kind of peer review process is that?   It doesn&#39;t speak highly of Bentham.  I&#39;m not sure but I think the word &quot;Open&quot; is describing the journal.   The only evidence to the contrary I&#39;ve heard is the authors claim that they had it peer reviewed.  That should be the journal&#39;s job.  What evidence have you found that they have a proper peer review process?</p>

<p>Agreed. I&#39;m no scientist, so I don&#39;t feel particularly qualified to debate all of the technical aspects of the issues (such as chemicals, theoretical physics and whatnot). However, I have always considered myself to be a logical person with good instincts. And after all of the pictures, videos, interviews and articles I&#39;ve seen on the subject, I find it extremely hard to believe that a substantial amount of pertinent information hasn&#39;t been withheld from and/or altered for public consumption.

<p>A journal is typically termed &quot;pay to publish&quot; if you just have to pay a filing fee to get the paper published.  Most respectable journals require that before the  paper is published it has to go through a peer review process and an an editorial process.  Neither of these two requirements seemed to have been met by bentham&#39;s guidlines.  The fact that the editor quit when she found out it was published is pretty good proof that it is, in fact, a pay to publish journal. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Your not alone, everyone thinks exactly like this.  Some people are aware that they aren&#39;t experts in every field and often what we may think is obvious isn&#39;t in fact obvious.  But this is all beside the point.  People claim science is on their side when in fact it&#39;s not.  You just pointed that out in your conclusion.  You are using your perception and experience to base your conclusions on.  That&#39;s what most people do, but don&#39;t believe that science backs you up.</p>

<p>Maybe we already have questioned it, and came to a different conclusion than you?</p>

<p>In the first week of the attack I thought: &quot;Hey I bet some conspiracy theorist is gonna say the towers were taken down by controlled demolition.&quot;  Then I thought: &quot;Nah no way, that&#39;s too stupid.&quot;  Then over the following years I was saddened by the onslaught of people clinging to this belief as if it were undeniable fact.  Sorry guys but you blew it by promoting bizarre theories instead of focusing on the more tangible aspects of the event.  </p>

<p>This is why most people no longer care: they are aware of your beliefs and have rejected them.  A long time ago.  It&#39;s like Jehovah&#39;s witnesses coming to your house every month - we get it, you believe, we are sheep, but no we don&#39;t want to hear about it yet again.</p>

I engaged him in a discussion about his job as a disinfo agent, and asked if the pay was good, or if he was forced to do it without pay. He exclaimed gratitude that someone finally understood his username, and then remarked that he was of course a troll. It was very odd, and after that the tone of our dialogue took a drastically respectful turn, and all of my comments with him lost 1 downvote each.

    <div class="md"><p>So, you saw the event, and part of your brain said &quot;Hey, that looks just like a controlled demolition...&quot;, and another part of your brain said, &quot;...yeah, I bet that&#39;s what the conspiracy nuts will say...&quot;.</p>

<p>i.e. you yourself began with a conflict between the evidence in front of your very eyes and the rationalisation you had already constructed, or the explanation you had been given. You chose the explanation over the only evidence you had. Perhaps others weren&#39;t so ready to accept the explanation, and more readily accepted what they saw?</p>

<p>Personally, I had the same reaction: &quot;This looks like a controlled demolition.&quot; Subsequently, official reports have failed (in my view) to explain the actual collapse of the towers, other than to say the collapse progressed as seen, following the weakening of steel supports.</p>

<p>Sure, there are whackjob crazy theories... I don&#39;t believe those either. But don&#39;t tar everyone with the same brush. Ultimately, I saw what looked like a totally unexpected explosive demolition, which <em>at the very time I saw it</em> seemed contradictory to my (admittedly limited) knowledge of physics and engineering, and have yet to see a satisfying explanation. I don&#39;t have the answers, but neither have I seen an answer that convinces me.</p>

<p>There <em>is</em> mounting physical and eye-witness testimony that the official explanations are wrong in some important respects... I do not like the direction the evidence seems to point. Some of the officially presented evidence is suspect. (esp. in relation to the pentagon attack, IMO).</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is that it was so obviously a nutty theory (to me) that I didn&#39;t expect anyone to take it seriously.  I never chose the &quot;explanation I had been given&quot;.  I looked at it, saw that two planes had crashed into the buildings, and decided that was sufficient to collapse the towers.  I didn&#39;t believe any extra explanation was necessary.</p>

<p>If you think people who reject the 911 truth movement are running to the cradle of government propaganda, you&#39;re simply deluded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just trying to highlight that on some level, you recognised that there was the appearance of a controlled demolition, or you wouldn&#39;t have thought what you did. You chose to dismiss that fleeting thought, and in your view you were correct to do so. However, others did not dismiss it and would disagree.</p>

<p>I also saw that planes had hit the towers, but my prior knowledge of high-rise fires, and knowing that the twin towers had been specifically designed to cope with aircraft collisions, gave me no reason at all to suspect the buildings would collapse, and then the manner of their falling contradicted my expectations. Certainly, planes hit the buildings, but I was genuinely surprised at what happened next. This has caused me to be extra-skeptical of subsequent government explanations.</p>

<p>Also, most people are not &#39;running to the cradle of government propaganda&#39;. I certainly am not. To be honest, most people probably haven&#39;t given it much thought at all. Nobody &#39;runs to the cradle of propaganda&#39;. People may be fooled by it, or not.</p>

<p>There is certainly some level of &quot;cover-up&quot; over 9/11, and much of it may be understandable and not nefarious, but just political, face-saving, and/or minimising panic. However, some of it seems hard to account for. As to delusion, I think I&#39;m just extremely skeptical of the official account. I would counter that anyone who believes every word of the official reports has not applied any critical thinking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve discussed the issue with multiple people: not only have they not done any research into the scientific evidence supporting controlled demolition of the Towers and Building 7, many aren&#39;t even aware that a third building was brought down, nor did they even bother to review the official reports made by the government. I highly doubt your explanation is a plausible one. It&#39;s more likely that they are just too scared/lazy to care and the amount of victims is an easy excuse to steer clear of an actual thoughtful analysis.</p>

What did get me suspicious, in the first week, was the recovery of the passport of Satam Al Suqami (one of the terrorists) on the street below the towers.That a passport of a terrorist managed to get out of a plane engulfed in flames and land on the streets of New York is beyond reason.

<p>No, never.  I haven&#39;t seen Loose Change or been exposed to any 911 Truth.  I am just a dumb sheep that believes whatever the government and media tells me.  I&#39;d rather watch Oprah and go to WalMart because my weak mind can&#39;t handle being exposed to the painful truth.</p>

<p>But then I watched V for Vendetta and learnt about Operation Northwoods and became a superhero visiting internet forums where it became apparent that anyone who doesn&#39;t join the 911 cult is a blind fool who will perish in hell for their ignorance!  ahahaha!  I am helping the world now, in my own way, by spamming everyone I can and getting mad at them if they reject my insane blather.</p>

<p>Fortunately there still exists, hidden within the internet, echo chambers of people who all agree with me.  Reddit is not one of these echo chambers, alas, so the only possible explanation is that it is full of trolls, government agents, and shopping-mall morons who believe the propaganda.

By over-simplifying the position of all conspiracies revolving around corporations and government you deny the position that many conspiracy theorists hold that its actually a small group of super elite financial dynasties who control the policies of these corporations and thus the lobbyists from those corporations who influence the politicians.  Its the eye at the top of the pyramid.  Who cares if corporations/banks fail if it fits into the overall plan?  Those corporations and governments are just patsies.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your willingness to discuss this.  It sometimes seems that people have an inability to entertain an argument without becoming afraid that they&#39;ll adhere to it.  You are right that a lot of this is connecting dots, but part of the reason people start believing in the conspiracies is the overwhelming number of dots to connect.  This does not validate the conspiracy.</p>

<p>Here is how blowing up the World Trade Center would be more profitable than letting it stand.  The 9/11 attacks were a pretext to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  These wars destabilized two countries allowing the United States to install puppet governments in order to control the oil reserves in these countries (maybe even the heroin trade in Afghanistan).  Now our involvement in Middle Eastern affairs seems to be less odd because we&#39;ve been doing it for so long.  Now we&#39;re talking about going to Libya, which frankly I find disturbing.  The fact that Haliburton and its subsidiaries were involved at all in the Iraq rebuilding efforts is a little <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0331-01.htm">fishy</a> to say the least.  The companies manufacturing weapons benefited from the war, obviously.  The war demonized Islam which benefited the position of the Israelis in regard to how they&#39;re treating the Palestinians.  Larry Silverstein benefited from the insurance money after the towers fell.  Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden did not benefit from the attack, however.  The last thing you want is the US military knocking on your door.  Its debatable if Al-Qaeda exists in the capacity that we were led to believe post-9/11.  So much of the information we have about them comes from the CIA and they have to protect their own interests (like ousting the democratically elected president of Iran and installing the puppet government of the Shah, just to name one instance).  There are lots of people that benefited from 9/11 and few, if any of them were Islamic extremists.</p>

<p>Bankers benefited from the wars because they loaned the money to the US government, which used it to fund the military industrial complex.  You cannot justify the huge military budget we have if there are no wars going on.  &quot;Defense,&quot; doesn&#39;t account for our spending rate.  The thing is that all these wars require money and so the people loaning the money to the warring countries always benefit.  This is how the, &quot;global eltite,&quot; profit from this scheme.  They fund both sides of a war, so it doesn&#39;t matter who wins.  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/sep/25/usa.secondworldwar">Prescott Bush</a> is purported to have profited from the funding of the financial backers of the Nazis.</p>

<p>The reason that they chose a target like the World Trade Center over something like the Statue of Liberty is very simple.  Body count.  If you want to rally the people in support of a war that they might not support otherwise a whole lot of people need to die to justify it.</p>

<p>I could go on and on, but I&#39;d like to hear what you have to say to what I&#39;ve written so far.</p>

<p>I definitely could be wrong.  I would only say I&#39;m 80-90 percent sure of the events of 9-11.  I mean what the fuck, I wasn&#39;t there, for starters.  </p>

<p>The point of this thread isn&#39;t to debate the evidence really, it&#39;s to discuss the attitudes of people regarding their 911 beliefs.  What I&#39;m working so hard to tell everyone is that not everyone who rejects &quot;911 truth&quot; is a dumb sheep, that there are people who have researched &quot;911 truth&quot; and simply remained skeptical of the claims.  </p>

<p>But please don&#39;t take that as a false duality - I haven&#39;t chosen to side with the government&#39;s take on things either.  It&#39;s not so black-and-white, though I will admit there are plenty of dumbasses in the world who sop up the propaganda without question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People were fooled that day Sir.  They think they saw it impact.  All witnesses and their testimony taken by the army center of military history has witnesses all either have them in positions that show they could not have seen the impact directly as their view was obscured.  Any other witnesses to the impact......well, are suspect.  There was a string of people along Washington Blvd.  Those people all worked for USAToday!  All of those witnesses headed by Mike Walters all say they saw the ACTUAL impact.  </p>

<p>The problem is you don&#39;t hear about them because even THEY prove it all bullshit.  All those witnesses describe  the plane in some sort of bank or turn before leveling out.  The Radar data, the actual Flight data recorder which was provided by your Gov&#39;t, all show the plane in a straight line coming in from way far out.  A perfectly straight line.  No deviation.  They made a model of this, played it before court etc etc.  It can&#39;t be both ways.  You can have the plane in a turn and the FDR from the actual plane in a straight line.  No data is missed, nothing from FDR&#39;s.  That means the 4 YEARS before they provided that to the public, means they could have done anything they wanted to it.  The real event witnessed and corroborated by those witnesses was correct, the plane was in a bank.  Can&#39;t be denied.  The FDR is bullshit, the radar data is bullshit.  The crap they provided to support their story is bullshit.</p>

<p>Beyond that the plane was on the NORTH side of the Citgo Gas station.  I can&#39;t stress that enough.  That proves the plane could not have hit the building just by itself.  There are 15 witnesses to that, it cannot be undone.  On top of that the Gov&#39;t already changed their story through Lloyd England who you will see in CIT&#39;s other documentaries.  </p>

<p>Please watch them, and ask questions, the simple stuff.  How does a plane on the North side make a SOUTH side approach damage path??</p>

<p>The one I like best is, they have 86 video&#39;s from the event that they say would all show the plane impacting the building right??  The plane couldn&#39;t be anywhere else, it must have hit right??  The tapes would all show the exact same thing.  Yet they don&#39;t want to show those to you at all!  They prove their story correct supposedly, but you have to take their word for it because they won&#39;t show you!  Can you believe that?  Take their word for it?</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t they want to show you VIDEO proof of the event to put this whole thing to rest?  Why wouldn&#39;t they?  They don&#39;t have anything to hide right?  </p>

<p>Think about it, ask questions.  The alternative is, we&#39;re all being &quot;trolled&quot; in a way you can&#39;t possibly imagine.  Which is precisely why you have to find out and be aware who is fucking with you.  We were manipulated into going to war in the Mid-east.  Look at what has happened since then, you think that all just happened because of 13 hijackers??  No, they knew what they were doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even watch it?  If you had, you would have noticed, that the plane does a turn.  They guy in the video even comments about it.  Watch it again.  @ 2:50  </p>

<p>&quot;But instead of going straight they decide to make this turn&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad i didn&#39;t waste much of my time on this.  In the future, you should at least watch the crap before you post it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol, Mr reality engineer.  You said that there were MORE tangible aspects of the event that you&#39;re aware of but you yourself still don&#39;t believe nor do you care enough to confirm those &quot;tangible aspects&quot; true or false.  You didn&#39;t look into them you&#39;re just so confident in your knowledge or lack of it that you couldn&#39;t be wrong about it?</p>

<p>What a crock of shit.  Reality engineer.....apt name, but its not working.  You see all those downvotes?  I know they don&#39;t really mean much but they show you&#39;re in the minority.  You&#39;re going to be working hard spewing your bullshit.  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s silly that you think I haven&#39;t looked into things.  This is just a typical assumption you see from 911 truthers: they assume those that disagree with them are ignorant.  But really all I&#39;ve done is come to a different conclusion than you.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve swallowed up the conspiracies while I&#39;ve remained a skeptic.</p>

<p>The demolition, missiles, free falling, thermites, etc... are all fantastical claims that have been debunked or discredited. Stop tarnishing a perfectly legitimate inquiry to the failings(intentional or not) of the intelligence community with this rubbish, thanks. </p>

<p>Agreed, though, don&#39;t forget some of the departmental cover-ups of ineptness during the investigation.  </p>
