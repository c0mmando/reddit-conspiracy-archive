       I´ll try to be as clear as possible since english is not my first language.
A couple of days after 9/11 my uncle forwarded an email about a ufo that appeared in one of the shots. I didn´t really believe it but after seeing that shot in the news it was really clear. It was one of the shots that, at least in my country, they showed every time they were talking about 9/11, alongside with several others. Whenever I heard they where talking about 9/11 I would go to the tv and look for the ufo, and there it was, hovering one of the towers for a while and then flying away. Still skeptic I kept watching for several days every time I was able, it could be a big bird flying in a strange way or something, but, to my surprise, one day they didn´t show that specific shot again, ever, and I´ve never seen it since. I´ve searched for it, but never found anything. I´m not that much into conspiracy theories, but I believe some things are kept secret.
I´ve never been able to understand this, and I would like to.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: looking for info on a 9/11 ufo, not the fake shot from the helicopter, the shot that was shown for some time in the news alongside all the other footage.

       Slow motion view of a black object coming from top left (around 3:00 mark).  The video says it might be a motor, however, it comes from ABOVE and BEHIND the impact site, so that's not even a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it is, it was on a collision course with the ground.

       I think I see the projectile you are talking about there.  If it's what I think it is, there are many that believe it's a missile shot form the plain.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is covered in a few documentaries.  The first was 9/11 in Plane Site, but there are newer ones that provide more details.  I'll give the points.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        There is a flash before each plane hits the building.  It's visible in most all videos.
       </li>
       <li>
        There is one good photo of the bottom of one of the planes, and it shows a pod on the bottom.  The photo was used on a national magazine cover.
       </li>
       <li>
        Each impact results in a projectile as shown in the video above.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's suggested that these were missiles.

       The only argument I would have against the missile idea is that if watch the video, the "missile" goes either through or behind the WTC building during the impact.  Which is either a collosal failure or not a missile.  Had it been a missile, we would have seen or heard something about a missile hitting somewhere else in or around the WTC complex.

       I couldn't see a bird in that video. Also, it's edited, and likely encoded multiple times. TLC didn't capture any original video.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what the flash and the pod are, but the are very real and they exist in the original video.

       The attacks are interesting to study, because every element of them seems more odd the more you look into it.

       So a bird flew past the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can clearly see the object pass in FRONT of the smoke plume and towers.  The camera is focused on the impact site several thousand feet away.  Even movement is not blurred.  The object however is blurred, as you would expect if it were MUCH closer to the camera.  Like say, a bird flying past 20 feet away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Birds do in fact exist in New York.  But I wouldn't put it past the troofers to claim that they're all holograms too.

       I was thinking pretty much the same thing, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as far as the truther movement, you shouldn't go so far as to lump them all into the same category.  Sure there are those out there who believe UFOs were involved, but in the actual destruction, I don't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal belief that is contrary to the 9/11 Commission Report, is that the towers were brought down by controlled demolition.  I'm an Architect, I know what kind of physical stress it takes to bring down a towering sky scraper at near free fall velocity, and a passenger jet full of fuel is simply not enough.  At most, the supports would have failed on the side of the impact, leading to the top section of the tower falling down and towards the weak area.  The floors below the impact site suffered minimal damage as a result of the impact, and there is just no physical explanation for the towers falling into their own footprint as a result of a plane impact.

       What a coincidence, I´m an architecture student! There´s been some talk at a class in my university about fire melting steel at pretty low temperatures and the heat propagating really fast, regarding 9/11. It could kind of explain the falling on their own footprint, but it does not explain the free fall velocity part.
I don´t know what to believe about what happened, but I saw that strange ufo footage disapear from the news .

       Well, I can tell you this much.  Even if the jet fuel burned to a high enough temperature to melt the steel, the tower still would have fallen with a bias toward the point of impact.  As steel melts, it gets weaker, turning from a solid, becomes increasingly malleable, and finally melts.  This would have led to certain supports weakening before others, causing the floors above the impact to tilt toward the failing members.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a basic idea.  If you have a chair, and you kick out the back left corner, you expect the chair to fall to that side.  You don't expect the other three legs to buckle under the pressure, having the chair fall straight down on top of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Changed "gelatinous or colloidal" to "increasingly malleable."  This is more accurate.

       The way I understand it is that steel propagates heat very rapidly trough its mass, like when you heat the tip of a metal bar and the other tip, the one you are holding, becomes hot very fast. The entire steel structure would be mostly at the same temperature at any given time, so the entire building would melt at the same time when it reaches the melting temperature.
This is my basic understanding, I don´t know what I´m talking about really.

       Sure, heat propogates fast, but not far.  An impact on the 80th floor would not lead to molten metal at ground level.  At most, 2 or 3 floors below and above the impact, I imagine, would be affected as far as the heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, another small experiment you can try.  If you get a bunsen burner and a nail, you can heat up one end of the nail to the point that it glows, while the other end remains metallic in color.  The heat propagates, sure, but it's definitely going to be hotter nearest the point of heating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, the metal will get hot, but it's only going to deform and melt nearest the heat source.

       Now, this particular clip relates to a document released awhile back that discussed a plan by the government to create a hologram machine that could fly through the air and simulate an airplane.  The idea would be that it would fly next to the projection and could simulate both the shape and the sound of an aircraft.
      </p>

       This isn't the exact document I'm referring to (still haven't been able to find it again), but it's a similar idea AND it relies on the use of Strontium Barium Niobate, the very materials believed to compose the "chemtrails" that have been cropping up all over the globe.

       Really interesting, but that was not what I saw. The ufo was a wthite dot, not black, and it was hovering the tower for some time and then left very fast.

       This is in regard to a "mysterious white plane."

       It wasn't hovering, per se, but it does resemble a bird in the first shot.

       Still not the one I´m looking for, the thing I saw was clearly hovering, and then flew away, it was on the right side of the frame also.

       Now, this particular clip relates to a document released awhile back that discussed a plan by the government to create a hologram machine that could fly through the air and simulate an airplane.  The idea would be that it would fly next to the projection and could simulate both the shape and the sound of an aircraft.

       Well, I can tell you this much.  Even if the jet fuel burned to a high enough temperature to melt the steel, the tower still would have fallen with a bias toward the point of impact.  As steel melts, it gets weaker, turning from a solid, becomes increasingly malleable, and finally melts.  This would have led to certain supports weakening before others, causing the floors above the impact to tilt toward the failing members.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a basic idea.  If you have a chair, and you kick out the back left corner, you expect the chair to fall to that side.  You don't expect the other three legs to buckle under the pressure, having the chair fall straight down on top of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  Changed "gelatinous or colloidal" to "increasingly malleable."  This is more accurate.
