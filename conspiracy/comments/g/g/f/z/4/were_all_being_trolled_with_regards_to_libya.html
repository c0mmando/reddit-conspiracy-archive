        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I find it interesting how before we got involved in Libya the rebels were spoken of like a substantial fighting force. They took over damn near the whole country quickly like they knew what they were doing. </p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve dipped our toe into the water, suddenly the rebels are hopeless. Not fighters at all. They&#39;re lazy, I&#39;ll equipped, unorganized and barely able to fire their dirty old Kalashnikov. </p>

<p>Let me guess, they&#39;re going to need more help. </p>

<p>I instantly doubted the woman that stormed into the hotel claiming she was raped. Smelled strongly of propaganda. </p>

<p>Now every report I hear from Libya is nothing but straight up propaganda. With a little more prodding, the public will soon give permission to help arm the rebels and finally the coalition will step in and do the job themselves. </p>

<p>Moammar is Saddam all over again. Remember just last year when everyone loved this guy and the new leaf he was turning over. Fucking even released the Lockerbie bomber to him! Now he&#39;s public enemy number one. </p>

<p>Iraq, Afganistan, now Libya! </p>

<p>Thanks Barack!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get kids to sacrifice themselves by giving them no other options for their future. Where do the military get their force from? New York? Los Angeles? Houston? </p>

<p>No - it comes from <em>Dogshit, Nebraska</em> or <em>Hopeless Gulch, Arizona</em>. For may young people there they have little other option than to join the military if they want to make a decent living. Sadly with that comes one hell of a price. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. Libya is the highest ranking country in Africa according to the Human Development Index which is is composed from data on life expectancy, education and per-capita GNI (as an indicator of standard of living or income). Gadaffi has done a lot for his country and his people while he has been in power, but the US, EU and NATO want to undermine that. If they were really doing this to &quot;save&quot; the innocent people of the country they would be doing something about what is going on in Yemen, Bahrain, Ivory Coast, Syria etc. too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Barack <em>Nothing</em>. Sorry to bust your bubble there, but this is how US Politics works. No matter what smiling face you see on TV, the agenda will go on as planned. The thing is, people are incessantly bombarded by falsehood from sources like Fox, trying to convince you that we have a huge Muslim problem, or that your neighbor might be a &#39;terrorist&#39;. </p>

<p>Good to see people waking up though. </p>

<p>I thought she said that Gadaffi was taking incubators out of hospitals and throwing babies on the sidewalk ... ?</p>

<p>Or did he attack some ships in the Gulf of Tonkin? I can&#39;t remember.</p>

<p>Oh, I know, Libya is slant-drilling into Kuwait. Yeah, that&#39;s what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rebels are not an organised military. They&#39;re loosely banded individuals. They lack military training. When they originally took positions, they&#39;ll have taken them not for superior firepower or tactics, but because the government never expected to have to use their weapons against their own people.</p>

<p>Once they fought back, the rebels wussed out and fled. They&#39;re not an organised unit.</p>

<p>Our options are, get the fuck out, keep to a no fly zone, take out Ghadaffi or go all in. I suspect that the longer we&#39;re there, the more the pressure to go all in will be.</p>
