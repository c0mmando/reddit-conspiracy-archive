       I'm astonished at the crazy things coming out of his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we should consider the possibility that he's a deep-cover democrat, who's out to damage the vote for the Republican party in 2012, just as Ralph Nader did to the democrats in 2000.

       edit: I really meant "split the vote", not "damage the vote".

       the correct question is who really believes there is a difference beyond rhetoric and positions on entertainment-value political football issue between the high democratic party and the high republican party officials?
      </p>
      <p>
       hello?
      </p>
      <p>
       this shit has been going on for how many decades now, republican after democrat and democrat after republican, still no change. the official political system of the US at the higher public office level is a game-show to distract an ignorant population, it is wholly owned and operated by international finance and corporations, and will NEVER be used to change anything for the better, regardless of which one of their employees we elect, while the media is used to disguise the extent of political indifference between the major parties with extremist talking-heads at either end of the spectrum and candidates like Sarah Palin/Obama.

       yes, political football issues, 'reproductive rights', gay rights, political football issues(what in our society currently amounts to "women are looked down on by christian fundamentalists for having abortions, gay people are looked down on by christian fundamentalists for preferring one warm, dark hole to another an don't want them to be able to call one another husbands or wives") are utterly insignificant in the scope of real issues facing the country and the world, if women or gay people were being imprisoned or hanged for being the way that they are or having an abortion, then it might measure differently.

       There's no conspiracy here.  Donald Trump is a massive attention whore who loves being in the headlines.  He's only doing it for bragging rights and to add "former Presidential candidate" to his resume.  Claiming that his run is anything more than ego-stroking is giving this man entirely too much credit.

       He's made the mistake of peaking way too early and also he's the living antithesis of the early primary states which usually make or break political outsiders like Trump... now if he bought a horse ranch in Montana and started collecting antique guns... he might have a chance.

       Trump is the most promising of the GOP candidates at this point. He's this year's Bob Dole. Nobody in the field right now is going to beat Obama in 2012, they might as well make t entertaining.

       Whilst I agree Trump is just ego stroking (the idea of him being president, even with your countries corrupt and laughable electoral system), I just wouldn't write it off, for one simple reason.  The same reason G.W.Bush was forced on the world...

       However, if he does drop out early (which he will), and endorse the acceptable candidate, it could allow the GOP to regain all the Tea-Party loons who followed Trump in the short time he was 'viable'.

       I find it very telling that, for all his bullshit (and the fact that he was very liberal in a lot of ways up until this whole circus), he is actually getting some traction. Really highlights the issues with the Right and US politics in general.

       Also, Donald Trump is the absolute epitome of the ego-fucked republican mindset.  What you see as so crazy as to be a leftist conspiracy is actually just the blatant truth of what the right-wing has turned into.  Donald Trump is the poster-child for who is fucking the middle-class in the ass... and the truth of it is so appalling that your mind demands that it be a conspiriatorial lie.

       You're right.  After it became apparent the old methods of election fraud raised too many red flags, the right switched to electronic voting machines.  Still, I don't think Nader really made the difference.  Bush was going to win that election whatever it took.

       good on him! now all he has to do is become louder, dumber, and crazier, and he'll steal their entire voting base, get elected, and go immediately mad with power. he might be the only presidential candidate (other than H. ross perot) to NOT be intimidated by a 'trip to the woodshed'.

       It's not false-flagging or any other big political trick.  It's that the republican party is this stupid.  The only possible 'conspiracy' is that the cooler heads in the republican party is letting their far right bleed off their energy and idiocy in obama's reelection that they probably will not win so the serious candidates can step up in 2016.  Kinda like what I feel the democrats did in 2004; no way was Kerry their strongest candidate.

       This. The Democrats purposely fucked Howard Dean in '04 then gave him the chairmanship of the DNC as a consolation prize because it didn't fit their narrative. Obama was the guy since 8 years ago.

       Rick Perry is going to be the real RNC candidate. he's been angling for it for years, he's been masturbating in the shadow of W since W was governor of Tx. (Perry took over as Gov in Tx when W became POTUS, and has been Governor ever since)
      </p>
      <p>
       He's also a steaming, gaping anus whose arrogance and stupidity are only rivaled by the sensationalist jackasses at Fox. pay attention to his ass, he's the one who's going to be running for real.

       his goal is to benefit from his candidacy, in the same way that palin benefited from hers.  neither one of these candidates is thinking about the political party that they claim to represent.  they simply see it as an opportunity to fuel their sociopathic self absorbance, and are taking full advantage of it.  the real question is why are republican voters content with having imbeciles for leaders.

       Yeah that idea runs afoul of both Occam's and Hanlon's razor. This is who Trump is: a deluded narcissist. He's not a sophisticated guy. He has the world's most ridiculous comb-over, marries vacuous barbie dolls (contrast that with Obama's and Clinton's spouses), thinks hosting a D-list celebrity reality show is something to brag about, and would be broke if he'd actually tried to pay his companies debts instead of filing chapter 11. He's the world's richest clown.

       Sometimes the reality is right in front of your face and not some grand conspiracy.  Nader didn't run purely to ruin it for Gore or as some undercover GOP agent, he ran because he really believed in his ideas and thought the two party system was corrupt.  What Trump has said already is no more outrageous than other republican celebrities such as Palin, Bachmann, Beck, or any other the other bloviating talking heads.  The fact is that he is just stroking his ego while pandering to the hardline base of the right just like all the others are.  r/conspiracy needs to keep in mind that reality is often right in front of your face and that tree you are looking at is really an actual tree instead of a secret government listening center

       The difference between Trump and the others is that he might run as an independent.  If he does, then one explanation is that he's running as a spoiler.
