<p>Maybe we should consider the possibility that he&#39;s a deep-cover democrat, who&#39;s out to damage the vote for the Republican party in 2012, just as Ralph Nader did to the democrats in 2000.</p>

<p>edit: I really meant &quot;split the vote&quot;, not &quot;damage the vote&quot;.</p>

<p>hello?</p>

<p>this shit has been going on for how many decades now, republican after democrat and democrat after republican, still no change. the official political system of the US at the higher public office level is a game-show to distract an ignorant population, it is wholly owned and operated by international finance and corporations, and will NEVER be used to change anything for the better, regardless of which one of their employees we elect, while the media is used to disguise the extent of political indifference between the major parties with extremist talking-heads at either end of the spectrum and candidates like Sarah Palin/Obama. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that idea runs afoul of both Occam&#39;s and Hanlon&#39;s razor. This is who Trump is: a deluded narcissist. He&#39;s not a sophisticated guy. He has the world&#39;s most ridiculous comb-over, marries vacuous barbie dolls (contrast that with Obama&#39;s and Clinton&#39;s spouses), thinks hosting a D-list celebrity reality show is something to brag about, and would be broke if he&#39;d actually tried to pay his companies debts instead of filing chapter 11. He&#39;s the world&#39;s richest clown.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes the reality is right in front of your face and not some grand conspiracy.  Nader didn&#39;t run purely to ruin it for Gore or as some undercover GOP agent, he ran because he really believed in his ideas and thought the two party system was corrupt.  What Trump has said already is no more outrageous than other republican celebrities such as Palin, Bachmann, Beck, or any other the other bloviating talking heads.  The fact is that he is just stroking his ego while pandering to the hardline base of the right just like all the others are.  r/conspiracy needs to keep in mind that reality is often right in front of your face and that tree you are looking at is really an actual tree instead of a secret government listening center</p>

<p>It was stupid to run &quot;because of ideas&quot;, because he didn&#39;t have a snowflake&#39;s chance in hell of winning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thought the two party system was corrupt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, he was right about that.  Sadly, his actions resulted in the invasion of Iraq, and the death of close to a million people.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The difference between Trump and the others is that he might run as an independent.  If he does, then one explanation is that he&#39;s running as a spoiler.</p>
