        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My theory is they brainwashed this kid, manchurian candidate style, MKUltra, or whatever.</p>

<p>Before May 2010 he had the exact opposite opinion about hacking. In less than a year he&#39;s undergone a complete change in opinion, mannerisms, vocal cadence, and appearance. He&#39;s hardly recognizable compared to who he once was. This young man has had his spirit and soul drained from him.</p>

<p>Watch this and pay close attention to his mannerisms. This is him pre-May 2010 in unreleased footage for a documentary about hackers: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbsyjQh03Xs&amp;t=5m54s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbsyjQh03Xs&amp;t=5m54s</a></p>

<p>More interviews and documentary footage of Lamo from before his April run in with the police. Lamo in the Hackers Wanted documentary. He speaks eloquently and never loses focus of the subject matter. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGTYyltYi80">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGTYyltYi80</a></p>

<p>Here he is again in a Tech TV interview from 2003: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_SwtWu2HXk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_SwtWu2HXk</a></p>

<p>Now he struggles to articulate himself, stammers, blinks heavily, completely monotone, and has a scar above his left ear. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsSRaoOo2k">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPsSRaoOo2k</a></p>

<p>I think this is when they had something done to him, from a Wired magazine article:</p>

<p>&quot;In May 2010 Lamo reported his backpack stolen. The investigating officer noted unusual behavior by Lamo and detained him. He was diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s syndrome after having been placed on a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold, which was extended to a total of nine days.&quot;</p>

<p>There are now reports that Bradley Manning also appears to be catatonic and having severe problems communicating. If they&#39;re doing this to Lamo what is keeping them from doing this to Bradley Manning?
I&#39;m thoroughly creeped out by all this.</p>

<p>Edit: Interesting article picking up on this in November.
<a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/12/23/bradley-manning-and-the-convenient-memories-of-adrian-lamo/">http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2010/12/23/bradley-manning-and-the-convenient-memories-of-adrian-lamo/</a></p>

<p>Edit2: Lamo has worked for FBI or NSA, german news source google chrome translate for the win.
After that Lamo is a security specialist that the secret &quot;Project Vigilant&quot; worked for ( https: / / <a href="http://www.projectvigilant.us/">www.projectvigilant.us/</a> ). This project was Mark Rasch with donations from the business founded by. Quickly headed for nine years, the Internet Crime Unit of the U.S. Department of Justice and took for his project top people on board, including Ira Winkler, the NSA (National Security Agency) for FISA activities (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) is responsible was observed and foreign intelligence agencies.</p>

<p>Manning has been in solitary confinement for a long time. Of course he is going to be that way.</p>

<p>9 days in psychiatric hold is serious shit. This is why I pointed it out in my comments a few days ago. The guy was already bi polar or had a screw loose.</p>

<p>He openly admits to abusing Xanax and overdosing on amphetamines... In his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... substances that disassociate you from your senses have played a big part in my life ...&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;The dissociatives are amazing ... You can look at your face in the mirror and completely not recognize it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not quite imagining someone brainwashing Lamo in the sense that there&#39;s someone with an xbox controller and headset off in the distance remotely operating him. &quot;They&quot; could have gotten access to him by facilitating Lamo&#39;s drug abuse/psychiatric treatment and manipulated him to make him more susceptible to suggestion. I don&#39;t think they necessarily had to have Lamo in an underground bunker under his will, it can be more subtle than that. Lamo could indeed live an everyday life perhaps. </p>

<p>If Charles Manson can brainwash some hippies by himself, I wonder what more well funded and determined groups have mastered through the use of rigorous research.</p>

<p>I am making wild accusations and speculations based on the importance of Lamo and the timing of the events. I think it is at least worth our vigilance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is mentally impaired in that Al Jazeera interview. What does selling out and being an attention whore have to do with mental impairment. The man cannot come up with words. Something has been done to that man during his forced psychiatric stay due to his sudden Asbergers diagnosis.
