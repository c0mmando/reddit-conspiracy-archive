    <div class="md"><p>You can make your own with a vacuum tube.  A  GM detector is just an ion chamber.  Put a small hole in the tube, then apply a voltage to the Cathode until you get some breakdown current (might need a whole lot of voltage).  Turn the voltage back down until you just barely don&#39;t get current.  </p>

<p>Then if any ionizing radiation hits the tube you&#39;ll be able to see a drop in Cathode voltage.  Hook a speaker up to a cap on the Cathode and you&#39;ll be able to hear the clicking.  </p>

<p>This is guaranteed to work.  (No guarantees, never tried it.  But it might work)</p>

<p><a href="http://park18.wakwak.com/%7Eweather/geiger_index.html">http://park18.wakwak.com/~weather/geiger_index.html</a></p>

<p>The top chart is today&#39;s past 18 hours. The bottom chart is a baseline reference from last December.</p>

<p>100CPM on this scale = 1 microSievert. 10,000CPM = 1 milliSievert.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sievert#Symptom_benchmarks">250 milliSievert is the dosage at which people&#39;s health is affected</a>.</p>

<p>It would have to hit about 2,500,000 on this scale to be an immediate danger to health. Currently about 20.</p>

Think about its implications. Think about how many of those tests were inside the US, and above ground. Think about how many atmospheric tests were done in the Pacific.</p>

<p>Then think about how little background radiation there is when you turn on your Geiger counter...</p>

<p>You clearly need some perspective, and so will a lot of other people freaked out by this disaster. It is a disaster, and it will affect the Japanese, and some Russians, to varying extents, but getting upset about it from North America isn&#39;t very realistic at this stage.</p>

There have been numerous atomic bomb detonations and nuclear accidents since then.Once again NOBODY outside the immediate area has died from radiation exposure. I was in the Three Mile Island area a few months ago and all was well. I have a friend who lives in that area and he is healthier than I am. He has lived there since 1970. I suggest if you are that worried about it,find a big hole get down in it and enjoy your life !

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the redditors are not old enough to remember Chernobyl,Nevada nuclear tests, Russian nuclear tests or Three Mile Island or remembers that we dropped two a- bombs on Japan. I am. Funny thing is were still here ! I don&#39;t glow in the dark nor does my skin fall off. Nobody I know shows signs of radiation sickness or has dropped dead at a early age ! Nobody that I know is worried about it because it is a &quot;been there, done that&quot;. Yes it is a problem of concern and we should keep aware of it but to go in the panic mode NO !</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to this beautiful park in South Utah.  Couldn&#39;t believe how few people were there in spite of it being in a city.  I googled it... Snow Canyon State Park.  Found out John Wayne did a film there.  They say that&#39;s where he got his cancer.  Also, google &quot;downwinders&quot;.  A lot of information about the people that lived downwind from the Nevada test site during the above ground nuclear tests of the 1950&#39;s.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to worry about here in the U.S.</p>
