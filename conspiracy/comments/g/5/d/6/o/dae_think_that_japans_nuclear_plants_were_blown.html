       I'm amazed that I see a lot of conspiracy theories saying that Japan is covering up the severity of the nuclear emergency, but not a single one (OK, maybe one) about
       <strong>
        why the reactors blew up in the first place
       </strong>
       (or even possibly what caused the earthquakes).
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, "explosions" at the reactors caused this.  Those explosions could be from Hydrogen gas, like they say... or they could be from someone planting an explosive device and setting it off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such an
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       potential conspiracy theory, yet not a peep from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ?  The front page is most telling in its conspicuous
       <em>
        lack
       </em>
       of coverage of this theory that I would imagine should be at the forefront of every conspiracy nut's lips right now.
       <em>
        Is it being suppressed?
       </em>
       Well, I suppose there's one way to find out:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        By starting things off
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       The motives are twofold: sabotage Obama's nuclear ambition in the United States, and set off a global disaster that will upset/reset the world economy.  Since the economy is essentially one big Ponzi scheme, blaming the scheme's collapse on a "causeless" catastrophic event like this poses the only way to preempt the real reason: because we've run out of money to prop up the pyramid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The execution of such a disaster is highly feasible: setting off an explosion in a building is beyond simple.  As for the earthquake, they could have waited for it, or used HAARP if you believe that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's discuss.
       <strong>
        If you disagree, please do so intelligently.  If you're here to astroturf, crack a joke, ridicule, or espouse your anti-conspiracy rhetoric (without allowing proper debate), please take your conversation elsewhere.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT
       </strong>
       Bolded the last sentence for those of limited intelligence and attention span.

       The reactors lost power, and the backup generators were flooded by the tsunami. It's been explained repeatedly. Without cooling, nuclear reactors have a tendency to go sour.
      </p>
      <p>
       TEPCO has a long history of covering up disasters. It's not a surprise that the information we've been getting has
       <em>
        escalated
       </em>
       . They were simply hoping against hope that it wouldn't end up as bad as it's going to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The explosions did not cause the crisis. They are a result of the crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conspiracy might be
       <em>
        how bad
       </em>
       the disaster is, not that it was planned. But you can't hide radiation so we'll eventually know how bad it is/was.
      </p>
      <p>
       As bad as this disaster is, and as bad a nuclear disaster it could be, it would not be enough to destroy the world economy. They are talking hundreds of billions of dollars in physical damage. The US financial frauds have cost trillions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve can't run out of money. It's not possible, as they are allowed to print as much as they want. It may cause hyper inflation, but there's always more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest you focus on more believable conspiracies.

       Hyper inflation of one of the world's dominant currencies would probably cause a lot more harm than you seem to imply.

       Wow. You are a genuine conspiracy theorist.

       In science (and forensics) the most logical theory is
       <strong>
        always
       </strong>
       the most correct theory. (In this case I interpret logical as meaning it's:
       <em>
        based on observation
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        contains quantifiable criteria

       ,
       <em>
        is testable

       , and
       <em>
        can predict outcomes
       </em>
       .)
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't let logic dissuade you from your theory.

       But an argument like yours is plainly foolish to assert. First, we can't cause an earthquake (HAARP causing them is complete bullshit), and next, you haven't presented a coherent argument that would benefit any conspirators.

       Resetting the world economy means triggering the collapse of the Ponzi scheme.  Normally such a scheme would collapse after its operators could no longer afford the payouts.  The economy is one big bubble right now, and isn't collapsing only because the Fed keeps propping it up.  This can only go on for so long before they lose credibility.  Hence the need for a catastrophic event somewhere else to trigger the crash.  The perpetrators of the scheme make off with the greatest financial heist in the history of the planet, and it gets blamed on one of the worst disasters of the planet: the release of nuclear radiation into the most heavily populated city on Earth.

       I am not trying to disprove anything. If you can read English and understand basic human psychology you would get that I am telling you the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have seen no evidence that radio waves produced by HAARP have any effect on crustal tectonics, nor do I believe they intended to have any effect on crustal tectonics. HAARP, therefore, cannot be responsible for causing earthquakes in my
       <em>

       opinion, although I would not claim to be an
       <em>
        expert
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       As a footnote, I have read much about HAARP, and I am educated in physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can say "it's not totally bullshit." And I would reply with, "please show me any believable evidence that radio waves can cause earthquakes." And if you can, it's very possible I could change my opinion about HAARP.

       I don't believe the Federal Reserve is a Ponzi scheme. I believe the United States is still operating under a philosophy that was effective in the 50s, including depending on productivity increase, population increase, and natural resource use. Unfortunately for them, the US population is stagnating (which is why they are encouraging immigration), productivity (in terms of both efficiency and automation) are increasing too fast, and natural resources are becoming more difficult to extract and use. On top of this instability, there has been huge financial fraud on the part of some very large corporations causing even greater problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm simplifying it. It's not, simply put, a Ponzi scheme and declaring it so is disingenuous at best.

       Let me requote you:

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       What's the point of explaining yourself now, when your previous comment still exists for everyone to see?  You're proving my point for me, that your previous statement was pulled out of thin air without any backup.  And you have the audacity to now ask
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       for evidence that HAARP
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       cause earthquakes?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are horribly confused.  I never stated unequivocally that HAARP can cause earthquakes.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       stated unequivocally that it can't, and that there is no conspiracy to blow up the reactors, and that the event is
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       not big enough to upset the world economy.  All with no backup, and all stated with the confidence and expectation that people reading this just what... believe you at your word?  You're living in a fantasy world.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       This is in reference to your ability to write 3 whole paragraphs while not really answering the question.  It really is rather impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your final paragraph is your only redemption.  And I will respond to it fairly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        there has been huge financial fraud on the part of some very large corporations causing even greater problems.... It's not, simply put, a Ponzi scheme and declaring it so is disingenuous at best.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The financial fraud on the part of very large corporations WAS the Ponzi scheme.  That was the mortgage crisis, and the derivatives crisis.  That bubble within our economy turned our economy into a Ponzi scheme as well.  I will concede that declaring it a Ponzi scheme is at best an accusation on my part, and on the part of many experts far more knowledgeable than I am.  If you're interested in why I think it is a Ponzi scheme, read up on anything even remotely recent from Matt Taibbi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to know why you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       think it's a Ponzi scheme.  Why do we have to keep injecting money into the system, if it's not artificially being propped up right now?

       Thanks. I'm paid well.

       Technically, the Federal Reserve providing liquidity to the markets is not a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes require
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       investors. When the Fed repeatedly buys Treasury Bonds, and the Government lends money at low rates, that's not a Ponzi scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Social Security, on the other hand, really is a Ponzi scheme, as it is designed to require increased pay-ins to support payouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think it's pretty obvious that we could go on and on. You set in your ways, and me set in mine. So take care; it's unlikely I'll give this thread much further thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose you can tell yourself you "won" because I care little to go on, but I don't care much about that.

       Cheers.

      <p>
       I am not trying to disprove anything. If you can read English and understand basic human psychology you would get that I am telling you the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have seen no evidence that radio waves produced by HAARP have any effect on crustal tectonics, nor do I believe they intended to have any effect on crustal tectonics. HAARP, therefore, cannot be responsible for causing earthquakes in my
       <em>
        educated
       </em>
       opinion, although I would not claim to be an
       <em>
        expert
       </em>
       ."
      </p>
      <p>
       As a footnote, I have read much about HAARP, and I am educated in physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can say "it's not totally bullshit." And I would reply with, "please show me any believable evidence that radio waves can cause earthquakes." And if you can, it's very possible I could change my opinion about HAARP.

      <p>
       I don't believe the Federal Reserve is a Ponzi scheme. I believe the United States is still operating under a philosophy that was effective in the 50s, including depending on productivity increase, population increase, and natural resource use. Unfortunately for them, the US population is stagnating (which is why they are encouraging immigration), productivity (in terms of both efficiency and automation) are increasing too fast, and natural resources are becoming more difficult to extract and use. On top of this instability, there has been huge financial fraud on the part of some very large corporations causing even greater problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm simplifying it. It's not, simply put, a Ponzi scheme and declaring it so is disingenuous at best.

       What I meant was that you speak with more confidence than the substance of your words can support.  You speak with surety, when it is impossible to be sure.  Only a fool does that, and only a bigger fool believes that.  In other words, you're talking out your ass.  For example:

       Oh, so like Entergy Corp, which operates Arkansas Nuclear One plants? Because they own 40 coal and gas fired electric generation plants...
      </p>
      <p>
       Or FirstEngery Corp, which operates nuclear plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio? Did you know they own over a dozen region power companies, and operate dozens of power generation facilities all over the north east? That includes coal, wind, gas, and other power generation plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, for example, Constellation Energy Group, which operates Calvert Cliffs nuclear plants? What do they own? Do I have to do all of your homework?
      </p>
      <p>
       Homework: go ahead and run down the owners of the other 100+ private nuclear plants in America and find out if their interest is

       nuclear power generation.

       Market saturation. Coal and oil have higher profit margins due to comparatively lax regulations, inexpensive fuel, and older technology, but nuclear is still profitable. Installing nuclear plants in the past century was an inevitability, so of course coal and oil conglomerates would invest.

       This is like me pointing out that pharmaceutical companies have a lot to gain from long-term chemical patents, and you pointing out that some of them sell generic versions alongside their brand-named medications. It doesn't mean they think cheap generics are a good idea, it means they think holding both markets is a good idea. And it is, because it allows them to profit that much more, and to keep that portion of the market out of competitors' hands.

       So bear with me here. You suggested that some "people" are ecstatic that the TEPCO plant had (is having) melt-downs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked you to provide an example of these people, and you pointed out it was the coal industry, oil industry and their respective lobbies and shareholders with power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed out that most nuclear plants are owned by companies that also own coal-fired, gas-fired, wind-pushed, and hydro-powered electric plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you are saying that these companies, which are divested among many sources of power generation, are what, happy that a big part of their business is going sour? Ecstatic that they'll have to mothball profitable assets?

       If there is a public backlash against nuclear, the only realistic power options are coal and oil. Solar, wind, and hydrogen are too expensive given the (orchestrated and three-years-ongoing) financial problems the US has.

       How do they win by having to deactivate nuclear plants? How could that possibly be profitable? They aren't forced to build nuclear plants, so not having to build them isn't a problem. They aren't forced to operate nuclear plants; I'm sure they could sell them.

       It's a short-term loss compared to increasing the overall powergrid-share of coal and oil power. They could also, like you say, sell the plant, if they saw anti-nuclear fallout gaining legitimate traction. It's not as if the country would immediately shift from "We have nuclear power and it's working great" to "You have to decommission this beginning in five seconds".

       The question isn't whether nuclear power plants are owned in any part by other companies that own other types of power generation plants.  The fact that they are does not imply anything at all.

      <p>
       The question is whether oil and coal companies want to encourage or suppress the advancement of nuclear power in the United States.  It's very clear that they want to suppress nuclear power.  You're not quite arguing that they encourage it, but you're trying very hard to imply such.

       I think it's a convenient coincidence for those who have something to gain by slandering nuclear power. If there was no Japanese earthquake, and no meltdown of their reactors, they'd just throw down a few million on pro-coal propaganda as they have for decades already. This earthquake is just propaganda they don't have to pay for.

        Why not?  It's a pretty big coincidence to me that Obama is just trying to unveil an energy plan that includes nuclear power, and then a catastrophe involving nuclear power hits Japan, and then the news media talks about nothing else other than whether nuclear safe is truly safe enough after all.

        Correct, but neither have we hit the bottom.  We busted ourselves out of the mortgage crisis by bailing it out with an even bigger Ponzi scheme: the U.S. economy.  So while we're still recovering from one, we are just waiting for a much more massive hammer to drop.

       An operation like that would take some degree of planning and intelligence gathering in order to carry it out - and that would be under normal circumstances. To put such a plan into motion so hastily in the midst of such chaos would be difficult to say the least.

       If they wanted to engineer a nuclear crisis to accomplish the goals you mentioned above, then they would do it domestically under much more controlled circumstances. To carry out such a complex operation in the midst of such chaos on foreign soil is really stretching things. There are so many variables involved here that such an operation would be pretty much guaranteed to fall apart.

       Could you be a little specific?  I don't see how the operation and variables involved could be as complex as you make it seem.  I also don't see why they would do it domestically to our own people when they could do it to someone else.

       I think it's possible that both are true.  Just like most conspiracy theories, it is, at its heart, a theory.  There are suggestions that such an attack on a Japanese nuclear reactor happened a few years ago.  In that case, it was a relatively small earthquake and had relatively little impact.  There were also reports of unusual auroral activity beforehand.  In this recent disaster, there has been no mention of auroras, but things are so bad right now I doubt it would be mentioned for a while even if they were seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it comes down to this: if you accept that the technology exists to target an earthquake, then one cannot deny the possibility (however remote) that this, or any other, is a result.  If you accept that people are able to have sabotaged the reactors more directly, then the possibility if it actually happening is also there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me that there are those who stand to benefit from this disaster and they are, in large part, the same types of people who we would expect this type of thing from: callous disregard for value of human life and total focus on personal/group dominance.

       Such a plan could well have been planned in advance, and saved for a time that the U.S. again demanded nuclear power.  Good point though.

       1)Dunno, seems unnecessary.  I doubt that the political willpower required to overpower the gas+coal industry existed before this incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Absolutely.  The FED is, amazingly, actually under a bit of pressure due to the unholy alliance that is Fox News and the few conservative members of congress that are actually fiscally conservative.  I would not be surprised in the least if somewhere in the upper eschelons of power they quickly realized the cover that this would give them in pulling the trigger early on the 2nd bubble.

       How do they win by having to deactivate nuclear plants? How could that possibly be profitable? They aren't forced to build nuclear plants, so not having to build them isn't a problem. They aren't forced to operate nuclear plants; I'm sure they could sell them.

       Someone who lurks around a conspiracy theory forum denying every single conspiracy theory to anyone who will listen, would by definition be a troll.  Hence me asking him if he believed in any, multiple times, to which I have not received an answer.

      <p>
       I don't see how I'm being a troll, but I'm sure you'll gladly explain it to me.

       You are claiming an assertion (on my behalf) when really I'm countering your assertion:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's very clear that they want to suppress nuclear power.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Please support your argument with facts and references and I will consider countering it further.

       Provide a single, irrefutable example that supports your claim.
