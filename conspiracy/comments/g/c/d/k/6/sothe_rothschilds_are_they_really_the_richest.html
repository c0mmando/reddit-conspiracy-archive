       Conspiracy theories thrive on the lack of primary sources.  When you ask about that, then they reply, "There's a conspiracy to cover it up."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the best thing about being a conspiracy theorist.  You never EVER have to admit that you are crazy or wrong.  It's just the Government/ETs/Reptilians/Zionists/black helicopters/sentient narwhals trying to discredit you.

       I have no problems with conspiracy theories that are based on fragmentary evidence from primary sources being connected - "putting the pieces together", so to speak.  But what really irritates me (particularly since this discredits any
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       conspiracy theories that are remotely plausible) is when these nutbars try and unite them all under some all-encompassing evil secret society, like the "NWO", or the Rockefellers or Rothschilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a prima facie case that WTC7 may not have collapsed due to natural causes - I'll cede that - and there is in fact plenty of scientific analysis which supports this theory. However, there is absoutely NO evidence that the Rothschilds or Rockefellers or "NWO" "control the world". One of my favorite ways of fucking with people who believe this is mentioning that I would like to apply for a job at the NWO, and ask them whether they're in the phone book - or how exactly I could get in touch with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that there's no answer to that question is enough to prove these people are mindless fucking lunatics.

       That is bullshit and you know it. 99% of Alex Jones listeners (and Mr Jones himself) crap on and on as if these guys are an organized corporate entity, with branch offices all across the planet. I acknowledge the existence of the NWO as a concept, but most of these loons think it's some kind of dark army, complete with lieutenants and generals, and some kind of deep heirarchy.

      <p>
       If you don't think I'm not making that leap it's probably because I know some people who I consider intelligent, who get that there's a lot going on behind closed doors and during supposedly private conference calls, things that regular blokes aren't supposed to be privy to.

       Because in the world of "conspiracy", idiots are the cracks through which genuine revelations fall. The 9/11 truth movement used to be a serious field of inquiry, featuring people who included, among many other credible individuals - actual victims' families. Now the mere
       <em>
        mention
       </em>
       of the word "9/11 Truth" elicits visions of complete fucking moron mouthbreathers, ranting with spittle flying from their mouths about how there were "no planes!" (and using delectable new adjectives like "Sheeple") or how "HOLOGRAMS!" fooled everyone into believing there were planes where there were actually none at ALL! (never mind the HUNDREDS of thousands of first hand witnesses on the streets of New York that day).

       I'm aware of this as well. Aware enough to realize that these guys you speak of are not
       <em>
        stupid
       </em>
       enough to carry out their skulduggery with all the subtlety of a group of high school boys, complete with code names and secret handshakes. The people who pull the strings in this world do so with NO explicit planning amongst themselves, and with very little communication. They work on assumptions and, above all, shared values, engendered within them from the moment they begin their education as small children. For example - when you see a stunningly right-wing piece come out of a news organization like Fox News, or some other newspapers - that doesn't happen because the editor came right up to the journalist and said "You WILL write this story in THIS way, OR ELSE". This is the mistake these idiots who claim a global command of the NWO or such like don't realize. These guys don't
       <em>
        HAVE
       </em>
       to do that. They simply build an organization whereby the culture, and hiring practices
       <em>
        ensures
       </em>
       that the "right" kind of people end up working there. Fox News journalists don't need to be
       <em>
        told
       </em>
       to be propagandists - they ARE - that's why they were hired!
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is : the NWO has no "Agenda". It is but a group of like-minded people, with like minded interests, education and goals, who continue to push the world in a certain direction. Meanwhile, the Alex Jones' of the world try to force people to believe that actually - they are some kind of "organized" secret society, with set goals and agendas, which include nothing less than the decimation of the entire human race. THESE are the people I'm calling fucking morons. This notion is complete and utter bullshit.

       I know what you're saying, but I'm pretty disgusted you've chosen to use that as yet another opportunity to insult me - that wasn't necessary by the way - and it indicates a severe lack of intelligence on your part. I find that if you can't argue with someone intelligently, it's so much easier to tell them to "go fuck themselves" - to use your language.

       Definitely seems like we've got similar ideas here, you seem to be at where a lot of my fellow mindless lunatic genetic mutant fuckups arrive at in some point of their batshit mudraking careers: Who is Alex Jones and why hasn't he been skinned alive and bathed in salt by the powers that be?

       Well, he's a Jesuit. Who are the Jesuits? The society of Jesus, a branch of the vatican, with some of the most expensive universities you've barely heard of - machines that produce the likes of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sutherland">
        Peter Sutherland

       and

      </p>
      <p>
       This is the part where I tell you EVERYTHING. EVER. ANYWHERE. is a Jesuit ploy, and that even the poorest ex-jesuit on a dank street corner is secretly plotting whatever you think the decline of your home country is. Nah. They're just vested in the status quo and centralising their own influence. It's not complicated and they're definitely not incapable of screwing up.

       Not entirely true, but ok. As for the nuts on this subreddit, the main reason I continue to humor them is because they are actually practically

       I think you've misunderstood. What my ranting has tried to point out is that I consider the sort of people who post here as numerous shades of grey. Whereas most of the rest of the world who see these things in black and white, would consider me one of those nutcases, merely for posting in here and having the audacity to suggest some of their theories might bear looking into. The point is that it seems with all of these debates, inevitably a brand of the least hinged and least intelligent (and to be fair, from my personal experience dealing with some of these guys first hand - least mentally stable) individuals in society end up screaming the loudest, and doing so with the most insane and absoutely cockamamie shite in these questions. It's like what I was alluding to with the 9/11 truth movement. They started as a handful of smart people and relatives of the victims, asking simple, legitimate unanswered questions. The next thing you know, every single mental patient who was off of their meds began screaming 1000% louder about their completely bizzarre and improbable scenarios about the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially "I" am the kind of people who post here, but my point was "I" am not the 20% who scream the loudest, who are verifiably insane. Nor are you, by the sounds of it.

       Without going into the details of why, I'm something of a scholar of AJ. I am simultaneously one of his greatest critics, while considering him an absolute subversive genius. The real problem, however, is that it's hard to
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       tell whether he is actually "taking the piss" as the English/Aussies say, or he genuinely believes what he's saying. On the one hand, a decent percentage of his rhetoric is spot on accurate, based on genuinely scary shit going on in the world today. On the other hand, he supports some really crazy shit, most of his listeners are downright frightening (just read some of the comments on the forums on his websites), and has given an audience to people who are known convicted fraudsters and such. But on the other hand, he's laughing all the way to the bank. While he rants and raves about the NWO and how they're going to send everybody to camps, five minutes later, he's voicing commercials from companies selling everything from nuclear fallout shelters to "survival seed banks" to companies hawking
       <strong>
        colloidal silver
       </strong>
       (even though we KNOW beyond a shadow of a doubt that
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq8C0GknwAM">
        colloidal silver will turn you BLUE
       </a>
       ). So in short - he's all over the map, and very well worth keeping an eye on, but certainly also worth taking with several grains of salt.

       "Naismith was a small, slight man and, like many Texans, affected a cowboy hat (although he had never herded cattle) and a bandito mustache (although his thefts were all based on fraud rather than force). He was also, for his nation at this time in history, an uncommonly honest man, and, unlike most corporations of the epoch, none of his enterprises had poisoned or mutilated the customers whose money he took. His one vice was cynicism based on lack of imagination: he reckoned most of his countrymen as total mental basket cases and fondly believed that he was exploiting their folly when he told them that a vast Illiminati conspiracy controlled the money supply and interest rates or that a bandit of the 1930s was, in a sense, a redeemer of the atrophying human spirit. That there was an element of truth in these bizarre notions never crossed his mind. In short, even though born in Texas, Naismith was as alienated from the pulse, the poetry and the profundity of American emotion as a New York intellectual."

       Alex Jones has two British contributors, who I SWEAR sound like they are actually disinfo agents from MI5 or MI6 (or "M-Sixteen", as Alex Jones calls them). They write absolutely brilliant prose, in the realms of perfect propaganda, ranting and raving against Jones' flavors of the week, and Jones all the while somehow tries to leverage their "Englishness" as some kind of mark of credibility. The whole thing is quite disgusting - but simultaneously, "fascinating" - again part of my love hate relationship with Jones and his brand. For the record, basically without giving away too much personal info - I'm trained in media and PR, and propaganda is an ongoing personal project/hobby of mine. Alex Jones is one of the great propagandists of the 21st century. Sure, so is G W Bush, and Obama, but people like Jones, or (grimace) Glenn Beck are "privatized" - propagandists of the masses - something that is a unique phenomena in our time.

       So you point links to the Council on Foreign Relations' journal, and the Bilderberg group. Both of which are legitimate "think tanks", and despite their illustrious membership, literally NOBODY knows what goes on behind closed doors with the Bilderberg group. So, basically, you haven't proven
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm with you - I
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       believe that those two groups are often up to no good. But what zombie brainwashed drones like you fail to realize is that that is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       "PROOF". There is a difference.  The moment you choose to think for yourself, you will realize there is NO proof. But I understand - it's a lot easier to believe demagogues on the web like Alex Jones or David Icke - after all, they sound SO convinced, so they MUST know what they're talking about, right?

      <p>
       Hey - again, I'm with you. I'm SURE that they feel that way. But believing that is NOT the same as verifiable PROOF that there is some kind of global agenda amongst those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let me counter with another question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you HONESTLY believe that amongst the MANY Billionaires in the world, that not a SINGLE one of them doesn't use their money and power in the service of humanity? IS there some law of biology or chemistry which means that as soon as somebody comes into the posession of obscene wealth, that they
       <em>
        automagically
       </em>
       become some kind of sub-human MONSTER? If so, what
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       scientific evidence can you use to prove your point. And further more, if somebody gave
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       ten billion dollars tomorrow, would you be different?? Why or why not?

       Yeah sorry about that. I wanted to leave it at well played because explaining why I agree (wholeheartedly) is sidetracking from our points - it comes from a personal belief that situations are usually (even if it's unintuitive/hidden) fundamentally, mathematically set up to be win-win. Your last point, the one posed as a rejoinding question really carries that same belief.

       You got it ass backwards. The 911 "truth movement"
       <em>
        began
       </em>
       with a large contingent of no-planners and wankers of all stripes, 2 seconds after the news. Only for a short period did it gain a certain amount of credibility, years after the fact (and the msm soon squashed that and ostracized anyone that took it seriously). The families only came in to the equation around this time; they had been convinced by some credible investigators as well as conspiracy theorists and wankers.

       Webfairy posted all kinds of stuff the very next day, and basically invented the no-plane theory. Lizard man David Icke posted his Alice in Wonderland schtick on the 13th. Conspiracy theorists playing at numerology represented the most prominent initial offering - 77 this, 11 that, master number illuminati this and that. Geocities was the veritable heaquarters of all cranks alike. That stuff continued for at least a year, before more level heads started to even accumulate tangible data (let alone write anything substantial).  All this was mixed in with Mike Ruppert's "From The Wilderness," and Mad Cow who actually attempted real parapolitical investigations. A grab bag for all sorts -

       the real conspiracy has to do with targeting jews saying they are the problem when the reality is this is only what the elite want, while you blame the jews they have extra time to regroup and shift strategies, a method of the ruling elite that has worked  for thousands of years

       It appears you are confused.  The family being talked about here is the Rothschild family, not Rothchilds or Rothchild.  Like you, I know some people from the Rothchild family and they are definitely not rich.  However, the Rothschild family contains several people connected to international banking and they are fantastically wealthy.

       They own the world bank, they own the bank that handles ALL transactions for the stock market (IMB or something like that) they own the Global Bank that is designated to receive all the carbon taxes and the carbon trading scam from all over the globe, and they own the Federal Reserve. 500 Trillion sounds a little high but pretty close to me. Because they have all the gold of America and gave us paper for it (by 2013 you wont be able to buy toilet paper with it btw) But you also have to remember 1 thing, this group of people are so tightly knit that there is almost no way to tell who in the group really owns what. They seem to share and trade within the group some of the smaller entities, like some of the medias, so if you were to divide up the 500 Trillion between 20 so people 3 or 4 receiving a larger portion then the rest I can see his wealth individually being around 100 Trillion.

       They only control it.. not own it. It's a subtle distinction though. Many people control things through trusts and other such vehicles.. the people at the top also control things through other people.

       No, whoever owns that Inca gold is. I'm guessing the worlds most powerful cartels rule the world. Firstly the intellectual elite, who would naturally find away to rule the rest of us. Then there Lieutenants, royalty, the vatican, the ruling body of the Freemasons would be candidates. LOTS of different groups make up the Establishment. And there all related. The Establishment needs bankers. Thats were the Rothschilds and Rockefellers come in. All working day and night to destroy there enemy, the average joe, who is completely oblivious to there plans. So yeah, fuck that red pill.

       That is bullshit and you know it. 99% of Alex Jones listeners (and Mr Jones himself) crap on and on as if these guys are an organized corporate entity, with branch offices all across the planet. I acknowledge the existence of the NWO as a concept, but most of these loons think it's some kind of dark army, complete with lieutenants and generals, and some kind of deep heirarchy.

       Alex Jones has two British contributors, who I SWEAR sound like they are actually disinfo agents from MI5 or MI6 (or "M-Sixteen", as Alex Jones calls them). They write absolutely brilliant prose, in the realms of perfect propaganda, ranting and raving against Jones' flavors of the week, and Jones all the while somehow tries to leverage their "Englishness" as some kind of mark of credibility. The whole thing is quite disgusting - but simultaneously, "fascinating" - again part of my love hate relationship with Jones and his brand. For the record, basically without giving away too much personal info - I'm trained in media and PR, and propaganda is an ongoing personal project/hobby of mine. Alex Jones is one of the great propagandists of the 21st century. Sure, so is G W Bush, and Obama, but people like Jones, or (grimace) Glenn Beck are "privatized" - propagandists of the masses - something that is a unique phenomena in our time.
