<p>Honestly it&#39;s not.  They may not help but they certainly aren&#39;t the main problem.  The main problem are posts like planes not hitting the pentagon or thermite bringing down buildings.  Those stories aren&#39;t factually based and when they get posted on other subreddits that lack of fact gets called out.  I&#39;m not trying to be mean, the burden of proof is on you.  That&#39;s often forgotten.  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are for conspiracies.   </p>

<p>The U.S. government has released two separate videos of the Pentagon attacks. Neither video shows a plane hitting the Pentagon.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paWiZ2Y8fRg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paWiZ2Y8fRg</a></p>

<p>Following Occam&#39;s razor that &quot;the simplest explanation is most likely the correct one&quot; a rational person can only conclude that a 757 never stuck the Pentagon.</p>

<p>Since you also mentioned the thermite, here is the University study entitled <em>Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe</em>: </p>

<p>It was a pay to publish journal.  I could have bought &quot;why farts are funny&quot; into that journal.  The editor quit when she found out it was published.  It wasn&#39;t peer reviewed.  Yet that&#39;s what you are sticking your faith in.  I rest my case.  There are 100s of papers published in peer reviewed journals that are respected across the world that have topics related to the collapse of WTC 1, 2, and 7.  Why don&#39;t you trust those?  Oh, that&#39;s right, it doesn&#39;t fit your narrative. </p>

<p>NIST reports, CIA, FBI evidence, countless investigative reporters, Frontline reports, Der speigal articles, wall street journal articles, the times, bbc, I could go one all night.  What do you have?</p>

<p>What facts do you need?  Are there any that would change your mindset?  I doubt it.  No one ever responds to me with an answer, I doubt you&#39;ll be the first.   As to my media sources you have to be joking if you don&#39;t think yours have an agenda.  That would be seriously comical if you thought that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. Just 2 things. 1st- that doesn&#39;t address the fact that if you are making a claim, especially one as fantastic as some of these theories, then the burden of proof is on you to provide evidence of the claim.

I could tell you right now that I have X-Ray vision, but it wouldn&#39;t be your job to prove my claim wrong, it would be my job to provide evidence of my claim.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If one is not supposed to believe anything they read about any conspiracy, why should they believe the articles with evidence supporting them? Is your determining factor for the articles to believe and the ones to ignore whether they support or oppose your theory? If it is important for me to not believe anything I read about a theory, then there is no point in doing my own research, because none of it can be believed.</p>

<p>This is exactly what Fountainhead was referring to about facts.  You did not list one fact in that last post.  A skilled pilot saying he didn&#39;t think he could replicate what the hijackers &#39;did&#39; is not proof or fact of anything other than the hijacker may have been a better pilot than the instructor after only a couple of lessons.</p>

<p>Is NOT a way to prove ANYTHING to me, unless being ridiculous IS your proof to me that a Boeing passenger jet struck the Pentagon. I am asking for what really struck it and a Boeing jet is one of the FARTHEST and most REMOTE possibility, so I ask YOU to PROVE your hypothesis to ME. However I completely agree with that nothing is true until proven I challenge you to PROVE what you claim which is a Boeing 747 with an amateur prop plane experience made an IMPOSSIBLE flying maneuver with an aircraft he NEVER flew before into a 16 foot hole in the Pentagon!! ...

    <div class="md"><p>but it cant be 750 mph... passenger aircrafts cant withstand the sound barrier. Besides no report of a sonic boom. </p>

<p>Think of it this way, same reason why no experienced pilot has been able to perform this flying maneuver in a simulator on that aircraft. Imagine passing your exit on the expressway traveling at 70mph, it requires you to get over (usually) to the right lane a mile before hand, now imagine that same situation at 600 mph, you&#39;d have to be in the perfect lane 30 -40 miles before you even saw the building. Bear in mind this is NOT a stunt plane, turning these planes is no easy task ESPECIALLY at full throttle descending. Out of hundreds of simulations the closest any EXPERIENCED pilot could achieve was 1/2 mile BEFORE the Pentagon, because of the hill located on that trajectory, the second closest was 2 miles PAST. But here you claim a non experienced barely trained never practiced on this aircraft was able to pull it off flawlessly with only 1 try is just preposterous. So again I ask for your PROOF, that a Boeing passenger aircraft flew by a novice pilot traveling at 600(compromise with you) mph crashed into the most defended building on the planet and put 2 wings 2 engines a fuselage and a tail into a 16 foot hole PERFECTLY</p>

But do you <strong>really</strong> think you could hop into a Boeing passenger jet TODAY with no practice and maybe a video game to learn the controls but no simulation training, and pull off a maneuver that experts who fly those birds every day say they couldnt do? Are you really that pompous?</p>

<p>Another thing your not taking into account on this is the landscape. The trajectory that aircraft/missile took it had to avoid 2 buildings and a considerable hill and tall freeway overpass. Its not a simple &quot;look building hit it&quot; to start with it wasnt visible when the the course had to be set (auto pilot will NOT target the pentagon, so NO computer assistance) then you must avoid 2 buildings, then remain above the trees while accelerating then a fast drop over the hill maneuvering around the freeway with 2 overpasses and then keep it off the ground long enough to strike the building a few feet off the ground without scraping the dirt AFTER tucking the wings and tail and motors into the fuselage so they dont cause any damage other then the 16 foot hole.</p>

<p>R U serious you think you can do that??? <em>facepalm</em></p>

<p>STILL waiting for your proof!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sure explain to me this 16 foot hole and the engine HALF the size of a motor on a Boeing and the manufacturer of Boeing does not recognize this motor found in the Pentagon!</p>

<p>Or 1 of the COUNTLESS cameras that were pointed at the Pentagon. Because if ANY of those videos showed a Boeing Passenger aircraft it would NOT be a national security issue. It would be proof of THEIR claim, but here they are Secret Service CONFISCATING ALL video surveillance from surrounding buildings UNDER the National Security claim. And the 5 HD Cameras on THAT side of the Pentagon facing OUTWARD, also National Security... DOES IT NOT seem ODD to YOU that they have the EXACT evidence they need to PROVE their claims, but they cant show them .. because WHY???</p>

<p>.. the witness&#39; have ALL been proven to be an employee of the Pentagon or a paid actor, so good luck with that (btw the guy in the Blue cap from the parking lot cannot be found by that name) the first one on the TV screaming &quot;Bin Laden&quot; was an actor from California with no excuse why he was there that day in that area (other then to look good on camera and start the propaganda train) What about ALL the witness&#39; that said there were explosions, or do you only listen to the ACCEPTED witness&#39;?</p>

<p>... or the dozen that said the first plane was BLACK and not a passenger plane at all? Again ONLY the accepted witness&#39;? what about the guy who called his wife to let her know he got out from a payphone and she wasnt home so the answering machine recorded multiple explosions... AGAIN you like them ignore the evidence that doesn&#39;t conform with your theory that the government TOLD you to believe... way to think for yourself sheeple! </p>

<p>Or the special agent who&#39;s desk was TWENTY FOUR FEET from the explosion site, she was knocked to the floor as was her 2 year old baby, she picked up the baby and walked out THROUGH the (SIXTEEN FOOT DIAMETER) hole and saw NO (plane) WRECKAGE, she is sueing Chenney Rumsfeld and a few others. But with all that &quot;jet fuel&quot; she SHOULD be dead, right? </p>

<p>But you go ahead and believe the &quot;We&#39;ll show you what it looks like... once it looks worse and after we plant evidence (plane wreckage) all around to try to solidify our story and completely fool the simple minded. (looks at Fountainhead) </p>

<p>What about the 5 witness&#39; that said there was a chase plane that pulled up before the explosion, but it wasnt a plane that it was chasing. Nevermind them you have your PROFESSIONALLY paid witness&#39; to believe, there is a few of them, and 10 TIMES as many of the others that tell different accounts. So you go ahead and believe your masters! As for me I have taken all available information and came to my own intelligent conclusion and that is that no matter what happened the &quot;official story&quot; is ABSOLUTELY impossible!</p>

Like in anything if you stand too close you cant see the picture. So no I would prefer to discuss them all since they all revolve around the same event, I will not take the easiest lie to believe to make the impossible lies more feasible. Check all the events of that day and you will at least wonder why so much doesnt make sense. THEN try to form the most probable conclusion .. and a few terrorists pulling this off will be the most unlikely of them all. Yet we have killed 1.4 MILLION Afghanistan people. And not 1 terrorist. In fact most people in Guantanamo are people who the taliban got paid cash for capturing people most were just farmers. But if your getting paid who cares, right?</p>

<p>Read Top Secret Military Specialist April Gallop&#39;s <a href="http://www.centerfor911justice.org/complaint.htm">Complaint</a> it explains a LOT. If there was a witness to believe would you TRY one that was there and is so confident in what happened that she is going to court for it April 5th!</p>

<p>A section from the court records (credible enough for you??):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>III.  The Attack on the Pentagon.</p>

<pre><code>       33.  At the Pentagon, the plaintiff was at her desk, with her baby, in her office on the first floor, 
</code></pre>

<p>when large explosions occurred, walls crumbled and the ceiling fell in.  Although her desk is just some forty feet 
from the supposed impact point, and she went out through the blown-open front of the building afterwards, 
she never saw any sign that an airliner crashed through.  If Flight 77, or a substitute, did swoop low over the 
building, to create the false impression of a suicide attack, it was then flown away by its pilot, or remote 
control, and apparently crashed someplace else.  At the building, inside or outside of the wall the plane 
supposedly hit, there was no wreckage, no airplane fragments, no engines, no seats, no luggage, no fuselage 
sections with rows of windows, and especially, no blazing quantities of burning jet fuel.  The interior walls and 
ceilings and contents in that area were destroyed, but there was no sign of a crashed airplane.  A number of 
those present inside the building and out have attested to this fact in published reports.</p>

<pre><code>       34.  Instead, just when plaintiff turned on her computer — for an urgent document-clearing job she 
</code></pre>

<p>was directed by her supervisor to rush and begin, as soon as she arrived at work, without dropping her baby 
off at child care until she was finished — a huge explosion occurred, and at least one more that she heard and 
felt, and flames shot out of the computer. Walls crumbled, the ceiling fell in, and she was knocked 
unconscious.  When she came to, terrified and in pain, she found the baby close by, picked him up, and, with 
other survivors caught in the area, made her way through rubble, smoke and dust towards daylight, which was 
showing through an open space that now gaped in the outside wall.  When she reached the outside she 
collapsed on the grass; only to wake up in a hospital some time later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>uhhhh dumbass its not ME that believes that picture... its CERTIFIED EVIDENCE the 9/11 commission enter into record. Look for yourself, are you seriously that stupid to NOT believe the ONLY source you believe about events on that day THEY entered that photo INTO evidence just to fuck with me to fuck with you??!?!! Want the link again?? since if you looked at it for HALF a second you would have seen ALL the information that certifies that UNBELIEVABLE photo is FACT and was used as such by the &quot;people&quot; your stupid ass believes over science!</p>

<p>And I am sure there were other photos taken earlier by the special ops watching the whole operation unfold according to plan. But those photo&#39;s would only confirm the INSIDE JOB fact. So this would be the EARLIEST photo taken that has been entered into evidence as the &quot;earliest on&quot; photo available to the All Knowing 9/11 bureaucrats that you bow to.</p>

<p>But arguing with you any farther on this thread will be a waste of my time, because no one is going to &quot;continue thread&quot; this far so continuing this debate with you will just not wake any others up to the truth. So catch you maybe on some other one where I can continue to make people listen to your arguments and decide you say nothing where I offer possible feasible explanations for events.. who is more convincing &quot;you stupid your dumb makes no sense proves nothing. Or actual links and information... Sorry you are losing the info war, but its the ancient problem the truth fears no lie. But every lie falls to the truth. But keep up the good work, we cant spread the truth without you. ;-)</p>

<p>Yes, I know that, but it&#39;s not the very first photo taken of the impact site. For example here are a few:</p>

<p>therefore the pic I showed was before they added plane fragments that should not have left the interior of the building ... thats called inertia for morons. Twin towers the flames went out through the other side of the buildings yet your second pic shows a clear OUTWARD explosion (way to go with parking security camera footage that shows NO PLANE!!

<p>That&#39;s some pretty flawed logic there.  Random is random and you cannot predict something that is truly random.  Therefore, random fires will damage randomly which <em>can</em> include symmetrical fires.</p>

<p>I had to stop and re-read this. This sounds like the &quot;tide goes in, tide goes out&quot; theory of &quot;you can&#39;t explain that&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;Random&quot; is a loaded word that is often used without sufficient knowledge of its implications. &quot;Truly random&quot; is even worse in the context of what you wrote because you are unwittingly admitting that you don&#39;t understand physical abstractions like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_entropy">entropy</a>. Which is fine. I&#39;m not trying to hate, it&#39;s not exactly &#39;common knowledge&#39;. I&#39;m just sayin, when you start talking about &#39;symmetrical fires&#39;, you are entering the realm of physics. Speculation here will get shat on if not properly defended. </p>

<p>You ended your post with the claim that &quot;random fires will damage randomly which <em>can</em> include symmetrical fires.&quot;. Okay then, here&#39;s your chance to prove it (I&#39;ll even explain how):
Take a piece of paper. Take a match or lighter. Light one end of the paper. 
- <strong>If the fire burns in a straight line</strong> through the paper all the way to the opposite side from where you lit it, effectively cutting the paper in half (so that you are left with two pieces of paper of roughly equal size/weight), <strong>then you have just shown that &quot;random fires can include symmetrical fires&quot;</strong> once. Let&#39;s call that a &#39;symmetrical fire&#39;. 
- If the fire burns the paper in anything but a straight line, then the results of the experiment have refuted your claim, once. Let&#39;s call that a <em>(real)</em> &#39;random fire&#39;. 
- For extra science points, you can keep score of how many times you get results that defend or refute your claim. Try as many times as you&#39;d like; if you got 1 symmetrical fire for 1000 random fires, I would still be <em>fucking astonished</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ditto, I share your sentiments.  This subreddit is very entertaining and really, it&#39;s the zany ideas I come here for.  </p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ve noticed is that some poor people ascribe to the philosophy that any and every event must have happened for a human reason.  So anything bad that has happened is a deliberate act.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Earthquake in Japan? HAARP.</li>
<li>WTC towers fell down? Controlled demolition.</li>
<li>Stubbed my toe? Government agent.</li>
</ul>

<p>No, nothing could be an accident, ever.  It&#39;s really sad to see some of these people abandon any semblance of logic in order to fit everything into a neat nice tidy worldview.  I like what Terence McKenna said about conspiracies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that the truth of the matter is far more terrifying, that the real truth that dare not speak itself is that no one is in control, absolutely no one. This stuff is ruled by the equations of dynamics and chaos. There may be entities seeking control, but to seek control is to take enormous aggravation upon yourself. It&#39;s like trying to control a dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s exactly the point I was trying to make. About a week ago 7 (seven!) swans turned up dead near where I live. So on some conspiracy website (or possibly some murmur here, I&#39;m not sure) it&#39;s more evidence of the coming HAARPtilian-NWO-chem trail-Apocalypse. </p>
