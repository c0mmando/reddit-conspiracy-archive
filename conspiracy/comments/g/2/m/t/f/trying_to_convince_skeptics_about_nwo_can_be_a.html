        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to come up with a way to broach the subject of NWO/Zionist conspiracy that doesn&#39;t raise peoples&#39; defenses right away.  I&#39;ve found that one of the most relatable topics for skeptics is examples of people who have been conveniently assassinated or died under mysterious circumstances.  So I made a website <a href="http://nwocasualties.com/">http://nwocasualties.com/</a> that tries to list as many of these victims as possible.  I hope you find it useful.  And I would welcome any suggestions of names or links that I&#39;ve overlooked.  I&#39;m sure there are many.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but that&#39;s not an excuse to use shitty evidence as filler.</p>

<p>Seriously, look at the OP&#39;s idea. &quot;Some people died under mysterious circumstances, therefore NWO&quot;. This is why nobody takes conspiracy theorists seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On some of the more recent ones it is hard to come by information, but on the older ones there is a lot of evidence that surfaces.  For instance, in 1999 a civil jury found that: 
&quot;Loyd Jowers, owner of Jimâ€™s Grill, had participated in a conspiracy to kill King, a conspiracy that included J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, Richard Helms and the CIA, the military, the Memphis Police Department (MPD), and organized crime. That verdict exonerated James Earl Ray who had already died in prison.&quot;
Attorney William Pepper tried this case and is currently looking into the Robert Kennedy assassination.  All of this is from the links I provide and is heavily sourced.  </p>

<p>This type of thing always seems to surface years later and I think it would be foolish to believe that times have changed and the CIA and Mossad are now altruistic entities looking out for the good of the masses.  But I appreciate the criticism and welcome the debate.  It is understandable that this topic defies belief.  It is wise of you to be skeptical (although I figured I&#39;d be preaching to the choir on Reddit Conspiracy), but I don&#39;t think you should just dismiss all of this without looking at all of the evidence.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not very strong evidence.</p>

<p>I never said or implied this. No strawmen please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to make a similar list of those whose reputations and careers have been damaged or destroyed for speaking out against Zionism, its activities and its purposes. Recent additions would be Mel Gibson, Charlie Sheen, Norman Finkelstein, Rick Sanchez, and Helen Thomas, just to name a few prominent in the news of late. Gibson had his latest movie deal cancelled. Sheen had his series cancelled. Finkelstein was denied well-deserved tenure at his university. Sanchez lost his job. Thomas lost her job. Try digging into historical revisionism as it relates to the Holocaust, and you&#39;ll find a host of people whose lives have been destroyed by Zionists, for daring to express their opinions on forbidden topics.</p>
