       I've been trying to come up with a way to broach the subject of NWO/Zionist conspiracy that doesn't raise peoples' defenses right away.  I've found that one of the most relatable topics for skeptics is examples of people who have been conveniently assassinated or died under mysterious circumstances.  So I made a website
       <a href="http://nwocasualties.com/">
        http://nwocasualties.com/
       </a>
       that tries to list as many of these victims as possible.  I hope you find it useful.  And I would welcome any suggestions of names or links that I've overlooked.  I'm sure there are many.

       Providing

       evidence usually works when you're trying to persuade someone. Conspiracy theorists typically don't like that step.

       True, but that's not an excuse to use shitty evidence as filler.

       Seriously, look at the OP's idea. "Some people died under mysterious circumstances, therefore NWO". This is why nobody takes conspiracy theorists seriously.

       On some of the more recent ones it is hard to come by information, but on the older ones there is a lot of evidence that surfaces.  For instance, in 1999 a civil jury found that: 
"Loyd Jowers, owner of Jim’s Grill, had participated in a conspiracy to kill King, a conspiracy that included J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, Richard Helms and the CIA, the military, the Memphis Police Department (MPD), and organized crime. That verdict exonerated James Earl Ray who had already died in prison."
Attorney William Pepper tried this case and is currently looking into the Robert Kennedy assassination.  All of this is from the links I provide and is heavily sourced.
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of thing always seems to surface years later and I think it would be foolish to believe that times have changed and the CIA and Mossad are now altruistic entities looking out for the good of the masses.  But I appreciate the criticism and welcome the debate.  It is understandable that this topic defies belief.  It is wise of you to be skeptical (although I figured I'd be preaching to the choir on Reddit Conspiracy), but I don't think you should just dismiss all of this without looking at all of the evidence.

       I agree. It should at most be a list of suspicious deaths. A list that acknowledges the lack of fact with emphasis in developing trends and pointing out circumstantial evidence.

       The biggest the conspiracy the easier it should be to find some credible evidence. With 9/11, for example, the truthers have no evidence to support their theories. Even with the WTC wreckage they have resorted to lies such as "the evidence was recycled before anyone could see it".

       There is a lot more information about this than I can go into right now, but it is actually a surprisingly small organization that controls the world's money supply and has set itself up as kingmakers.  You can't become an exceedingly powerful person without their consent.  If you do become powerful and go against them, you will probably wind up on this list.

       Of course I believe there is an "elite group" that is offering money to control parts of the world to carry out their "master plan".   Of course this "plan" is not going to happen in a day but these people are speeding things up with the actions of 9/11.  9/11 brought the "fear of terror" to America allowing those in control to tell us who is the enemy and the actions they should take.

       You might want to make a similar list of those whose reputations and careers have been damaged or destroyed for speaking out against Zionism, its activities and its purposes. Recent additions would be Mel Gibson, Charlie Sheen, Norman Finkelstein, Rick Sanchez, and Helen Thomas, just to name a few prominent in the news of late. Gibson had his latest movie deal cancelled. Sheen had his series cancelled. Finkelstein was denied well-deserved tenure at his university. Sanchez lost his job. Thomas lost her job. Try digging into historical revisionism as it relates to the Holocaust, and you'll find a host of people whose lives have been destroyed by Zionists, for daring to express their opinions on forbidden topics.
