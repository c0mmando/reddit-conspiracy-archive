         WHAT IS YOUR POSITION ON ‘ZEROING OUT’ THE BUDGET FOR PUBLIC MEDIA? I am a constituent who highly values the programming and services that my local public television and radio stations provide me, my family and my community. I strongly urge you to stand up for public broadcasting and oppose defunding public media. Please vote against the House Continuing Resolution (H.R. 1) to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Federal funding is critical for public broadcasting, allowing local public radio and television stations to provide educational services, in-depth news and public affairs programming, and world-class cultural content. Without the investment of this funding, many public radio and television stations across the country will be forced to go off the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Roper Poll found for seven straight years that Americans’ most-trusted source of news and information, and considered the best use of federal funding after national defense. It offers unique and vital programming that listeners and viewers can’t find anywhere else, including classic and invaluable children’s programming such as “Sesame Street.”
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 70% of current federal funding for public media goes to support local stations around country. Defunding these stations will strip many Americans – especially those living in rural areas or places hardest hit by the downturn in the economy – of their only source of local news, entertainment and information, and their only access to the public airwaves.

        In 2009, member stations derived 6% of their revenue from direct government funding, 10% of their revenue from federal funding in the form of CPB grants, and 14% of their revenue from universities.[14][15] NPR receives no direct funding from the federal government.[16]
        <strong>
         About 1.5% of NPR's revenues come from Corporation for Public Broadcasting grants.

       Only 1.5%! It should be easy-peesy to wean themselves and stop using the govt to force people's support.  They will certainly get more from me than they're getting now by using the power of the govt to extract my "donation".

       I'm one of those small government types who thinks no one should get money from the govt, it's not supposed to be a system of redistribution of wealth.  I'd like to decide for myself what artistic, cultural, and media outlets to support rather have some govt bureaucrat make these decisions and force me to pay taxes to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm involved in community theater and can't stand govt subsidies for the arts. It corrupts the art and teaches those involved that they don't need to make a product that can survive on its own in the marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
       I listen to NPR and will support them once they get out of the govt subsidy trap. I hope their fund drive business model succeeds.

       It's for practical purposes -- you don't bite the hand that feeds you so you produce something palatable to the taxpayer because if you go "too far" you might not get your grant next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could argue that producing art for the marketplace has it's limitations too. One produces something that they think will sell. There is always a degree of "selling out" that goes with that route.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the way I see it the only uncorrupted art is the art you produce with no strings attached. So I'm using the word "corrupted" from a purist's perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've experienced the people who get grants know that they are serving a master they must appease.  They say they need the money or else they cannot produce X. They cannot sell enough tickets or find a willing buyer for their work, so they turn to the govt to take money from you and me and give it to them. You might be fine with that arrangement but it grinds my gears!
      </p>
      <p>
       Apologies for the rant, I'm almost done..
      </p>
      <p>
       I like NFL football but don't think the govt should get in the entertainment business and build sports arenas. I love NASA but don't think the govt should fund it. I love the arts but think that govt subsides come with strings attached.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are facing the abyss of a national financial crisis and the money soon just won't be there. We will need to learn to exist without govt subsides soon enough, and I think that will be a good thing, artistically at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       There, it feels better to get that off my chest. Thanks for asking. :)

       I never really understood how NPR &amp; PBS worked... they openly get money from the government but their reporting is far more aggressive than the corporate-controlled "free" press.  But it works so I don't really want to see its funding taken away, even if it does only account for 1.5% of their revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       What pisses me off is this whole system that the gov't uses for budget cuts.  In the middle of a economic downturn and need to cut spending?  Don't stop spending billions on federal grants giving every hick township a fuckin tank and sound weapons... let's cut education, parks, and services people actually use.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they do is cut things that are really a drop in the bucket, but they are in our interest... and keep all the bullshit that accounts for 90% of the budget, that's in their self interest, well funded.  We can't find the money for public broadcasting or social security... but if your police dept wants a UAV or armored humvee (which is more than what our military had during the Iraq invasion), they'll find a way to fund it.
