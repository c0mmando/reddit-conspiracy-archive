<p>original information suppression downvoted question was here
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gf30a/how_long_can_someone_reasonably_take_potassium/">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gf30a/how_long_can_someone_reasonably_take_potassium/</a></p>

<p>How long can someone reasonably take potassium iodide to counter future streams of I 131  from Japan? Please DON&#39;T discuss whether rad levels in USA are harmful yet- just the question.</p>

<p>(exasperatingly necessary insert edit: please note that the PR nuclear people information suppression nannies are really downvoting this INSTANTLY so you &quot;don&#39;t panic&quot; and see the question at all so a few upvotes would be helpful to keep it in the cue.)</p>

<p>How long can someone reasonably take potassium iodide to counter continuing streams of I 131 that will apparently be streaming for weeks from Japan?</p>

<p>This is NOT a discussion of whether it is appropriate take it or whether levels reaching the USA are harmful yet or to say don&#39;t panic etc etc- just how long one can reasonably take PI before iodine supersaturation of thyroid causes some other problem (if any).</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t assume allergic reactions to K or any of the other non primary generic concerns everyone seems to want to mention.</p>

<p>I am interested to know when any possible harmful effect might occur to the thyroid from the iodine saturation itself.</p>

<p>edit: As the comments are drifting let me say i am looking for time for thyroid damage from iodine saturation or other things like kidney damage etc.</p>

<p>At what time limit would they occur?</p>

<p>Clearly we in the USA are going to be facing a long term accumulating low dose exposure of Iodine at possibly increasing levels as the reactors break down further over the next few months or years so some basic guidelines to help the balancing act would be helpful. Obviously it is NOT going to just be a short term exposure of a few days as we had hoped it would if they started dumping cement on it right away as they should have.</p>

<p>Morten still produces iodized salt.</p>

<p>But the problem with consuming salt for its iodine content is that the RDA (150 micrograms) for iodide is much lower than the amount of iodide present in potassium iodide. 2 grams of salt give you that 150 micrograms, but a potassium iodide tablet has 666 times that so you&#39;d have to eat 1332 grams (2.9lb) of salt daily to be comparable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you scroll to the bottom of the page, it lists the amount of iodine present in micrograms. Only kelp is listed as having more micrograms (415) than iodized salt. However, you need to eat 3/4ths a cup of kelp to equal a potassium iodide tablet. You&#39;re more likely to encounter kelp supplements (150 micrograms) which means you&#39;d have to pop 9 pills a day, but the recommended daily dose for adults is 1 kelp pill so you can see the problem there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Panic could spark a “mini-epidemic” of potassium iodide ingestion and overdoses, predicted Dr. Leonard Wartofsky, spokesman for the Endocrine Society and a thyroid expert.</p>

<p>He warned that the drug could cause serious reactions in some people and even backfire in the case of an actual emergency, <strong>putting people past a two-week window of safe dosage</strong>. After that period of time, the drug can induce severe hypothyroidism, a condition that essentially shuts down thyroid function.</p>

<p>If I had to venture a guess.. the RDA is 150 MCG .. the &quot;tolerable upper level&quot; for males of most ages is 1100.  Somewhere in that range should be okay.  Maybe a nutritionist might have some technical references.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, iodide supplements will affect your basal metabolic rate. Too much can alter the function of your endocrine system, which regulates all vital processes in the body. More immediate and noticeable symptomatology may include heightened or lowered blood pressure, atypical levels of arousal, altered body temperature, heart palpitations, change in appetite and mood. Some people might experience these changes right away and others will not, that will depend on their current state of health. The problem with any supplement is that it has the potential to deplete the body of other nutrients--why it&#39;s important for a complete spectrum of nutrition. My own question, as someone who has worked with people, has relatives and friends who lived through Chernobyl; all of them were supplied with iodide by the gov&#39;t, they took it in massive quantities following the incident and all of them have been affected in some way. Some died within a few years of the accident, some have recurring cancerous growths, another has hyperthyroidism, the list goes on. Knowing this I doubt that taking these supplements works the way people think it does in the first place. The idea is to saturate the thyroid to prevent absorption of I-131 but what happens to all that iodine when it becomes exposed to radiation anyway? And if it doesn&#39;t offset any actual damage, the potential damage from supplementation itself may not be worth the risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you sure it&#39;s not people downvoting you for claiming idiotic things, such as &#39;the nukular pr shills trying to downvote me&#39;? Cos that&#39;s sure as hell why I did.</p>

<p>Anyway don&#39;t worry about the iodine, tinfoil hat and moms basement should protect you enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its unfortuante that is why you downvoted it. it&#39;s unfortunate that you downvoted it at all.</p>

<p>however you should know that both during the healthcare debate and now it was clearly demonstrated that PR shills hired by those lobbyist&#39;s and interests were infact actively supressing sotriies they didn&#39;t like on reddit. In fact many ppr companies now opening state handling &quot;online reputations&quot; and social network image control and issue control as part of what they do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame People have to keep being told this individually. It takes to long to educate people individually about this going on. In the meantime people like yourself keep doing their work for them..</p>

<p>by the way I don&#39;t claim something is getting voted down by pr shills in the ifrst post. I post something they vote down and they when it happens i repost it while noting that it is getting voted down so people who actually care about the info will actually take the trouble to vote it up to counter the shills.</p>

<p>sorry for the typos. no time to correct</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many Japanese consume 50 to 200 mg daily of iodine from all the seaweed they eat.  That&#39;s every day, for their entire life.  So that amount is definitely safe -- and protects against breast cancer.  They get way less than the US.  </p>
