<p>save you some clicking</p>

<p>&quot;Today the IAEA has finally confirmed what some analysts have suspected for days: that the concentration per area of long-lived cesium-137 (Cs-137) is extremely high as far as tens of kilometers from the release site at Fukushima Dai-Ichi, and in fact would trigger compulsory evacuation under IAEA guidelines.</p>

<p>The IAEA is reporting that measured soil concentrations of Cs-137 as far away as Iitate Village, 40 kilometers northwest of Fukushima-Dai-Ichi, correspond to deposition levels of up to 3.7 megabecquerels per square meter (MBq/sq. m). This is far higher than previous IAEA reports of values of Cs-137 deposition, and comparable to the total beta-gamma measurements reported previously by IAEA and mentioned on this blog.</p>

<p>This should be compared with the deposition level that triggered compulsory relocation in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident: the level set in 1990 by the Soviet Union was 1.48 MBq/sq. m.</p>

<p>Thus, it is now abundantly clear that Japanese authorities were negligent in restricting the emergency evacuation zone to only 20 kilometers from the release site.  &quot;</p>

<p>By the way here is a 50k radius map around San Onofre nuclear reactor on the fault line in Southern California which is built to withstand an earthquake that is two magnitudes LESS than what can occur on newly discovered faultlines nearby.</p>

<p>(oh and upvote this quick or the nuclear PR people will be burying this story with downvotes faster than the dead in Japan)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give it a shot. The OP&#39;s headline says that the radiation measured exceeds that of the Chernobyl disaster and it does not. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster#Effects">Chernobyl</a> was orders of magnitude worse. What the article is saying that the radiation measured in the area around the Japanese reactor is higher than the level the Soviets set as a mandatory evacuation point. So I would agree that Japan has dropped the ball on evacuation but not that this disaster is worse than Chernobyl. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I downvoted and here&#39;s why.  The linked blog makes a ton of claims, but did not link to any sources where this information was reported.  If you&#39;re going to claim the IAEA reported this or that, then fucking link us to that report instead of telling your readers to just take your word for it.  The only sources the blog linked to were previous blog posts, i.e. the equivalent of blog circlejerking.  So downvotes it is.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a better source for the information:

    <div class="md"><p>From that report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on measurements of I-131 and Cs-137 in soil, sampled from 18 to 26 March in 9 municipalities at distances of 25 to 58 km from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, the total deposition of iodine-131 and cesium-137 has been calculated. The results indicate a pronounced spatial variability of the total deposition of iodine-131 and cesium-137. The average total deposition determined at these locations for iodine-131 range from 0.2 to 25 Megabecquerel per square metre and for cesium-137 from 0.02-3.7 Megabecquerel per square metre. The highest values were found in a relatively small area in the Northwest from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. First assessment indicates that one of the IAEA operational criteria for evacuation is exceeded in Iitate village. We advised the counterpart to carefully assess the situation. They indicated that they are already assessing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So one village has been affected. Hardly the panicked situation painted by the OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As of this writing the most recent <a href="http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/tsunamiupdate01.html">IAEA update</a> says:</p>

<p><em>&quot;Two IAEA teams are currently monitoring radiation levels and radioactivity in the environment in Japan. On 29 March, one team made gamma dose-rate measurements in the Tokyo region at 8 locations. Gamma-dose rates measured ranged from 0.02 to 0.19 microsievert per hour, which is within or slightly above the background.</em></p>

<p><em>The second team made additional measurements at distances of 32 to 62 km, at directions North to Northwest from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. At these locations, the dose rates ranged from 0.5 to 6.8 microsievert per hour. At the same locations, results of beta-gamma contamination measurements ranged from 0.05 to 0.45 Megabecquerel per square metre.</em></p>

<p><em>Based on measurements of I-131 and Cs-137 in soil, sampled from 18 to 26 March in 9 municipalities at distances of 25 to 58 km from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant, the total deposition of iodine-131 and cesium-137 has been calculated. The results indicate a pronounced spatial variability of the total deposition of iodine-131 and cesium-137. The average total deposition determined at these locations for iodine-131 range from 0.2 to 25 Megabecquerel per square metre and for cesium-137 from 0.02-3.7 Megabecquerel per square metre. The highest values were found in a relatively small area in the Northwest from the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. First assessment indicates that one of the IAEA operational criteria for evacuation is exceeded in Iitate village.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Based on the above, the info in the OP&#39;s link may be correct, but limited, as other measurements indicate a range of findings.  I have no idea what the rates were at Chernobyl.</p>

<p>The update does say that <em>one</em> of the evacuation criteria is exceeded.  I don&#39;t know how many criteria the IAEA has.</p>

<p>Honestly, based on my limited info--and realize that I&#39;m no fan of nuclear power--it seems that the OP&#39;s link is doing the same thing that pro-nuclear people do.  It focuses on the findings which support its view, as opposed to discussing the entire picture.  I&#39;m perfectly happy to be corrected about this, but that&#39;s how it seems to me.</p>
