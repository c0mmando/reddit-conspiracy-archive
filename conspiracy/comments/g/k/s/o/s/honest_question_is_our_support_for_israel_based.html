<p>I find it ironic that this always comes after saying &quot;Honest Question&quot;</p>

<p>And, in this case, your &quot;honest question&quot; is to frame the situation so that it either reinforces your contempt for Christianity/religion, allowing you to continue on your merry path, ... or, it allows you to go on your merry way not giving a shit about the situation.</p>

<p>Why must atheists always attempt to corner the answer they seek for self-perpetuation of their mindset?</p>

<p>Support for Israel is commonly referred to as Zionism. It is a distorted interpretation of Judaic scripture (not &quot;biblical&quot;, as you so tightly framed your inquiry). Through this distorted interpretation, it is asserted that &quot;The Jews&quot; need a homeland... a place where they can exist &quot;peacefully&quot; without &quot;being persecuted&quot;. The big lie of this, however, is that none of the Jews who believe/assert this have any desire whatsoever to live in that war-torn region of the world.. they all want to live in Florida or on some Caribbean island somewhere. They truthfully do NOT want to live in Israel.</p>

<p>Additionally, they&#39;re all hypocritical when it comes to the &quot;reasons&quot; they give. Take Rep. A. Weiner, for example, who claimed he supported Israel because of &quot;democracy, peace, blah blah&quot;, when in truth, Israel is one of the most barbaric and hostile forces in that region of the world... and over the past 50 years, they have all but eliminated the existence of Palestine. </p>

<p>Getting to the core of the matter, however, Israel is the Frankenstein monster of the international Ashkenazi bankster mafia (the Rothschild extended family and associates). Inevitably someone will attempt to disclaim this by saying that Evelyn Rothschild hasn&#39;t even been to Israel in 20 years (or whatever other lame excuse they dredge up), but the truth is still there... the Rothschild family pretty much <em>built</em> what there is of Israel today... all the while, enslaving other nations via their contemptuous &#39;fractional reserve central banking&#39; cartel.</p>

<p>That is a &#39;honest answer&#39; to your dishonest, tightly framed question.</p>

<p>The 250,000 Eastern European Jews living in makeshift internment camps in 1945 and the 2.5 million who migrated between 1945 - 1951 would beg to differ.  You should read Richard Crossman&#39;s &quot;Palestine Mission.&quot; He notes how most Eastern European Jews did not want to emigrate to the US or Britain or stay anywhere in Europe out of fear of what European anti-Semitism could do. Even Austrian, German, Polish, and Yugoslav authorities acknowledged that reintegration of Jews was impractical given the traumatic aftermath of the Holocaust and the massive loss of land and possessions of the refugees. Palestine and, after 1947, Israel was seen largely as a refuge for the homeless Jewish European masses still displaced after WWII.</p>

<p>Also, while the Rothschilds&#39; contribution was significant, the vast majority of Zionist funding came from American Zionist organizations, not British.  The Rothschilds didn&#39;t build Israel alone - Herzl, Ben Gurion, Weizmann, and the millions of yishuv constructed buildings, housing development, irrigation canals, hospitals, schools, roads, infrastructure, electrical plants, etc.  They used money provided by the Rothschilds and thousands of other Zionist donors and organizations to conduct this nation building.  But the Rothschilds did this with the help of Weizmann and hundreds of thousands of other early Zionists.  I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re getting this conspiracy that it was some pet project crafted by one man. Not to mention, your use of the phrase &quot;Frankenstein monster of the international Ashkenazi bankster mafia&quot; is more loaded than most Glenn Beck analogies.  Care to elaborate on that?</p>

<p>And, I gave you one. But, notice how it didn&#39;t fit into your little frame. Even without mysticism. If, however, you&#39;re oblivious to the amount of power and influence wielded by the Rothschild family, that&#39;s your own shortcoming.</p>

<p>Now, you&#39;re just lying. Thankfully, you can&#39;t edit post titles to cover that shit up, either. You framed the question to suit your agenda... and did it very tightly: It&#39;s either a religious reason (in which case I get to throw a huge atheism fit) or I don&#39;t give a shit.</p>

<p>You&#39;re now not only a liar, but a proven ass.</p>

<p>To head off &quot;comments like mine&quot;, indeed. You deliberately taunted for comments like mine, and now you&#39;re a backpedaling liar... ... probably only here for the trolling lulz.</p>

<p>Dude, I said I just don&#39;t want to hear anything about mysticism saying about what we NEED to do rather than what the situation IS. </p>

<p>Everytime I ask, I hear some herp-derp bullshit over &quot;well its &#39;cause israel is the light of the earth and god and herp-derp, secrets of life, etc etc...</p>

<p>I want an answer dealing with politics, economics, and yes if faith is a reason by all means include it, but don&#39;t support one side or the other. I wanted an objective answer. </p>

<p>I know U MAD now since you&#39;re calling me an &quot;ass&quot; and calling me a liar. You&#39;re looking to make a point where there wasn&#39;t one. I&#39;m simply saying, i&#39;m an atheist so any appeals to that religious influence won&#39;t affect me so don&#39;t include it. I Just want the objective raw answer of what the status of israel/usa is. Its obvious that some americans support israel beacuse of biblical ideology, and I expect to hear that answer...<strong>I was NOT looking for a reiteration of a dan brown novel. Thats not helping the discussion. THATS WHAT I MEANT.</strong></p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t say it verbatim to your liking oh fuckin well. You took offense to it. Piss off. I&#39;ve remained consistent in what i&#39;ve asked for. </p>

<p>This reddit has the tendency to loose credibility by suggesting all of that magical shit that goes down. Thats not helping anyone. While it makes for interesting <em>stories</em>... i&#39;m not trying to hear about the annunaki, and chakras and soul-talk etc... I just want to hear it without all the jazz. <strong>Its one thing to say, christians think israel is important, thats why we help them...and another to say... christians like me know that there is a profound importance to the most high elohim or some bullshit in israel. I don&#39;t need that.</strong> </p>

<p>I said I wanted an answer without &quot;woo-woo&quot; in it and that makes me hypocritical? You suggested more from what I wanted in the answer than I even had initially asked. You wrote 10x more about what you THOUGHT I might be thinking than what I ended up explaining even more. You&#39;re the one that made that distinction.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you proved my point in bold. You could have answered me without being a dickhead yourself. </p>

<p>In my initial response to you, approximately 80% of the text specifically addressed your inquiry... quite clearly and unambiguously, in fact.</p>

<p>The remainder of this thread of discussion has been you whining about how lame this subreddit is and how you phrased your question to ward off the kooks that you <em>know</em> hang out here. So, once again, I reassert: You are an ass... a troll... a major douche... and I&#39;m fairly certain you identified yourself as an atheist because you seem to think that atheism somehow equates to superior intelligence. But, from where I sit, atheism is no better than Judaism... both of which define non-membership as &#39;lesser in quality&#39;. And, finally, <em>I</em> did not make my point in bold. YOU did that. (btw, thanks for finally admitting it as truth)</p>

<p>Perhaps one day, you&#39;ll set aside your arrogance (it seems to be part and parcel of being &#39;born again atheist&#39;... like some sort of bragging right: &quot;yay! I&#39;m atheist! I are smart now!&quot;) and take a look at the information. Blah blah blah.</p>

<p>I thank you for the info...but the bullshit about me lying and begging the question is inaccurate and needs to be addressed. You were wrong for that.</p>

<p>I said I appreciate this reddit, but i&#39;m not trying to hear about wizards and magic spells of israel. What the fuck don&#39;t you understand?</p>

<p>And yes! I&#39;m an atheist! It doesn&#39;t make me better than anyone else. No where did I assert that. BUT it does mean that suggesting that there is a secret key which unlocks the mystical energy of the earth hidden in israel is NOT something i&#39;m willing to entertain...SPECIFICALLY because sometimes that sort of crap floods this reddit. </p>

<p>Like i&#39;ve said before and i&#39;ll say again. I announced my &quot;stance&quot; so as to make sure I wouldn&#39;t get answers suggesting Harry Potter but rather answers that addressed the issues at hand. Since you took so much offense to it, maybe you&#39;re a believer yourself. Thats fine. I don&#39;t care. Just don&#39;t tell me about how my third-eye isn&#39;t open or how I can vibrate on higher energy levels when in reality I just want to know what the objective reasons for support for israel are. </p>

<p>I say &quot;honest question&quot; because I want the answer to be objective and not overly supportive of religious doctrine. Its one thing to say, its because of americas support of zionism as stated by biblical principle, and its another to say ITS BECAUSE AMERICA SHOULD STAND UP AND DEFEND ISRAEL AGAINST THE WITCHDOCTORS OF THE ILLUMINATI AND THE 3rd EYE!.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I come to one of two conclusions from this post.</p>

<p>a) This is a brilliant fusion of red herring and logical reversal, which you were paid to post.</p>

<p>b) You&#39;re simply misinformed.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Israeli != Jewish != Zionist (as in, one can be one without being the others).</p>

<hr/>

<p>Israel sits on Zion, which is the holy land of all Western religion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Zion (Hebrew: ציון‎; Tiberian vocalization: Ṣiyyôn; transliterated Zion or Sion) is a term that most often refers to Jerusalem and, by extension, the Biblical land of Israel. The word is found in texts dating back almost three millennia.[citation needed] In Kabbalah the more esoteric reference is made to Zion[1] being the spiritual point from which reality emerges, located in the Holy of Holies of the First, Second and Third Temple. It commonly referred to a specific mountain near Jerusalem (Mount Zion), on which stood a Jebusite fortress of the same name that was conquered by David and was named the City of David.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zion also being the Christian holy land is supported by its mention in the Book of Psalms, a formative codex of both the Torah and the Bible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Psalms (Tiberian: Təhillîm; Modern: Tehillim, תְהִלִּים, or &quot;praises&quot;) is a book of the Hebrew Bible <strong>and the Christian Bible</strong>.</p>

<p>&quot;By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.&quot; (Psalms 137:1 KJV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, consider. The vast majority of the leaders of the USA are rich, have stock in arms companies, and are deeply religious - not to mention that they display overt allegiance to Israel.</p>

<p>It is all but perfectly logical to assume that some people in such a position, given that they are indeed deeply religious, would use their power and influence to push towards religious goals and ideals.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to assume that one of these goals might be to orchestrate a return of the human race to the Holy Land.</p>

<p>The only &quot;mysticism&quot; here is the fairy tales in the minds of senators and state leaders. Everything else is politics and business. Follow the money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, however, is just the coverstory. It provides a convenient scapegoat for covering up the atrocious underbelly of the corrupt banking and corporate mafia-like operations. And, it is beautifully conceived, because anyone who challenges this is automatically easily labeled anti-semitic. It is, in their minds, an equivocation: &quot;anti-Israel == anti-semite&quot;.</p>

<p>And, I&#39;m fairly certain that people who are anti-Israel are getting pretty tired of this unjustified labeling (especially anti-Israel Jews).</p>

<p>The even more nefarious potential here, however, is that this continued false-labeling may eventually create an anti-semitic uprising (among the Nazi party, the skinheads, whoever) and no amount of &quot;name-calling&quot; will stop the violence of such people. -- We of civil mind have done our best to keep these pots from boiling over (I, myself, have confronted more than one truly anti-semitic person here on reddit in an effort to stifle such hatred). But it may all be in vain, if these Zionist monsters keep feeding that fire... in which case, all I&#39;ll be able to do is pity the victims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Israel doesn&#39;t exist for any one reason.</p>

<p>A lot of Jews support Israel because it&#39;s their homeland.  A lot of the world that hates them does it <em>because</em> of the tradition of distrusting wandering outsiders, which with out a homeland Jews were.  It happens that Israel is round-about the ancestral Jewish homeland, so unless America went back in time to make that happen then it&#39;s location in the Middle East is at worst a happy, or is it sad, coincidence for American foreign policy.  This is probably more unfortunate for Israelis then anything, despite claims otherwise by the Christian Identity set.  Jews didn&#39;t choose their history, so why people begrudge them wanting a homeland to settle in and choosing their, you know, homeland as that homeland, is beyond me.</p>

<p>Some Christians support Israel because they think it&#39;s part of biblical prophecy of the end times that requires a Jewish settlement in Palestine or the dome of the rock needs to be blown up or some such thing.  Then again one of the requirements for their messiah was to establish this Jewish homeland in the first place, so it&#39;s all a bit confusing and I guess that means Ben-Gurion is the real Jesus anyway, so all bets are off.</p>

<p>Some people support Israel because the Israeli lobby pays them too, while others, like a lot of elected officials, support Israel because their constituents support her.</p>

<p>Some governments support Israel because they see it as a human right to have a homeland and the Jewish history with persecution makes them a pretty obvious and compelling candidate for the effort.  Some governments, including some in the above group, support Israel because fuck the Jews, we got us a foot hold in oil heaven.</p>

<p>Some people support Israel because they are Zionists and fuck the rest of us.</p>

<p>It might be confusing because many people hold several of these opinions at the same time, but support for Israel doesn&#39;t come from one or the other, it&#39;s a complex mixture of good, bad, selfish and strange intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>honest answer: you are asking the most retarded crowd on Reddit. not that the rest of Reddit has a half-decent logical opinion of Israel. Reddit could be the WORST place on the internet to ask about my country. It&#39;s like walking into a KKK rally asking for their opinion on the NAACP.</p>

<p>in regards to what the OP is asking, can you tell us what Israel gives the USA?</p>

<p>You sir have hated, congratulations. Please keep on with your hating as it only shows how ignorant and jelly you are.</p>

<p>Be well!</p>

<p>If you are serious about not knowing what Israel gives the USA, then you should probably stop talking about my country because you clearly don&#39;t know shit. Have a good life!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol u sound mad, re-read what i wrote, you didn&#39;t come to Palestine in 1948, no you were coming since the beginning of the 1900&#39;s. What i said is that you stole the land in 1948, when you created you state on top of Palestine. If Israelies weren&#39;t so brainwashed, you would realize that you are in the wrong.</p>

<p>i know the history better than most: the white papers, the protocols, the rothchilds, the Media and Political powers your lord over the world, the massacre&#39;s your all responsible for.</p>

<p>No Shakshuka, you can&#39;t answer my questions, because thought is something that a brainwashed &quot;intellectual&quot; is not capable of on his own, in fact im sure most Israelies accept that they are war criminals, but its the poker face that conceals all that shame you hold, that truly bothers me.</p>

<p>That Poker face..po po po poker face....LMAO!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This, however, is just the coverstory. It provides a convenient scapegoat for covering up the atrocious underbelly of the corrupt banking and corporate mafia-like operations. And, it is beautifully conceived, because anyone who challenges this is automatically easily labeled anti-semitic. It is, in their minds, an equivocation: &quot;anti-Israel == anti-semite&quot;.</p>

<p>And, I&#39;m fairly certain that people who are anti-Israel are getting pretty tired of this unjustified labeling (especially anti-Israel Jews).</p>

<p>The even more nefarious potential here, however, is that this continued false-labeling may eventually create an anti-semitic uprising (among the Nazi party, the skinheads, whoever) and no amount of &quot;name-calling&quot; will stop the violence of such people. -- We of civil mind have done our best to keep these pots from boiling over (I, myself, have confronted more than one truly anti-semitic person here on reddit in an effort to stifle such hatred). But it may all be in vain, if these Zionist monsters keep feeding that fire... in which case, all I&#39;ll be able to do is pity the victims.</p>
