       Western media has tried to frame it as Gaddafi killing thousands of peaceful protestors. What is actually happening is an armed insurrection. The people that the Libyan army/Gaddafi's forces are killing are armed rebels with serious equipment.

       The living standards of Libyans have improved significantly since the 1970s, ranking the country among the highest in Africa. Urbanization, developmental projects, and high oil revenues have enabled the Libyan government to elevate its people's living standards. The social and economic status of women and children has particularly improved. Various subsidized or free services (health, education, housing, and basic foodstuffs) have ensured basic necessities. The low percentage of people without access to safe water (3 percent), health services (0 percent) and sanitation (2 percent), and a relatively high life expectancy (70.2 years) in 1998 indicate the improved living standards. Adequate health care and subsidized foodstuffs have sharply reduced infant mortality, from 105 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 20 per 1,000 live births in 1998. The government also subsidizes education, which is compulsory and free between the ages of 6 and 15. The expansion of educational facilities has elevated the literacy rate (78.1 in 1998).

       Seriously, please elaborate. This just seems a little over anxious for me. I mean of all the wars since WWII, why would this be it? The Korean War, Vietnam, the first Gulf War, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, etc. Of all of the countries we have been involved with in conflict, why is Libya so important that it would spark WWIII? Oil isn't a good enough reason for me, because other countries we have already attacked have a lot more, in fact, the US even has a lot more domestically.

      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this is a join UN mission tells me they are just protecting oil assets (French oil companies), and probably ousting Qadaffi because he is pretty much slaughtering people and waging war on his own capita, but I don't see any real political play here. This is Africa, the continent that the world never seems to care about, and I don't see why they would enough now to start WWIII. Hundreds of thousands of people die needlessly on that continent everyday from lack of food and clean water, yet you think a few cruise missiles knocking out some SAM sites in Libya is going to spark WWIII?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are over reacting.

       Is he really "pretty much slaughtering people and waging war on his own capita"?  Or is he defending himself from "rebel forces" curiously well-equipped and organized?
      </p>

       This may not be the start of WWIII, but after witnessing two false wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as two true uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt (not to mention hastily censored reports of civilian casualties in Libya caused by air strikes), I think even red-blooded conservatives in America are waking up to the very obvious reality that this is no peacekeeping operation.

       There seems to also be a division within Libya, no? The western parts, namely Tripoli, are privy to a lot more than the people in the east - where the oil actually is. The people of Libya get much less, on average, than what their government COULD provide. Gaddafi is blatantly stealing from his own people. Now, I'm not saying NATO doesn't have ulterior motives for assaulting the country, but your data doesnt really have much worth in this particular discussion.

       Libya is one of only a few remaining nations in the whole world without one.  Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan are the others.  Small wonder why we won't leave them alone.

       Some websites say so, but I did some research and discovered that Iran joined the IMF way back a long time ago.  Still, because of its current troubles I speculate that Iran might be trying to wrest back some measure of independence in this regard.  Here's an article I stumbled across just now:

       What's really interesting to note with the Rothschild angle is that if they are as responsible for global happenings as people claim they are, then they appear to be stepping up, almost
       <em>
        rushing
       </em>
       their efforts to gain more control.

       I agree with the OP,

      <p>
       I had lived in Libya for 8 years- as a none arab, I was treated like crap by the people and HATED that country...

       However, I can SAFELY say that what I'm reading on reddit and all the other media is complete BS.

       These are NOT civilians, these are ARMED rebels.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are millions of people that are fine with the gov, and only maybe 20 000 who are trying to rid of the gov.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Libyan gov have done good to the people - heck i remember that they bought 20 000 $ cars (forgot the brand) and sold it to the people at 6000.... alot of good came out of the gov.
      </p>
      <p>
       if Qadafi looses his hold on these morons - other counties better watch out, as these armed rebels are just asking for help from the west, when in reality all they want to do is KILL people from the west.

       When does a civilian become a rebel? When he picks up a gun. No one is denying that the people fighting Gaddafi are armed - it's kinda hard to overthrow a mad dictator without them (although possible). Your estimations of "maybe 20 000" are just completely made up, by the way.

       yes, when they break the rules and cause a threat.
did we see people in Egypt getting weapons and bombing the gov? no...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true shit escalated a bit too much since Qadafi is a bit insane (sometimes really insane) however, EVEN if he does leave power and these guys, the REBELS go in power... do you people know who they are or what they want?
      </p>

       EVERY libyan person i met HATES america, christians and the jews. only a few educated ones are not insane about it.

       so now they're sucking up to the states, once order is gone, they will be bombing us and hell will break loose.

       We should've stayed out of this and left it for them to deal with - also if you were to read further on, you'll see why france pushed on this (all the assists they own).

       You sir are either misinformed or lying, those figures are wholly innaccurate. My family are out there, 20,000 against? I think you'll find it's the other way around. I'm staggered another human being can even quote figures like that. My feeling is shill!

       Anyone who believes major western govts do anything other than represent the interests of the powerful while bullshitting a deliberately intellectually retarded tax base and labor force is a useful idiot.

       Noting you are told is anywhere near the truth and 30+ years of mindnumbing tv culture and an education system that leaves most without critical thinking skills has left most of the western worlds majorities as brain dead ADD emotionally reactionary children spoonfed bullshit their entire lives.

       No. Though I think Caesar burnt it down on purpose. Like I believe a lot of what was destroyed in Iraq was on purpose so the Iraqis would have less of a focus for their national identity. Israel has done the same thing in Palestine.

       Yeah good luck with that one, I hope shit really gets bad in America so you people can see what actually tyranny and oppression is like. Maybe you'll stop crying for revolution and chaos everytime you don't agree with something the government does. FYI most revolutions end with a more tyrannical and inexperienced government, the first american revolution is one of the few exceptions.

       Its less interesting when you realize that Al-qaeda has always been Muslims engaging in activity that is helpful to the Western military agenda.  Also Al-qaeda was originally just the name of a database of CIA assets.  So Gadaffi calling the agressors Al-qaeda is not that far off.

       Thanks... for posting this. I agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/g7vnt/libyan_rebels_are_indiscriminately_executing/">
        The Rebels are killing all the black people too...
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems that there are quite a few African-looking (black) people living in Libya... not surprising, given that Libya is in North Africa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black people come to this Arab country because it is (was) stable, has (had) a good standard of living, has free health care and they can (could) find work there.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, now, if you are black in Libya, you are in a lot of danger from the Libyan Rebels.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, the Libyan Rebels (the guys the US and France and the UK are supporting) don't like black people very much. There seems to be some ethnic cleansing (genocide) going on. They are saying that all black people are Pro-Ghaddafi Mercenaries and they are kidnapping and executing them. There have been various cases where black people in Libya have been attacked as mercenaries and found later to be just some laborers from a nearby country. See
       <a href="http://somalilandpress.com/libya-rebels-execute-black-immigrants-while-forces-kidnap-others-20586">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rebels sometimes kill the black people and parade the corpses around.
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utHdXuEmq_k&amp;amp;skipcontrinter=1">
        Watch this youtube video of actual dead black people piled onto a rebel's car, driven around for all to see
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Ghaddafi hiring African Mercenaries, that is apparently just a rumor (if anyone finds any proof, please provide a link).

       We all contribute.  If you look back at our founding fathers, and their strive for equality, you'll notice that they didn't give up their slaves at least until after they died in a will or after their wife died.  We know oil is bad and produces all these outcomes, yet we continue to use products that are subsidized by the government that are connected to these resources that our military is used for acquiring.

       TBH ive never met a bad american, in fact they are some of the most polite and hospitable people ive met BUT America is spilling the blood of people  across the world for profit, americans have got it into their heads that they are the perennial good guys. If the US cared about rights of foreign ppl they wouldnt have turned their backs on Palestinians, or they would be more critical of china over Tibet etc etc etc. The US state and its press is filled with murderers and assassins or those that are complicit in such actions. Yes there are some good people like Dr paul, Kucinich and a few others but on the whole they are loons.

       America is a big country with over 300 million people.  How many Palestinians are there?
       <a href="http://www.israeldemography.com/">
        2.4 million
       </a>
       ? That's less than the state of
       <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Census10/HouseAndElectors.phtml">
        Utah
       </a>
       with 2.7 million people.  And you want us to care?
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that, I will say that most of the people I know do care about the plight of the Palestinian people and vote accordingly (Massachusetts).  But I am afraid we are in the minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, also, that the U.S. is about 77% religious, the majority of whom are Christians, who are mostly supportive of Zion, and by default, against the Palestinians.

       I am an atheist, so I am against Zionism.

       Think about who the US soldiers are.  Not the officers, the brass, but the guys walking around on the ground.  They are 17, 18, 19 year old boys who play video games, read 4chan and beat up fat kids at school.  These are not men, they are not mature individuals, they have little or no education past a general high school one.  These are not kids destined for Harvard or MIT or CalTech or Sarah Lawrence or Smith College.  These are the kids who had no other option but to go to the military.

       I've read that Wikileaks was started by the Chinese.  I've read that it is maintained by Israel and the "cables" released have little or no actual impact, but are official enough to point fingers or create a stir.

       I've taken to the stance that "trust is earned, not given" is some childish bullshit, and figure it's best to hear things out before being dismissive.

       Benjamin Fulford seems like a bit of a quack to me. Saw him speaking to Rockerfeller and it was just cringeworthy. As for wikileaks... I see it as possible that some organisation may have been feeding them leaks, with any that incriminate themselves removed of course. Whether Assange and his team know this or not I don't know. Regardless if they do or not, I think they're still the real deal in what their aim is and the service they provide to people with potentially secret information.

       Also, Total made out REALLY WELL in that contract you're linking to. Total had a great deal with the Libyan government, it is unlikely that after this they will still have such a favorable contract, so I'm not sure what you're trying to say about that.

       Nobody said Benghazi was a 'war zone' - the cruise missle strikes came in part as a response to Libyan forces continuing to advance toward Benghazi.

       I agree that our intervention in Libya is not about us saving civilian lives or promoting democracy, but that doesn't change the fact that Gaddafi IS a murderous tyrant, and the majority of the people in Libya support a democratic uprising.

       The contract almost halved their share. I saw in the news here (UK), large pieces on the story that he had used airstrikes on his own people, and the same for the violence in Benghazi. I'm not saying he is a victim. He is old, crazy and a dictator. However, he has not been the brutal one he is made out to be. Libyans quality of life is the best in Africa.

       I'm not saying he is the good guy. What I am saying is that he is being used as a scape goat, or a means to an end in a greater plot. I know a little what Libya is like (or at least was 25 years ago) as my father, who is British, grew up there. Gadaffi is a dictator, and slightly off his rocker and has made sure that his family sees a nice sum from the oil. He talks shit and has held power for far too long. However he is not a rampant murderer killing any civilian that gets in his way. But that is what is being used as the pretext for France, UK and the US to get their fingers into the pie.

       I'd guess to say that it is another textbook conquest. There's lots of oil, money to be made by dropping bombs and money to be made repairing the damage of those bombs. It's happened time and again. The western capital interests i.e the banks, defence, oil, infrastructure companies go through the process via "diplomatic relations" and "trade missions" to get what they want out of regimes. Politicians and diplomats and trade envoys are their tools.  Whether the target regime/country be a dictatorship or not. Soft power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both the US and UK had renewed full on relations with Libya in recent years. Tony Blair and Berlusconi were very receptive to Libya, not so long ago. France also had alot of deals going on. The Scottish government released the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds. BP got a nice billion worth of contracts around the same time for offshore exploration. Russia even got in on it and (I think) sold some weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere down the line, Gaddafi and/or his government have either become less malleable (again) or the limit for what was able to be gotten out of them has been reached. So the political and economic screw gets turned. See the recent-ish sanctions. If this gets nowhere they turn it on even more. The economic jackals get sent in, sometimes including the IMF and world bank, the media is used and all the non military options are on the table. If this still does not work then it's just a matter of waiting for the right time to get in there (e.g armed rebellion or mass protests), or if unpatient and those aren't in sight, then you go full blown war. See Iraq for the latest example in this model. I highly recommend "Confessions of an Economic Hit Man" and "The shock doctrine" for much more in depth insight.

       I like your analysis.  But I view this one as more of a crime of opportunity.  Pure speculation though.  It just seems too far fetched that the whole movement was completely planned.  They might of planted a few seeds and hoped for a similar outcome, but I cant imagine someone planning this course of events.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        THE continuationo f authority in a single individual has frequently been the downfall of democratic governments. Repeated elections are essential in popular systems, because nothing is more dangerous than allowing the same citizen to remain in power over a long period of time. The people become accustomed to obeying him, and he becomes accustomed to commanding them; this is how power is usurped and tyranny takes root. The freedom of the Republic must be jealously safeguarded, and our citizens should justly fear that the same magistrate who has governed them for many years might come to rule them for ever....

       Eh... because the people 'become accustomed to obeying him' does not make him a bad guy.  I mean, if he's a good leader, his extended amount of time being a good leader does not automatically make him a bad leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I can see this argument having validity over the course of generations where... say a good leader passes on leadership to his son who is an 'okay' leader, who passes it on to a so-so son, who passes it on to a bad leader - each growing up and being more progressively used to the "rights and privileges" they get from leadership and less concerned about their responsibilities to the people - and by that time the people have gotten used to the "ruling" family and suffer under the rule of 'tyrants' because it's been done that way for a long time.  But the amount of time in and of itself of a single person in power  - though it can be a factor down the line if he begins to set up such a system - does not necessarily change him from a good guy to a bad guy.

       Eh yeah after thinking about it overnight, I can see where someone who, as he gets older, clings to power itself at all cost regardless of what's good for the people can turn a good leader into a bad.  I still don't see that time-spent-in-leadership alone should be the deciding factor in whether someone a good or bad guy/leader.  But yeah I can see where it can happen with an individual.  I wouldn't judge a longstanding ruler on that basis
       <em>

       there's evidence of that occurring, though.

        this?
       </a>
       Did they publish proof of it? I haven't heard much on mainstream media about it anymore. Guess that would explain the frontline operations being led by the French army.

       I have also found very little of it, other than officials in France saying it is false. Nothing concrete from what I can find. There are other numerous murky business links between Tripoli and Paris out there. I was going to add it in my post, but there isn't enough solid info to draw lines from, even though it could further explain the extensive involvement of the French. Worth considering though. Thanks for the post.

       Concerns about ulterior motives of the French in Africa have been around before this too. A lot of EU countries were hesitant to help them in the Congo recently because of concerns it was a form of neo-colonialism by the French in Africa.

       They have definitely been the most gung-ho about it. They were the first to recognize the rebels, started support for action, and were the first to scramble aircraft. Of course, it is the USA that is doing most of the work at the beginning (the French and British don't have the capabilities); but the French are going to take the lead after the initial strikes are concluded.

       I was trying to tell you guys this 3 weeks ago when they said all the protests were happening yet there were no video of anything but people throwing shoes at a screen of Gaddafi... this is the latest false-flag coup but definitely not the last; and you had better believe were going to war with Iran soon; if they don't act soon they know they will have no chance so im sure they will be forced to make the first move, only time will tell.

       But how do you know those are actually Libyan people in the videos? How do you know that they are the "rebels." The only thing you know is what the media is feeding you and its all lies. Well 80% lies peppered with truth... believe what you want but I don't see how you can just confirm that all these people that are rebelling are from Libya or even have justification for that revolt.

       I understand the skeptecism, but I'm pretty convinced. I see posters flying pictures of anti  gaddafi  phrases. I see their main cities packed with people. There doesn't seem to be a reason to doubt the authenticity of what's going on over there. I know the difference between some FOX news Bullshit picture authenticity. But im always willing to consider and look at the possibility of your perspective. Got anything I should see to sway my opinion?

       It is obvious to me that this is a false flag coup to overthrow the country and push the Israeli Zionist agenda even further in order to provoke Iran to strike first causing an all out World War against Zionist / Palestinian regimes.... in my mind its like a bully instigating you to strike first so he can for lack of a better word **** your world up.

       How does this prove the false flag coup though? 2nd video, of course the Gaddhafi supporters are going to say that. 3rd video, probably happened, doesnt prove anything about a false flag coupe, etc. etc.  Here is what I won't deny: As someone who has been keeping up on this as much as possible, I would be willing to say The U.S. does have an agenda here, and of course they are going to spin this in the best way possible for them. However, I don't think it goes as far as a false flag coupe, although perhaps close.

       Where there's smoke there's a fire... And there's alot of smoke here... Don't forget that Libya is right next to Israel and is key territory for them to go after... Zionists have been pushing them out of there homes for ages now... Take a look at Palestinian occupied territory in 1950 and compare it to now... There is an agenda here and its not just about oil. Also Russia, China, Venezuela are all condemning these attacks. We spent 68 million dollars yesterday launching 120 missles... The military industrial complex rules as always

        Tony Blair's meeting with Gaddafi
       </a>
       back in 2007.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Under the terms of the deal, Britain was committed to “exchanges of information and views on defense structures, military and security organizations;
        <strong>
         exchanges of visits by experts
        </strong>
        and exchange of printed materials in the field of military education and science;
       </p>

      <p>
       I think its clear just what kind of experts Blair sent in the exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then this article in 2009
       <a href="http://www.neurope.eu/articles/92240.php">
        Will Gaddafi pull a Chavez in the oil industry?
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Over the last couple of years (2007-2009), the Libyan leader has held landmark meetings with Nicolas Sarkozy, Gordon Brown, Silvio Berlusconi, Condoleezza Rice and Vladimir Putin all of whom vowed to strengthen cooperation with Tripoli in several projects, and especially in oil and gas development.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is exactly why the West was caught by surprise when Gaddafi,..., was quoted by the press as saying he is considering nationalizing operations of international oil companies...

       I love how people see Iraq and Libya as different.  Let's see how they match up:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The attack on Iraq was not justified because we attacked Iraq for their oil!"
      </p>
      <p>
       We actually get almost no oil from Iraq.  We get a similarly small amount from Libya, yet... no one's saying this is for oil, as well?

       "The attack on Libya is justified because Gaddafi's a dictator committing a genocide against his own people!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And Saddam didn't?

       - sure seems like he committed a far, FAR worse crime than anything anyone is claiming Gaddafi has done.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The attack on Libya is justified because the UN has OK'ed it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Who cares what a bunch of national sovereignty-stealing crooks say?
2) The UN was sold to us as a way to
       <em>
        prevent
       </em>
       wars.  Now we're starting wars because they say so?
3) Part of the justification of the Iraq war has been that Iraq violated UN resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're both wrong.  A couple of my friends are Middle Easterners.  They don't like Gaddafi, but they're still against our involvement.  Even the protesters have put up banners telling the western governments to stay out of this.

       Exactly. c0mputar is using incredibly easily compromised sources as proof. Numerous videos on Liveleak, Reddit and YouTube? Really? I've seen a lot of these videos and what was frustrating to me was never seeing them verified by anyone of any real credibility.

       i'm sorry this statement just shows your ignorance on the subject. i ask anyone who says this is a purely armed rebellion to answer honestly: when did you start following the events in libya? i bet you think the protests started on the 17th. instead of making up random conspiracy theories, how about you talk to someone who actually has family in libya who will tell you what is going on.  protests STARTED peacefully, but they would be mowed down by live fire. and they were shot at with anti-aircraft and anti-tank rounds. it became an armed rebellion when police and army members refused to shoot at their own people and started defending them.  look at tripoli, they have no guns at all there, and they have came out multiple times in peaceful protests only to be mowed down. seriously this ignorance of the issue. yes the bombings of civilian residents wasnt true, but because of one rumor you're gonna dismiss all the facts? and of course there were rumors, people saw and heard explosions, which was from shelling of cities, and assumed they were from planes.  there are no media allowed, and everything is by word of mouth. say wat u want about US and british true interests in the region, but to say this started as an armed rebellion is just retarded

       I've known about Libya for my whole life. Like I said else where, my father grew up there. No I did not only start paying attention recently. All I am doing is providing discussion about how the media is shaping what is going on there. MOST people will know nothing about it and accept all of the facts the TV tells them about the place. I'm pointing out that these "facts" may not be accurate, and hypothesizing as to why. There has been little footage of
       <em>
        mass
       </em>
       protests, not when you compare it to Egypt or Tunisia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I please have a source for "they have came out multiple times in peaceful protests only to be mowed down"? Cheers. Oh and no media allowed? lol. There isn't a hotel room to be had in Benghazi, because of all the media.

       There are a TON of videos of people getting killed. im talking about from peacefully protesting not the ones out fighting now.
      </p>
      <p>
       OMG benghazi has media NOW. there wasnt any media for over a week in libya, and that is the time period that the rumors of the bombing came from.  gaddafi IS shelling the people: (example:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfydO-Z-D0M">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfydO-Z-D0M

       , a lot more videos with this if you feel its not sufficient)
      </p>
      <p>
       YES rumors were abound in the beginning, but are you going to deny the massacres that have been going on in the country?

       here's the problem you now put. if i post independently recorded video they're "questionable", if i put video put by western media outlets you say "propaganda". its honestly not even worth it. look at those videos of people protesting, waving the revolutionary flag and chanting anti-gaddafi slogans.  where do you think thats happening, france? common give me a break

       look up videos for yourself. you say you've been following the events from the beginning, then by which media outlet and which sources? you're not a libyan, you don't know people in libya. it was a complete blackout for the first week, so how would you have heard anything?

       i'm sorry this statement just shows your ignorance on the subject. i ask anyone who says this is a purely armed rebellion to answer honestly: when did you start following the events in libya? i bet you think the protests started on the 17th. instead of making up random conspiracy theories, how about you talk to someone who actually has family in libya who will tell you what is going on.  protests STARTED peacefully, but they would be mowed down by live fire. and they were shot at with anti-aircraft and anti-tank rounds. it became an armed rebellion when police and army members refused to shoot at their own people and started defending them.  look at tripoli, they have no guns at all there, and they have came out multiple times in peaceful protests only to be mowed down. seriously this ignorance of the issue. yes the bombings of civilian residents wasnt true, but because of one rumor you're gonna dismiss all the facts? and of course there were rumors, people saw and heard explosions, which was from shelling of cities, and assumed they were from planes.  there are no media allowed, and everything is by word of mouth. say wat u want about US and british true interests in the region, but to say this started as an armed rebellion is just retarded

       It was, quite clearly, an honest mistake. And maybe the reason why conspiracy theories are rarely supported by the public is because people like you put down anyone who asks about the topic, and prefer to insult rather than inform.

       If you watched this story unfold from the beginning, you would see that it did start out somewhat in that fasion. Peaceful protestors were protesting untill they were so many, that Gaddafi started mandating curfues and using force to try to get rid of the protestors. Gaddafi made the first move to use force against them, and as such we are now at our present state of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate that you're on this side of the argument, because with a (LOT MORE) research you'de be able to find answers that go against your current theory and point of view.

       So the protestors got heavily armed literally over night? As soon as Gadaffi's forces started firing, they got hold of the arsenal they now have? No, some of the factions (tribal, Islamic) have been armed prior to this, and they have been active in Libya long before the TV started talking about it. I suggest you do a LOT MORE research. Cheers.

       You make some interesting points, and I will be sure to look further into this. But, you are aware that a no-fly zone resolution means
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       that Libya cannot use their planes, right? There is no actual deployment by any country to Libya, nor is any country supporting either side. The fear that Libya might attack civilians from the air is a quite legitimate one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite simply, if no Libyan plane leaves the ground then all external involvement in Libya ends. As in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       external involvement in it's
       <em>
        totality
       </em>
       will cease. This isn't a war or an invasion.

       Umm, what? I'm a bit confused by what you're saying here. There have been airstrikes on many government/army installations and land weapons. As for the fear that Libya might attack it's civilians from the air, I haven't seen any concrete proof that it has happened...before or after the NFZ. Was any proof given that Libya had planes in the sky once France and UK started bombing? I didn't see any, they just went in and took out military installments regardless of whether there were any Libyan planes in the sky.

       Fair point.
An interesting, emotional story. Ever see an interview with the defectors? Ever heard their names? I'm not saying it isn't true, but if it isn't, it has that sensationalist emotional bent to it that we see all too often used in shaping public opinion.

       I saw it on CNN not more than an hour ago.  First, the US denies they used any missile at all on his compound, then some reporters found a few missile parts with English words on them (like, "motor assembly part #3" or some such).  The military then says, "OOOOOooohhh, you mean THOSE missiles.  Yeah, that was, um, knocking out some 'command and control' infrastructure that just, er, happened to also be in his house.  It's a coincidence, we weren't targeting him at all."  Sorry, no links, I'm just getting this from the tee vee.

       Edit: top article on CNN at the moment:

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "A coalition military official insisted neither Gadhafi nor his residence were intended targets of the bombing late Sunday. But the official -- who was not being identified because of the sensitivity of the information -- said the compound was targeted because it contained capabilities to exercise command and control over Libyan forces."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Aaaah, yes, makes perfect sense.  We're not going after Gadhafi, we're just targeting, you know, the surrounding 100 foot area that he's standing in.  Screw that area.

       From what I've seen in the press the over 110 Tomahawk missiles into Libya from the US and UK sure doesn't seem like the aggression "totality" ceased, even with no Libyan planes in the air.

       Maybe that explains why the Arab League is now voicing their displeasure with this, saying it's no longer a "no fly zone" but some other military exercise they will not support.

       What did you think a no fly zone was going to be? Dog fights? It was explained weeks ago that ground targets would have to be taken out so air dominance can be established.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the UN resolution stated that civilians should be protected from Libyan forces. That's why tanks and other ground targets are being destroyed. The Arab league knew that and it is still unclear that they are officially critical of the attacks.

      <p>
       And to this whole the Libyan civilian bombing hasn't been documented argument. Why were there defectors that flew Migs to Malta and say they were ordered to bomb and shoot protesters. Just because you can't find a you-tube video showing a plane actively bombing people doesn't mean it never happened.

       Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this standard procedure when a no-fly zone is enforced in foreign land. They need to remove Libya's ability to disobey. From what I've heard there hasn't been any casualties.

       disobey what? if there's a rule saying that a government can't defend itself from an armed insurrection, please show me. as far as i'm aware, this is a civil war and the united
       <del>
        states
       </del>
       nations is illegally intervening in a sovereign nation's affairs. whether you call it an invasion (my preferred nomenclature), a simple NFZ, whatever.. i'm of the mind that the UN's actions are completely unjustified. just b/c it's multilateral doesn't make it right.

       Disobey the UN resolution that enforces a no-fly zone over Libya. Whether or not you think there should be such a resolution, there is, therefor Libya can either obey or disobey. You may think that Libya is right to disobey, but still there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       something to disobey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that the UN Resolution seeks to impose the sovereignty of the people, as opposed to the sovereignty of the government. It has become immensely obvious that they people of Libya would like a new government. At what point did we decide that the sovereignty of a government was more important than the will of the people that government are supposed to serve?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: If it is your belief that it isn't the will of the people, I would be more than willing to listen to why - I am simply saying this is the way it appears to me from initial impressions and an admittedly limited knowledge on the subject.

       here's my point. the libyan people aren't a monolithic anit-gaddafi bloc. there are plenty of people (mostly in the west) that still support the old bastard. you might not have seen it on our media, but there's been pro-gaddafi gatherings as well. in terms of sovereignty, the state has the sovereignty over a given land area unless it is shown to have grossly abused that power.
      </p>
      <p>
       now, what we have in libya isn't just a one way street. it's a civil war. as i see it, the libyan people are fighting amongst themselves to determine who has (or hasn't) the sovereign right to rule the area that compromises the libyan state. since this conflict isn't pouring into other states (thereby infringing on their sovereignty) and there isn't evidence of human rights abuses in this conflict, i'd say that the state still has sovereignty. do i hope the rebels win? sure. but i think that they should win by themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, here's an example of why i think the UN involvement is wrong. let's take our civil war. let's imagine we start fighting in 1861 and a few weeks into the war, great britain says "well fuck india, if the US is in a war, let's go see if we can't get on the confederates' side and maybe get a piece of that big resource pie over there!" so they start sending ships and they're just bombing the fuck outta washington, ny and boston, severely hampering the Union's effort to defend itself as a sovereign state. do you support that hypothetical international interference?

       there needs to be concrete proof of this. dots don't do the trick
      </p>
      <p>
       and you can't just revoke sovereignty. it's like guilt in an american court, just b/c someone is accused doesn't mean that person is guilty. it's b/c of his incumbency and his armed forces (he's on equal footing to obama and the US armed forces in the eyes of the UN) that his gov't has sovereignty. and if defying UN resolutions was all that was needed for a revocation of sovereignty, there'd be quite a few states all around the globe that wouldn't have the right to rule the land that they control.
      </p>
      <p>
       and i agree that the majority don't want gaddafi to rule the country, that's why there's a civil war. and if the majority not wanting a leader in power serves as impetus for UN action, where were france and the uk after the 2000 elections in the US?

       You're not serious are you? You can't seriously think that people changing their minds about a democratically elected leader is the same as a leader who forced his way into power and refuses to leave slaughtering all opposition in order to maintain power.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't agree with the UN Resolution, that's fine, but don't base your dissent on some false notion that Gaddafi isn't a violent fascist or that he has any place ruling Libya besides the fact that he is
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       ruling Libya and has enough military force to oppress his people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The revocation of sovereignty is not based on disobeying a UN Resolution, but rather the UN Resolution is based on a perceived end of Gaddafi's sovereignty over Libya. Libya's sovereignty is not at stake here; Gaddafi's is. Gaddafi is the only thing keeping Libya from being sovereign.

       no of course i'm not serious. i'm taking what you said to the extreme to show that your generalities aren't helping this discussion. i think the fucker needs to go but 3 assholes from the UNSC firing missiles at his house when it's a NFZ operation isn't the way to go about this power exchange. and its motives are dubious at the very least.

       When did libya lose sovereignty? when gaddafi had the coup 40 yrs ago? when factions w/in his country decided to try and oust him? if we didn't like gaddafi so much, why did we try to bring him into the fold of 'normal' UN countries so recently? if it's all about being an asshole, why didn't we bomb him after lockerbie and all the other shit he's pulled?
      </p>
      <p>
       a country's sovereignty isn't dependent on what form of gov't it happens to possess. revoking a state's sovereignty is serious business so i suggest that you read the UN charter before you continue, it'd be helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       another related point - if the UN was so against gaddafi, why were they patting him on the back for the past half decade? if you think this is just about gaddafi, think again man. it's not about him 'nearing benghazi' it's about the oil under benghazi and the rest of eastern libya.

       My point was that the sovereignty of a countries people trumps the sovereignty of a countries government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're probably right about the motives of the involved countries, but motives alone don't invalidate actions. So long as what they are doing falls in line with what should be done I could care a lot less
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       they are doing it.

       My post wasn't really that long, you
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       take the time to read it. As I said: I'm not saying Libya isn't a sovereign nation, I am saying that the sovereignty of a government isn't as important as the will of the people. No definition of what sovereignty is refutes this. We aren't arguing about the definition of sovereignty.

       Source for "The majority, it would seem, no longer want Gaddafi to rule..."? Any figures or studies? Even an estimate from some kind of agency that monitors these things? Heck, even some footage of Egypt level mass protests? (10s if not 100s of thousands of people).
