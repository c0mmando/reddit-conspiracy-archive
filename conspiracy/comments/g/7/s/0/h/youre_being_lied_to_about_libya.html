    <div class="md"><p>The living standards of Libyans have improved significantly since the 1970s, ranking the country among the highest in Africa. Urbanization, developmental projects, and high oil revenues have enabled the Libyan government to elevate its people&#39;s living standards. The social and economic status of women and children has particularly improved. Various subsidized or free services (health, education, housing, and basic foodstuffs) have ensured basic necessities. The low percentage of people without access to safe water (3 percent), health services (0 percent) and sanitation (2 percent), and a relatively high life expectancy (70.2 years) in 1998 indicate the improved living standards. Adequate health care and subsidized foodstuffs have sharply reduced infant mortality, from 105 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 20 per 1,000 live births in 1998. The government also subsidizes education, which is compulsory and free between the ages of 6 and 15. The expansion of educational facilities has elevated the literacy rate (78.1 in 1998).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, please elaborate. This just seems a little over anxious for me. I mean of all the wars since WWII, why would this be it? The Korean War, Vietnam, the first Gulf War, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, etc. Of all of the countries we have been involved with in conflict, why is Libya so important that it would spark WWIII? Oil isn&#39;t a good enough reason for me, because other countries we have already attacked have a lot more, in fact, the US even has a lot more domestically.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_oil_production</a></p>

<p>The fact that this is a join UN mission tells me they are just protecting oil assets (French oil companies), and probably ousting Qadaffi because he is pretty much slaughtering people and waging war on his own capita, but I don&#39;t see any real political play here. This is Africa, the continent that the world never seems to care about, and I don&#39;t see why they would enough now to start WWIII. Hundreds of thousands of people die needlessly on that continent everyday from lack of food and clean water, yet you think a few cruise missiles knocking out some SAM sites in Libya is going to spark WWIII?</p>

<p>I think you are over reacting.</p>

<p>This may not be the start of WWIII, but after witnessing two false wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as two true uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt (not to mention hastily censored reports of civilian casualties in Libya caused by air strikes), I think even red-blooded conservatives in America are waking up to the very obvious reality that this is no peacekeeping operation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There seems to also be a division within Libya, no? The western parts, namely Tripoli, are privy to a lot more than the people in the east - where the oil actually is. The people of Libya get much less, on average, than what their government COULD provide. Gaddafi is blatantly stealing from his own people. Now, I&#39;m not saying NATO doesn&#39;t have ulterior motives for assaulting the country, but your data doesnt really have much worth in this particular discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the OP,</p>

<p>I had lived in Libya for 8 years- as a none arab, I was treated like crap by the people and HATED that country...</p>

<p>However, I can SAFELY say that what I&#39;m reading on reddit and all the other media is complete BS.</p>

<p>These are NOT civilians, these are ARMED rebels.</p>

<p>there are millions of people that are fine with the gov, and only maybe 20 000 who are trying to rid of the gov.</p>

<p>the Libyan gov have done good to the people - heck i remember that they bought 20 000 $ cars (forgot the brand) and sold it to the people at 6000.... alot of good came out of the gov.</p>

<p>if Qadafi looses his hold on these morons - other counties better watch out, as these armed rebels are just asking for help from the west, when in reality all they want to do is KILL people from the west.</p>

<p>My friend almost got killed in my private school by ignorant idiots who thought you go to heaven for killing a christian- these people are nuts sometimes!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, when they break the rules and cause a threat.
did we see people in Egypt getting weapons and bombing the gov? no...</p>

<p>It&#39;s true shit escalated a bit too much since Qadafi is a bit insane (sometimes really insane) however, EVEN if he does leave power and these guys, the REBELS go in power... do you people know who they are or what they want?</p>

<p>EVERY libyan person i met HATES america, christians and the jews. only a few educated ones are not insane about it.</p>

<p>so now they&#39;re sucking up to the states, once order is gone, they will be bombing us and hell will break loose.</p>

<p>We should&#39;ve stayed out of this and left it for them to deal with - also if you were to read further on, you&#39;ll see why france pushed on this (all the assists they own).</p>

<p>why is there nothing being done in Bahrain, Ivory Coast...etc?
how about Rawanda? years and years of slaughter?</p>

<p>All what our govs&#39; want is money (oil and other assets)</p>

<p>Anyone who believes major western govts do anything other than represent the interests of the powerful while bullshitting a deliberately intellectually retarded tax base and labor force is a useful idiot.</p>

<p>Noting you are told is anywhere near the truth and 30+ years of mindnumbing tv culture and an education system that leaves most without critical thinking skills has left most of the western worlds majorities as brain dead ADD emotionally reactionary children spoonfed bullshit their entire lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks... for posting this. I agree. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/g7vnt/libyan_rebels_are_indiscriminately_executing/">The Rebels are killing all the black people too...</a> </p>

<p>So it seems that there are quite a few African-looking (black) people living in Libya... not surprising, given that Libya is in North Africa.</p>

<p>Black people come to this Arab country because it is (was) stable, has (had) a good standard of living, has free health care and they can (could) find work there.</p>

<p>However, now, if you are black in Libya, you are in a lot of danger from the Libyan Rebels.</p>

<p>You see, the Libyan Rebels (the guys the US and France and the UK are supporting) don&#39;t like black people very much. There seems to be some ethnic cleansing (genocide) going on. They are saying that all black people are Pro-Ghaddafi Mercenaries and they are kidnapping and executing them. There have been various cases where black people in Libya have been attacked as mercenaries and found later to be just some laborers from a nearby country. See <a href="http://somalilandpress.com/libya-rebels-execute-black-immigrants-while-forces-kidnap-others-20586">here</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g6YRYpd9NBR69h9dB9WiwISFEEZg?docId=f53c354409194ed58e05c79f2bb7bf17">here</a>  and <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201122865814378541.html">here</a> . </p>

<p>The Rebels sometimes kill the black people and parade the corpses around. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utHdXuEmq_k&amp;amp;skipcontrinter=1">Watch this youtube video of actual dead black people piled onto a rebel&#39;s car, driven around for all to see</a>. </p>

<p>As far as Ghaddafi hiring African Mercenaries, that is apparently just a rumor (if anyone finds any proof, please provide a link).</p>

<p>This is the first I&#39;ve heard of that. I&#39;ve heard of shelling, and people getting shot. </p>

<p>Also, Total made out REALLY WELL in that contract you&#39;re linking to. Total had a great deal with the Libyan government, it is unlikely that after this they will still have such a favorable contract, so I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to say about that.</p>

<p>Nobody said Benghazi was a &#39;war zone&#39; - the cruise missle strikes came in part as a response to Libyan forces continuing to advance toward Benghazi.</p>

<p>I agree that our intervention in Libya is not about us saving civilian lives or promoting democracy, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that Gaddafi IS a murderous tyrant, and the majority of the people in Libya support a democratic uprising.</p>

<p>Did you watch any of Gaddafi&#39;s recent speeches? (if you can call them that)</p>

<p>How can you paint him out as a victim of an international conspiracy without acknowledging his own crimes?</p>

I saw in the news here (UK), large pieces on the story that he had used airstrikes on his own people, and the same for the violence in Benghazi. I&#39;m not saying he is a victim. He is old, crazy and a dictator. However, he has not been the brutal one he is made out to be. Libyans quality of life is the best in Africa.</p>

I know a little what Libya is like (or at least was 25 years ago) as my father, who is British, grew up there. Gadaffi is a dictator, and slightly off his rocker and has made sure that his family sees a nice sum from the oil. He talks shit and has held power for far too long. However he is not a rampant murderer killing any civilian that gets in his way. But that is what is being used as the pretext for France, UK and the US to get their fingers into the pie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d guess to say that it is another textbook conquest. There&#39;s lots of oil, money to be made by dropping bombs and money to be made repairing the damage of those bombs. It&#39;s happened time and again. The western capital interests i.e the banks, defence, oil, infrastructure companies go through the process via &quot;diplomatic relations&quot; and &quot;trade missions&quot; to get what they want out of regimes. Politicians and diplomats and trade envoys are their tools.  Whether the target regime/country be a dictatorship or not. Soft power.</p>

<p>Both the US and UK had renewed full on relations with Libya in recent years. Tony Blair and Berlusconi were very receptive to Libya, not so long ago. France also had alot of deals going on. The Scottish government released the Lockerbie bomber on compassionate grounds. BP got a nice billion worth of contracts around the same time for offshore exploration. Russia even got in on it and (I think) sold some weapons.</p>

<p>Somewhere down the line, Gaddafi and/or his government have either become less malleable (again) or the limit for what was able to be gotten out of them has been reached. So the political and economic screw gets turned. See the recent-ish sanctions. If this gets nowhere they turn it on even more. The economic jackals get sent in, sometimes including the IMF and world bank, the media is used and all the non military options are on the table. If this still does not work then it&#39;s just a matter of waiting for the right time to get in there (e.g armed rebellion or mass protests), or if unpatient and those aren&#39;t in sight, then you go full blown war. See Iraq for the latest example in this model. I highly recommend &quot;Confessions of an Economic Hit Man&quot; and &quot;The shock doctrine&quot; for much more in depth insight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THE continuationo f authority in a single individual has frequently been the downfall of democratic governments. Repeated elections are essential in popular systems, because nothing is more dangerous than allowing the same citizen to remain in power over a long period of time. The people become accustomed to obeying him, and he becomes accustomed to commanding them; this is how power is usurped and tyranny takes root. The freedom of the Republic must be jealously safeguarded, and our citizens should justly fear that the same magistrate who has governed them for many years might come to rule them for ever....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh... because the people &#39;become accustomed to obeying him&#39; does not make him a bad guy.  I mean, if he&#39;s a good leader, his extended amount of time being a good leader does not automatically make him a bad leader.</p>

<p>Now, I can see this argument having validity over the course of generations where... say a good leader passes on leadership to his son who is an &#39;okay&#39; leader, who passes it on to a so-so son, who passes it on to a bad leader - each growing up and being more progressively used to the &quot;rights and privileges&quot; they get from leadership and less concerned about their responsibilities to the people - and by that time the people have gotten used to the &quot;ruling&quot; family and suffer under the rule of &#39;tyrants&#39; because it&#39;s been done that way for a long time.  But the amount of time in and of itself of a single person in power  - though it can be a factor down the line if he begins to set up such a system - does not necessarily change him from a good guy to a bad guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh yeah after thinking about it overnight, I can see where someone who, as he gets older, clings to power itself at all cost regardless of what&#39;s good for the people can turn a good leader into a bad.  I still don&#39;t see that time-spent-in-leadership alone should be the deciding factor in whether someone a good or bad guy/leader.  But yeah I can see where it can happen with an individual.  I wouldn&#39;t judge a longstanding ruler on that basis <em>unless</em> there&#39;s evidence of that occurring, though.</p>

There are other numerous murky business links between Tripoli and Paris out there. I was going to add it in my post, but there isn&#39;t enough solid info to draw lines from, even though it could further explain the extensive involvement of the French. Worth considering though.

<blockquote>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Britain was committed to “exchanges of information and views on defense structures, military and security organizations; <strong>exchanges of visits by experts</strong> and exchange of printed materials in the field of military education and science;</p>

<p>I think its clear just what kind of experts Blair sent in the exchange.</p>

<p>Then this article in 2009 <a href="http://www.neurope.eu/articles/92240.php">Will Gaddafi pull a Chavez in the oil industry? </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the last couple of years (2007-2009), the Libyan leader has held landmark meetings with Nicolas Sarkozy, Gordon Brown, Silvio Berlusconi, Condoleezza Rice and Vladimir Putin all of whom vowed to strengthen cooperation with Tripoli in several projects, and especially in oil and gas development.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how people see Iraq and Libya as different.  Let&#39;s see how they match up:</p>

<p>&quot;The attack on Iraq was not justified because we attacked Iraq for their oil!&quot;</p>

<p>We actually get almost no oil from Iraq.  We get a similarly small amount from Libya, yet... no one&#39;s saying this is for oil, as well?</p>

<p>&quot;The attack on Libya is justified because Gaddafi&#39;s a dictator committing a genocide against his own people!&quot;</p>

<p>And Saddam didn&#39;t? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halabja_poison_gas_attack</a> - sure seems like he committed a far, FAR worse crime than anything anyone is claiming Gaddafi has done.</p>

<p>&quot;The attack on Libya is justified because the UN has OK&#39;ed it!&quot;</p>

<p>1) Who cares what a bunch of national sovereignty-stealing crooks say?
2) The UN was sold to us as a way to <em>prevent</em> wars.  Now we&#39;re starting wars because they say so?
3) Part of the justification of the Iraq war has been that Iraq violated UN resolutions.</p>

<p>They&#39;re both wrong.  A couple of my friends are Middle Easterners.  They don&#39;t like Gaddafi, but they&#39;re still against our involvement.  Even the protesters have put up banners telling the western governments to stay out of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve known about Libya for my whole life. Like I said else where, my father grew up there. No I did not only start paying attention recently. All I am doing is providing discussion about how the media is shaping what is going on there. MOST people will know nothing about it and accept all of the facts the TV tells them about the place. I&#39;m pointing out that these &quot;facts&quot; may not be accurate, and hypothesizing as to why. There has been little footage of <em>mass</em> protests, not when you compare it to Egypt or Tunisia. </p>

<p>Can I please have a source for &quot;they have came out multiple times in peaceful protests only to be mowed down&quot;? Cheers. Oh and no media allowed? lol. There isn&#39;t a hotel room to be had in Benghazi, because of all the media.</p>

<p>There are a TON of videos of people getting killed. im talking about from peacefully protesting not the ones out fighting now.  </p>

<p>OMG benghazi has media NOW. there wasnt any media for over a week in libya, and that is the time period that the rumors of the bombing came from.  gaddafi IS shelling the people: (example: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfydO-Z-D0M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfydO-Z-D0M</a>, a lot more videos with this if you feel its not sufficient)</p>

<p>YES rumors were abound in the beginning, but are you going to deny the massacres that have been going on in the country?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watched this story unfold from the beginning, you would see that it did start out somewhat in that fasion. Peaceful protestors were protesting untill they were so many, that Gaddafi started mandating curfues and using force to try to get rid of the protestors. Gaddafi made the first move to use force against them, and as such we are now at our present state of the situation. </p>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate that you&#39;re on this side of the argument, because with a (LOT MORE) research you&#39;de be able to find answers that go against your current theory and point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the protestors got heavily armed literally over night? As soon as Gadaffi&#39;s forces started firing, they got hold of the arsenal they now have? No, some of the factions (tribal, Islamic) have been armed prior to this, and they have been active in Libya long before the TV started talking about it. I suggest you do a LOT MORE research.

    <div class="md"><p>You make some interesting points, and I will be sure to look further into this. But, you are aware that a no-fly zone resolution means <em>only</em> that Libya cannot use their planes, right? There is no actual deployment by any country to Libya, nor is any country supporting either side. The fear that Libya might attack civilians from the air is a quite legitimate one.</p>

<p>Quite simply, if no Libyan plane leaves the ground then all external involvement in Libya ends. As in <em>all</em> external involvement in it&#39;s <em>totality</em> will cease. This isn&#39;t a war or an invasion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Umm, what? I&#39;m a bit confused by what you&#39;re saying here. There have been airstrikes on many government/army installations and land weapons. As for the fear that Libya might attack it&#39;s civilians from the air, I haven&#39;t seen any concrete proof that it has happened...before or after the NFZ. Was any proof given that Libya had planes in the sky once France and UK started bombing? I didn&#39;t see any, they just went in and took out military installments regardless of whether there were any Libyan planes in the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw it on CNN not more than an hour ago.  First, the US denies they used any missile at all on his compound, then some reporters found a few missile parts with English words on them (like, &quot;motor assembly part #3&quot; or some such).  The military then says, &quot;OOOOOooohhh, you mean THOSE missiles.  Yeah, that was, um, knocking out some &#39;command and control&#39; infrastructure that just, er, happened to also be in his house.  It&#39;s a coincidence, we weren&#39;t targeting him at all.&quot;  Sorry, no links, I&#39;m just getting this from the tee vee.</p>

<p>Edit: top article on CNN at the moment: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/21/libya.civil.war/index.html?hpt=T1&amp;amp;iref=BN1">http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/21/libya.civil.war/index.html?hpt=T1&amp;amp;iref=BN1</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A coalition military official insisted neither Gadhafi nor his residence were intended targets of the bombing late Sunday. But the official -- who was not being identified because of the sensitivity of the information -- said the compound was targeted because it contained capabilities to exercise command and control over Libyan forces.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aaaah, yes, makes perfect sense.  We&#39;re not going after Gadhafi, we&#39;re just targeting, you know, the surrounding 100 foot area that he&#39;s standing in.  Screw that area.</p>

The Arab league knew that and it is still unclear that they are officially critical of the attacks. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12803222">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12803222</a> </p>

<p>And to this whole the Libyan civilian bombing hasn&#39;t been documented argument. Why were there defectors that flew Migs to Malta and say they were ordered to bomb and shoot protesters. Just because you can&#39;t find a you-tube video showing a plane actively bombing people doesn&#39;t mean it never happened.        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disobey the UN resolution that enforces a no-fly zone over Libya. Whether or not you think there should be such a resolution, there is, therefor Libya can either obey or disobey. You may think that Libya is right to disobey, but still there <em>is</em> something to disobey.</p>

<p>I personally believe that the UN Resolution seeks to impose the sovereignty of the people, as opposed to the sovereignty of the government. It has become immensely obvious that they people of Libya would like a new government. At what point did we decide that the sovereignty of a government was more important than the will of the people that government are supposed to serve?</p>

<p>Edit: If it is your belief that it isn&#39;t the will of the people, I would be more than willing to listen to why - I am simply saying this is the way it appears to me from initial impressions and an admittedly limited knowledge on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>here&#39;s my point. the libyan people aren&#39;t a monolithic anit-gaddafi bloc. there are plenty of people (mostly in the west) that still support the old bastard. you might not have seen it on our media, but there&#39;s been pro-gaddafi gatherings as well. in terms of sovereignty, the state has the sovereignty over a given land area unless it is shown to have grossly abused that power.</p>

<p>now, what we have in libya isn&#39;t just a one way street. it&#39;s a civil war. as i see it, the libyan people are fighting amongst themselves to determine who has (or hasn&#39;t) the sovereign right to rule the area that compromises the libyan state. since this conflict isn&#39;t pouring into other states (thereby infringing on their sovereignty) and there isn&#39;t evidence of human rights abuses in this conflict, i&#39;d say that the state still has sovereignty. do i hope the rebels win? sure. but i think that they should win by themselves. </p>

<p>also, here&#39;s an example of why i think the UN involvement is wrong. let&#39;s take our civil war. let&#39;s imagine we start fighting in 1861 and a few weeks into the war, great britain says &quot;well fuck india, if the US is in a war, let&#39;s go see if we can&#39;t get on the confederates&#39; side and maybe get a piece of that big resource pie over there!&quot; so they start sending ships and they&#39;re just bombing the fuck outta washington, ny and boston, severely hampering the Union&#39;s effort to defend itself as a sovereign state. do you support that hypothetical international interference?</p>

<p>there needs to be concrete proof of this. dots don&#39;t do the trick</p>

<p>and you can&#39;t just revoke sovereignty. it&#39;s like guilt in an american court, just b/c someone is accused doesn&#39;t mean that person is guilty. it&#39;s b/c of his incumbency and his armed forces (he&#39;s on equal footing to obama and the US armed forces in the eyes of the UN) that his gov&#39;t has sovereignty. and if defying UN resolutions was all that was needed for a revocation of sovereignty, there&#39;d be quite a few states all around the globe that wouldn&#39;t have the right to rule the land that they control. </p>

<p>and i agree that the majority don&#39;t want gaddafi to rule the country, that&#39;s why there&#39;s a civil war. and if the majority not wanting a leader in power serves as impetus for UN action, where were france and the uk after the 2000 elections in the US?</p>

<p>You&#39;re not serious are you? You can&#39;t seriously think that people changing their minds about a democratically elected leader is the same as a leader who forced his way into power and refuses to leave slaughtering all opposition in order to maintain power.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t agree with the UN Resolution, that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t base your dissent on some false notion that Gaddafi isn&#39;t a violent fascist or that he has any place ruling Libya besides the fact that he is <em>already</em> ruling Libya and has enough military force to oppress his people. </p>

<p>The revocation of sovereignty is not based on disobeying a UN Resolution, but rather the UN Resolution is based on a perceived end of Gaddafi&#39;s sovereignty over Libya. Libya&#39;s sovereignty is not at stake here; Gaddafi&#39;s is. Gaddafi is the only thing keeping Libya from being sovereign.</p>

<p>When did libya lose sovereignty? when gaddafi had the coup 40 yrs ago? when factions w/in his country decided to try and oust him? if we didn&#39;t like gaddafi so much, why did we try to bring him into the fold of &#39;normal&#39; UN countries so recently? if it&#39;s all about being an asshole, why didn&#39;t we bomb him after lockerbie and all the other shit he&#39;s pulled?</p>

<p>a country&#39;s sovereignty isn&#39;t dependent on what form of gov&#39;t it happens to possess. revoking a state&#39;s sovereignty is serious business so i suggest that you read the UN charter before you continue, it&#39;d be helpful.</p>

<p>another related point - if the UN was so against gaddafi, why were they patting him on the back for the past half decade? if you think this is just about gaddafi, think again man. it&#39;s not about him &#39;nearing benghazi&#39; it&#39;s about the oil under benghazi and the rest of eastern libya. </p>

<p>My point was that the sovereignty of a countries people trumps the sovereignty of a countries government.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re probably right about the motives of the involved countries, but motives alone don&#39;t invalidate actions. So long as what they are doing falls in line with what should be done I could care a lot less <em>why</em> they are doing it.</p>
