       Agreed. I upvoted this thread, because it's a worthwhile sentiment and a good call to action, but... people also are by and large truly ignorant of what's really going on. We need a way to reach everyone and convert them instantly. Also: Magic beans {sigh}

       Well, we write these theories in other subreddits as well. We just end up with -30 karma on the post we make. They don't like critical thinking, they want to circlejerk.

       And they marginalize us by characterizing "conspiracy theorists" as crazy or dangerous. So we only discuss it amongst ourselves or risk social reprisal.

       So don't just sit on your ass then, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       (this isn't really directed at you per say, it's just something I've wanted to get off my chest for awhile and this seemed to fit the bill).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a 5-point plan, but at the very least you can try to apply this information. Choose a different career path. Make different investments. Move to a different place. Use less debt - hell, just ADAPT. Sitting on your ass isn't the only option.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is if all of this "conspiracy" information is so true and valid, shouldn't having that understanding benefit you in some way? It should. Sitting on your ass isn't the only option.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how I see it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hi (person) - The world doesn't work like this (media's explanation). The world runs like THIS (conspiracy explanation).  OMG OMG Here's a video I got off the internets. Let's TEAR DOWN THE STATE, FIGHT EVIL AND START A REVOLT!!!
       </p>
       <p>
        (proceeds to sit on ass).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       OR
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Since I have a better understanding of the world, I've been able to do X,Y and Z, and improve my life in some way. Oh, you're asking HOW i was able to? Oh well, you see, I look at things differently... blahblablahb....
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem is most people have idealogical expectations. They think they are to be the torchbearer of this knowledge and that we are all supposed to spread and share it to save the human race from whatever it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start saving yourself first. Then you can move onto bigger and better things. Rather than becoming a 'conspiracy buff' gorging on the table scraps, try to use some of it. Somehow. Brainstorm and DO something. For yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or you can just sit on your ass and mindlessly click on link after link. All the while expecting the world to change while your ass hurts, your wrist is sore, your eyes are glazed and your spirit's crushed.

       I think the idea of a conspiracy theory is a conspiracy theory in order to discredit certain ideas or observations.

       I have to agree. When someone scrutinizes something which they have been told as being true, but has doubt because of potential evidence to the counter, they are thought of as conspiracy theorists. We have to continue to question what we are told; otherwise we will remain ignorant and easily fooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is power and those in power wish many to not know the truth.

       For me, reading about these things, is just being informed. Like watching a house fire, then you evaluate how FoxNews, MSNBC, CNN, AlJazeera, WP and WSJ spin the event.

       Information. Knowing a few more angles to a situation. So next time someone comes to sell me magic snake oil, tell me purple people are evil and the root of al problems, ask for my or loved ones' blood to go spill in the dirt across the globe, or someone warrant me in writing that this time he won't come in my mouth, I
