       I don't condone any murder at all no matter where it comes from yet I'm asking why so many people refer to the land as Palestine when a Roman emperor came up with that in the second century? Prior to that the land was called many names but for thousands of years it was called Judea or Judaea.

       Thank you and I'm sorry I'm dumb and ask dumb questions. What you just wrote seems to imply people should call it Israel since that's modern name. I'm just saying according to how my brain reads what you wrote. I don't know and I'm sorry for my ignorance and hope i did not offend. Thank you for your thoughts my friend.

       Asking question is never dumb, not knowing something doesn't imply stupidity, it just mean you don't know, there's shitload of things i don't know but that doesn't mean i'm an idiot and neither are you.

       It's not dumb. I just wanted to deliver the simplest answer possible due to the politicization of the area and the potential for miscommunication and argument.

       Like, look below. They're already arguing about which side killed more people. Seriously, you could write a post about Hostess Cupcakes in this subreddit and the thread will devolve into racist or ADL name-calling.

       today i don't believe in white people or black just people. i also think those you talk about called white have been lied to and fooled most for long time and that the sort of avarice, greed and lusts many did when they came to this country is exemplified in all races of man at some point depending on circumstance. what i mean to say is that the sort of disgusting evil done by men can be of any race just as there were some men called white that rejected the evil and lived with the native americans and suffered and fought with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Always those men who choose good over evil seem too few and those who choose greed and avarice outnumber the men who choose good. This is why i think it so important today to not believe the lie of racial or ethnic or religious division but see now in this day where technology that it's most important to know love, and all people are human beings, and come together no longer willing to drop bombs or war but know we are one and work for love.

       Sorry, i am dumb, and dream, but am very sad today because of wars happening which i will not do.

       Not "thousands of years"! It was actually called Judea for only about 500 years and it was only half of what is today Occupied Palestine. The land of the
       <em>
        Philistines
       </em>
       and Samaria were other parts. It has been called Palestine since about
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine">
        450BCE
       </a>
       . that's 2450 years. Before it became Judea it was called Canaan (Retenu by the Egyptians). The earliest reference to the name Canaan was from the archive of Tell Mardikh c.2350 BCE.

       I'm sorry for my ignorance my friend. Thank you for your reply. There seem to be some conflicting thoughts about dates and areas but probably just me not understanding. I'm sorry I'm not too bright actually and I'm sorry for asking dumb question. Two other replies brought up the obvious connection between the words, not sure how I managed to not see the obviousness of the connection. Sorry, my friend. Thank you again for your reply.

       Thank you and I'm sorry I'm dumb and ask dumb questions. What you just wrote seems to imply people should call it Israel since that's modern name. I'm just saying according to how my brain reads what you wrote. I don't know and I'm sorry for my ignorance and hope i did not offend. Thank you for your thoughts my friend.
