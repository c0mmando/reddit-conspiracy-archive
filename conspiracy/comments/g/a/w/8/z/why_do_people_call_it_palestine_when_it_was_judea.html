    <div class="md"><p>today i don&#39;t believe in white people or black just people. i also think those you talk about called white have been lied to and fooled most for long time and that the sort of avarice, greed and lusts many did when they came to this country is exemplified in all races of man at some point depending on circumstance. what i mean to say is that the sort of disgusting evil done by men can be of any race just as there were some men called white that rejected the evil and lived with the native americans and suffered and fought with them. </p>

<p>Always those men who choose good over evil seem too few and those who choose greed and avarice outnumber the men who choose good. This is why i think it so important today to not believe the lie of racial or ethnic or religious division but see now in this day where technology that it&#39;s most important to know love, and all people are human beings, and come together no longer willing to drop bombs or war but know we are one and work for love.</p>

<p>Sorry, i am dumb, and dream, but am very sad today because of wars happening which i will not do. </p>

<p>Thank you very much for your reply my friend. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not &quot;thousands of years&quot;! It was actually called Judea for only about 500 years and it was only half of what is today Occupied Palestine. The land of the <em>Philistines</em> and Samaria were other parts. It has been called Palestine since about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine">450BCE</a>. that&#39;s 2450 years. Before it became Judea it was called Canaan (Retenu by the Egyptians). The earliest reference to the name Canaan was from the archive of Tell Mardikh c.2350 BCE.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Originally, the land was part of three areas called Philista, Canaan, Moab, and Amor. Later the Israelites moved into the land; it then became Israel, Philistia, Moab, and Phoenicia, and Judah (which became a separate kingdom from Israel later). Then the Roman Empire conquered the lands, and the area became <strong>provinces of Rome known as Idumea, Judea, Perea, Decapolis, Samaria, Galilee, Trachonitis, Iturea, and Phoenicia (all together known as Palestine).</strong> Then later the Roman Empire fell, and the area became part of the Ottoman Empire, and was still known as Palestine until about 1914. Later, when the Ottoman Empire fell to the Allies, it was split from the other lands of the Ottoman Empire, and was still known as Palestine (1914-1922) this was done by the Balfour Declaration. Later, violating the Balfour Declaration, the land was split into two areas one called Palestine, and one called Transjordan, and again the Balfour Declaration was violated when the British Mandate gave the Golan Heights to the French Mandate;</p>
