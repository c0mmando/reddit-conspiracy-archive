       You can spout out anti-war rhetoric all you want, but most people that speak that way without understanding that 9/11 was a hoax to trick people into war will still be easily manipulable and generally close minded about many of the most important issues we are facing. (Obama supporters are good examples of this)
      </p>
      <p>
       Two of the main reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nr. 1 - It is so thoroughly researched and every bit of the official story has been shred to pieces. The culprits made far too many mistakes that day and anyone who wants to know, can and should. There are now hundreds of documentaries out there and to my knowledge only two of them support the official story. (BBC and History Channel) It is so glaringly obvious it´s a lie that anyone who is incapable of seeing it is clearly under hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nr. 2 - It doesn´t matter if you´re a democrat or republican, knowing this will make you want REAL change. It exposes the scale of what authorities are morally and physically capable and willing to do to advance their goals. Once this is realized a natural gravitation towards understanding the complete picture of how this could happen will follow. The result usually being a demand to end the fed, stop the wars and reclaim our freedom.

       I think it's important to communicate to people carefully about 9/11. People shut the gates when you're talking about sensitive subjects, so you have to tread carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the topic ever comes up, do NOT go hell for leather into why it was a lie. See if you can prompt the discussion towards what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       know about what happened that day. The tiny amount they actually know about it tends to be a little eye opening.
      </p>
      <p>
       "What do you know about what happened that day?" is a fair question that people often struggle to coherently answer. Let them answer it, and if any inconsistencies in their story come up, calmly and kindly correct them and show them the sources for what really happened.

       "calmly and kindly"?  Sorry, that's just not going to happen.  9/11 was intentionally loaded with reason-canceling emotion and patriotism.  You're not going to cut through that easily.  People will only learn by educating themselves and that will only happen in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, the amount of time required is at least one generation.  People who were not shocked and awed by 9/11 were most likely not alive when it happened.  These will be more likely to see the truth because they were never force-fed the lie.

       9/11 is probably as good as anything else. Financial scandal, fracking natural gas at the cost of drinking water, Deep Horizon BP oil spill, you can pick what you like and see that they are fucking us over. Warentless wiretaps, no habeus corpus, the list is endless. Some people believe in the government, others are afraid, others think that they do not have the resources to fight back. The most important thing is communication.

       All the evidence you have cobbled together about 911 is essentially useless. You want to argue about aerodynamics, thermite and politics, but you forget that almost half of Americans have utterly rejected science in favour of the more comfortable Creationism, which panders to their egos and ignorance. Americans are increasingly rejecting science for Jewish magic, and facts won't sway them. 
   The 911 movement needs more than a bunch of home-made movies on the internet narrated by 14 year olds. 
  It needs a confession. An insider confessing that he was involved. That is the only thing that will sway the great masses.

       I reject the nonsense notion that life is an accident of physics.  There is no model of physics that predicts or explains life, consciousness or intelligence.  Physics is, therefore, only half of the picture and "science" can only tell half the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right about swaying the masses on 9/11, though.  It can only be done by the people who told the lie in the first place and there's no way they're going to do that.

       The evidence for the other half of the story is the lack of answerability to questions left on the table after review by science.  Sure, you've been promised answers but it's been a long time.  You can wait the rest of your life but there some things that science is not prepared to deal with at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the story that "people invented God to explain things that they didn't understand" doesn't hold water when you compare it to some of the things that are found in the Bible.  For instance, your science gods have sworn up and down that there never was a global flood but
       <strong>
        every ancient culture
       </strong>
       says that there was.  How did these "simple" people ever even acquire a concept of an "extinction event" if they just "fell out of the trees"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible raises lots more questions that are easily
       <em>
        explained-away
       </em>
       but not easily
       <em>
        explained
       </em>
       without invoking some higher power...and no, I'm not talking about "miracles".

       The problem I see with this is the overwhelming amount of information available on the "Truth about 9/11".
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong.  I'm with you on this and I agree with what you're saying about how you can differentiate between people in the know and people in the box, and how it is so ridiculously obvious at this point that 9/11 was not a terrorist attack...but...
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of conspiracies surrounding 9/11 are overwhelming.  Anyone who Google's it could find anything from UFO's to Government conspiracies to anything else.  I can't remember what the method was called when you flood the Internet with so much contradicting information in order to create confusion instead of giving people a chance to discover the truth...but I think that was used heavily on 9/11 (whether by the government or just a bunch of paranoid people who have websites...I don't know).
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people suspect it was a set up, but very few have actually done research past viewing a YouTube video or two, and even then a lot of them are hesitant to suspect their own government as the culprit.  It's near impossible to make people motivated enough for change because right now their lives are comfortable.  They're in a nice, clean bubble/box (except for all that shit in the food, air, water, ink, etc.) and they don't want to get out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it really hard to word things gently enough to guide people towards the understanding that there is a very real possibility of massive manipulation going on.  If only there was a way to point at someone and install knowledge into their mind...

       Well, that makes sense...but there was a specific term for the method.  I heard it years ago...and it is now lost in the abyss of my mind.

       I think we can move forward with "CIA disinformation tactics".  That's very fitting.

        The amount of conspiracies surrounding 9/11 are overwhelming. Anyone who Google's it could find anything from UFO's to Government conspiracies to anything else. I can't remember what the method was called when you flood the Internet with so much contradicting information in order to create confusion instead of giving people a chance to discover the truth...but I think that was used heavily on 9/11 (whether by the government or just a bunch of paranoid people who have websites...I don't know).

       I think I'd give that honor to the John Perkins model of privateering. The reason for that is much like what he says, the Latin, and Arab, and Indian, and Asian people are at a turning point in terms of their acceptance or rejection of this western-style economic domination. Mobilizing those broken lives seems key to any sort of resistance, and those people may or may not care about 9/11. 9/11 is a very ethnocentric topic, while these asshole warmongers and powertrippers are certainly affecting people worldwide.

       9/11 was an event that meant different things to different people. Many have woken up in
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       ways,
       <em>
        since
       </em>
       the attack, but still lack the resolve to assess whether our system is indeed
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       corrupt it would stage an event of that nature, regardless of how likely some of us understand it to be. What this means is that qualifying people by their beliefs about the illegitimacy of the official 9/11 narrative necessitates we
       <em>
        disqualify
       </em>
       all but those who believe the system is
       <em>
        profoundly
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       corrupt, which is very selective and serves to marginalize us
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the people, common as they are, who come to discover things more slowly.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we are going to unite, I agree it should definitely be in favor of something black and white; otherwise the distinction is meaningless. However, it must also be something general, in order that, for one, it does not discourage participation from outsiders, and two, it does not hinge on our personal, individual interpretations, which are selective and only serve to divide. For this reason, I would propose we unite under the plain understanding that the system itself is crooked, no longer warrants our support, and must be replaced, no
       <em>
        matter
       </em>
       our specific reasons for coming to form this belief. This is the most relevant issue that will distinguish us from our counterparts through our beliefs and our actions. Worry about the details later. Knowing details is a luxury.

       I used to think that 9/11 was the smoking gun as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truthfully, I believe that this is too large a scale of an event for people to open their mind to.  (Yes, non sheeple like us would see this event as the perfect subject to awaken people, yet sadly it is just too grand for them to break out of their slumber.)

       Start with the smaller conspiracies that are known to have been proven true.  The American involvment with Hitler, the Gulf of Tonkin, USS Liberty...things like this.

       9/11 really freaked me out.  I didn't jump in bed with the truthers though.  Like, I'm not sure if it was because I was younger or just because I was the typical American, but I didn't really care what our gov't was doing before 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now assuming the official story is legit (which its probably not), at the very least 9/11 opened my eyes to our foreign policy for the last half century or so.  I wanted to know what would drive people to the point where getting on a plane and turning it into a guided missile sounded like a good idea.  Turned out, we did a ton of shit over the course of a long time to piss alot of people off.  And because we didn't hold our gov't accountable, we were being held accountable ourselves.  For the things our gov't did overseas, propping up this regime or destroying that one, dropping bombs here or there, etc. we were being punished for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then somewhere along the line I think I heard MK-Ultra by Immortal Tech and I didn't know why he kept repeating that word so I googled it.  Holy shit.  Started listening to Alex Jones and stuff, Northwoods and CoIntelPro blew my mind.  That basically told me that shady shit was being against Americans too, it wasn't just against sand people.  From there, lots of Googling and reading on Wikipedia led me here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have trouble picking a side on the 9/11 issue.  Both sides bring up good points, so I tend to give the lone cavedweller theory as much credit as the inside job theory.  I think if you pick a side on this, no matter which one, you're making a leap of faith.  On one hand you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that the gov't wouldn't do anything as bad as this to us, which I don't think is accurate... or you
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       that they 100% had a hand in it, which I'm unsure of also.  All it really boils down to is which 3rd party you're willing to believe, some people will side with 'official' sources, and other people will side with 'alternative' sources... and I think the only thing I can honestly say to myself is that I don't know what happened on 9/11 but both theories sound pretty possible, and that in itself is pretty scary (I lean towards the alternative side).  No matter which side is right though, a ton of shit has to change because we're gettin fucked one way or the other.

       The entire field of 9/11 conspiracy theories is so convoluted and extreme and in many cases totally absurd, that any chance of finding the truth has long since passed. There are too many nut jobs, muddying the waters.

       Understood.  That's why I said "truth mixed with lies".  There is a theory for everything and, unfortunately, your choices are to either listen to them all or tune them all out.  I think the former is the better option because there are things that are too important to risk not knowing because you're trying to filter out the nonsense.

       That is a first, actually. The first time I - and many people, I would imagine - have seen anyone dumb enough to try on that the physical impact of the tiny, flimsy planes
       <strong>
        themselves

       were (this is what you are saying, not me) responsible for the buildings' collapses, even WTC7 of course (you have heard of that ?). Well, there is always room at the bottom. Those telling you fools what to think probably even considered suggesting your supremely stupid idea and discarded  it because it was too ridiculous. Maybe. Maybe they didn't even think of it.

       As usual, common sense remains where it belongs, as a subset of what is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your likening of the flimsy planes to a ".44 magnum" and the (asbestos plastered) steel mesh of the towers to the softness of a "head" is about the level that you  menInCavesWithBoxCuttersLetsRoll patriots generally come in at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your saying that your, or any, silly story is true because a significant time later the vast majority of engineers and architects have not joined AE911 is your own personal demonstration of why only the anti-intelligence, pro-stupidity dregs mouth, and some believe, the MSM's comical 911 sitcom.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, the eternal request to propaganda worshipers (fuck firemen, 2,700 killed and half the nation being shown to be idiots, worship propaganda !) : can you anything to add to our knowledge of what happened that day ? Anything.  You fools never have anything, it seems. [well, you fools have said a few insightful things - 'it was not a normal demolition' for example, but three or four over effectively ten years]. Come on !  You can do better.

       What I do know?  3 Israeli art students were seen taking pictures, high-fiving and laughing as the towers fell.

       EXPLODE THE BOMBS.

       Holy shit, who the fuck are you truther nuts? Do you really care about the state of the world and the people in it or do you just like a good story?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is not one shred of evidence that 9/11 was anything but the official story, yet you persist with your delusions. Why? What's the point? How does it make life better for anyone? Do you care?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are real ways to make a difference in this world and uncovering the "truth" about 9/11 isn't one of them. So why do you persist?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       , well-documented, influential conspiracies (influential in the sense that almost
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       man, woman and child in the world is affected) that happen all the time. That are happening now. Goldman Sachs and the Fed is probably the biggest and most influential, yet you don't give a shit. Monsanto and the Federal Government is another. Blackwater and the military industrial complex is yet another.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no. Some shit heads who hijacked some planes and crashed them is all you knuckleheads give a fuck about. Is Monsanto not sexy enough for you?

       I will admit that the idea of a MIHOP controlled demolition scenario is a difficult sell  for some one that just doesn't believe secrets can be kept.
But if you are going to run around disparaging people who have broken out of a box created by the media. Media in the US is more complex and sophisticated than Pravda or China Daily but none the less controlled propaganda just the same.

       I agree with you about the media. But I find the evidence for an "inside job" type conspiracy regarding 9/11 lacking. So do most knowledgeable experts on matters of engineering and government.

       Sorry, but lack of evidence is not evidence. If lack of evidence were evidence, I might as well believe in stupid stuff like God too.
