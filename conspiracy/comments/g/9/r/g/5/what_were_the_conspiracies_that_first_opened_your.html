       When 9/11 happened I had just started my first year of college.  I had heard people at the time talk about a possible inside government conspiracy but I couldn't believe it was possible.  Over the next few years I slowly began investigating the 9/11 claims.  That led me to things like the Gulf of Tonkin and Operation Northwoods.  Once I realized the government had already used a lie to get us into one war I started looking for evidence of something similar in other wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out most of the wars of the last 100-200 years were created by banking and MIC cartels.

       and on that note... doesn't anyone think of Pearl Harbor and just be like, WTF was Japan thinking? I can't wrap my mind around anything that would be positive for Japan even if they were to take over Hawaii. Either way, we were bigger, stronger, and would have just plucked the Japanese off there anyway. Never made sense to me.

       There are a series of papers between FDR and one of his chief admirals of the Navy (9 of 10 pages released by the FOIA) that indicates both of the men knew of the imminent Japanese attack long in advance and even moved newer vessels out of the harbor.

       The US had ceased supplying Japan with oil. The Japanese were at war with China and was reaching south to try to insure oil and rubber supplies. The US did several actions blockign equiment that Japan felt was provocative. The Japanese felt if they could destroy the US Pacific fleet this would hamstring the Americans and they could consolodate their position. They were largely correct in this assessment and almost pulled it off. It was lucky US aircraft carriers were not in Pearl at the time... or it coudl have been a different war... until the development of the atomic bomb.

       Yes you're right, but TV and radio and most websites are free, so it's easier to grasp that "someone else" is paying all those people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had not realized at that time that the cost of the newspaper for the reader was insufficient to cover printing and distribution, much less the journalists and administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, print news had (and still has I guess) a better reputation for true journalism than TV or radio which offer mostly entertainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I remember it because it made perfect sense and changed the way I looked at many things after. "Follow the money" became a useful question to ask about just anything.

       Me too. The congressional hearings were televised. I was shocked by the way that Oliver North not only admitted his actions but proudly defended them. In fact he almost questioned the patriotism of his accusers. How did America respond? Republicans treated this as a partisan witch hunt. Basically no one was punished. And years later North was taken seriously as a candidate for Senator. Learning that this sort of thing can be done by factions within the government and go unpunished disturbed me terribly.

       The Gulf of Tonkin. I never really thought there was a good reason for Vietnam, and I offhandedly mentioned this to a professor my freshman year of college. He asked if I knew about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and though he didn't outright tell me it was a lie, suggested I do some research. I did, and ever since have not trusted a single fucking thing the government has said. Also, reading 1984 for the first time also had a big impact on me, but it really isn't a conspiracy so much as a primer for what the government can and will do to maintain control of its people.

       Having only tried LSD once (27 times), I'm certainly no authority on the substance. That having been said, however, there does seem to be a connection between the use of LSD and the opening of one's eyes to truth.

       It's a twist on an old LSD joke which usually goes like this:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Acid? Yeah, I tried that once . . . 27 times.
       </p>

       You can't discuss this with anyone because TV has trained us to foam at the mouth over the trigger word "Nazi". Yes Hitler was screwed up crazy christian psycho.  We fucking know.

       I was 13 in 2002 when a (drunk) US marine relayed some powerful information to me regarding those attacks. What he told me held true, and from then on I knew we were all blatantly lied to. I haven't had much trust in any government or organization since.

       I woke up December 12th, 2000 at the age of 15.  That was the day I realized the world as it was explained to me did not exist and something was terribly wrong.  For those that don't remember George Bush Jr. was awarded Florida's electoral college votes by the State's Supreme Court.  After I heard the announcement on CNN the charade cracked and fell away.  I have learned a lot over the years and I'm very grateful, but I will confess that I have thought about how my life would be different if I had not watch the election fiasco unfold numerous times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back story:
I began following the 2000 election very closely because I knew I would be old enough to vote in the next election.  I found politics very fascinating and was excited about getting to cast my vote for PoTUS for first time in 2004.

       I am glad that my original question made it to a main page somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me 9/11 was a kicker....but not everyone is as open minded as I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things I found strange enough to continue down the rabbit hole have been things like the Bush Sr. (and American for that matter) connection to Hitler; Columbine and Waco; American forknowledge of both 9/11 and Pearl Harbor....just to name a very, very few.

       Ultimately I can't even remember where I started, but after almost a decade I've come to the conclusion that our reality has more in common with a video game than not.  Everything is an illusion (from Law to the matter we touch, to time itself).  Everything happens with our consent, acquiescent or not. It's the experience that matters - failure is more important than success.  We have chosen this experience and will choose more, with the ultimate goal of solidifying ourselves for challenges greater than this.

       I'd like to add to the conversation by posing another question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were the American people always so skeptical of their government?  Was there ever a time when society didn't get fed a bunch of meaningless crap?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not being facetious here, I'm really trying to pinpoint where/when the American people started to realize that their Government was feeding them BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it has a lot to do with the rapid increase in available information, i.e. photojournalism and The Vietnam War.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it may also have a lot to do with The Cold War, which is around the time the CIA was going full steam ahead.  I can't really think of a time before these events where people started saying "The Fuck?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Would love to hear anyone's thoughts regarding this, especially OP mc_wombat.

       I never followed current events or politics until 2005. (I just started a desk job and Hurricane Katrina happened which made for some exciting news coverage).
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point after that I came across some Ron Paul videos and was introduced to the idea that the government isn't a group of nice people who are looking out for our best interests. (I was completely naive).
      </p>
      <p>
       I followed Ron's campaign very closely and I saw how the media ignored/slandered/marginalized him in favor of other candidates and I was introduced to the idea that the media isn't a group of nice people who are trying to report objective facts. From then on I have been able to see through the bullshit (for the most part) and I have been learning/re-learning a whole lot.

       Oh gosh, the very very first thing was probably the bermuda triangle. In a boys life magazine I got as a kid (I was a cub scout). It was about Gian Quasar and his book. Years later I viewed his website and bought the book, or asked for it for my birthday. It was interesting, but hard to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later, it was John Titor, which my brother introduced me to.

       The Truman Show instilled me with oodles of paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 9/11 videos on the internet pretty much shocked my entire system. Maybe a year or so after the event. I haven't been the same person since.

I had no sympathy for Zundel, no inclination to believe anything he wrote, and in fact I dismissed him as a nut case ... BUT, the abuse he suffered under the law, because of the manipulation of the law by Zionists out to silence him and make an example of him, caused me to begin the process of questioning the entire political and social structures within which I live. It was so obviously and flagrantly unfair, what was done to Zundel, yet nobody was protesting it, nobody was outraged by this abuse of justice, nobody was standing up.

       I owe some of my first conspiracies to Stumbleupon--&gt;Videos--&gt;Conspiracy!  I owe a lot of great discoveries to Stumble.  9/11 opened my eyes to the possibility of something rotten going on inside our government and our world.

       The first time I questioned what was going on was when I was in about 4th grade. I use to have this apprehensive fear of the Lunch Ladies in my elementary school.
They were so freaky wearing those thingys to keep their hair from falling into this weird glop of food they served on those plastic trays.

       I started realizing there was something more to this weird cult of subhumans.
