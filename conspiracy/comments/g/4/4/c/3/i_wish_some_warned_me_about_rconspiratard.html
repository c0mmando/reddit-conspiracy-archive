    <div class="md"><p>Actually people in the real world <em>do</em> clip coupons. You can save a ton of money with coupons. Why not do it? It&#39;s like free money. Check out <a href="http://www.hotcouponworld.com/forums/store-deals/">this</a> section of Hot Coupon World for store deals. You can also try to match stuff up on your own using the Coupon Database. There are numerous web sites out there that sell coupons, but I just use eBay. You usually wind up paying between one and two bucks for 20 or so coupons. This really isn&#39;t hard and you really can save a lot of money. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eFHwG.jpg">Here</a> is a screen shot of one of the receipts I scanned from the first week of January. I did a lot of orders that week and this was the best one, and someone in <a href="/r/frugal">/r/frugal</a> was talking about couponing so I scanned a good receipt. The coupons for the cereal in the deal I worked out were all different, which is why not all came down to 3 cents. I still messed it up. I thought the laundry detergent that required a $10 order was limit 4 but it was limit 4 PER VARIETY. I could have gotten 20 bottles of detergent on each order that week, but I only ordered enough coupons for 4.  :/ </p>

<p>Well it&#39;s a compelling anecdote is it not? I don&#39;t save all of my receipts but I had this one on file from when I did take a picture of it. You really could save a lot of money on this shit. I know yo&#39;ve spent some time in Baltimore in the apartment complex near the end of that freeway. Not every Supermarket is all that great but I know that Shoprite is a very good one and I know there are some Shoprite stores in Maryland. You should learn the Shoprite game. And while you&#39;re at it, start taking advantage of the CVS/Rite Aid/Walgreens deals! </p>

<p>Whats your hourly rate for being a mindless troll? I was able to get $200 worth of things for less than $3 that day. The shopping took and acquiring the coupons took less than a hour. Including driving time. That&#39;s better than usual, but people who do couponing intelligently can usually do pretty damn well. Modern technology really helps with this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really really miss NoLibs. How cute. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be back in a few weeks.  </p>

<p>You laugh but doing things like couponing can really add up. You see I went at 7AM on a Friday if you looked carefully at the receipt. The place was still close to empty but I wasn&#39;t the only guy at my store doing what I was doing that day. You seem to have this narrow-minded and condescending opinion about people who use coupons, but it&#39;s literally your loss. You should start taking advantage of opportunities when they are staring you in the face. And in the case of grocery stores you get this every Sunday morning. In my stores case I (and many others) get it mailed to me several days earlier so we can look at the deals and if there&#39;s some super deals order the coupons by Thursday night. </p>

<p>I know you can get a lot of stuff but some of the excess can be sold at yard sales. Not for full price of course but you can get some cash for your pocket. And some of the food can be donated if you go overboard with that. </p>

Furthermore, simply having a novelty account or two is not enough to get the ban hammer, but if the admins can see that those accounts are being used by one person to game the voting on reddit, that is likely to get accounts banned. If you want to go on spinning some yarn about Nolibs voluntarily deleting his account, <em>I don&#39;t care.</em> I know that the more likely story (the truth) is that all of those accounts were ID&#39;d as coming from the same IP address and banned by the administrators.

    <div class="md"><p>Not related to your topic but I was reading some of your posts...Someone needs to tell you-I guess I&#39;ll be the one-that you need to get a life.  I only needed to skim through about 10 of your posts...you really are like the biggest nerd on this whole site (which btw is made up of nothing but nerds).  I mean, all you do is complain about people that bitch you out for being a spiteful downer all the time, or offer advice on the most boring, menial chores, or offer fucking Minecraft strategies.  You only get one chance at this man, get a hobby that&#39;s actually fun.  Do something that forces you to be social.  Who knows?  You may meet some friends, hook up w a few chicks, and you might open your eyes and realize what you&#39;ve been missing out on all this time while you were nerding out in your room, getting all pissed off at people on some fucking message board while you bitch about &quot;sub-reddits.&quot;  Give me a break.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans hate Muslims because Muslims hate Americans. They fucking flew &gt;planes into our tallest buildings and killed thousands of us. It&#39;s unreal how there &gt;are politically correct pussies out there that downplay that fact and use the racism &gt;and profiling card whenever they come across someone speaking out and saying &gt;what they are too afraid or conservative to say</p>
