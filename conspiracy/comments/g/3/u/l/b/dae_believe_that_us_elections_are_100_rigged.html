    <div class="md"><p>First, there are a lot more than two parties in the US.</p>

<p>Second, in the last two elections in Sweden, it was de facto two parties:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Alliance_%28Sweden%29">Alliance for Sweden (Alliansen)</a> -- an alliance between four center-right parties.</li>
<li><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Red-Greens_%28Sweden%29">Red-Greens (De rödgröna)</a> -- an alliance between two left parties and a green party.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both alliances acted like parties, hold together like parties, and effectively was parties. Two parties. Like in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look at it that narrowly, yes, but the government doesn&#39;t work the same as in the US, and still, the issue is that the US makes/forces/scares people into voting for one of two parties, in Sweden people still vote for Kristdemokraterna, vänstern, folkpartiet, miljöpartiet, even if Alliansen might be the &quot;winner&quot; of an election. The other parties still have power and mandate by the people who voted for them, in the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes, in that way that people can &quot;fine tune&quot; the winning alliance, by voting for a specific party.</p>

<p>But on the other hand no, it&#39;s hard for the voters to change anything in the big picture that doesn&#39;t fit with either of the two alliances (even if one party in one of the alliances agrees). If it wasn&#39;t for the alliances, things like that would be a lot easier.</p>

<p>In the end, yes, there&#39;s a lot of differences between the US and Sweden regarding this matter, but there&#39;s a lot of similarities also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also american, btw. I just don&#39;t feel like living there atm. Compared to the state of the united states Sweden is a winter paradise for rich, poor, white, black, gay, disabled or the average Joe. Anyways, what I know of other political parties is mostly from reading wikipedia. Scaring everyone into voting for one of two (major) political parties could be the control davidlovessarah was talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are the race relations really in Sweden?  Not to say that you saying that its a winter paradise for all races, seems a bit of a exaggeration.  Its just hard for someone who grew up in a American where people try to bullshit you and say that there are no racial problems in this country, when there clearly are if you are a racial minority or just paid attention to what happens in this country.  I have always been curious about these paradises that are Sweden and Norway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course there are problems here. And not being a racial minority I don&#39;t have a first hand account of them. Also I am not rich so I can&#39;t tell you about that either. What I was referring to mainly is that there is a party for everyone here. And compared to United States, there is a heck of a lot more humanity and empathy towards citizens from the government. Everyone has food, shelter and health care. And the social and educational programs are there for anyone to use. No one is scaring you into voting for a certain party and standing for what you personally believe in isn&#39;t such a big deal. Sweden is secularized and has freedom of religion and no one is pushing you or making you feel bad for whatever choices you make. I&#39;m no expert on anything, this is my general feeling on this country. If you are curious, you should visit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t mean to imply it was growing, just that Sweden is probably like some other European countries (apparently, the Dutch are quite &quot;proud&quot; of being White, blond and Christian, for example). That was a 2008 blog post, by the way.</p>

<p>Caucus has an advantage over party in that someone can be a member of several caucuses, whereas under the European party system, if you are a member of a party, you are required by party discipline to vote the party line, whether you happen to agree with it or not.</p>

<p>Citation needed. Let me see here exit polls are basically people asking other people at polling stations how they voted, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shy_Tory_Factor">There is absolutely no legal requirement to be truthful in their stipulation hence the verbal contract allegory, and its been proven that Conservatives are less willing to be forthcoming in who they voted for</a>. And there are other examples such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect">this</a>.</p>

<p>I think that the only imagination being seen here is by someone attempting to fabricate conspiracy where none exists, and who obviously knows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution">nothing about statistical analysis</a> or how complex the process can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the citations I gave you: Polls have been wrong numerous times in the past and spectacularly so in the 1992 British general election. All polling is, is the collection of a small sample of data from the population which can be then be used to extrapolate what the result of the whole will be, via the usage of various probability modals. This methodology is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_regression">Statistical Regression</a>. Since the sample size will start out small then it is perfectly reasonable that there will be a normalization as more data comes in due to the increased size of your sample as well as issues such as participate willingness to be polled being exaggerated.</p>

<p>From the way you&#39;re talking you give the impression that you believe that pollster actually run their own separate ballot, which is simply not the case, what they actually do is more focus grouped based and then using the results derived from these tests to make predictions on what the whole will be. In short, polls are predictive and in no way representative of direct empirical data. To make an analogy: To attach substantive empirical weight to polling would be equivalent to, say, of doing climate modeling based on past weather forecasts rather than what the weather was actually like.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, There really is no point arguing with you because clearly you&#39;ve taken a dogmatic position, I.E., something is true merely because you believe it to be true, and unwilling to even consider any evidence that contradicts your position. As well as having (what seems to be) a limited grasp of the field.</p>

<p>Like the original poster said: This type of thing has already been analyzed to death by people who know what they&#39;re talking about, I.E., actual statisticians who have all &#39;em fancy degrees and stuff.</p>

<ol>
<li>Polls are representative sample data from a population.</li>
<li>Polls extrapolate results based on focus group samples (same thing).</li>
<li>The reason I&#39;m not arguing legitimately is because you wouldn&#39;t believe me anyway.</li>
<li>Experts have analyzed polls.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now let me analyze your methodology:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You replaced all &quot;exit polls&quot; with &quot;polls&quot;</strong> because that&#39;s an easier argument for you, even though the distinction between the two is the whole reason we&#39;re having this argument.</li>
<li>The first two paragraphs have no bearing on our argument, seeing how they&#39;re referring to polling in general.  <strong>Attempting to talk down to me with useless facts to make yourself look better</strong> is really pathetic.</li>
<li><strong>You accuse me of what you yourself are guilty</strong>, which is taking a dogmatic position without evidence to back it up.  Furthermore you are trying very hard to divert the conversation away from the main logical argument with logical fallacies and other distractions.  You have a limited grasp of the field.</li>
<li>The last paragraph shows me just how desperate you are.  What you said: &quot;Experts have analyzed the polls.&quot;  What you wanted your readers to infer: &quot;...and they agree with me.&quot;</li>

<p>Exit polls are polls, that is just another form of polling. There is no distinction, and if note the citation exit polls where just as incorrect in the 1992 general election as general polls, There is no straw man here. Saying that the choice of adjective some how makes it different is a nonsense</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you have no idea what your talking about and seem to merely assume that the process works the way you imagine when this is simply not the case. Or that is the impression you give, I&#39;m sorry if you find this patronising but the truth, what you call &#39;useless facts&#39;, is patronising.</p>

<p>I was paraphrasing the original post, the point is: if you&#39;re a statistician then you can compare the US election data with elections that we know are obviously rigged, such as the Iran election, then the difference is quite obvious. You saying that I&#39;m arguing that this &#39;infers that they agree with me&#39; is just your opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hypocrisy is an unconscious self-contradiction: a state of incongruence between one&#39;s professed beliefs and feelings and one&#39;s actual beliefs and feelings, or an application of a criticism to others that one does not apply to oneself. I have not done either of these things, All I have done is pointed out that that the argument you have presented is weak.</p>

<p>Your argument is that since exit polls are infallible then it does not follow that the results of an election would differ. This is incorrect because in the first instance exit polls have been wrong in the past many times, and, in the second instance, due to the way that the process works they are not empirical in nature at all - which I think you incorrectly assume I.E., you think they actually run a separate ballot - but are rather mere predictive devices. So both the premise is wrong and further your supposed conclusion does not follow from your premise, anyway, due to it being illogical comparison. Therefore it is an invalid argument.</p>

<p>To draw an analogy, what you are essentially arguing is that the weather is fixed because it doesn&#39;t reconcile with a weather report from three days ago - which is a very shaky position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you seem to be blind to your own failings I will tell you exactly what is wrong with your argument this time.</p>

<p>First paragraph: You defined &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and denied being guilty of it in unequivocal terms in order to feign confidence, even though you have no idea whether or not you are guilty of being a hypocrite because you&#39;ve barely deigned to entertain the idea out of fear of finding out the truth.  You also lied by saying all you&#39;ve done is point out that my argument is weak.  You&#39;ve done far worse than that.</p>

<p>Second &amp; third paragraphs: You exaggerated my argument with specific statements (&quot;exit polls are infallible&quot;, &quot;you think they actually run a separate ballot&quot;, &quot;what you are essentially arguing is...&quot;) and then proceeded to disprove those statements, thereby concluding that my original premise was wrong.  I completely agree with your most recent statements, and yet they in no way disprove my argument.</p>

<p>Exit polls are not infallible, but they&#39;re a heckuva lot more accurate than regular polls; accurate enough that discrepancies between exit polls and election results are enough to trigger election fraud investigations internationally (as in, by entire countries).  All you&#39;re doing is listing examples of discrepancies, i.e. possible election frauds, that haven&#39;t yet been investigated, including 2000, 2004, 2006 Senate, as proof.  That&#39;s not proof just because nobody&#39;s proved it was fraud.  That&#39;s like saying there must have been WMDs in Iraq after all because nobody&#39;s proved there weren&#39;t.</p>

<p>You have no argument to stand on.  I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m still replying, except out of a sliver of hope that the fact that you&#39;ve persisted this long must indicate that you&#39;re maybe <em>not</em> a troll.  Anyway, I&#39;m not in this argument to win it, and neither should you be.  If I ended up being wrong, and came away better informed, then this debate would have been a success.  I&#39;m hoping you will feel the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the one who accused me of hypocrisy and ironically the definition that I gave you is not mine but rather the one off Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocracy">here</a> - saying that I do this to &quot;feigh confidence&quot; is merely your opinion or a strawman that you are attempting to erect. Also, truth is a relative term with what you define as being true to be vastly different then myself - which I personally consider to be the more rational position - however, if you&#39;re willing to engage me in a debate over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">epistemology</a> then go ahead. </p>

<p>In my opinion, from reading the past comments, all I&#39;ve done is informed that your argument is weak - after all you presented one screen-shot, a definition of exit polling and some broad statements about how exit polls are never wrong, sorry but this just isn&#39;t good enough - and then attempted to inform you about how the process actually works simply because you seemed - from my own assessment - to be ill informed and have merely jumped in to a incorrect presumption E.G., like believing that a apple dropped from the mast of a ship in motion will land towards the stern, for the purpose of illustration. That you don&#39;t share this opinion - probably because it undermines your argument, somewhat - does not mean that I&#39;ve &quot;lied&quot;. However, what you just said is quite a revealing thing because it implies - I think, anyway - that you see yourself as the sole arbiter of truth; quite the ego, I must say. </p>

<p>That&#39;s because I haven&#39;t really presented an argument but merely pointed out how weak your one is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>yet they in no way disprove my argument. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you haven&#39;t really presented a logically consistent argument to disprove. Let me repeat myself.</p>

<p>Your argument is basically this:
Exit polls are never wrong; this is incorrect, (unless you believe all elections where they are wrong are rigged, I suppose - but then that would be a dogmatic position);
An election will reconcile with exit polls; Also incorrect - since the actual process doesn&#39;t even work that way with polling being more like a weather forecast than anything, else;
Since an election does not reconcile with exit polls it was a fraud - absolutely incorrect since, by even your own admission: absence of evidence isn&#39;t evidence of absence; Example: Have you considered the possibility that exit polls, themselves, could be fraudulent?
And like I said the <em>actual</em> empirical evidence that you have supplied, I.E., a screen shot, is pretty weak.</p>

<p>Also, people who rig votes are sure to know about Benford&#39;s law.</p>

<p>More interesting is Joe Leberman&#39;s opponent getting the same number of electronic votes in two elections, four years apart. That seems like a whistle blower rigging it so it&#39;s obvious.</p>

<p>When you have more votes than voters for a given district then THE ENTIRE ELECTIONS BOARD SHOULD BE THROWN OUT, and another round of elections performed at a later date once the new process has been tested and approved with a completely new board.</p>

<p>Currently, votes are counted until there are enough votes to declare a winner, then the rest, included absentee ballots, are thrown out.  This is the fraud, there are far more votes than voters in most districts.  </p>

<p>&quot;Vote early, vote often&#39; ...indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they stop tallying when they have enough for a decisive win, it is next to impossible to identify exactly how often this occurs, because it is the perpetrators job to blow the whistle...but it is frequently, especially in important elections or districts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they&#39;re rigged to a degree. People are influenced by the media, societal morals and values. If those influences are manipulated by an outside source in a way that they affect another person&#39;s own judgement on a belief (or political party for example) then votes can in a sense be controlled indirectly.</p>

<p>The idea of &#39;free will&#39; can of course be taken into account by the individual/group being affected, but when social norms and beliefs are accounted for in a person&#39;s judgement as to whether they should pick between A or B (for example) then it demonstrates a person&#39;s free will to choose either one they see fit. </p>

<p>Although this may be the case to an extent, societal/personal values and morals always seem to play a part in our decision making, and with the manipulation of these morals/values through various mediums it is possible to determine the statistical outcome of a vote.</p>

<p>It all seems pre planned to me.</p>

Then they get &quot;voted&quot; in, and go invade the next country (that was planned already during their last term, to go ahead after the Democrats had their go.)</p>

<p>Then after a couple of terms of war and sucking the cock of the arms/oil industry...</p>

<p>...The Democrats will get in and &quot;fix the country&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it even needs to be rigged.</p>

<p>I figure it&#39;s just a matter of large populations being easy enough to program that the results can be determined by a far less intensive degree of involvement than rigging votes. On top of that, political candidates likely only get to positions of democratic election in the first place by being very distinct <em>types</em> of people: specifically, types of people who can either be manipulated or depended on to act in very precise ways the agenda already knows it is able to exploit.</p>

<p>what this means is that by the time we see our candidates and vote on them, the game is already rigged twice over: once in the form of our choice of representatives, and again in the form of our manufactured preferences in our minds. Now, if the system <em>fails,</em> I&#39;m sure some votes can just be lost, magically, in states the system is already able to forecast ahead of time. But I doubt the system even fails.</p>

<p>you could say, oh, what about George W. Bush? Blah blah blah. No, no, you&#39;re missing the big picture. We wouldn&#39;t have seen any of that unless we were supposed to. They&#39;re trying to make us believe the system is corrupt, like it is, so we can willingly usher in the new one.</p>

A third party just divides the vote, and the least popular candidate is then elected. One could argue that any viable third party candidate is paid to run by the opposing point of view. Only in America, pre-selected millionaires who lie, cheat, and steal, and the least popular of the group is then elected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DAE remember the TIME magazine poll about who was the man of the year? If my memory serves, I believe Assange was the top and Zuckerberg was in 11th place or something. Yet it was Zuckerberg who TIME put on the cover. </p>

<p>I honestly think US elections (at least the presidential and representative ones are. Maybe not so for governors and mayors) are just like that. First, our votes don&#39;t actually matter but the representatives&#39; are the ones whose votes count. That&#39;s the official explanation. However, I think someone is going to &#39;win&#39; no matter what. There was actually no contest. They were just people who were put in front to give the illusion of choice. Like Whose Line Is It Anyway: the points don&#39;t matter. It alternates between Rep and Dem because if just one party was constantly elected, people might smell something fishy. </p>

<p>It does leave the question about the media. In the &#39;08 election the press covering Obama was a lot more positive than that of Hilary Clinton and John McCain. I remember seeing the newspaper section with two different magazines. One had Obama front and center talking about how much of a family man he was, with a smaller headline about Sarah Palin&#39;s daughter. The second one had McCain featured with something about his past corruption, with something Pro-Obama as a smaller feature. </p>

<p>Why do this if the votes don&#39;t count? Simple: to make people feel better. Even if most people vote for the other guy, hounding us with enough bad press, picking the worst possible other-guy candidates who don&#39;t even need stuff made up about them, can beat people into at the very least a sense of indifference. &#39;Look, this guy is saving an orphan from a burning building while the other guy is feeding the flames. Aren&#39;t you glad HE&#39;S president?&#39; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think &quot;they&quot; would even need to.  </p>

<p>People disagree with each other, but they can always seem to hammer out resolutions that please no one.  I just can&#39;t reasonably expect that any group of people would exhibit enough competence to try and manipulate society on a large or consistent scale.  </p>

<p>There are fairly straightforward reasons why parties have the less than rigorous ideological identity they do in SMDP systems.  To a person who is increasingly only intimately familiar with one world view, this can make them seem &quot;corrupt.&quot;  This is a product of an utopian mindset though.</p>

<p>There is a lot of effort, intelligence and experience that goes into even the smallest of society&#39;s accomplishments.  Over time, I&#39;ve learned to pay close attention when people do something in a way that doesn&#39;t make sense to me initially, rather than be instantly critical.  I choose to believe that people should be trusted to make sensible decisions most of the time, and that this is why societies, especially free societies, work out.  You certainly can&#39;t trust desperate people, or those who believe they are oppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s just worked out this way as a kind of evolution. You need tons of money to run because nobody takes you seriously if you run and aren&#39;t a millionaire. Nobody even hears about you because you can&#39;t buy the airtime. </p>

<p>The sort of people who run are just naturally interested in money, they have a drive to earn it, and it&#39;s hard to come by a huge amount without a certain amount of fucking-people-over, some ruthless self-interest and ego and a love of business.</p>

<p>If those are the only people who can get to the oval office, some company somewhere is going to take advantage of it. What sane person gets there with no interest in money and a desire to do the most stressful job under constant criticism? At this point we&#39;re just lucky if they&#39;re merely greedy and not actively nuts (eg with some sort of religious agenda) or actively filled with hatred for the lower class or foreigners.</p>

Now the repubs are sittin on the fence pointing fingers at the dems and on how bad of a job they are doing.. setting themselves up to take power next election.  All the while the folks get screwed royally.  What i cant believe is that people are ok with this system where no actual change comes out of.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the voting machines are fixed, to the extent that the right has a 10% kick. This was seen in the polling data back in the early 80&#39;s. In response the polling companies changed how they modeled their data so it would conform to the election results. </p>

<p>This 10% gives them much more power than they can get through elections but is not so high that some leftists can&#39;t get elected. This keeps the populace quiet and allows a release value for discontent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ooh, this is a favorite of mine! I THINK (and it gets me in trouble all the time) that it hasn&#39;t gotten past the edge, yet. The &#39;06 midterms caught them off guard and swamped their machine (metaphoric). That&#39;s why they had to take down ACORN. That&#39;s the constant harping on voter fraud  while running massive election fraud. That&#39;s the concerted attack on the Democratic Party&#39;s union funding machine. Etc.. Paper Ballets and get involved!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no because I don&#39;t think it is necessary. </p>

<p>The results of any election in America are easy to predict as most riding always vote R or D.</p>

<p>Some swing and it is these you diddle.</p>

<p>I am positive the original GB election was diddled like this in Florida. I would like to know about that white house consulting kosh or whatever his name was, background in statistics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How are the race relations really in Sweden?  Not to say that you saying that its a winter paradise for all races, seems a bit of a exaggeration.  Its just hard for someone who grew up in a American where people try to bullshit you and say that there are no racial problems in this country, when there clearly are if you are a racial minority or just paid attention to what happens in this country.  I have always been curious about these paradises that are Sweden and Norway.</p>

<ul>
<li>You replaced all &quot;exit polls&quot; with &quot;polls&quot; because that&#39;s an easier argument for you, even though the distinction between the two is the whole reason we&#39;re having this argument.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Exit polls are polls, that is just another form of polling. There is no distinction, and if note the citation exit polls where just as incorrect in the 1992 general election as general polls, There is no straw man here. Saying that the choice of adjective some how makes it different is a nonsense</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The first two paragraphs have no bearing on our argument, seeing how they&#39;re referring to polling in general. Attempting to talk down to me with useless facts to make yourself look better is really pathetic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because you have no idea what your talking about and seem to merely assume that the process works the way you imagine when this is simply not the case. Or that is the impression you give, I&#39;m sorry if you find this patronising but the truth, what you call &#39;useless facts&#39;, is patronising.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You accuse me of what you yourself are guilty, which is taking a dogmatic position without evidence to back it up. Furthermore you are trying very hard to divert the conversation away from the main logical argument with logical fallacies and other distractions. You have a limited grasp of the field.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve provided plenty of citiaion, you have provide limited citiaiton. If you what to start modaling data and doing regressions (not my idea of a fun Saturday night), with the intention of arguing over raw empirical data then go ahead.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The last paragraph shows me just how desperate you are. What you said: &quot;Experts have analyzed the polls.&quot; What you wanted your readers to infer: &quot;...and they agree with me.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I was paraphrasing the original post, the point is: if you&#39;re a statistician then you can compare the US election data with elections that we know are obviously rigged, such as the Iran election, then the difference is quite obvious. You saying that I&#39;m arguing that this &#39;infers that they agree with me&#39; is just your opinion.</p>

<p>This argument is a waste of time. You obviously understand my argument but refuse to acknowledge that it undermines your position.</p>
