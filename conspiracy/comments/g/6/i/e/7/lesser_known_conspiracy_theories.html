<p>First of all I <em>do</em> believe in stuff, and I am not an agnostic nor an atheist.  I <em>am</em> interested in theology, so tell me where I&#39;m wrong and what the truth is.  Whether or not I accept your point-of-view is irrelevant, I&#39;m trying to learn, aren&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s that arrogance again. Does it make you feel better to be condescending? Does it give you feelings of superiority, however illegitimate?</p>

<p>Right now I&#39;m criticizing you for saying religious mumbo jumbo like a dick.  You say you are a believer and are interested in theology yet you have no problem being an asshole when someone points out their differences (after you asked) and how they disagree within theology. You want a rational discussion about theology give a shit about what somebody else is saying enough not to disrespect them. Sounds like you wanted a conspiracy story about gnostics being actively deceived, not to talk about religious differences. </p>

<p>As for truth either you believe fully and confidently in science and it&#39;s methods at present or you don&#39;t to whatever degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Odd how one person&#39;s religious mumbo jumbo is another person&#39;s mockery, no?  This is my whole point.  One group lambasts the other group for having crackpot beliefs, but then put their own garbage on a pedestal like it is the unblemished truth.  If you can&#39;t handle a little criticism, if your belief system cracks at the first bit of skeptical thought, then you probably are on the wrong track.</p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly searching for a viable dissolution of gnostic beliefs.  Why is that bad?  If there is one, it means &quot;gnosticism&quot; is false, and we can move on.  If there isn&#39;t one, all the better, right?  Don&#39;t be afraid to shine the light of truth on <em>anything</em>.  That&#39;s what science is about, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, because the Bible is truly the work of God, and no other religious texts are, my criticism <em>is</em> rational. Objective comparison can be made between the respective legitimacies of the two works. However, because coming to <em>know</em> this takes place primarily in the realm of the experiential, rather than the exclusively empirical, <em>demonstrating</em> this is true to an observer cannot be accomplished to any significant degree with rationality alone. Rather, it is specifically an interpretation of rationality as reality which tends to indicate the Bible is nonsense in accordance with its own criteria, <em>obfuscating</em> its legitimacy. Relying on it to make my argument, then, would be senseless from this position.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I did read the link but I&#39;d imagine we&#39;d probably go nowhere arguing as you are heavily invested in your belief system.  But consider this:</p>

<p>The Bible was written by man.  Inspired by God, probably, yes, but <em>written</em> by man.  Two thousand years ago.  Do you not think there are more &quot;up-to-date&quot; religious truths now available?  It seems silly to me to take any old document so seriously in this day and age.  If you accept the premise that we can have a relationship with God personally, then what do you need the Bible for?  Just ask God directly what&#39;s up.  If he tells you to go read the Bible and take it literally, then fine... although I&#39;d recommend getting a second spiritual opinion ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>see,</p>

<p>it really doesn&#39;t matter the Bible was written by man when I see it evidenced these men were distinctly doing the will of God by writing it as they did. It&#39;s like making the argument that because my post is typed on a keyboard, it isn&#39;t an accurate reflection of what I mean, because the keyboard is posting it to the internet, not me. That&#39;s silly. It makes no difference whether or not the functionality of the keyboard is governed by its own rules. <em>I&#39;m</em> writing the post. The keyboard is just the instrument I&#39;m using when I do it.</p>

<p>why would truth need revision? That would mean it was wrong before. It wasn&#39;t. We call Jesus the Christ and the Messiah because his intermediation, by <em>itself,</em> is all we need in order for salvation to be made <em>universally accessible.</em> If the significance of his involvement only pertained to the people immediately around him at the time, for example, the Bible would no longer be as consistent as it is throughout, because the most fundamental tenet upon which its overarching message is based would be invalidated.</p>

<p>besides, I can only imagine the reason you would suggest a revision or an update is appropriate in the first place is because you have a grossly inaccurate understanding of what the Bible is saying to begin with. I don&#39;t just stick up for what it says because it&#39;s the <em>Bible,</em> y&#39;know. I believe <em>separately</em> its tenets are philosophically sound and apply unilaterally to everyone. I mean, I even came up with lesser versions of most of them, myself, without reading the book. They make an incredible amount of sense to me on a deeply personal level.</p>

<p>I accept the premise I can have a personal relationship with God, but only under the conditions stipulated by the Bible, which grants me the functionality. I <em>could</em> ask God what&#39;s up directly, and I <em>do,</em> but the only way I&#39;m going to know if what I come to understand in response is accurate is by comparing it against the Bible, which does not yield to the bias I am deeply susceptible to as a human being. <em>Because</em> this bias exists, a mechanism such as this is <em>required</em> in order to facilitate my interaction with God at all.</p>

<p>I <em>am</em> a second spiritual opinion. I do not need a third.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already answered your question, but I will phrase it differently.</p>

<p>I <em>can</em> have that communication with God. I do. However, because <em>former</em> interactions with God ended up in the Bible, verifying the conformity of these exchanges to God&#39;s will, they inherently serve as a gold standard by which the legitimacy of <em>my</em> communication with God is, thus, gauged. I see how <em>they</em> do it, I learn from them, I do it myself. Pretty simple. This is absolutely <em>not</em> something I could do without the Bible, just as it wasn&#39;t something <em>they</em> could do without the intervention of Jesus and the context provided by the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Okay you lost me right there.  Anyone can say that about any religious text.  Muslims say that about the Koran, etc.  Pure circular reasoning.</p>

<p>I have my own criticisms of gnosticism, especially the Illuminati one on that site, but they aren&#39;t based on contradictions with other fairy tales.  I have to admit, I like the concept of being able to &quot;know&quot; God personally; but they go off on rants about Simon Magus, Lucifer, and other horseshit, making them sound no different than crazy &quot;Christians&quot; and other ranting nuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of my own: the bizarre game shows, clips, panty-selling vending machines, etc. is basically Japan trolling the world. </p>

<p>&#39;Posted a clip from another game show. Went viral in hours.&#39; 
&#39;You&#39;d think people would notice there are never two clips from the same show.&#39; 
&#39;What&#39;s the buzz?&#39;
&#39;That we&#39;re a bunch of crazy people with sadistic tendencies.&#39; 
&#39;Fantastic! But let&#39;s not get too arrogant. We need to top this. Any ideas?&#39;
&#39;Toads dancing on cats?&#39;
&#39;Too tame.&#39;
&#39;What about if we have another game show where people are supposed to play chess against a toad while playing the harmonica.&#39;
&#39;You get a raise! Now let&#39;s go on break.&#39; </p>
