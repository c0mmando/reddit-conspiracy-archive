    <div class="md"><p>How about this one?</p>

<p>During WWII, psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer was commissioned with the only officially-sanctioned psychoanalytic report made by the US Government on Hitler, and together with a small team Langer set upon this unique task.</p>

<p>By the time he was finishing his report, the tide of the war had already turned against Germany, and Japan was the greatest threat. Therefore, not much attention was given to Langer&#39;s report, but it remains a fascinating study nonetheless, detailing even his most intimate sexual perversions.</p>

<p>One truly remarkable passage is worth quoting in its entirely, and I know people here will appreciate its significance. The following is from &quot;The Mind of Adolf Hitler&quot; by Walter Langer:</p>

<p>There are some people who seriously doubt that Johann Georg Hiedler was the father of Alois. Thyssen and Koehler, for example, claim that Chancellor Dollfuss had ordered the Austrian police to conduct a thorough investigation into the Hitler family. As a result of this investigation a secret document was prepared which proved that Maria Anna Schicklgruber was living in Vienna at the time she conceived. At that time she was employed as a servant in the home of Baron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back
to her home in Spital where Alois was born. If it is true that one of the Rothschilds is the real father of Alois Hitler, it would make Adolph a quarter Jew. According to these sources, Adolph Hitler knew of the existence of this document and the incriminating evidence it contained. In order to obtain it he precipitated events in Austria and initiated the assassination of Dollfuss. According to this story, he failed to obtain the document at that time, since Dollfuss had secreted it and, had told Schuschnigg of its whereabouts so that in the event of his death the independence of Austria would remain assured...Those who lend credence to this story point out
several factors which seem to favor its plausibility:</p>

<p>(a) That it is unlikely that the miller&#39;s assistant in a small village in this district would have very much to leave in the form of a legacy.</p>

<p>(b) That it is strange that Johann Hiedler should not claim the boy until thirty-five years after he had married the mother and the mother had died.</p>

<p>(c) That if the legacy were left by Hiedler on the condition that Alois take his name, it would not have been possible for him to change it to Hitler.</p>

<p>(d) That the intelligence and behavior of Alois, as well as that of his two sons, is completely out of keeping with that usually found in Austrian peasant families. They point out that their ambitiousness and extraordinary political intuition is much more in harmony with the Rothschild tradition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing I always bear in mind is that the wartime propaganda never really ended. The Allies won the War, so the propaganda they were disseminating was carried forward into the peace. It wasn&#39;t as overt, but the Nazis were still portrayed as monsters in the history books. No consideration was given when German soldiers told their inquisitors that they had to follow orders or they would have been shot. Yet we have heard of so few atrocities committed by American, British, Canadian or Australian forces. Were they really that much morally superior to German soldiers? No, that would be absurd. None the less, it is the standard basis for historical accounts of the War and the Nazis. Historians <em>start</em> from the premise that they were all monsters, and go on from there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll go one better than that ... everything you&#39;ve been taught about World War 2 and the events leading up to the War was propaganda, completely one-sided, designed to make the Germans look bad and the Allies look good. That goes for Hitler&#39;s character and actions, but it also applies to everything else about the War. History is written by the victors, and the victors don&#39;t praise the people they murdered -- they portray them as monsters so they can pretend that they were heroes.</p>

<p>The problem with questions like that is that it brings out the neonazis who believe <em>everything</em> could have been a lie. Obviously, it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The more interesting question is, what if 3%, or 0.5% was a lie, like the lie about the Iraqis throwing babies out of incubators in Kuwait, or Saddam putting someone is a plastic shredding machine.</p>

<p>Every now and then you see &quot;Do THEY control all the voting machines?&quot; Of course not! That would be stupid as all fuck. THEY only control <em>need</em> to control swing districts in swing states. Easier to do, easier to hide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see a movie version of Hitler&#39;s life that wasn&#39;t total character assassination and Zionist propaganda. But I doubt we&#39;ll ever see it. Even if some film maker had the guts to produce such a picture, the Zionist-controlled distribution system would bury it and make sure it never made any money or got seen in major markets. History as we know it is a joke. History is a fantasy written by the people who gained control over book publishing and other forms of media, and who control the universities and the government. Anyone who wants to know history has to dig for it, because it&#39;s been deeply buried.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to see a movie version of Hitler&#39;s life that wasn&#39;t total character assassination and Zionist propaganda. But I doubt we&#39;ll ever see it. Even if some film maker had the guts to produce such a picture, the Zionist-controlled distribution system would bury it and make sure it never made any money or got seen in major markets. History as we know it is a joke. History is a fantasy written by the people who gained control over book publishing and other forms of media, and who control the universities and the government. Anyone who wants to know history has to dig for it, because it&#39;s been deeply buried.</p>
