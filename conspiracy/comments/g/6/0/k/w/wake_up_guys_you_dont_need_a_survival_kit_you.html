        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No matter how fancy your kit is (with the possible exception of it including a helicopter with a lot of fuel) you&#39;re not going to be walking, let alone driving, out of any major cities very easily if something goes down that would motivate you to do so. No matter how much water, how many guns, how much food, or how much gear you have, if things are so bad that you need all that stuff, the chances that you&#39;ll be able to just pack it all into a backpack or into your car and walk/drive out are probably zero. You really think everyone that lives around you, who is out of food, water, gasoline, etc., is just going to just let you leave with all the gear and supplies you have with no harrassment? Even if you plan to go out guns blazing, you really think you&#39;ll be able to kill everyone who gets in your way? And do you think the highways are going to be in working (let alone safe) condition? If you need to defend yourself with guns, do you think you&#39;ll have enough ammunition to fend people off for as long as could be necessary? Think again.</p>

<p>You need to live in a place and in such a way that if the shit does hit the fan, you can self-sustain and don&#39;t need much (or anything) in the way of defenses.</p>

<p>You might want to check out some &#39;permaculture&#39; sites like <a href="http://www.permies.com/">http://www.permies.com/</a> and focus more on learning survival skills (get library books about what&#39;s edible in your region, etc.) and finding a safe place to live and a way to self-sustain that&#39;s as independent of the rest of the world as it can be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There a many scenarios that could happen, and you&#39;re being overly simplistic. The true survivalist could last in a major city just as well as in the country, possibly even better. Major city&#39;s have really cool places to take refuge, like subway and sewer systems that could protect you from a nuclear bomb better than being in open country farmland. A lone guy in the woods is an easier target for police helicopters than someone hiding in the subway tunnels, so it really depends on what you are trying to hide from. There are also scenarios where you may not want to run/hide/survive, but instead the best decision may be gorilla warfare against the government. In this case you are probably more likely to survive in the city. </p>

<p>I am not advocating living in the city vs the country, I just want to point it out that there are advantages to both sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this all comes down to the type of disaster. If you&#39;re talking something large and distructive like a tsunami, a nuclear warhead or tornado, then the best location is just not fucking THERE. If it&#39;s something man produced like riots or zombies, you&#39;re going to win in smaller towns. It really depends your context. People are where resources are. Permiculture can&#39;t work too well in a dessert, as safely isolated as you would be.</p>

<p>This is why we like societal groups to begin with. If you&#39;re alone you&#39;re fucked, hands down. It&#39;s just a matter of how long until you are.</p>

Our ability to survive any sort of collapse scenario is going to be locked up in our ability to form functioning communities and relate to our environment in a constructive manner.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m been learning morea bout permaculture recently. The idea of a sustainable lifestyle is excellent. It does require having some land on which to grow food and create sustainable infastructure. There is also some pratical value to other types of short range preperation. Some preperation is better than no preperation. Having some extra food in the house is a good start. Something to store water in is good. Having somewhere to go that is out of the city is not a bad idea. Seeing the images of gas lines in Japan and no food on the store shelves is a wake up call.</p>
