    <div class="md"><p>Most people are going to say gold/commodities but there are other options. </p>

<p>The alternative to the commodity backed currency would be a fiat currency that is not based on debt. IOW, the treasury would issue money directly to congress (that never has to be paid back to the Fed) instead of issuing bonds. There&#39;s a very long documentary you can find online called &quot;The Money Masters&quot; which covers that idea at the end.</p>

<p>If you have some time to kill I&#39;d recommend it. I don&#39;t know how accurate it all is, but it&#39;s interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know anything about European monetary policy. I was under the impression that their system functioned like ours (I&#39;m American). </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank">Wikipedia</a> says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In U.S. style central banking, liquidity is furnished to the economy primarily through the purchase of Treasury bonds by the Federal Reserve Bank. Because the European Community does not have system-wide bonds backed by a system-wide taxation authority, it uses a different method. Member banks, of which there are several thousand, bid for short term repo contracts of two weeks&#39; to three months&#39; duration. The member banks in effect borrow cash and must pay it back; the short durations allow interest rates to be adjusted continually. When the repo notes come due the participating banks bid again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looks like they use different mechanisms, but ultimately they still borrow the cash from a central bank.</p>

<p>The idea from that documentary I mentioned was different. There was not any borrowing involved, the Treasury just printed money instead of bonds.</p>

<p>The only currency I know of off the top of my head that worked like that was the stuff Lincoln used during the Civil War: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_Note#Pre-issuance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_Note#Pre-issuance</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with this concept, and here&#39;s my line of thinking.  To state that a currency needs to have a gold/commodity backing to be stable is a fundamental misunderstanding of some basic economic principles.  To think of what money is, you need to have a definition of wealth.  Personally I define wealth as a tangible &quot;thing&quot; that provides me value.  In theory money provides liquidity to markets, for the exchange of wealth.  If this was the only function for money, than a physical backing might make sense.  However money also has an additional purpose, I can use it to exchange services.  This new function now makes a note also a vehicle to represent a promise for future value.</p>

<p>It is this duality of the dollar in my opinion that makes fractional reserve banking (the redheaded step child everyone loves to blame) an actually practical system (but not without problems, which I will get into in a bit).  My thinking continues like this.  When a deposit is made, the money in the bank represents a portion of wealth.  That wealth (which can be anything) is then the backing for the lending of promises for future value (a loan).  If that loan is used to build a house or a factory, additional wealth has just been created.  This is why the money supply can justifiably be increased, the loaned money (which formally represented promises) was converted into money that now represents wealth.  The new wealth can now become leverage for further promises.</p>

<p>It is in my opinion that the fundamental problem with the system is lack of data or the quality of data.  The system is really good at expanding, however it&#39;s terrible at dealing with failure.  When wealth disappears the data to systematically deal with it is distorted. I believe a virtual currency that tracks the history of a &quot;dollar&quot; would solve this.</p>

<p>From a cultural point of view, I view the rage at fractional reserve banking as misguided.  Instead of raging at the practice itself, I would rather the rage be directed at the owners.  In my opinion the &quot;bank&quot; should be owned by the public.</p>
