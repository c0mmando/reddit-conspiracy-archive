        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After the Cold War, the US needed a new USSR.  Whether by accident or cold false flag attack, they found a new and terrifying enemy.  Rather than fight that enemy reasonably (if it were true), or simply go about looting all possible resources as cleanly as possible (if that was their goal), they seem to have taken a different route and committed to pissing off and radicalizing as many Muslims as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There were no bodies, only body parts - hands, legs and eyes scattered around. I could not recognise anyone. People carried away the body parts in shopping bags and clothing or with bits of wood, whatever they could find.&quot;</p>

<p>He said 44 people died at the scene, including 13 children - one as young as seven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was in Pakistan, a country we&#39;re not even at war with.  Consider what this will mean in 10 to 20 years, when the children of today have had time to grow up with nothing in their heads but violence, religion and revenge.  </p>

<p>It means that we will have tens of thousands of terrorists who will be willing to carry out any imaginable act of violence against Americans... it will provide a new and far more terrifying USSR.  At the same time, it&#39;s an enemy with no <em>real</em> military power.  It can terrorize us but has absolutely no chance of defeating us.  It&#39;s an excuse for every draconian type of surveillance I can think of.  It&#39;s enough to make people beg for mandatory GPS tracking and video cameras on every street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There should be no question that the US policy towards the Muslim world is definitely creating what many in the West would brand as being &quot;Islamic terrorists&quot;. If someone invaded my country and dropped a JDAM on my family, destroyed my way of life and left tens of thousands of dead civilians in their wake (as the US has in Afghanistan and Iraq), I would have some pretty strong incentive to become a &quot;terrorist&quot; too, although I don&#39;t think that would be the name I would use to describe myself in that case. </p>

<p>I believe quite strongly that the PTB are in many ways manufacturing the threat of Islamic extremism, deliberately fueling the fire rather than attempting to extinguish it. I think the PTB have even gone so far as to make up certain enemy figureheads out of thin air in order to create a manufactured persona that could then be presented to the public as being a major threat to our &quot;freedom and democracy&quot;. </p>

<p>Remember for example a guy named Mullah Mohammed Omar - the spiritual leader of the Taliban? I think it is only reasonable for all of us to have serious doubts about whether that man ever even really existed! He has NEVER even been photographed, and his entire life as we know about it seems to be based on stories and legend from other people. Omar&#39;s entire persona just smacks of being made up completely, and it seems to me that this evil character the PTB and media has presented us with - the mythos of Mullah Omar - may very well have been created as a propaganda tool by an intelligence agency or two.

    <div class="md"><p>And quite honestly, that was the way a lot of people proposed to fix the place. Build infrastructure, meaningful, lasting investment - roads &amp; utilities, giving people jobs and pulling them out of poverty, educating them, and reaping the financial benefits of a healthy, productive nation - but no. We chose to bomb the fuck out of it remotely. To conduct shock and awe campaigns - shooting countless rounds from tanks, soldiers, bradley&#39;s, into river beds just to make noise. To hire mercenaries devoid of the rule of law. To keep the people in squalor...No. We had a plan. We had a means. We chose to quite literally, blow it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lets not forget <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/northwoods.html">&quot;Operation Northwood&quot;</a> which basically is: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Code named Operation Northwoods, the plan, which had the written approval of the Chairman and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called for innocent people to be shot on American streets; for boats carrying refugees fleeing Cuba to be sunk on the high seas; for a wave of violent terrorism to be launched in Washington, D.C., Miami, and elsewhere. People would be framed for bombings they did not commit; planes would be hijacked. Using phony evidence, all of it would be blamed on Castro, thus giving Lemnitzer and his cabal the excuse, as well as the public and international backing, they needed to launch their war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that 9/11 was the start of a rather large and complex fear campaign, designed to control the populace and strip them of their rights. The theatric horror of 9/11 and the record-breaking time in which a culprit was found were my first clues. I still was kind of unsure but by this time I knew something wasn&#39;t quite right. Then, all you saw on the news were big scary graphics like &quot;America Under Attack&quot; etc..And the &quot;experts&quot; on every channel to back up the official story. You can put any dickhead on TV in a shirt and tie and call him an expert. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true. Unless you are the American public, who mostly can&#39;t be bothered with pesky fact-checking or looking beyond what the TV news feeds them in 30-second soundbytes.
Ten years on and the War on Terror™ is still being shoved down the throats of the world, and everyone in the media are doing their part to perpetuate it. Meanwhile, all of the reasons we were given have largely been disproven, and we still haven&#39;t &#39;found&#39; the boogeyman bin laden, never mind that throughout history when the US of A wants their man they could have his throat sliced as he slept, be it in someone&#39;s livingroom or in a tent in the desert. </p>

CIA Spy Captured Giving Nuclear Bomb To Terrorists
Posted by EU Times on Feb 11th, 2011 // 218 Comments 
While all eyes in the West are currently trained on the ongoing revolution taking place in Egypt, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) is warning that the situation on the sub-continent has turned “grave” as it appears open warfare is about to break out between Pakistan and the United States.</p>

<p>Fueling this crisis, that the SVR warns in their report has the potential to ignite a total Global War, was the apprehension by Pakistan of a 36-year-old American named Raymond Allen Davis (photo), whom the US claims is one of their diplomats, but Pakistani Intelligence Services (ISI) claim Raymond Davis is a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>

<p>Davis was captured by Pakistani police after he shot and killed two men in the eastern city of Lahore on January 27th that the US claims were trying to rob him.</p>

<p>Pakistan, however, says that the two men Davis killed were ISI agents sent to follow him after it was discovered he had been making contact with al Qaeda after his cell phone was tracked to the Waziristan tribal area bordering Afghanistan where the Pakistani Taliban and a dozen other militant groups have forged a safe haven and former CIA agent Tim Osman (also known as Osama bin Laden) is believed to be in hiding.</p>

<p>Of the actual gunfight itself we can read as reported by the Time News Service which, in part, says:</p>

<p>“The scene could have been scripted in a Hollywood action thriller: For two hours at the end of last month in Lahore, U.S. diplomat Raymond Davis was closely pursued by two visibly armed men on a motorbike. He noticed them tailing him from a restaurant to an ATM, and through the crowded streets of Pakistan’s second [largest] city. They were close by when, in a crowded intersection, Davis produced his own handgun and fired seven shots.</p>

<p>The diplomat was apparently a crack shot, and all seven bullets found their mark, killing his two pursuers. Davis then called for back-up, and a four-wheel-drive vehicle raced onto the scene, striking a Pakistani bystander who was killed by the impact. But the people in the vehicle, whose identities remain unknown, escaped from the scene having failed to retrieve Davis, who was later arrested nearby.”</p>

<p>The combat skills exhibited by Davis, along with documentation taken from him after his arrest, prove, according to this report, his being a member of the feared American Task Force 373 (TF373) black operations unit currently operating in the Afghan War Theater and Pakistani tribal areas comprised of US Military Special Forces Soldiers, CIA spies and freelance mercenaries.</p>

<p>Further information about Davis discovered by the Times of India includes:
