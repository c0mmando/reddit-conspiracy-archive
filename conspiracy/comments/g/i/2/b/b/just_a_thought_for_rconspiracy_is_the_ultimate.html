       Unprecedented pressure is being put on the global economic system causing instability, CIA instigated uprisings around the world are leading to mass killings, and tectonic disasters (possibly weaponry?) wiping out hundreds of thousands of people....With the most important issue to the most powerful people in the world being population control, of all things, one must wonder if perhaps it is being carried out before all of our very eyes?

       I was thinking about this today, if these wars, uprisings, and disasters didn't happen, and we were all at peace; would there be enough food and resources to go around the world?

       Wars and disasters are part of the controls on population. So is crime, disease and human interaction. The population can never exceed a level that resources can sustain it. IOW if food is not available people will die, if they get sick they will die, if they get bombed they will die.
On a positive note, the population has not hit a plateau yet. I think we're about half way there.

       since the introduction of diesel fuel to our agriculture process our population doubled from 3.5 billion to almost 7 billion in 50 years. This is a serious problem. consider another doubling in 50 years we will be at 14 billion and on another 50 years and will will be at 28 billion within a 100 years from now. now where are we gonna find enough oil to keep that going? When we run out and we will how will we be able to grow enough food fast enough for that population?

       War is not the most effective means of population control. In fact it's pretty shitty with lots of collateral damage. It'd be far easier to release a virus and trim the herd that way.

       You're wrong for a very perverse reason.

       Although wars kill people, they also encourage people to breed like rabbits, hence the baby boom in the 50's, and hence the huge birth-rates in war zones like Iraq, Lebanon and Afghanistan.

       i think uncontrolled population growth is the reason for most of the things you cite (except the earthquakes obviously), you have the causality backwards
      </p>
      <p>
       for example: spiralling overpopulation in Egypt has led to food riots because it is impossible for 90 million ppl to feed themselves from the Nile Valley

       you clearly have not researched about the issue and talking out of your ass here. food crisis in Africa has almost nothing to do with It's food production. Africa is the no.1 food exporter in the world but people in it are staving to death because all the lands and farms are owned by white people and food from the farms gets shipped to other countries for profit.
and people only have access to food from Chile or other countries that WTO forces them to trade with which people can not afford and that's why farmers and people around the world protest when WTO meetings take place in their cities.

       i wouldnt argue that any of these things you mention could be contributing factors -- but if you look at the exponential population growth in africa over the past 50 years, it has just overwhelmed any progress in bettering people's lives there
      </p>
      <p>
       look at the population density in Rwanda before the massacres there -- there was simply no room for people to make a living there

       I'm gonna get real out there with why I believe the world is in the state it's in: not for money or power: those are used to achieve the true purpose of their deception and destruction. Their goal is to wipe out the children of Israel....and I don't mean the burgs and steins and golds and smiths. Call me out, but before anyone bashes my belief, please begin your research with: who are the children of Esau? Where did the Israelites go when exiled from Assyria?  And "research" does not consist of 30 minutes of reading. I've been pondering this for 4 years
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: in short, the "jews" of today (no offense to ethnically jewish ppl who read this, i'm sure you're not plotting the destruction of the world) are no jews at all, but are the descendants of esau. his people are the edomites, the kazars, the rothchilds and rockafellers, the possessors of our gold and silver, ...our leaders. and as these men attempt to make this earth a footstool for satan, and destroy the prophecies of old, they attempt to wipe out the bloodline.

       well, it requires extensive reading. if you start looking some of this stuff up, you'll find that it is all very relative to the plans of the "elite" around the globe, particularly in the western world. in short, it is not population control that brings us to where we are, but
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       'they' are determined to destroy. ultimately, genocide over thousands of years.

       Because I don't want to convince anybody. If you care enough to look it up, then you'll know. Like I said, this isn't a 30 minute read, and it most certainly can't be put in the short length of a comment. Research, my friend, not kindergarten

       I meant my question to be an invitation for you to explain what you know.  I tried your search and didn't come up with anything useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Doing research" does not mean people will come to the same conclusions you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically you will have to sum it up for us or become another pointless voice lost in the internet.

       dude. i was just saying what i thought. i can't try to share my entire knowledge of the subject to you on reddit. it simply can't be done. it's not something that is written shortly. someone could write a book on it haha. but, it would be like me trying to convert you to Christianity over the internet: simply not happening. If you come across information, then for the better, but if you don't learn it by yourself, then i don't know how else you'd learn it. that's how i came to learn what i've learned. but really, my point of posting it was to perhaps spark someone's interest so that they would begin reading themselves, but not to persuade

       You could post a link or 2 or 3 or whatever, that would be something at least.  I looked at a few links but none of them seemed relevant to what you said.

       i wouldnt argue that any of these things you mention could be contributing factors -- but if you look at the exponential population growth in africa over the past 50 years, it has just overwhelmed any progress in bettering people's lives there
      </p>
      <p>
       look at the population density in Rwanda before the massacres there -- there was simply no room for people to make a living there
