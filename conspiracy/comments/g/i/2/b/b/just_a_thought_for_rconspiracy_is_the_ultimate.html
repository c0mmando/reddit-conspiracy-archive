    <div class="md"><p>Wars and disasters are part of the controls on population. So is crime, disease and human interaction. The population can never exceed a level that resources can sustain it. IOW if food is not available people will die, if they get sick they will die, if they get bombed they will die.
On a positive note, the population has not hit a plateau yet. I think we&#39;re about half way there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>since the introduction of diesel fuel to our agriculture process our population doubled from 3.5 billion to almost 7 billion in 50 years. This is a serious problem. consider another doubling in 50 years we will be at 14 billion and on another 50 years and will will be at 28 billion within a 100 years from now. now where are we gonna find enough oil to keep that going? When we run out and we will how will we be able to grow enough food fast enough for that population? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think uncontrolled population growth is the reason for most of the things you cite (except the earthquakes obviously), you have the causality backwards</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you clearly have not researched about the issue and talking out of your ass here. food crisis in Africa has almost nothing to do with It&#39;s food production. Africa is the no.1 food exporter in the world but people in it are staving to death because all the lands and farms are owned by white people and food from the farms gets shipped to other countries for profit.
and people only have access to food from Chile or other countries that WTO forces them to trade with which people can not afford and that&#39;s why farmers and people around the world protest when WTO meetings take place in their cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m gonna get real out there with why I believe the world is in the state it&#39;s in: not for money or power: those are used to achieve the true purpose of their deception and destruction. Their goal is to wipe out the children of Israel....and I don&#39;t mean the burgs and steins and golds and smiths. Call me out, but before anyone bashes my belief, please begin your research with: who are the children of Esau? Where did the Israelites go when exiled from Assyria?  And &quot;research&quot; does not consist of 30 minutes of reading. I&#39;ve been pondering this for 4 years</p>

<p>edit: in short, the &quot;jews&quot; of today (no offense to ethnically jewish ppl who read this, i&#39;m sure you&#39;re not plotting the destruction of the world) are no jews at all, but are the descendants of esau. his people are the edomites, the kazars, the rothchilds and rockafellers, the possessors of our gold and silver, ...our leaders. and as these men attempt to make this earth a footstool for satan, and destroy the prophecies of old, they attempt to wipe out the bloodline.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, it requires extensive reading. if you start looking some of this stuff up, you&#39;ll find that it is all very relative to the plans of the &quot;elite&quot; around the globe, particularly in the western world. in short, it is not population control that brings us to where we are, but <em>who</em> &#39;they&#39; are determined to destroy. ultimately, genocide over thousands of years.</p>
