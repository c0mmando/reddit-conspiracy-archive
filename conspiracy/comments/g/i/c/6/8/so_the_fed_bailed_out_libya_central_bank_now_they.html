       You pick from the pool that's made available. He didn't select the 100,000 employees of the CIA, the DEA, ATF, or SEC...and he doesn't control who starts wars in the middle east, or blows oil wells up in the Gulf of Mexico. He get's handed a basket full of bullshit and not enough time of any day known to man to "fix them" much less make truly informed or in control decisions. He's a man, mot a magician.

       Yeah, I mean, considering the scale and lack of clarity, he had so many choices to make otherwise...I'm not an apologist, trying to be a realist. This Uncle Tom BS is propaganda. The Ron Paulite crowd is suicidal on thinking of taking us back to Gold Standard.

       What the world needs is for labor to rise up and demand it's place in the economy internationally. Until you have wage parity that is really going to be hard to do. You also need international standards of clean air, water, and soil....standard OSHA rules...to bring about the One Price Theory for wages, benefits, and standards of living.

       ? How so...
      </p>
      <p>
       As I saw, the bank of libya had a net profit of 143 million, and if we were to assume that they made 143MM payments on the 26,000MM debt, it would take 185 years to pay that back.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were able to pay back 26 billion in three years -- the that would have meant that they were able to make a hell of a lot more than 26B pretty quickly. And if that were true - then wouldnt there be more news about this?

       The Treasury Department team had been working nonstop on a plan to freeze Libyan assets in U.S. banks, hoping they might snare $100 million or more and prevent Moammar Gaddafi from tapping it as he unleashed deadly attacks against protesters who wanted him gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, at 2:22 Friday afternoon, Feb. 25, an e-mail arrived from a Treasury official with startling news. Their $100 million estimate was off — orders of magnitude off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The e-mail said there was in “excess of $29.7 Billion — yes, that’s a B.”

       I was wondering how it works when money is "seized".  You see the signals of where the money is going are registered.  I'm wondering how it works when some of this money is forcibly redirected.  In short though it seems to me like if you are using their digital money then it doesn't matter if you are a nation or an individual in that they can steal it all from you with a push of a button.

       Paid back. They didn't bail them out in the sense of giving them free money to keep, they gave out very short term loans at near zero interest rate through the discount window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, I'm pretty sure the Libyan bank posted treasury bills they were holding as collateral for the loan, which is pretty funny because that means they were lending the U.S. taxpayers money at a rate higher than they were being lent money by the FED.

       You pick from the pool that's made available. He didn't select the 100,000 employees of the CIA, the DEA, ATF, or SEC...and he doesn't control who starts wars in the middle east, or blows oil wells up in the Gulf of Mexico. He get's handed a basket full of bullshit and not enough time of any day known to man to "fix them" much less make truly informed or in control decisions. He's a man, mot a magician.
