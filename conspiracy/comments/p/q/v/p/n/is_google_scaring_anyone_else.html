       I don't like the way Google is going about business. Before they were all about getting information out to the user. But now, they are more interested in staying atop the internet world, and seem to be blocking newer inventions. They are just power hungry now and will do whatever it takes to stay in power of the internet world, and that includes lessening the freedoms of their users. Instead of giving us ways to explore the internet world, they are now trying to limit what we see by suggesting things that we already search for. Grouping together multiple websites (google, youtube, gmail, g+) and using all of the user inputted information to create a miniture world for them. It's like lying to your kids to protect them from the truths of the world. Except they are lying to us and decieving us to keep us using their products.

       Google, like kids on a joy ride, picked up all their friends along the way, but soon ran out of gas money. So someone said, hey let’s go pick up Greed, he needs a ride and he has gas money!!!  So, Google picked up Greed, but Greed was like, “Hey, I am paying for the gas, so I dictate where we go!” Greed led them to a place called “Mental Evolutionary Stasis”, and it was soon discovered that this was where he was getting all his gas money.  Google didn’t care, though. They just wanted to keep going on their joy ride.

       Let’s say I am a company who sells “knowledge of addition” as in teaching you
       <em>
        2+2+2+2=8
       </em>
       . Now, your search history has “knowledge of addition” in it. Google will then put advertisements and recommended links on your personal pages which lead you to my “knowledge of addition” websites only. Why?  Because, they know, by looking at your search history, that you like “knowledge of addition” and are more likely to click on those links. Thereby, Google stands a chance of making more money from generating traffic to my site.  You then run the risk of never being exposed to “knowledge of multiplication”, because your awareness is being limited to “knowledge of addition”.  Basically, your level of exposure, and in turn, awareness, will be limited to what you already know and understand, effectively causing mental evolutionary stasis because of greed. Of course, Google is only a small part of the internet, and you are bound to find out about multiplication elsewhere, but it will have to be an active search. It will be at that point, that Google will cease to be a portal for new information and simply become a sales portal. I assume they will limit your awareness of that, though.

       Does that not assume that google is not a fair operator and that 'knowledge of multiplication' is free to advertise too in which case google may recommend that too.  Perhaps I am missing your point?

       For this example, I am sure they will advertise and present search results that include a general scope of
       <em>
        mathematics
       </em>
       . They just need to be careful of how
       <em>
        specialized
       </em>
       our exposure and awareness becomes, when profits take precedence in the age of information.  The
       <em>
        com
       </em>
       in “google.com” does label it as a commercial site, so of course they exist to make money, but considering one’s survival on the internet, reputation goes pretty far, as well.  When millions of people on a global scale are able to communicate instantly, your reputation can be damaged before you have a chance to do anything about it. So, go for the profits, I say, but set some boundaries in regards to how far greed influences your business model, as there is a new equation in place, where reputation is a variable not to be taken lightly.....in a true "free market" that is.

        As web companies strive to tailor their services (including news and search results) to our personal tastes, there's a dangerous unintended consequence: We get trapped in a "filter bubble" and don't get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview. Eli Pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy.

       I'm not so much scared of Google itself; Google does what any rational entrepreneur does - it tries to make money.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does scare me is that they are an NSA contractor, and that regardless of that, the government isn't acting (as in, recent legislation like SOPA-oids, monitoring bills, data retention, lack of European-type privacy laws) as if it's going to support legal action against them if/when (probably when) they start overstepping ethical bounds (or moreso than they do already).
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Google's just being a private company. The government's incompetence/collaboration in these matters is the problem.

       Agreed and upvoted but in addition - it doesn't help that they have an executive or two who attend Bilderberg.  That's how the pyramid slave system works - control the eye and you control the rest of the compartmentalized structure.

       I think it's don't be evil. Philosophers have pondered about the concept of good and evil for a while now.  I wonder if google has a good idea of what it thinks evil is.

      <p>
       Currently for me google is saying evil is "Profoundly immoral and malevolent."

       There is an interesting video somewhere about personalisation of the web experience with companies such as google and facebook altering the experience based on what the heuristics say is relevant to that person.  Of course this requires a level of scrutiny of the individual that is undoubtedly intrusive and clearly questions about censorship will be being asked.   If you are tailoring results according to the individual than you are not simply returning results basedd on how the company sees the search request but in the context of the individuals history.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words it will be commonplace for two people to get different results based on the same query which some might say is a good thing if the results use the personal data accurately to assess what it is the user wants.  If we are honest , google does what it does damn  well,and it has done it for a while, and that is a big part of the success.   they now though do have enormous clout whoever they are (who owns them)
      </p>
      <p>
       Their motto is don't be evil and they do seem to pay lip service to being fair and open whilst protecting privacy. That could all change if it is even true for the time at the moment.

       No one, i wasn't complaining that i have to use their products. I have stopped actually. I absolutely love youtube, but being suffocated into the Google realm is only going to lessen the quality in my opinion, and there are many other great options to choose from. I like my internet to have no limits, not be a one-stop shop.

       Let’s say I am a company who sells “knowledge of addition” as in teaching you
       <em>
        2+2+2+2=8
       </em>
       . Now, your search history has “knowledge of addition” in it. Google will then put advertisements and recommended links on your personal pages which lead you to my “knowledge of addition” websites only. Why?  Because, they know, by looking at your search history, that you like “knowledge of addition” and are more likely to click on those links. Thereby, Google stands a chance of making more money from generating traffic to my site.  You then run the risk of never being exposed to “knowledge of multiplication”, because your awareness is being limited to “knowledge of addition”.  Basically, your level of exposure, and in turn, awareness, will be limited to what you already know and understand, effectively causing mental evolutionary stasis because of greed. Of course, Google is only a small part of the internet, and you are bound to find out about multiplication elsewhere, but it will have to be an active search. It will be at that point, that Google will cease to be a portal for new information and simply become a sales portal. I assume they will limit your awareness of that, though.
