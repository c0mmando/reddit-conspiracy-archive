       Maybe I misspoke again. However, the commission report does not mention building 7 at all, while it does analyze WTC 1&amp;2.

       I haven't read anything about him but I endevour to read anything I can  on the Moon landings. The idea that he directed the filming of it is fascinating. I've read countless books and articles on what the footage isn't but never read anything on what it

       If air is a poor conductor of heat, space would conduct a negligible amount of heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If circulating atoms in a fluid are need for convection, a negligible amount of heat transfer in space can be due to convection.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're taught that the planet Earth is primarily, if not solely, heated by radiation from the Sun as the only form of heat transfer that can occur within a vacuum results from an electromagnetic wave striking matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an inverse relationship between radiation intensity and the distance from the Sun.

       Neither. Heat transfer in space has always been a fascinating topic though. For instance, how could a warm object freeze in space without nearby atoms to transfer heat to?
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder what a modern moonbound trip would look like. Either so many scrutinizing eyes paying attention, would NASA use different protocol to protect their astronauts from radiation?

       Frank Olson, Army scientist, had involvement with MKULTRA. Didn't quite reveal a conspiracy exactly, but the nature of his death imo (he was dosed with LSD without his knowledge, later while rooming with a CIA agent in a hotel, jumped out of the window) makes me think he belongs here.

       I'm pretty sure he called his wife and said it was time. He was tired of being an old bastard and was unhealthy (his words). Of course, that could be faked. But I like to think of him as a hero that burned out bright... plus, what else could he have done against the government?

       Gary Webb is an iffy one.  He had mailed letters the day before to several people and had been doing some financial settling for months.  Several people said he was very depressed.  However, two gunshots to the head in a suicide?  It certainly makes you wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dark Alliance, which can be a bit draining to read at times, is something everyone should read.  Instead of half-baked conspiracy theories without any proof, this is full of sources and proof that the CIA and our gov't helped start the crack cocaine epidemic in the 80's to fund a civil war in Nicaragua. Webb was rewarded for his hard work by being fired from his job at a newspaper who suddenly decided he lied in his collection of Dark Alliance newspaper articles and was unable to get a job anywhere because he was blackballed.

       So you (and those who downvoted me &amp; upvoted you) all agree with DICK CHENEY, who praises Tim Russert for asking "tough questions" (none of those questions ever about torture, illegal wars, or 9/11 conspiracy):
      </p>
      <p>
       In praising Russert’s tenure on “Meet the Press,” Cheney said: “He would ask you tough questions, he would remind you of quotes you made previously in other settings or on earlier shows, so you never got away with anything going up vis-à-vis Tim.”

       Political Rule #1: Never speak ill of the dead. Cheney went into full pitbull mode during one of his Russert interviews. I'm sure he was glad Tim was dead and someone wrote this public version of that sentiment for him. (Dick "Fuck you, go fuck yourself." Cheney wasn't exactly a wordsmith.)

      <p>
       Russert’s role in the 2000 election
      </p>
      <p>
       Confirmation of Russert’s political leanings (not that any is needed) come from an incident related by Al Gore to Anthony Lappe, which took place shortly before the 2000 election at the Al Smith dinner, attended by Gore and Bush. Here is Lappe’s description from his book (
       <a href="http://www.amazon.com/True-Lies-Anthony-Lappe/dp/0452285313">
        http://www.amazon.com/True-Lies-Anthony-Lappe/dp/0452285313
       </a>
       ):
      </p>
      <p>
       "At one point in the evening, Gore explains, Russert approached the candidates. As Gore was closest to him, Russert respectfully shook his hand and then moved on to Bush.
       <strong>
        Thinking that Gore had turned away, Russert shook Bush’s hand and, mischievously, turned over his jacket lapel to reveal a Bush campaign pin hidden under the fold."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Russert was indeed relentless on Bush’s behalf during the Florida recount. Prior to Bush’s being awarded the presidency, as described by Eric Alterman in “What Liberal Media?”,
       <strong>
        Russert referred to Bush’s “future presidency” nineteen times, and he referred to Bush himself as “President Elect Bush”
       </strong>
       . On NBC Nightly News on November 8th, Russert said that Gore “can’t extend it too long, nor can he become a whiner about Florida”. He asked Dick Cheney if he thought that Gore was being a “sore loser”. And when Bush’s Florida campaign chairman, Katherine Harris, announced George Bush as the winner of the Florida election, based on the fact that the uncounted ballots hadn’t been counted by what she interpreted as the deadline date, Russert announced on his November 26th edition of Meet the Press, “He (Bush) has now been declared the official winner of the Florida election … and therefore is the forty-third president of the United States.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And he tried, ultimately successfully, to get Gore’s running mate, Joe Lieberman to make concessions. On Meet the Press during the height of the controversy, as related in Robert Shogan’s book “Bad News”:
      </p>
      <p>
       "... Russert demanded that Senator Lieberman … announce that Gore would give up the fight and accept Bush as the winner if the Florida tribunal upheld an unfavorable lower-circuit court decision against him."
      </p>
      <p>
       When Lieberman refused to agree, Russert persisted:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...But Senator … if the Florida Supreme Court rules that the lower-court judge was correct and the hand recount should not be counted, it ends there. The Supreme Court has spoken. Why not accept that decision? Why keep dangling out there future litigation?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the Florida Supreme Court, in a losing effort to preserve democracy in our country, did NOT rule that the hand recount should not be counted, as Russert was so fervently hoping for.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then there was the issue of 680 controversial, illegal and probably phony overseas military ballots, which went heavily for Bush. As Eric Alterman describes this situation in his book:
      </p>
      <p>
       "...The New York Times reported that the Bush lawyers had failed to present “any evidence” for legal arguments to allow the ballots…. What’s more, a later extensive post-election investigation by the Times found considerable circumstantial evidence for monkey business on these and other overseas ballot by the Republicans. But the echo chamber they created was so strong that Democratic vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman felt compelled to concede the issue under pressure… Since the number of ballots in question was 680, and Bush’s alleged margin of victory turned out to be just 537, this concession alone could conceivably have cost Gore his victory."
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, the efforts of the Bush campaign, Russert, and other “journalists” paid off, as Lieberman announced directly to Russert on Meet the Press that the Gore/Lieberman campaign would not dispute the counting of those 680 questionable ballots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russert’s handling of Bush and his administration
      </p>
      <p>
       Tim Russert has a reputation as a relentless interrogator of politicians, never afraid to ask the tough questions. But anyone who thinks that obviously hasn’t seen him interview George W. Bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after chief U.S. weapons inspector David Kay exposed the lie of Iraqi WMDs in February 2004, the White House needed to repair some of the political damage. *
       <em>
        Bush chose Russert for that purpose. *
       </em>
       Anthony Lappe describes Russert’s interview of Bush on his February 8th, 2004 edition of Meet the Press:
      </p>
      <p>
       "For over an hour, six million viewers were treated to one of the biggest journalistic letdowns of the election year. With so much on the table – from the nonexistent WMDs to the Iraqi quagmire to accusations that Bush was AWOL from the National Guard – Russert could have hog-tied the president and left him twisting in the wind. Instead, he let him off easy, failing to counter Bush’s dodges with obvious follow-up questions."
      </p>
      <p>
       In that same interview, in response to Russert’s asking if he would authorize the release of his military records to settle the question of whether or not Bush was AWOL from the National Guard, Bush answered “Yes, absolutely. We did so in 2000, by the way.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Russert, regarded as one of the most well prepared journalists on television,
       <strong>
        must have known that that was a bald faced lie,
       </strong>
       as researcher Marty Heldt has previously publicly made clear that his efforts to obtain information on Bush’s military records through the Freedom of Information Act had been rejected. But Russert just let that slide.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in an interview with Dick Cheney shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks on our country, Cheney tried to explain the pitiful response of his administration to the attacks:
      </p>
      <p>
       "VICE PRES. CHENEY: Well, the--I suppose the toughest decision was this question of whether or not we would intercept incoming commercial aircraft.
"MR. RUSSERT: And you decided?'
"VICE PRES. CHENEY: We decided to do it. We'd, in effect, put a flying combat air patrol up over the city; F-16s with an AWACS, which is an airborne radar system, and tanker support so they could stay up a long time."
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, *
       <em>
        Russert must have known that Cheney’s contention that “the toughest decision was this question of whether or not we would intercept incoming commercial aircraft” was a lie, since fighter jets routinely intercept commercial aircraft under certain designated circumstances (such as hijacked aircraft) without requiring or asking for approval from the White House. But again, Russert made no challenge of that ridiculous assertion by Cheney, and did not even follow up on it. *
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <strong>
        in an abject display of his unbounded admiration for George Bush, Russert even asked Laura Bush on his December 23rd, 2001 edition of Meet the Press if she thought that her husband had become president due to divine intervention.

       Oswald's handler, Bush Family associate, scheduled to testify before the House Committee on Assassinations,
       <strong>
        wrote letter to George H.W. Bush pleading for his life
       </strong>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       From Wikipedia link:
      </p>
      <p>
       On September 17, 1976, the CIA requested that the FBI locate de Mohrenschildt, because he had "attempted to get in touch with the CIA Director." On September 5, 1976, De Mohrenschildt had written a letter to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, George H. W. Bush asking for his assistance. The letter said:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "You will excuse this hand-written letter. Maybe you will be able to bring a solution to the hopeless situation I find myself in. My wife and I find ourselves surrounded by some vigilantes; our phone bugged; and we are being followed everywhere. Either FBI is involved in this or they do not want to accept my complaints. We are driven to insanity by the situation. I have been behaving like a damn fool ever since my daughter Nadya died from [cystic fibrosis] over three years ago. I tried to write, stupidly and unsuccessfully, about Lee H Oswald and must have angered a lot of people — I do not know. But to punish an elderly man like myself and my highly nervous and sick wife is really too much. Could you do something to remove the net around us? This will be my last request for help and I will not annoy you any more. Good luck in your important job. Thank you so much."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       George Bush wrote back:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter. I believe I can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic death a few years ago, and the current poor state of your wife's health. I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances. In your situation I can well imagine how the attentions you described in your letter affect both you and your wife. However, my staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years. The flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren Commission has long subsided. I can only speculate that you may have become "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest in the Kennedy assassination, and thus may be attracting the attention of people in the media. I hope this letter had been of some comfort to you, George, although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely. George Bush, Director of the Central Intelligence Agency."
       </em>

       b) It was likely that Berg was on an FBI ''watch'' list. FBI agents interviewed Berg a few years ago when they were investigating the September 11 terrorist attacks because, unbeknownst to him, Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, had used his e-mail account when both were in Oklahoma. On Thursday Fox News reported that the FBI dismissed the link between Berg and Moussaoui as ''coincidental.''

       Wait... what?  It amazes me how much information that points to obvious conclusions and conspiracy is out there that gets ignored.

       Sounds like Berg was Mossad (?) and might have had intimate knowledge of the 9/11 attacks as well if he did in fact have dealings with Moussawi. What a strange tale in any case.

       The same entities that control society at the moment have controlled society for at least 4,000 years. We used to worship Gods in ancient Egypt, now we worship our celebrities and musicians who receive our energy through our worship of symbols. They're basically abusing a mechanic in the universe that allows them to suck up our energy using the same symbols in movies, television, and in companies like Mcdonalds. Here's a video with examples of companies that all use the same symbol
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STVYN0wpzU8">
        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STVYN0wpzU8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So everytime we go buy Mcdonalds, we're spiritually contributing energy to them. We live in a mind-before-matter universe, so this energy can be made to make sure things go according to plan as long as they use the same symbols in their plans. The same symbols are used in porn, specifically XXX. XXX actually equals 666 and that energy we're using fapping goes directly to them because you're subconsciously giving it to that symbol, subconsciously "worshiping" the symbol.

       I'm 7 mins in and so far the video has been all spelling errors and coincidences. Hope it gets better in part 2.

      <p>
       Edit: So I didn't realise the guy speaking didn't make the video, so I'll let the spelling mistakes go.

       David Hutlzer
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This initial announcement also earned me a very serious warning -- from two different insiders working at high levels of government -- that I needed to publish the entire investigation as quickly as possible, or my life could be in imminent danger.
       </p>
       <p>
        The conspirators are desperate to stop the bleeding and save themselves from prosecution. Threats, bribery, blackmail, torture and murder are their standard tools of the trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        As you will see, on December 31st, David Hutlzer publicly conveyed vital information to me for this case, acting directly on behalf of Benjamin Fulford -- the former Asia-Pacific bureau chief for Forbes Magazine, and a leading representative of this international alliance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ben had David direct me to the "Unwanted Publicity Intelligence" website, which contains extremely sensitive documents. I was astonished when I reviewed this website, considering that I was told it is very dangerous to publish pictures of the Federal Reserve bonds we will be discussing.
       </p>
       <p>
        A week later, on January 6th, David and his eight-year-old son Mackie burned to death in their home. Hardly anything recognizable was left. Accelerants were found outside and arson has not been ruled out.

Ex-marine turned spiritual humanitarian pacifist and truth-seeker.
He died in January in a police shootout.
Here's a comprehensive guide with many news reports about this incident, every single one has different details, SCREAMS disinfo:

       I also recommend the book, it's full of his collection of insider info shared in a 'stream of conciousness' writing style, like a conversation with him. The final chapters are saddest to me, his faith in Obama being our savior was placed too soon.

       You have to be careful with this kind of approach. It's a common trick the news media use: [X] died unexpectedly after they [Y].
      </p>
      <p>
       It implies a causal link between the two where none has been shown to exist.
      </p>

       To me at least, it's very clear that by making the criteria of the list "has died after revealing conspiracies" sets up the assumption that their deaths had something to do with their revelation of conspiracies.

       An unrelated note, but I've always wanted a list of all doomsday (or equal) prophecies. Modern ones i.e. since the late 1800's would be more than enough. It probably exist out there, but I've somehow never stumbled across anything like that.

       I'm just saying, the terms need to be clarified. Everyone dies after reporting a conspiracy, eventually. Now, a "list of people who have died in a suspicious manner shortly after revealing a conspiracy" is a different list altogether.

       We all die... eventually "Username_Tokin of reddit's conspiracy subreddit" will join the army of the dead, too. As will everyone else here. I hope I'm not forgotten. In fact, I hope I'm remembered well by my peers (here, at least). Most of the redditors here will outlive me (assuming we aren't all wiped out simultaneously by some nefarious act of Illuminati/NWO).
