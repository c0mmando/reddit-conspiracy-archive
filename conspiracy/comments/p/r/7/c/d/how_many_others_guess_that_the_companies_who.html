I had serious conversations with my boss about if he could figure out who wrote the malicious code to then track them down and sue the pants off them. Seems stupid but if it worked it could set a precedent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plausible although perhaps not necessarily that likely or necessary. I mean there are plenty of smart people who like to find weaknesses in systems. I think the term hacker in the purest sense is someone who tries to understand enough about a device to change its function, make it do thinks not intended by the designer/manufacturer.</p>

<p>For instance I believe, most game DRM firmware has been bypassed in order to play copied games and most DRM for pc software, films and audio has been defeated.</p>

<p>I guess though the concept you are describing would be a type of problem reaction solution that kept them in business.</p>

<p>I think there is enough of an incentive for others with no interest in creating software but creating botnets without looking at the idea of a digital protection racket.   I have too thought about it though and was just thinking It would not be out of the question to imagine microsoft themselves creating viruses or at least leaving vulnerabilities such as buffer underruns in the code which then requires a security update which means you have to connect to them for the download of those, giving them the oppurtunity to break any authentication modules you have bypassed via crack.</p>

A lot of the worms for XP that infected millions of machine were made out of curiosity, and XP was so vunerable they spread across the world in a matter of hours. Enough people make viruses that the companies don&#39;t need to distribute their own. Plus the shit storm if they were found out would ruin them, it would only take one person to reveal.</p>

<p>A much more fun theory would be that they intentionally disenfranchise then lay off their talent in hopes that one or more of them will go rogue and sell secrets to actual virus makers.  then, uh oh, not only do you need new definitions, but upgrade to a new engine as well.  That&#39;ll be $70</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked for a major AV company for over 10 years, and I can reliably tell you that this is not the case. There are simply too many other people out there writing viruses, trojans, and worms for it to be necessary. Also, most major AV vendors have incorporated other security services into their software (intrusion prevention, venerability detection, etc) that if there were no new viruses at all, their product would still be used,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the problem of AV vendors, they only take a portion of the virus code and call it a &quot;signature&quot;. Its not enough, and most of the time is a common action among programs..  Often a virus writer just releases the virus with a slightly different code, and everybody else is stuck with a dead &quot;signature&quot;. </p>

<p>Much better off with just a firewall.</p>

<p>malware bytes---free and awesome</p>

<p>other than that, dont be an idiot and you will be just fine</p>

<p>no, they dont create them because the ones that are out there serve a purpose.  Some log your keys so your passwords and bank info can be stolen.  Some are malicious and serve to do things like what &quot;windows vista/7 anti-virus&quot; do and phish for you to buy a fake product.  Some are lurkers and just hang out waiting for select information to be accessed which they then create a back door to.  There are tons of others but those are the most prevalent.  Only a fool would buy an anti-virus in todays market anyway tbh.  I have never bought one and have never had any issues other than with tracking cookies which I have my browser set up to ignore anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a horrible analogy, because trojans can be easily distributed, especially among PC users who are not digitally savvy. The viruses are then easily patched by a security update or security suite purchase (for those who are not computer savvy).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can most assuredly put this one to rest for you.  99% of the malware out there is to reap money for the black hat hacker himself, they usually do not like to share the programs/exploits they use because it means a dissemination and thus a weakening of a tool they use for income.  If you spend 300 hours building a botnet the last thing you want is to share your source code and expose more machines than are necessary to do your farming.</p>

<p>Things like worms and lurker programs are designed by one person for one person only, to penetrate a system and wait until certain information or sectors of a database are exposed and then &quot;tunnel&quot; out creating a back door for easy access to the critical information such as huge credit card databases, email DBs, and so on.  These people DO NOT want AV companies knowing about this shit as it essentially destroys 1000s of hours of work in one patch.  </p>

<p>edit---also most of the motivation for these guys, outside of money, and I would argue the MAIN motivation, is very simply ego.  They want to pull of the big shit.  The botnets out there that are real powerhouses are hundreds of thousands of machines, mostly infecting facebook idiots who buy a computer for facebook and email and leave it on all day on a wifi with a factory password.  They never realize that 90% of their bandwidth is being consumed by a hidden program sending out thousands of emails per minute 24 hours a day and that people have complete and total access to all of their information.  I LOVE IT when I see people talk about facebook like its the coolest shit in the world and then I hear they got hacked and people sent pron to the mother in law.  </p>
