    <div class="md"><p>Well, a few years before you were born everyone was fairly well convinced they were about to perish in a nuclear fucking holocaust.  Not in some sort of abstract way like today, &quot;gosh, there are a lot of nuclear weapons, I hope no rouges get ahold of them etc...&quot; but more like, &quot;this shit is going down, and it&#39;s going down tomorrow!&quot;</p>

<p>Every 10 years or so there is a contagious virus that is going to kill scores of millions of us that turns out to not be so contagious or even deadly.</p>

<p>Every generation becomes convinced at some point that their government, media &amp; corporations have become especially corrupt relative to history when in fact they are only as corrupt &amp; vile as they&#39;ve ever been (not to excuse them of course).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying, &quot;relax, don&#39;t worry&quot;.  We should be vigilant to expose lies and corruption and so on.  However what I would say is that shit&#39;s always been fucked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why i planned on escaping society for the last 5+ years.  We&#39;re moving far away from people.  The county we&#39;re moving to only has 7000 people.  On friday our current house will be sold and we will have no debt and 7 figures in the bank.  We&#39;re going to use that cash to invest in a lot of long term items that we will use to farm and stuff like that and ensure we can grow food and have water to drink if/when the shit goes down.  </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right.  both of my grandfathers worked their asses off, retired and were dead within 5 years.  No thanks.  Life for me isn&#39;t sitting in a cubicle and stressing out about shit that doesn&#39;t matter.  I&#39;d rather grow my own food an basically live off of the land and not worry if i can afford to retire and live in the middle of a city.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are culminations happening on much higher levels than anyone is willing to admit on mainstream media and such; as such, ideas that talk of any sort of human evolution are laughed off. On cosmological levels, we are nearing the renewal of many cycles in our universe. We know for a fact that our galaxy is in a different position now relative to the central star of our universe compared to the last time this cycle was renewed. We have NO IDEA if this means something will happen or nothing will happen. </p>

<p>Here is what we do know: evolution works in waves, not a linear incline. If you look back on the way that evolution is tracked back through history, you actually see short periods of immense change followed by long periods of stagnant growth. The evolutional stages have been getting shorter and shorter over time; this references well with the idea of our exponential technology curve and the idea of the singularity. </p>

<p>It may well be that we are heading head first into the next stage of human evolution as we start to interface our technology and biology together to really start to bend the rules of reality. This is where suddenly ideas need to be elevated; ethics, morals, and things of a spiritual nature are going to become very important to us all, purely for the reason that we are going to be so very capable as creators if we choose. Can any of us really even imagine a world 50 years from now?</p>

<p>I honestly believe we&#39;re gonna pull this out. I feel we&#39;re ready for change; I feel people are giving up on the system as it is. All that is needed is another option to be presented. We need to get back to valuing human capital and ecology as our sustainability and investment into our future. We have to use money as a tool to set ourselves free rather than as a way to keep ourselves shackled. I think (i don&#39;t know) we will be given a different option by the end of this year. It will be up to us as a collective whole to take it tho. I think as much as there are bad people in this world, there are also good that are looking out for us. It always goes both ways. </p>

<p>As an amateur space and astronomy and astrophysics nerd, can you please explain what you meant here? There is no cycle to the universe, it is not revolving, it has no &quot;central star&quot; that I&#39;m familiar with, and it&#39;s simply expanding and accelerating in expansion, and has been from the start of the big bang.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just curious what you mean because you said &quot;we know for a FACT that our galaxy is in a different position now relative to the central star of our universe&quot;. But there is no central star that I&#39;ve ever heard of, and there is no universe cycle, and our galaxy is <em>never</em> in the same place twice. Everything is expanding away from a central point, but to my knowledge we don&#39;t exactly know where that point is, and it&#39;s certainly not a &quot;central star&quot;. There are rotational cycles to our galaxy, but not to our universe, everything is simply expanding. Our galaxy is traveling through the universe in the same direction it always has.</p>

<p>So, just curious if you could enlighten me to what you were talking about in that part of your comment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. You are correct; I was referring to the central star of our galaxy, not universe. My bad completely.</p>

<p>Specifically, I am speaking of the precession of the equinoxes, which is a wobble in the earth&#39;s rotational axis that cycles every 25,9xx or so years (can&#39;t remember the exact number off-hand). If you trace back this certain cycle in history, you can see that 25-26 thousand years ago, the neanderthals thereabouts disappeared from the earth and going back 50-52 thousand years, we see a huge outbreak in the first signs of fine tools, culture, and religion from the earliest hunter-gatherers. My point is that this cycle <em>could</em> have something to do with an evolution shift in humanity. David Wilcock has done a tonne of research into this in his book I just finished <em>The Source Field Investigations</em>, which I would recommend wholeheartedly. Very interesting research in that book, even if it might not be considered mainstream thinking. </p>

<p>I am not here to teach but also to learn! thank you for catching me on that detail. If I am butchering anything else, feel free to correct me :P</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>He said central star of the <em>universe</em> and was talking about the cycle of the universe, not galaxy. Also a black hole really isn&#39;t classified as a star, it&#39;s a black hole. Also, black hole or central star, what affect does that have on us here way out in the Sagittarius arm of the milky way galaxy? What does it have to do with humanity here on Earth? It just seemed to me he was spouting some pseudo science stuff like I&#39;ve seen in Zeitgeist and similar movies.</p>

<p>I acknowledged everything you just said in my comment, and was asking him to clarify. Our galaxy is on a 225 million year cycle sure, and that is how long it takes for a full revolution. It&#39;s happened plenty of times in the Earths 4.6~ billion years of existence. The <em>universe</em> however is not cyclical, and that is what he kept referring to, the universe and it&#39;s central star.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m open minded and a skeptic, so I&#39;d just like to see where he is getting this stuff from. It just happens I&#39;m a huge space nerd so when people throw this stuff around into conspiracies it makes me want to ask questions or see a source.</p>

<p>Glad you can tell that about a stranger from text over the internet. You should be a psychologist. Also, it&#39;s funny, that guy you are defending edited his post and changed everything I was replying to without leaving an edit. The entire context of his post is different now.</p>

<p>What was I incorrect about? The guy I originally replied to was the one spouting off babble and incorrect nonsense and confusing terms within our universe. I&#39;m talking about the person I originally replied to, no SOL-arSentient. I wasn&#39;t talking about impending doom, I was questioning the guy talking about impending doom.</p>

<p>Not complaining, was honestly saying I think me and SOL-arSentient are on the same page, and that the original commenter was the one who was all confused.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nice insult. Why don&#39;t you follow up with some &quot;I could beat you up in real life&quot; or perhaps the old stand by &quot;Have you ever been laid?&quot; I like how you replied to point out I was complaining... by complaining <em>and</em> insulting me. You are clearly far less sensitive than me, and clearly the bigger person here...</p>

<p>If that is true then, and I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t be, then it should be obvious that I didn&#39;t know that. The implication you are making is that what he said - words that we now can&#39;t see - was correctly bad enough to complain about.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I admitted my mistake a long time ago (i meant galaxy, and I WAS referring to the (unproven) concept that we have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy as well). I did say our galaxy was in a different position in the relative universe and was moving, and here is what I found from CalTech&#39;s &quot;Ask an Astronomer for Kid&#39;s&quot; section:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Do galaxies move?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, galaxies do move. They both rotate and move through space. Galaxies rotate around their centers with the sections of the galaxy that are farther out from the galaxy&#39;s center rotating more slowly than the material closer to the center. Galaxies are also moving away from each other due to the expansion of the universe brought on by the Big Bang. A galaxy which is part of a group of galaxies, called a cluster, also rotates around the center of mass of the cluster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my point was correct - I just described it in a poor fashion.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the other thing: WE DONT ACTUALLY KNOW FOR CERTAIN THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS SHIT!!!</p>

<p>We have all sorts of theories on how space works and galaxies work, but at the end of the day, if we find out we&#39;ve made one mistake along the way, we could be completely wrong. So why is it that you feel the need to hammer on everyone about stuff that we <strong>think</strong> we know, but we really don&#39;t. None of us have been to the center of the universe, nor has NASA. We&#39;re only taking educated guesses; none of us have proof. We know there <strong>may</strong> be a supermassive black hole at the center of the universe, but it&#39;s only a theory.</p>

<p>I think the others here have stuck up for me and I thank them for that. You are just someone who likes to preach your (half-true) knowledge to everyone as if you <strong>KNOW</strong>. The only thing I know is that I do not know. Check yourself; there are ways of imparting knowledge and correcting others without trying to take a bite out of them at the same time. People will like you more. Try it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you can tell me, without a single doubt in your mind, that there is no supermassive black hole at the center of the universe? Or can you tell me that is absolutely not true?</p>

<p>The smartest astrologers at NASA call these things &quot;theories&quot; for a reason; we are only making educated guesses. That is not a slam against them; it&#39;s a description of what we actually do. We educate ourselves as best we can, and then we make predictions and try to prove them. Unless they are proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, we call the <strong>THEORIES</strong> and not proofs. Most astrology is theory because frankly we can&#39;t easily shoot over to another galaxy and test our predictions. I&#39;m not making shit up; this stuff is very very complex and it&#39;s filled with more theories than proofs. We need to accept and understand this.</p>

<p>Now, tell me what is true and what is not when it comes to the mechanics of the universe. You seem to think this is easily acquired knowledge. Inform me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh. Okay, here&#39;s the &quot;bullshit&quot; as you call it:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession">Precessional Cycle</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the precession of the equinoxes or precession of the equator. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years, during which the positions of stars as measured in the equatorial coordinate system will slowly change; the change is due to the change of the coordinates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be the line of thinking to it, but I think we ultimately need to attack this from the top down. It has to start from the highest levels of organisation (government, military, etc.) We don&#39;t need to completely upset everything; most of our policies to build up the 3rd world have been suppressed and squandered. If we just allowed these programs to reopen themselves and run transparently and properly, we could go pretty far without even rewriting the rules. </p>

<p>It will all play out over the next few months. Those on top aren&#39;t going down easily, but they will go down. Since 2008, BRICS hasn&#39;t been playing nice anymore. It will be on their backs that we see this change; the challenge for us in the first world will be accepting the fact that the 3rd world will probably come first. There are 3-4 billion people in the BRICS countries that need sustainable solutions for the future, and we&#39;ve shown that it will not happen as long as the Western powers are in charge. Change has to come; we just need to stay positive and find a way to land on our feet. </p>

<p>Sorry - explain this to me? I haven&#39;t been keeping score. Where did I commit such atrocities again? I duffed the central star thing (forgot the theory is that it&#39;s a supermassive black hole), and I meant that our galaxy is moving into new areas of space and may be entering new zones of influence at different points.</p>

<p>I am not infallible, nor have I claimed to be. If I were admitting a thesis, I would triple check my work. That being said, we&#39;re on an internet message board of sorts. Are you perfect?</p>

<p>As far as the &#39;spiritual&#39; slant, let me ask you something: Do you think it is impossible that there be a spiritual element to power? Do you think it is impossible that the spiritual element (i&#39;m not talking religion here) could play a part into the thought process and reasoning of the people who seem to run the world? We have to battle both sides of religion, as well as unite our religions in order to destroy them eventually, but that will come once we start to actually try to eradicate strife on the planet. At this junction, religion is used to provoke it, so in that sense I agree with your sentiment. </p>

<p>The truth is that many of the characters that find themselves in conspiracies tend to have more money than both you and I could imagine. They don&#39;t need money; they print money as it is. What then do they want?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>IMHO, most conspiracy that has any merit has a money issue at it&#39;s core.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with you, but I think it&#39;s all tied together. Money is the new master that was created after slavery was kicked to the curb. That being said, why do you slam the spiritual aspect of our evolution, especially as ethics becomes more and more important as our technological and practical abilities expand?</p>

<p>Basically, instead of veiled criticism about me actually factoring in everything (and not just money), why can&#39;t you open your mind enough to include rather than exclude? Rather than one of us being right, what if both of us are right? </p>

<p>There is a spiritual aspect to life. You may not believe or feel so, but there also may be reasons for that. Your reality is your truth; I&#39;m not here to take anything away from you. Take what resonates and leave what doesn&#39;t. There are those who are convinced otherwise out there; some follow Jesus and others follow avatars much more sinister. We have to face this truth, even if we disagree with it ourselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with you 100%. I feel all the sensational crap is there purely as a distraction as well. I am more speaking to the fact that you even mention the Zionist element to it; there are dark societies making these plans you speak of, and there is a very good chance they have a spiritual or religious element to them. Take the whole Fortune 500 CEO and psychopath correlation everyone likes to bring up; what if most of them are not psychopathic by anything but spiritual choice? 100% selfish in every way by decision. If we don&#39;t try to understand how these people think, we misunderstand their motives and their eventual goals and we fall victim to them.</p>

Also, religion&#39;s rights have been one of the main reasons society is in the mess we are in. All of the fundamental christians in the USA have been indoctrinated and brainwashed to see the jew as a superior race ... the chosen ones.

<p>The last two world wars had a lot to do with jews and their death grip on the economy. The Federal Reserve is run by Ben &quot;Shalom&quot; Bernanke (yes, that&#39;s his name) and this agency answers to no one (except the B.I.S.).   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah - but you&#39;re not reading between the lines!</p>

<p>I come from a very similar situation. I am Canadian (with US citizenship) as well, and I personally have no place to complain outside of some extended family going through tough times. I, too, have a child that has pushed me into thinking more as a whole than selfishly as an individual. I  believe the Rothschild&#39;s are in the midst of their fall; and the proof is out there in the open if you know where to look.</p>

<p>First, the IMF has no money. This is the first clue. The way that the IMF is set up, they are supposed to be the lender of last resort. The fact that they have no money to give out speaks volumes about their position in the larger arena of world finance.</p>

<p>Second, take a look at the Baltic Dry Index, which follows the rates of shipping worldwide. This is one of the few indexes that the BIS cannot interfere with; since 2008, this index has been in freefall. The reason for this is that since 2008, the BRICS countries have been fighting back - and they&#39;re going to win.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the only thing you are not factoring in is that before the rise of the Western powers that we are so familiar with now, there were eastern powers that had existed for much longer before. These eastern powers have been laying low and providing much of the investment capital for the developing world. They are now finished and are ready to move on and upset the apple cart, so to say. The western bankers did not keep their promises; now they will have their comeuppance.</p>

<p>I think the key for us in the first world will be understanding that we need to lift the rest of the world up before we fix anything. We can&#39;t make this movement about getting new Ipads. We need to fix the root problems and we need to set people free. Thanks for the back and forth; I felt you were fair with me. Take care. I wish and hope the best for your family.</p>

Greed and power are motive enough and can actually be explained through evolution. We are all competing for survival so in the end the person who has the most and controls the most is most likely to survive, and that concept has been in our head forever.
If a 26,000 year cyce is what&#39;s going to cause us to all get wiped out or take the &#39;next step&#39; of evolution then why discuss it? With no comparison in our history there isn&#39;t much we can do about it.</p>

Money is clearly not the end goal as the banking cabal already has access to unlimited funds through their central banks. They are going for a higher-hanging fruit than money; until you factor in the spiritual aspect, their motives don&#39;t make too much sense.</p>

<p>My feeling is that these people take power from people freely choosing to rely and to depend on them. All of us run to money to fix all our problems; we ask it to set us free yet it enslaves us instead. The fact that we choose this for ourselves means they do not feel bad or morally unjust in their actions. They are merely providing us with a choice which we are happy to take; why should we be upset???</p>

<p>In practical terms, you are right. Spirituality has nothing to do with our global financial system. That being said, we don&#39;t exactly know to what degree spirituality plays in the lives of those who are most powerful in this world. If you feel it is &quot;too much&quot;, that is your choice.

    <div class="md"><p>Could it be that you think you feel it more strongly now because youve felt it more recently?</p>

<p>Example : I broke a leg 5 years ago. It was NOTHING compared to the pain caused by the identical break in the other leg last week. </p>

<p>Theres been studies that I think are relevant about pain and memory. It turns out (for burn victims) that its better to just rip the bandage off than slowly removing it while trying to cause no pain. It has something to do with how memories are encoded when they involve pain.</p>

<p>All Im saying is that all you thinking that the feeling is stronger recently, perhaps this is why.</p>

The guy who sells cars is still going to want to sell cars to make money and someone is going to want to buy a car.  It&#39;s not going to go mad max.

<p>Which is great because there is no limit to food and oil. There is a tectonic bomb right there in what you said. 2 billion people in China and India and Brasil demanding lifestyles resplendent in oil and meat and absolutely no way to make that happen unless something gives.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s going to give? The idea that there is something that can maintain lifestyles on diminishing supplies of oil is ludicrous. We can live without cheap oil but only by massive central planning, low wages, low profit. I can&#39;t see any of that happening without a massive crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to agree with this view, especially if you wake up every day and go and visit so called &quot;conspiracy&quot; websites. Not saying any view on the websites is wrong or believing them is stupid, but when you immerse yourself in a culture that constantly thinks shit is about to hit the fan, of course you are going to feel that way. If you were living off in a cabin in BFE with no link to the outside word you likely wouldnt be feeling the same anxiety.</p>

<p>Im not very smart so take my advice for what its worth, but if you are feeling an anxiety that is overwhelming the rest of your life it might be time to take a step back and let others fight the good fight until you are in a better head space. Its happening to my brother right now, he has adopted the attitude that &quot;shit is about to hit the fan anyway so why bother doing anything.&quot; Its no way to live.</p>

<p>We did not &quot;take over&quot; Libya.  We may have sent a few missiles, but if you&#39;re implying that&#39;s anything close to Iraq or Afghanistan, you&#39;re way off.  How many boots did we have on the ground there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our politicians don&#39;t care if it&#39;s popular or costs the public money. They are lobbied into these wars so aren&#39;t working for the average person. Look at the companies who profited off Iraq, these same companies profit regardless of the cost to the country. </p>

<p>They did take over libya, it almost cost the US 1 billion and the &quot;rebels&quot; could never have done it alone. It&#39;s not about boots on the ground, the point is the military industrial complex profits off wars however they are fought be it with drones, jets or actual troops so there&#39;s always an incentive. All those weapons need paying for and public discontent hasn&#39;t stopped a thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greece will default.  It&#39;s obvious enough that it will, and the organizing of this default is currently under way.  The way over leveraged European banks will likely not be able to convince the smart money to stay in Europe during the fallout (some has already started leaving), much of it will flee to safer havens which will exacerbate the situation enough to crash the Eurozone worse than the us in 2008.  This will cause a bit of the ol&#39; chaos, and that&#39;s when you can look forward for this something to jump off.  The central banks will be forced into complete collusion, and they will have it since the world will be begging &#39;just make things sane again&#39;.  Having just &#39;learned&#39; the lessons of Greece, they will demand some safeguards be put in place/concessions be made...</p>

<p>that&#39;s my guess.</p>

<p>I have my doubts on this Iran war business.  The PR campaign is failing and it just isn&#39;t worth it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greece?!?! The entire Western Financial system is on the verge of collapse. The dollar will no longer be the worlds reserve currency by the end of the year. 9/11 was a fraud to destroy evidence of the largest ponzi scheme the world has ever known, and throw the world into chaos. It really was a last ditch effort to keep the current system alive. alas, it is on it&#39;s last legs, and it&#39;s been a long time since the world was in such a unpredictable, and potentially dire situation <em>for us all</em>.</p>

<p>There is a small cabal of men whom you could say are the true leaders of the Western World. The Oligarchs (Free Mason/Illuminati). They are scrambling to keep the dam from bursting, and nothing they are doing is working, only delaying the inevitable crash. They are outnumbered one million to one, and they are scared (just US citizens). They have an enormous army of brainwashed men and women (like the one reading this) in place to protect the criminal cabal at all costs. They still think they are working on the side of good, but they know in their hearts that it is The People of this nation whom need protected. They know their agencies and employers have gone too far, and they are looking for a way out.</p>

<p>&quot;If they knew what we had done, they&#39;d string us up from the lamp posts&quot; GWB</p>

Even the escalation of tension between Iran and Israel seems like it will probably fizzle out.  Israel isn&#39;t likely to get support from allies who want no part of disturbing the flow of oil through the strait of Hormuz, so it will bide its time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The patriot act, the NDAA 2012, the TSA, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, the media is now controlled by roughly 6 conglomerates who also have major ownership of the military industrial complex who also buy politicians, ALEC, widespread election fraud, electronic voting machines, the devaluation of the dollar, the impending fall of the euro and the dollar, inflation, the war with Iran for israel, russia and china siding with iran, free speech zones, beating protesters, waging PR war against protesters, the frailty of the oil supply whether from peak oil, war with iran, or inflation, numerous false flag operations, the CIA working with the NYPD, local police forces working with the military on US soil, attitudes of people like Lamar Smith, SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, and even though they may fail they will be attempted again, the interests in this country with money are controlling the lawmakers, stop and frisk policing, needing to carry papers, no knock warrants, warrantless wiretapping, facebook, google, multi-million dollar spying campaigns on social media, social manipulation teams, see something say something and on and on and on and on.  </p>

<p>That is why this is obvious to those of us who pay attention to shit.  It&#39;s not theories, it&#39;s conspiracy fact of the grandest kind.  And it&#39;s too big for us to get a real firm grasp on, that&#39;s why we say &quot;something will happen&quot; and don&#39;t know exactly what.  It&#39;s hard to know what the entire puzzle makes when we have only put together a few pieces, but see most of them on the table.   </p>

<p>Also, the intense media campaign against Ron Paul.  If he&#39;s not right and not popular why fight against, defame, and ignore people like him?  Also, we havent heard SHIT from any militia&#39;s for at least a decade.  You think that&#39;s just a coincidence? They are already training people to farm and to fight in rotating cycles around the country.  They send you to a farm, they send you to a camp, then they send you home to recruit people that you trust.  </p>

<p>Edit, also Israel has the support of the only allies that matter.  The US and in turn the UK, Canada, and Australia.  That&#39;s all they need if they needed anyone, which I dont think they do.  They have over 200 nukes, a huge, high tech army we provided and they trained and staffed with compulsory service, and they have a deep religious hatred for anything un-jew.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, they had the civil war, the great depression, WWII, the Vietnam era, and now we have this.  The pinnacle of endless warfare, unsustainable spending, and more war without the consent of the people.  What makes this all seem more imminent is the frequency with which our rights are being stripped.  The Bill of Rights is nearly dead, the likes of which we have never seen short of during the heat of the civil war. We think it is imminent because of 30k drones ordered in the next ten years for US soil, the militarization of the police, soldiers being surveyed as to whether they would shoot civilians in the act of disarming us, civilian defense forces training in the US (around 200k) at the order of obama, police forces with tank-like vehicles, the TSA expanding from just airports to roads, bus depots, train stations, and morphing into VIPR squads and more.  </p>

<p>The CIA was forbidden from working on US soil yet they now work in concert with police forces around the nation.  The military WAS forbidden from operations on US soil until the new NDAA and previous to that they were deploying drones at the request of police.  These are all things that havent happened before and are happening on a daily basis.  </p>

<p>Put that together with an unprecedented amount of blatant political corruption with little to no consequence and that is why I, myself, feel it will happen sooner rather than later.  I sure hope it doesnt but all signs point to imminence.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In regard to the edit of your first comment, it was my understanding that we told Israel we would not support them in a preemptive strike against Iran, and that seemed to be the general consensus among the other allies.  Obviously, the rhetoric from the republican primaries has a much different tone, but I don&#39;t think that reflects the position of the Obama administration.  Unless, of course, we had solid evidence of Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions.</p>

<p>I am equally concerned about the erosion of our civil liberties and the escalation of domestic intelligence gathering.  Especially when you consider how much easier it is to strip rights away than restore them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think the reason the media pushes certain ideas, called keywords or talking points, is that having enough people thinking something will happen, causes that event to happen. </p>

<p>As in if enough of us believe something, we create it as reality subconsciously. That is why predictions usually aren&#39;t able to be given an exact date. It also explains why current events are shaping up to look like the book of revelations IMO. People believe that stuff as future fact, and it plays right into the desire of world dominators. This requires belief in the supernatural of course, but not the religious version. </p>

<p>Oh boy, I wonder what it&#39;s going to be... I&#39;ve always been a fan of eugenics, but I still think we don&#39;t know enough about genetics to do it properly. Plus I still think people are really racist and would just end up killing dark-skinned people. Anyways, I&#39;m an even bigger fan of the flu and disease! I hope every Thanksgiving when American&#39;s are busy shopping and stuffing their fat faces every person in China is outside coughing into the air that way when the flu comes over in the winter it will be so goddamn strong that all the weak and old people will die!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t be sad guys! You&#39;re not that special. I mean the only thing that makes you special is that you consider yourself special. In the big picture that&#39;s not a big deal. Depopulation is a sign that someone somewhere is controlling things and that humanity is moving in the right direction. Don&#39;t worry, be happy with what you have, and when the time comes you&#39;ll know whether what you had was enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion itself is a product of evolution. Through natural selection only religions that contain successful traits are preserved. Societies that have inferior religions are simply destroyed by their competitors. The reason why Christianity and Islam have been so successful is because they allowed society to organize better than the pre-religious pagan counterparts. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that most religions ban usury for example. We are witnessing today how our society is self cannibalizing itself due to the financial industry. </p>

<p>he hasn&#39;t been back in 2,000 years because God has a plan. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Tares">This is a pretty good explanation for the timespan itself.</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but the rest of what you propose is just occult, confused nonsense. You are no match for any spirit being.

    <div class="md"><p>you say it is evil to place one&#39;s own ideas above those of another. I generally agree, as I think this is diminutive and belittling, but I also believe that, in many cases, right and wrong exist objectively, independent of perspective. Let&#39;s use an extreme example just to illustrate what I mean: say I believed murder or pedophilia were acceptable. Are you at fault for finding error in my ways? Are you at fault for attributing negative value to my ways, or meaning to argue against my ways? Because, in this example, I feel it is <em>negligent</em> to be permissive.

They had decades to prepare the population for the coming oil crisis, but instead they chose to oblige the Wall St bankers and their addiction to usury and easy money. I think they will push the US into another war to prevent the population from turning against them.</p>

But the point is the world will keep spinning no matter what we do, all we can hope to achieve is peace of mind for ourselves and take care of those around us.</p>

<p>Having said that it doesnt change the fact we are facing huge challenges now and in the very near future,<strong>new challenges</strong>.</p>

<p>What annoys me is ignorance in some of the youth and the idea in some of the old that we maybe dont know enough history to put things into context.
The massive and very long lasting damage a world war could do now makes WW2 look like a party that got out of hand.</p>

<p>More people=more environmental destruction.<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16861468">Theres another hole in the ozone layer now have you seen?</a></p>

<p>The farce that is the monetary system is falling apart.</p>

<p>There is a massive change coming my friends but sadly there is no time to educate everyone so we could deal with it the easy way(besides the fact the ruling elite crush any chance we have as they struggle to mantain a broken system that supports and rewards their psychopathic type)</p>

<p>The change we want will only come after the inevitable collapse of this ridiculous system we live in and its going to be painful.

<p>Maybe this is what&#39;s causing the changes. As people have more access to information they see the moral decay in the higher levels of power, and they demand a better replacement. The crackdown is simply that power fighting back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that we just went it a near depression, and the dollar only slipped a bit. Stayed comparable to other currencies enough not to be replaced as the standard, and is now rising again with the quickly improving economy. Almost every single macro-economic indicator is leaning towards strong dollar recovery in the next few years. And if housing recovers, a likely boom period. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re one of those people who thinks that the debt is dragging down the dollar, then you really should learn about macro-economics. Not only do we also hold debt from some of the same countries that hold ours, but those countries profit greatly from it, and have absolutely zero incentive to stop holding the debt.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of really confused Americans. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just ignorance, or fear mongering. Possibly both. But the rumors of Americans demise are greatly exaggerated.</p>

Illegal and legal foreclosures at an all time high, 50 million people on the streets, health care costs rising, cost of gas and fuel oil setting records, food prices rising, yeah we have it made all right.  Fucking right we do.  Entire industries have vanished overseas, GM will be the next to disappear.  Detroit is a fucking warzone now.  I was just there for business and everyone said &quot;airport, hotel, work, hotel, airport.  Dont even try to go out and eat.&quot;  </p>

<p>Most of us dont believe even for a second that the reports coming from the financial sector are even close to reality because we see backdoor zero interest loans being pumped out of the fed and into other countries.  There is an extraction of US wealth going on and we are all becoming poorer for it.  How much do you think war with Iran is going to cost us?</p>

<p>Do you think we will see the same spend and destroy accountability that has haliburton and kbr destroying $100k+ vehicles rather than change oil or a tire?  Or see a few billion in cash go missing here and there with zero accountability? War with Iran is gonna cost a fuckton more than Iraq, that&#39;s for sure.  </p>

I&#39;m actually quite convinced of it because IMF/World bank can easily print international currency that can replace Us dollar.  If that actually happens It will be a catastrophic event for a lot of American citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sense an economic controlled demolition which will be used to justify a global debt based currency.  The currency would effectively lock in the power of those that already use the scam in a more dispersed way, through privately owned central banks.  Nobody will be able to escape their financial tyranny.  We could stop them if we&#39;d care enough to try to understand the commodity that effectively governs our time and effort, money.  It can&#39;t be created without giving someone free economic value.  Right now, and in a world debt based currency, the few economic elites that own the central banks create free money and exchange it for sovereign debt, interest bearing bonds to be paid back by the people via taxation.  </p>

<p>They get free money and our unending dependency, because they never create money without a corresponding debt.  The money to pay off the interest is not created, instead more debt is issued each year and some of it goes to pay off the interest from previous debt.  As resources dwindle, prices rise, and debts come due, the currency flowing in the economy is reduced, the music stops, assets are taken away as collateral for debts, and other assets are bought for pennies on the dollar by those that hoarded all the money.  </p>

<p>It should be clear to many here that money subverts governance and individual morality.  This is a system for total control.  We need to demand that the gains from creating money go to the people by allowing our governments the power to create debt free currency.  Otherwise we will become slaves to those that create money out of nothing, for us to shed blood, sweat and tears to acquire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are ten men, now, who own the planet. they&#39;ve been around since the notion of banks and money as an exchange occured. imagine people who love money so much realizing that one day they will die and all they worked for would dissapate. Now imagine them planning, decade after decaded, millineum after milleneum, succesor to hand picked succesor, to make the loss of their fortunes NOT happen, and actually for them to expand their power slowly with the goal of owning &quot;all there is to own&quot; at some point in the future. </p>

<p>thousands of years later, they own the planet. their fronts are corporations and lawyers and national governments and insurance companies and henchmen and... well, it takes a cast of thousands to run a planet...</p>

<p>it boggles my mind when i see another part of the their plan fall into place - it happens all the time. TV was HUGE boon to their overall plan. the slow homoginzation of the planet? not by accident. you say crime rate is going down? you betcha! prtests break out all across north africa and the middle east... accident? not hardly. oil. us government storms into the wrong country looking for... ? bin laden? you mean the mythical figure who claimed his group had nothing to do with 9-11 the day after? yeah, if you saw that broadcast you&#39;ll know it only happened once. when is the last time a terorist group did something of that magnitude and wouldn&#39;t claim it? that&#39;s right... never.</p>

<p>and it&#39;s neat when something goes wrong with their plan, how they can put &quot;plan b&#39; into play without missing a blink. but remember, as time goes on, and with enough behind the scenes manipulation, the plan doesn&#39;t derail much.</p>

<p>problem is, one of then is crazy... batshit insane. he&#39;s holding up well to all appearances, but absolutely fucking crazy. He also has, in his control, several of the bio labs that DON&#39;T make (because it&#39;s illegal, silly) biological weapons. He has the cure and he has the mindset that we&#39;re (all us ant-like peons) using up all HIS resources (the same ones he&#39;s packaged and sold us for the last two thousand years)(yeah, this has been going on since pharoe&#39;s time, maybe a bit longer).</p>

<p>he&#39;s tired of us using up all &quot;his&quot; resources and soon, there will be a &quot;terrorist&quot; attack using bio weapons that should, by all estimates, remove about 95% of the population.</p>

<p>i know, i know... i&#39;m the product of an &quot;overactive imaginiation&quot;. that&#39;s me! one of those silly conspiracy theory clowns calling september eleventh, jfk assassination, the coining of the fed... things that really happened and that we (all us peons) should take note and possibly come up with a plan of action to save our raggedy asses... i also realize that no counter attack is goind to happen. as soon as someone starts calling all you weenies &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and throws a few of you in jail, well, that&#39;s the end of THAT program, huh?</p>

<p>ah well. been nice knowing you. by the way, it&#39;s just on the horizon. it&#39;s only a matter of time before ... mr. bio ... cracks and looses the dogs.</p>

<p>in the meantime, we have sister against brother, religion against religion, man against woman, country against country, currency against currency... because as it was said oh so long ago, &quot;it is from this universal tension that the magician draws his power&quot;.</p>

<p>it&#39;s been nice knowing some of you... ta ta</p>

I understand and realize much better now that the (hidden) 1% that control the rest of the 99 control and manipulate a <em>lot</em> of the planet, and they make it a top priority to make sure that there is a constant state of fear and anxiety amongst the population.  This keeps them (us) on edge and much easier to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the euro will survive in a different form in a northern European currency union. The southern countries may be kicked out. The bigger question is if the dollar will retain its position as the world reserve currency. If China and Russia give up their US treasuries, and the OPEC countries stop selling their oil exclusively in dollars, then the greenback will sink like a brick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you underestimate just what France will be prepared to do to keep the euro afloat. The French and Germans will fight tooth and nail for the Euro to exist, while the UK will want no part of any tightening of euro rules and will object to the EU being used for any extra rules being put through. This already happened with Cameron and Sarkozy last year. Greece is being artificially dragged through the mud because they&#39;re not being allowed to leave the Euro, revert to drachma and devalue their currency. Instead they&#39;re being pushed into death by a thousand cuts. Now this isn&#39;t bad for the rest of Europe, and many Germans would expect nothing less than austerity for a country that is the poster child of the Euro mess.</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s one small problem. Contagion. Should Italy, Portugal or Spain go down the same path (and to all extents and purposes they all are to different degrees and at different speeds) then the Euro itself cannot bail out all of the countries involved. This means that instead of a default on a Eurozone country, the entire Euro goes into default. There are countries for which this is partially in their interest, for example, Russia as it allows them to buy up assets from former soviet bloc countries and those of strategic interest (as we&#39;re seeing in Greece now).</p>

<p>An energy shock is both good for Russia in terms of revenues and good in terms of the pain it&#39;ll cause the Eurozone. This is almost a certainty given the current posturing by Iran. Once that shock hits, the energy costs of the pigs will shoot up through the roof and they won&#39;t be able to afford it.</p>

It&#39;s always the same whenever we have a prophetic year -- the year 1000, the year 1666, the year 2000, the Y2K scare. It always comes to nothing.

    <div class="md"><p>So you can tell me, without a single doubt in your mind, that there is no supermassive black hole at the center of the universe? Or can you tell me that is absolutely not true?</p>

<p>The smartest astrologers at NASA call these things &quot;theories&quot; for a reason; we are only making educated guesses. That is not a slam against them; it&#39;s a description of what we actually do. We educate ourselves as best we can, and then we make predictions and try to prove them. Unless they are proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, we call the <strong>THEORIES</strong> and not proofs. Most astrology is theory because frankly we can&#39;t easily shoot over to another galaxy and test our predictions. I&#39;m not making shit up; this stuff is very very complex and it&#39;s filled with more theories than proofs. We need to accept and understand this.</p>

<p>Now, tell me what is true and what is not when it comes to the mechanics of the universe. You seem to think this is easily acquired knowledge. Inform me.</p>

<p>... i&#39;m waiting....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh. Okay, here&#39;s the &quot;bullshit&quot; as you call it:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession">Precessional Cycle</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the precession of the equinoxes or precession of the equator. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years, during which the positions of stars as measured in the equatorial coordinate system will slowly change; the change is due to the change of the coordinates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shall I continue? What else do you deem &#39;bullshit&#39;? Do you realize how ignorant that is to say that only an academic professional can hold truth on any single subject? You don&#39;t think information readily exists by those who have dedicated their lives to these subjects? Why can&#39;t I learn from them?</p>
