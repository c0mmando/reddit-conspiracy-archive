<p>Just check out those two sites. If you still have doubts about the reality of the manipulation of dialogue on the internet please post here. </p>

<p>Also, if you have any more information, please post it in the comments. I don&#39;t think this is covered enough and often when people bring it up they are treated as paranoid or deluded (even I have been guilty of defaulting to that reaction at times). </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to bring some more attention to this issue and the fact that it is, in reality, a massive business. I might do a podcast on this or maybe devote some of next week&#39;s radio show to it. It&#39;s very important to be able to prove these kinds of things because indeed it does seem like fiction, but as the old adage goes, reality really is stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>Edit: does anyone else find their .org TLD somewhat ironic?</p>

<p>&quot;In 2010, the Basij focused significant attention on combating perceived threats to the regime from the Internet. Thousands of members were educated in blogging and filtering of dissident websites, Basij officials acknowledged.&quot; -<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/10/iran-primer-the-basij-resistance-force.html#ixzz1Go4AW26i">source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend using this site as a redirect: <a href="http://anonym.to/">http://anonym.to/</a> so they don&#39;t catch on to what demographic is becoming aware of them.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://anonym.to/?http://www.advantageconsultants.org/blog.jpg">http://anonym.to/?http://www.advantageconsultants.org/blog.jpg</a></li>
<li><a href="http://anonym.to/?http://www.advantageconsultants.org/">http://anonym.to/?http://www.advantageconsultants.org/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>edit: i suppose using an anonymizing redirect site would give some indication of the demographic, but it at least would not direct them outright to r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have that wrong. There is way more false activity regarding how popular the other guys are. Ron Paul is the real deal and the people know it. He gets more campaign money from individuals in the military and from civilians than the other candidates together. The other candidates get money from big banks and multinational corporations. The people give their hard earned money to get Ron Paul elected. His voting record and personal behavior for YEARS show clearly that he has character, intelligence and high standards for himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea. Also, the ones who discuss tend to be more informed and a little more reasonable. Many of them are LDS people along the Western US side, too. Maybe it&#39;s just the type of people I gravitate towards? However I&#39;ve watched them put out some very level headed commentary that has garnered interest from others they know. They represent Paul well compared to how stupid the other cheerleaders tend to be.</p>
