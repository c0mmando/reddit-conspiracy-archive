        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My seething contempt is for those who make this difficult.</p>

<p>So, here are my accusations and requests (which I hope is balanced):</p>

<hr/>

<p>To Ijob911, Occidentalist, bumblingmumbling, and friends: You are sometimes (often?) inciteful. Please tone down your rhetoric so that we can have informed discussions.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To those of you who rise up defensively at any mention of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Israel/Zionism</p></li>
<li><p>The Rothschilds and Rockefellers</p></li>
<li><p>The Federal Reserve, IMF, Central Banks, etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>... you&#39;ll have to kill me in order to silence me on these matters.</p>

<hr/>

<p>To all of you engaging in this ongoing &quot;tit for tat&quot;:</p>

<p><strong><em>STOP IT</em></strong> </p>

<p>You are <strong>all</strong> participating in conflagration. It is unproductive. It reflects badly upon <strong>YOU</strong>,... not me... not this subreddit... and not reddit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;m not perfect, but I want to learn about and discuss conspiracies, including but not limited to the ones mentioned above. But those of you who conflagrate these discussions (on <strong>both</strong> sides) are preventing productive inquiry and discussion.</p>

<hr/>

<p>And, finally, start posting more stuff about the ongoing suppression of knowledge and information, preferably without smearing <a href="http://jewsagainstzionism.com/">The Jews</a>, because they&#39;re not all guilty of nefarious plotting.</p>

<p>My personal favorite (for those of you who can rise above all of this and see the Big Picture<sup>TM</sup> ) is: The scientific establishment is lying to us about the history of the world. They know more about the pyramids than they let on. And, they might be suppressing this information because of pressure by the world&#39;s ownership (you don&#39;t get research money if you&#39;re doing something that undermines the state of power in the world).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I mentioned in my post, I do want to discuss these issues (Israel, Zionism, international financiers, etc.)... openly and inquisitively.</p>

<p>But... my point is about the tone... about it always being &quot;The Jews&quot;, when it&#39;s really &quot;The Zionists&quot; (some of whom, and I have no tallies for numbers, happen to claim to be Jewish or attend synagogue services from time to time).</p>

<p>In my first post to r/campFEMA, I made this point... and I&#39;ll make it again here.</p>

<p>A very wise Imam once said [paraphrase]: The Jew is not our enemy. The Jew is our brother. And, we have an obligation to look after him. But, the Jew <em>behind the Jew</em> must be routed out.</p>

<p>The point being: Let&#39;s discuss Israel/Zionism, but with the understanding that they do not represent all of Judaism. So, whether or not someone is Jewish should be irrelevant (especially when they fall into this category of those who cower behind false/unfounded claims of racism).</p>

<p>Israel, to many orthodox Jews, is an abomination to their God. And, they feel the same way about the bloodthirst and warmongering as the rest of us.</p>

<p>So, yeah... address the specific individuals, but leave out &quot;The Jews&quot;, because it only fans the flames of unproductive discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I kind of figured this thread would focus only on &quot;The Jews&quot;, which is fine. Let&#39;s get it out here and try to find a way to work through it.</p>

<p>And, while I&#39;m on the topic, I&#39;m going to dive straight into Israel&#39;s top priority: Holocaust Denial.</p>

<p>When I was around 8 years old or so (late 1960&#39;s), there were hushed whispers about what was being taught in the school systems about WWII, and one of the messages that was transmitted (from person to person on an individual basis) was only written in dirt/dust (something easily and quickly erased). An old man (born in around the turn of the century) impressed this information me, so I always listen to these tales of revisionist history with great fascination.</p>

<p>Anyway... the &quot;secret message&quot; (only written in dust) can (sort of) now be written in reddit markdown. Basically, it&#39;s this: 6,000<del>,000</del> (i.e., that the number was a gross over-exaggeration).</p>

<p>The slaughter/murder of even ONE innocent person (let alone six, six thousand, or six million) is a travesty. But, by the same token, lying is, as well. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the story I heard as a child about revisionist history (The winners - in this case, the banksters who financed both sides of WWII - get to write the history books.)</p>

Anyone who survives a prison camp of any description would be, I imagine rather uninterested in perpetrating the lies of a secretive cabal who&#39;s only link was ethnicity or religion. Would that experience produce great liars? Isn&#39;t it more likely to tend toward producing? the opposite, even assuming it was only six thousand survivors.</p>

<p>Normally banned accounts don&#39;t show up. So, I&#39;m going to ask for a citation about him being banned (not why, just the fact of the ban please - see the EDIT at the bottom).</p>

<p>Information is one thing. &quot;A Jew from every lamppost.&quot; as a signature statement is quite another. (Guess you didn&#39;t see those, eh? Selective memory, perhaps?)</p>

<p>Fine. I&#39;ll watch it again when I have time, but I&#39;ll bet (if it&#39;s produced by Dr. Duke and not someone else&#39;s bastardized mashup) it still isn&#39;t calling for the wholesale slaughter of Jews.</p>

<p>You seem to be misunderstanding my point here. And, of all people, bumblingmumbling, I was actually holding out hope that you might get it.</p>

<p>We (people, of all creeds and colors, some even Jewish) <strong>can</strong> address the true problems relating to corruption by some of these people (and the &quot;evil Jews&quot; you guys keep throwing stones at wouldn&#39;t have a leg to stand on if it weren&#39;t for a few other evil people who aren&#39;t Jewish - Dick Cheney? Donald Rumsfeld? Two generations of Bush Presidencies?).</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all heard the alternative (or &quot;un-discussed&quot; or whatever) history of the Khazars and Ashkenazi.. So, why the blanket &quot;Jews&quot;? Why not be clear ... when clear distinction can be made? </p>

<p>From one accused anti-Semite to another, here&#39;s an insult to you:</p>

<p>The orthodox Jews being beaten at the hands of pro-Israel zombies are fighting against the exact same things you profess to oppose. They, however, are better than you; because they seek truth, not revenge. It is the triteness and pettiness of your approach which makes you contemptible.</p>

<p>If you want to expose specific people, expose them to their own constituencies. Make Jewish people worldwide ashamed of those who would hide criminal behavior behind the mantle of Judaism. Force a change upon the institution which is being abused.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what you&#39;re after, is it? You want a rebellion ... a mass hysteria wherein your anonymity can be your shield and you can be a forgotten face in the crowd... just in case the rebellion turns sour and you might get held accountable (i.e., just in case the Mossad win).</p>

<p>You are <em>not</em> David Duke, sir. And, I believe you do him an injustice when you use his words to inspire hatred rather than intellectual curiosity.</p>

But the very reality of all this Zionist control is that a lot of people are dead, permanently injured, disfigured and displaced. Their countries now have radioactive contamination. That is much worse than anything Johnny Cash said. </p>

<p>I personally will not accept Jewish Zionist billionaires as my overlords. Their money manipulation, usury, financial corruption, monopolies, media deceit and war mongering have lead to Endless Wars and Endless debt. Make no mistake about it their is a huge Zionist conspiracy in the USA, EU and Australia. There are a small number of Jews who are speaking out and I have posted their work. </p>

<p>The use of the word hatred is a powerful tool. Whose words have done the most damage? Ask the Palestinians and Iraqis. </p>

<p>Hatred is as hatred does Zionists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK was right a Free Society cannot operate in secrecy. Look at how defiant Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke have been about auditing and oversight of the Fed. They are an independent agency and no government body can over rule them. </p>

<p>Benjamin Freedman warned US in 1961. Two years later JFK was assassinated. It has been downhill ever since.</p>

<p><strong>The British government and the Zionist leaders struck a dirty deal.</strong> The Zionists were led by Chaim Weizmann, the man who one day become the first President of the State of Israel. The idea was for the Zionists to use their influence to drag the mighty USA into the war on Britain&#39;s side, so that Germany and it&#39;s Ottoman allies could be crushed. In exchange for helping to bring the USA into the war, the British would reward the Zionists by taking over Palestine from the conquered Ottomans after the war was over. The British had originally wanted to give the Zionists a jewish homeland in an African territory. But the Zionists were fixated on claiming Palestine as their land. Once under British control, the jews of Europe would be allowed to immigrate to Palestine in great numbers. </p>

<p>Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff, and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson. Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty “Huns”, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous year’s Lusitania “incident”, entered the war on Britain&#39;s side under the ridiculous pretext of “making the world safe for democracy”. </p>

<p>“Beat Back the Hun!” declared Fred Strothman’s famous propaganda poster, - a slogan which became a rallying cry of “patriotic” Americans. Woodrow Wilson was caught up in a sinister force beyond his control - a force which he himself described years earlier in his 1913 book “The New Freedom”, in which Wilson wrote these intriguing words:</p>

<p>&quot;Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men&#39;s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the U. S., in the field of commerce and manufacturing, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d be lying if i claimed i understand everything that has gone on with you and the issues you have talked bout tokin. But i also looked at forbidden archeology myself for a number of years, including the monuments at Giza, truly mind boggling when you start investigating them. 10,500bc seems to be the date of the last cataclysm. An ancient maritime civilization did exist, they were advanced beyond our understanding in some respects but then they went away. I&#39;m sure you are familiar with the work of Michael Cremo, Graham Hancock and the like. If there is anything i can help you with, if you have thoughts about the last time we were all here, i will try my best to help you.</p>

<p>Personally i believe the hidden hand are fully aware of past civilizations (3), they are also aware of solar flares and periodic flooding on a biblical scale. Dr Richard Sauder&#39;s work into underground tunnels and bases should not go unnoticed, I&#39;ve come to the belief that we are now looking at a break-away civilization. </p>

<p>In other words the elite, are fully aware of what has happened before and they have taken measures to save themselves in the event of another cataclysm.  They have technology far in advance of what we know and that they are using this to prepare to get the fuck out of dodge without us even being aware of it when the time comes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No real theories, other than what&#39;s been said here (it&#39;s obvious that cavemen didn&#39;t build the pyramids).</p>

<p>Although I do sort of have this suspicion that Tolkien may have been privy to some of that suppressed information. My hypothetical conjecture goes something like this...</p>

<p>The races of Tolkien&#39;s middle earth (elves, trolls, hobbits, etc.) are references to actual historical (pre-cataclysm) races. And, that the races of current time are a new evolutionary result of having had to start over with a smaller population subset. I think it would be fascinating to study facial feature variations within the existing races to see what things show up across all races.</p>

<p>For example, study eye shapes in Scandinavian people. Study eye shapes in Asian people. Study eye shapes in African people. Etc. Then compare the number of inter-racial (within the races) variations intra-racially (i.e., do you get six, ten, 14, whatever... variations... consistently across all races?) </p>

<p>Then, do the same with ear shapes. Is there a precise number of ear shapes within each race? No race has any earshape variation that other races have?</p>

<p>Compile these various traceable traits and then you have the vestiges of ancient (pre-cataclysm) races (Elves and shit).</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s just me trying to make sense of why I can see &quot;tall, then, angular people with slightly slanted eyes and slightly pointed ears&quot; as resembling elves, and &quot;short, stocky, rugged looking&quot; people as resembling dwarves. And so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Still, I think it&#39;d be interesting research.</p>

<p>And yeah, ... <em>this</em> is the one thing about my belief system which would rank me right up there with Icke&#39;s reptilians. (I&#39;m the guy who believes in Elves!)</p>

<p>My assertion is that the conspiracy is designed such that it makes &quot;protecting vested self-interest&quot; work to its benefit.</p>

<p>Those at the top arrange things so that everything below them feeds them. Thus, ... the pyramid. (pyramid schemes, and the symbolism of the pyramid)</p>

<p>Being oblivious to it doesn&#39;t negate its existence. Participating in it unwittingly doesn&#39;t negate its existence... nor disqualify that participation from inclusion. Being a zombie under the control of a zombie lord does not mean the actions of said zombie are not part of the zombie lord&#39;s plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of what you say but are you supporting the theory about &quot;The scientific establishment&quot; or is that an example of how people generalize and don&#39;t &quot;address the specific individuals&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, that was generalization because I have no idea whom, specifically, to address (although, if you&#39;ll notice, I did reference the power establishment as my suspicion). And, since there appears to be a very long history of this (spanning multiple generations), I&#39;m not precisely sure even what era to begin addressing.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s quite apparent that r/science and r/askscience aren&#39;t proudly advertising the fact that the public education system is teaching provable falsehoods in the name of science (re: those massive granite pyramids were built using stone age tools: copper chisels and rocks).</p>

<p>So, yeah... I generalized... because I don&#39;t have information ... but I generalized in the name of a <strong>request</strong> for said information (so, next time, maybe I won&#39;t have to generalize).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I mentioned in my post, I do want to discuss these issues (Israel, Zionism, international financiers, etc.)... openly and inquisitively.</p>

<p>But... my point is about the tone... about it always being &quot;The Jews&quot;, when it&#39;s really &quot;The Zionists&quot; (some of whom, and I have no tallies for numbers, happen to claim to be Jewish or attend synagogue services from time to time).</p>

<p>In my first post to r/campFEMA, I made this point... and I&#39;ll make it again here.</p>

<p>A very wise Imam once said [paraphrase]: The Jew is not our enemy. The Jew is our brother. And, we have an obligation to look after him. But, the Jew <em>behind the Jew</em> must be routed out.</p>

<p>The point being: Let&#39;s discuss Israel/Zionism, but with the understanding that they do not represent all of Judaism. So, whether or not someone is Jewish should be irrelevant (especially when they fall into this category of those who cower behind false/unfounded claims of racism).</p>

<p>Israel, to many orthodox Jews, is an abomination to their God. And, they feel the same way about the bloodthirst and warmongering as the rest of us.</p>

<p>So, yeah... address the specific individuals, but leave out &quot;The Jews&quot;, because it only fans the flames of unproductive discourse.</p>
