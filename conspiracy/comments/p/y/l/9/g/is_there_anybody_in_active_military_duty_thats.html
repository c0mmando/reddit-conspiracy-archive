<p>One would think that at least a FEW people in the military have browsed through here with an idea in their minds - however vague - that they&#39;re not really protecting their country from &quot;enemies&quot;.  They are for the most part killing and bombing other men, women, and children just like them to put more money and power in the coffers of people who will then turn around and start killing and doing away <em>them</em> too.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Damn!  Some of you guys suggested that I go over to r/military and post this link over there, and I did, and BAM!, I got banned from it like almost <em>immediately!</em>  Ha! lol.  Damn.  Oh well.  I guess that didn&#39;t go over too well over there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reserve officer in training here.</p>

<p>I have deeply come to that realization and it was incredibly painful to say the least.  I used to believe in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and was all gung-ho about &quot;kicking ass and taking names.&quot;</p>

<p>That was until I truly started doing my own research, talking with veterans, etc.  Then there was a true breaking point for me where I had a firsthand encounter that made me think &quot;this is not what I signed up to defend.  These are the faces of fear, not freedom.&quot;</p>

<p>I also read &quot;War is a Racket&quot; and &quot;Truth, lies and Afghanistan&quot; among other similar works.</p>

<p>In addition, I deeply thought about my international travels, the foreign people I met and spoke with, and all the ethnic girls I&#39;ve dated.</p>

<p>I&#39;m seriously considering filing for a Conscientious Objector discharge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s this?</p>

<p><em>Hope</em> in r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>A conscience is such a rare and precious thing in this world. Even moreso among the enlisted. I sincerely hope you take that final step and file.</p>

<p>If the Constitution were all you had to defend, serving in the United States military would be an honorable charge wherever the front. If a Federal Government chosen by free and fair elections to represent the weighted will of the American population were all you were asked to defend, serving in the military would not place such a burden upon you. </p>

<p>But rather than defend the Constitution, the United States, and her people, you are ordered to attack other sovereign nations to secure favorable construction, arms and oil contracts for your commander&#39;s friends. Instead of protecting the pursuit of happiness of all your countrymen, you are subsidizing the pursuit of property of only a small minority.</p>

<p>And how?</p>

<p>Through committed acts of organized mass murder...in costumes.</p>

<p>Concientious objection is not only the most human thing you can do, it&#39;s the most rational, too.</p>

<p>At least until the scenery in Washington changes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much. It is indeed a sad state of affairs.  I mean, how would I be &quot;protecting America&#39;s freedoms!&quot; by fighting some poor bearded men wearing robes and sandals who live in caves? FFS.  That&#39;s part of the reason I chose my redacted moniker &quot;Dulce bellum inexpertis.&quot; It means &quot;war is sweet to those who have never experienced it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listened to Bob Chapman on the Alex Jones show last Friday, He said that 70% of police and military are awake to what is going on and there is no way the elite will be able to carry out their plan. In one respect this is encouraging and on the other hand it is scarey; being that if one corners a wild animal, one can get very hurt.....blessings bro.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I certainly hope that&#39;s true, but I don&#39;t place much stock in Alex Jones.</p>

<p>If 70% of the police were awake to this, why were there so many atrocities committed against people in the Occupy movement with little or no repercussions for the offending officer?</p>

<p>If 70% of the military is awake, then why haven&#39;t there been more and louder voices of dissent among the ranks?  Once one is awake, one does not have the luxury of silence.</p>

<p>Thanks for the well wishes though, I appreciate that.</p>

<p>From an early age as an 80&#39;s kid I&#39;ve never understood this mentality, and I grew up with parents in the military.  They never really said anything either way but I remember thinking what a joke it was having all these bases around the world (I myself lived in Japan because if it for some time), and how it was probably half the reason &quot;they hate us&quot;.</p>

The only thing that&#39;s changed is police officers are more militarized and jumpy...killing people at the drop of hats, literally. Oh and heroin/meth are up, gas prices are up, and more people are committing suicide from the military then ever before.&quot; - just posted this to a major comment in r/guns...should be an interesting array of responses. </p>

<p>That is by no means a stupid question.  That is a great one.  However, it seems an even deeper, more pertinent question has to do with making sure and preventing the cycle of war from continuously repeating itself as it does.  What is the use of bringing the troops back to the U.S. if they&#39;re going to go right back out again and repeat the same cycle?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They absolutely have been if you measure the result next to what the public is TOLD the purpose of the military is supposed to be.  We&#39;re told the purpose of the military is to <em>defend</em> ourselves - not instigate, attack, and take over other countries, which is exactly what we&#39;ve done throughout our history.</p>

<p>I agree with pretty much everything you said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy crusade?  Dude, seriously.  Don&#39;t be <em>such</em> a sheep.  Understand that the very word &quot;conspiracy&quot; is a joke.  The b.s. reasons the U.S. has cited for going to war are NOT a conspiracy.  It&#39;s called truth.  Here.  Let&#39;s try this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>1898 Spanish American War</strong> The USS Main - a US ship anchored near Cuba - was sunk and blamed by the US on the Spanish, who denied it. US went to war w/Spain in order to control the Carribean area. A century later, America acknowledged that the Spanish never sunk the USS Main.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1915 WWI</strong> The USS Lusitania was sunk by a German sub as a result of the US covertly leaking information to the Germans that the USS Lusitania was carrying war time weapons and was a threat to them. Wash and repeat the problem, reaction, solution cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1941 WWII</strong> Pearl Harbor - the US instigated Japan for two years and did nothing when the US received information that Japan was finally going to attack in retaliation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1965 Vietnam War</strong>  Started because of the Gulf of Tonken incident: North Vietnamese boats were accused of attacking the US boat Maddox. Secretary of Defense Robert Macnamara later openly confessed that the attack on the Maddox itself actually NEVER took place. &quot;Events afterward showed that our judgement that we had been attacked that day was wrong. It didn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1990 1st Gulf War</strong> US secretly tells Sadaam that they have no problem with him attacking Kuwait. Sadaam (Iraq) therefore invades Kuwait. US (Dick Chaney) tells Saudi Arabia (Kuwait) that 200,000 Iraqi soldiers are amassing behind their border. Saudi Arabia, in fear, grants the US permission to establish military bases in Kuwait to defend them against attack. America covertly sells Saadam chemical weapons and allows him to use them against his own people. His atrocities get shown in the US news, the public buys it, and now allows US to go to war w/Iraq. Later American intel reveals that there were, in fact, no Iraqi troops at the Kuwaiti border.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Conspiracy crusades right?  Seriously man.  Educate yourself, brother.  You&#39;re only doing yourself and your country a major disservice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because you don&#39;t understand that they&#39;re often so one and the same as to be indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Because he&#39;s <em>not</em> only doing that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re wondering if my initial response to t0t here was sarcasm?</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>First of all, Ron Paul seems to be the best of the lot . . . but the lot is absolutely <em>putrid</em> to its core, so it says pretty much nothing that RP is the best of it.  The system that he&#39;s working in is putrid and will continue to putrefy the country around it regardless of whether RP is president or not.</p>

<p>Secondly, it would not seem that those in the military who support RP are sufficient to make any significant anti war change.  I support anyone who is against war, but I think that the point t0t makes is an unfortunate drop in the bucket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If people stop cooperating and engage in civil disobedience, the system will starve to death eventually. The question is if we can hold for long enough. They know that and they have been trying to weaken our ability to function independently. The powers that be have been preparing for the collapse for years by pushing for the centralization of food production through companies like Monsanto. The collapse of the dollar system is a mathematical certainty at this point, and I think they have been planning on using food as a weapon to impose their will on the people. What is needed is for people to be able to survive without their paper currency. Many are already using alternative commodities that can act as currencies such as silver, bitcoin, or distributed credit systems like ripple to trade separately from the dollar economy. If people can sustain ourselves using those tools through the collapse, we will have the upper hand. But if we cannot, they will decide our future. We need to be prepared. The more people start preparing by transferring their wealth away from their sinking ship, the better off we will be. </p>

<p>But you are dead on about the dollar.  Moving away from that is the best (and possibly only) solution.</p>

<p>That said, it would help if there was a mass movement to stop paying taxes.  But you cannot shift the blame onto the victim in this case.</p>

<p>I agree but that is only going to accelerate their downfall. If the Fed keeps devaluing the dollar, why would China and the rest of the countries keep their treasuries. At some point they are just going to sell their treasuries, and crash the dollar. </p>

<p>If you were to become aware that the reasons the U.S. is citing for going to war with another country are either manipulated or simply false, and those other people aren&#39;t as interested in fighting as you&#39;re told, would you still be willing to go and kill them?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s suppose your answer is &quot;No.  I wouldn&#39;t be willing to kill people who don&#39;t want to go to war with us.&quot;  Now, just for the sake of argument, lets also suppose that all your other E-3 compatriots new the same information you did and felt the same way.</p>

<p>How effective would you think a war would be if you and those other E-3&#39;s banded together and agreed <em>not</em> to kill people in another country? agreed <em>not</em> to fight and go to war with a people not interested in war? if those few manipulators at the top of the 1% didn&#39;t have you guys doing the fighting for them?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>1898 Spanish American War</strong>
The USS Main - a US ship anchored near Cuba - was sunk and blamed by the US on the Spanish, who denied it.  US went to war w/Spain in order to control the Carribean area.  A century later, America acknowledged that the Spanish never sunk the USS Main.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1915 WWI</strong>
The USS Lusitania was sunk by a German sub as a result of the US covertly leaking information to the Germans that the USS Lusitania was carrying war time weapons and was a threat to them.  Wash and repeat the problem, reaction, solution cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1941 WWII</strong>
Pearl Harbor - the US instigated Japan for two years and did nothing when the US received information that Japan was finally going to attack in retaliation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1965 Vietnam War</strong>
Started because of the Gulf of Tonken incident:  North Vietnamese boats were accused of attacking the US boat Maddox.  Secretary of Defense Robert Macnamara later openly confessed that the attack on the Maddox itself actually NEVER took place.  &quot;Events afterward showed that our judgement that we had been attacked that day was wrong.  It didn&#39;t happen.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1990 1st Gulf War</strong>
US secretly tells Sadaam that they have no problem with him attacking Kuwait.  Sadaam (Iraq) therefore invades Kuwait.  US (Dick Chaney) tells Saudi Arabia (Kuwait) that 200,000 Iraqi soldiers are amassing behind their border.  Saudi Arabia, in fear, grants the US permission to establish military bases in Kuwait to defend them against attack.  America covertly sells Saadam chemical weapons and allows him to use them against his own people.  His atrocities get shown in the US news, the public buys it, and now allows US to go to war w/Iraq.  Later American intel reveals that there were, in fact, no Iraqi troops at the Kuwaiti border.</p></li>

<p>You can and <em>will</em> be a shining beacon of light if you simply work at being a cool person and not being an asshole to others; if you simply work at lending a hand to some stranger that needs it if you&#39;re around - help him/her up if they fall on the ground while you&#39;re walking to the store for example.  Smile at a kid who just accidentally kicked his soccer ball in your direction as you kick it back to him.  Help an old lady cross the street if you happen to be there.</p>

<p>You see, a shining beacon illuminates everything that&#39;s around it by virtue of its simply being <em>on</em>.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to go out and <em>try</em> to help others.</p>

<p>Just be a cool person and try not to be an asshole to anybody.  Help someone if it seems they might need a quick hand, and move on w/your day.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it. :)</p>

<p>So I&#39;m obligated to throw any sort of career away because I don&#39;t believe in what the military is doing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all don&#39;t think that you&#39;re throwing &quot;any sort of career away&quot; because you don&#39;t agree with the military and don&#39;t end up going into a career with them.  There are a lot of things you can do with your life that don&#39;t involve the military.</p>

<p>Secondly, realize that what the military is doing isn&#39;t something as simple and benign as slapping some kid in a schoolyard on the wrist.</p>

<p>They are literally decimating entire countries in the name of a policy that has shown itself to be very, <em>very</em> spotty and leaky at best.  That&#39;s quite a different thing altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What you are asking me to do will give me at LEAST a dishonorable discharge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing wrong with that if you intelligently inform whoever wants to know that it&#39;s because you became aware that the life of people is more important than the money, and political advantage that a small group of greedy men wished to acquire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which means I can&#39;t even get a job at McDonalds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What?  McDonalds won&#39;t hire you if you&#39;ve been dishonorably discharged?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I graduated from Purdue in 2009 with a Bachelor&#39;s in Computer Technology too...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus Christ then, donkey!  There&#39;s SO much more shit you can do with your life now that I know that! lol.  Damn.  It&#39;s one thing if you&#39;re a flunky with barely a highschool education and no other means of supporting yourself.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a fucking computer tech.  You can almost work and make great money ANYWHERE, man.</p>

<p>Seriously.</p>

<p>Now, all this is not saying that you should bail out of your military post <em>now</em> . . . but, believe me, man . . . you&#39;ve got a LOT of options in your future whether you stay in the military or not.</p>

<p><em>Know</em> this.</p>

<p>I&#39;m too much of an adrenaline junkie to do programming anymore. I love computers as a hobby. I found that out about 90% of the way through school. That&#39;s why I decided to join. My initial contract was for EOD but I failed out and they stuck me in Intelligence where I spend 12 hrs a day on computers. -_-</p>

<p>&quot;Civilians&quot; (using the term only as people that are ignorant of the military) see the dishonorable discharge as someone that requires constant supervision and doesn&#39;t follow rules.</p>

<p>I have heard numerous cases of McDonald&#39;s not hiring due to policy on dishonorable discharges.  But they are all hearsay stories and I can&#39;t confirm/deny anything.</p>

<p>Why is it never mentioned that the 99% continues to allow the members of congress to stay in office that declare these &#39;phony&#39; wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This.</p>

<p>Why indeed.  I wonder about this continuously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They vote and allow the president to stay in office that uses his powers to initially send troops into places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This again.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very unpopular things to say, but voting in this country (if not the world) has really proven itself to be a real, real joke.  It&#39;s all fake and contrived.  They&#39;ve had computer programs to tabulate votes for quite some time that can count the final tally in any way that&#39;s chosen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why most people get angry at the military is beyond me, since they have to take orders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FYI I&#39;m certainly not angry at them.  Just as you said, they&#39;re merely following orders.  What I&#39;m saying is that it would be good if more of them become more aware so that they understand just how much power they <em>do</em> have.  THEY are the ones that can really sway the tide because it is the military that the 1% use to do its bidding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like most of these people don&#39;t feel like blaming themselves for letting the people into office(congress and potus) that would allow this to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m almost 40 and have never voted a day in my life.</p>

<p>This, of course, doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m not &quot;part of the system&quot; as well, but it <em>does</em> mean that the reason I don&#39;t partake is because, as I stated earlier, I&#39;ve understood it&#39;s all a joke from the time I was a very, very young person.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then, members of the military would not have to take the extreme risks of trying to object to something, since we would be doing the right thing in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that easy, however.  The government is nothing but the face that is commanded and controlled by the rulers of the land.  That is to say, the government itself isn&#39;t really the ruler of the land.  If we the people are too concerned with 1) voting, and 2) trying to get the <em>government</em> to do this, that, or the other, then we really won&#39;t succeed because a) voting doesn&#39;t work, and b) the government doesn&#39;t run shit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the people BEHIND and in control of the government that need to be exposed.</p>

<p>It&#39;s happening, but it feels like we&#39;re in a real race against this power to expose it and stop it before it pretty much enslaves the entire population of the world.</p>

<p>At the expense of slaughtering people that have never done anything to them?  That&#39;s not a warrior.  That&#39;s an ignorant fool, a coward, or both.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Get a job.  McDonald&#39;s is hiring.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t - and <em>that&#39;s</em> the point.  Who are they protecting?  They&#39;re protecting the 1 percent.</p>

<p>They all know who they&#39;re protecting?  They all know they&#39;re protecting the interests of greedy, planet-raping multi-billionaires interested in nothing but expanding their oligarchical empire?</p>

<p>Is that who the military knows they&#39;re protecting?  And if so, then they&#39;re not <em>our</em> military.  They&#39;re THEIR military.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t happen to feel this way, however.  I happen to feel that the majority of the guys and gals that go in are honorable and should be respected.  They go in to protect not so much &quot;America&quot; or &quot;American Interests&quot; . . . but American PEOPLE.  They go in to protect the lives of the American <em>people</em>.</p>

<p>Problem with that is that they&#39;re being given orders by people that don&#39;t have the interest and the benefit and welfare of the American people in mind.</p>

<p>And the orders they&#39;re being given?  To kill other men and women with children and families of their own in a distant land they&#39;ve barely thought of before dropping bombs on them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a problem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for protecting the U.S., but if the enemy is RIGHT HERE in this land, then we need to fight the right fight, and not worry about going abroad.</p>

<p>The other half (the lesser intelligent) are really not able to comprehend the bigger picture... they just shrug and perhaps even agree with you, but they literally do not have the will nor awareness to try and understand the situation at large. This is the most frustrating part for me. No matter what I say to them, they are the types of people who NEED someone to tell them what to do.

<p>Before I had my little apocalypse I was going to go into the Army as an officer - counter intellegence. Ultimately I decided that I had too many issues with authority and so I declined (they called me for years). My point is that I would&#39;ve been one of those pawns. Those pawns can easily open their minds at any time. They should be helped as much as possible. They shouldn&#39;t be attacked. They&#39;re still humans and deserve the decency / dignity given to any human.</p>

<p>That said, the self-appointed rulers should be arrested and jailed like the common criminals they are. If they repent, that&#39;s fine. If they do not, that&#39;s fine. But even the self-appointed rulers are people. The focus, in my opinion, should be on making the world a better place. Or at least not so lame.</p>

<p>I do not understand what you mean by this.  Rephrase it if you wish.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Instead, however, they&#39;re killing the family, friend, and neighbors of people they don&#39;t know because they&#39;re being given orders by business tycoons that don&#39;t have their best interest in mind.  This makes sense how exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These people are untapped assets and should not be derided or ridiculed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they&#39;re NOT being derided or ridiculed - at least not by me.  I honor and respect those in the armed forces.  It is <em>because</em> I respect and honor them and what they do and stand for so much that I think it is very important to inform them when they are fighting and killing for something that is a lie.  They deserve better than to risk their lives for a cause that is not in the best interest of them, their families, or their country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They should be helped as much as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  I made this thread to do my small part toward helping educate some as much as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those pawns can easily open their minds at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s that easy, as the military brainwashing and conditioning is deep, and much resistance will occur when one tries to inform some people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They shouldn&#39;t be attacked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with this.  They <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be attacked.  Also, however, they should not be allowed to go off aggressively on what they think is right if what they think is, in all actuality, a lie and a fabrication.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re still humans and deserve the decency / dignity given to any human.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot agree with this more, sir.  Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That said, the self-appointed rulers should be arrested and jailed like the common criminals they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I strongly believe it is the military that they are currently using <em>as</em> pawns that stand a strong chance of fighting against them when the time comes <em>to</em> &quot;arrest and jail&quot; these criminals.  But that military must be educated as to what&#39;s really going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A.) In a wonderful twist my wording wasn&#39;t at all clear. And yet an underlying part of my point had to do with clarity. It&#39;s hard not to get into a discussion about linguistics and perceptons of &quot;reality&quot; so I&#39;ll try to be as succinct as possible; how you frame a topic - what words you use - will effect the listener. If your phrasing is hostile then they&#39;ll likely become, themselves, hostile. We put on hats without even knowing it most of the time. It is more useful, generally, to put on the friendly hat so that others will see a friendly hat. This sounds completely ridiculous, and I know it, however it has served me well.</p>

<p>B.) My cousin is inAfghanistan right now. He&#39;s a good bean and doesn&#39;t understand much. He&#39;s a kid really. I think that he&#39;ll figure it out and it&#39;ll likely come as a shock. I don&#39;t want him to feel bad about it because we&#39;ve all felt that way. He&#39;ll be beating himself up without any help from anyone else. It is in this sense that I think a redirecting of energies would be a good thing for people like my cousin. He should be helped. He was manipulated and when he figures it out I think it&#39;d be best to help him rather than point a finger. I was like him years ago myself.</p>

<p>C.) You can&#39;t wake people up or inform them. I&#39;m a great example. I&#39;m an autodydact and if I&#39;m not into something it simply won&#39;t penetrate my thick skull. If I am interested in something you&#39;ll have to physically take me away from it. No one told me to &#39;wake up&#39; - I am a self-initiate. I can&#39;t even take credit for it really. Someone told me about the Twin Towers falling at freefall speed and I socked it away for years. One day, in 2007, some neuron fired in a somewhat irregular way and I knew that something was up. Someone told me, but it didn&#39;t sink in at all until I was ready for it. I will bet this holds for most people. All you can do is talk about things that interest you. And when you see a newly minded person all you can do is try to help them in whatever way you can. I&#39;ve spotted a few and I&#39;m always happy to tell them whatever I know and reinforce that I&#39;m far from omniscient. What I mean is I have never awoken anyone ever. They have always done it themselves and I&#39;ve always watched it as a friend / helper.</p>

<p>D.) There will be instinces of violence. I think defending yourself or loved ones is acceptable. But only in defense. Violence begets violence and should be avoided at all cost. This includes emotional violence. Shit will happen regardless of your attempt to do good. There&#39;s no reason to promulgate.</p>

<p>E.) Most of the ex-military people I&#39;ve come across have known damn well that they were fucked with. I have something like optimism that people are catching on like never before. En masse at that. I remember some study about how military personnel would not fire on their own if 3% of the population fired back. The first line is non-violence. The second line is NRA. Its my hope that we will never have to come to that.</p>

<p>F.) I sound as though I don&#39;t advocate public discussion of these things. Really, this kind of stuff is ALL I talk about. I get a lot of rolling eyes and groans, but people can&#39;t think about something they don&#39;t know exists (Rumsfeld&#39;s infamous [unknown unknowns]). I talk about this stuff publicly. However I do everything possible to keep my friendly hat on. People who count themselves as either Democrats or republicans will soon figure out how meaningless those labels are. At which time you gain an friend.</p>

<p>FINALLY: Be the change you want to see.</p>

<p>I want to see a world in which people are nice and help each other.</p>

<p>Yes.  This is unfortunately true.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I wish I could disagree with this or say it doesn&#39;t apply to me, but you are correct here as well.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It does indeed seem ridiculous.  Truth is truth.  Facts are facts.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you say &quot;2 plus 2 is 4, and your mother dresses you funny.&quot; or &quot;2+2=4 and you look great today.&quot;  2 plus 2 is still four.</p>

<p>People are more likely to argue with you if you state it the first way, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My cousin ... I think that he&#39;ll figure it out and it&#39;ll likely come as a shock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s unfortunate.  I wish that more soldiers could have folks <em>tell</em> them what they&#39;re in store for so they don&#39;t go in blind.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He should be helped. He was manipulated and when he figures it out I think it&#39;d be best to help him rather than point a finger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I entirely and wholeheartedly agree.  Who is there to help, however?  Perhaps my OP didn&#39;t use the best, most kind language, but I think it&#39;s important to try to be as truthful as possible about the realities involved in these wars.  That&#39;s not to say that 1) I know everything there is to know about it (<em>far</em> from it) or that 2) the way I said it is the best way to do so (far from it as well), but I do think that it <em>is</em> important for service men and women to be aware of some of these things almost <em>regardless</em> of how they&#39;re told.  Just make sure and at least be aware of the info.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can&#39;t wake people up or inform them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree.  You can&#39;t wake <em>everybody</em> up or inform <em>everyone</em>, but that&#39;s not to say that you can&#39;t wake <em>anybody</em> up or inform them.  There are some individuals (like myself) that simply won&#39;t get some types of information if it&#39;s explained in ten different ways.  However, there are other people (like myself as well) that you can take other types of info and explain them, and just by understanding your message abstractly they can figure out everything they&#39;re supposed to in that manner.</p>

<p>It really just all depends on the subject matter.</p>

<p>I feel that I <em>do</em> see your point, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone told me, but it didn&#39;t sink in at all until I was ready for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just because certain seeds need years to germinate, however, it doesn&#39;t mean that you weren&#39;t taught by the person who initially planted them in you - even if it may have been ages ago and long forgotten.  It just took a while before the seeds and the information flowered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you can do is talk about things that interest you. And when you see a newly minded person all you can do is try to help them in whatever way you can.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  Sometimes they understand and agree immediately.  Other times they will entirely scoff at you and nothing will <em>ever</em> get through.  Others they will scoff initially, but then understand long after you&#39;re gone.</p>

<p>Either way, all you can do is simply express what you feel as best as you can, and let the rest handle itself.  You teach, you learn, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I mean is I have never awoken anyone ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  You can only awake yourself.  However - and this is a big &quot;however&quot; - there are many that can shake you enough to cause you to awake.  <em>YOU</em> are the one that does your own awaking.  Others, however, can help to shake the sleep out of you.</p>

<p>Just because the person in question is the only one that can wake themselves, that&#39;s no reason to let someone soundly and quietly sleep in a sea of complete ignorance without any attempt on your part to clang them awake with the clamor of truth and information.  I feel if one has interesting and possibly little-known information, then if they get the opportunity to express their perspective on things - whether popular or not - they should <em>do</em> it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think defending yourself or loved ones is acceptable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have something like optimism that people are catching on like never before.  En masse at that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel this quite a bit myself.  I wouldn&#39;t call it optimism in my case, however.  I would call it a type of awareness of sorts that I have experienced growing more and more in me.  Perhaps I am only projecting, however, because my own awareness has been expanding significantly in the last few years.  I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s <em>only</em> projection, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I sound as though I don&#39;t advocate public discussion of these things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmmm . . . I didn&#39;t get that at all, sir.  No sarcasm there, by the way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Really, this kind of stuff is ALL I talk about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This kind of stuff is much of what I think and talk about as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to see a world in which people are nice and help each other.</p>

<p>You have made this entire thread well worth the effort.</p>

<p>That appears to be a pretty good dick move, antagonizing the people that protect you.  They have nothing to do with the decisions made about where they go, or what they do.  Most just wanted to escape their past, or get an education.  The military doesn&#39;t function well with the ideals they protect, so it bleeds over into their off time.  Why would they want the place they go to relax mentally to be another source of conflict?  There is no conspiracy here, you&#39;re a dick for doing that and they were right to ban you.</p>

<p>Do you think that I&#39;m suggesting our military only protects us by waging wars?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By proxy, Smurf, yes.  You are.  You&#39;re suggesting and allowing that because regardless of what the military is <em>supposed</em> to do during &quot;peace&quot; time, 1) they&#39;re almost ALWAYS at war, and 2) the wars they are called upon to wage are almost always (if not always) contrived, filled with lies, and about nothing but killing others in the name of conquest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible that having a military is, in itself, a defensive posture?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s certainly possible, but that&#39;s not how it&#39;s been used in the history of this country - so no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think that there are no other forces that wouldn&#39;t take our natural resources if we completely stripped all our forces of their weapons?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At THIS point, Smurf, there are a LOT of countries that are interested in killing the U.S.  It&#39;s not because those countries are simply assholes though.  It&#39;s because WE are and have been to them.  If the U.S. were more interested in cohabitation and peace rather than conquest and war, then maybe it would be a <em>lot</em> easier to not have all those weapons.</p>

<p>Are you literally suggesting that our military doesn&#39;t offer you any protection at all?  Is that what you&#39;re saying?</p>

<p>You call yourself one of the &quot;few reasonable people&quot; when what you do is come on here and spout sarcasm and vitriol?  How is that reasonable?  You call that reasonable?  I call that confused and ignorant, not reasonable.</p>

<p>You also come on here and call what&#39;s on this subreddit &quot;bullshit&quot; - which definitively shows that you really know <em>very</em>, very little about what&#39;s actually going on in the world.  Please.  Seriously.  Educate yourself.  It does you a great disservice to come on here (or go anywhere) and call people that show they know a great deal more than you about a great many things uneducated.</p>

<p>Ultimately, You&#39;re making the mistake of calling yourself and what you&#39;ve been saying reasonable.  You really shouldn&#39;t give yourself that much credit.</p>

<p>Why is it that you would <em>ever</em> think that I (or anyone for that matter) see you as &quot;the enemy&quot;?  I personally don&#39;t see you as important or knowledgeable enough to stand as any sort of enemy or foe - much less a worthy one that should be worried about if you <em>were</em> an enemy.</p>

<p>The very fact that you look at things from this twisted &quot;enemy&quot; paradigm is a great indication that you&#39;re simply a degenerate in terms of your thought process.  That&#39;s not anything that I look at antagonistically.  I look at it with pity.</p>

<p>And you&#39;re right, it <em>isn&#39;t</em> a fight that I would ever win because I would simply never engage in it.</p>

<p>The very fact that you typed that second sentence is proof positive that you haven&#39;t the least idea what you speak of.  Additionally, it almost entirely invalidates your first sentence.</p>

<p>I would imagine that you&#39;re not aware of either of those things.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>and given that you appear to know not the first thing about what you speak, I would be afraid of anyone who would be ignorant enough to actually listen to you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There very well might be.  However, anyone who is ignorant and short sighted enough to disregard the validity in the posts that are <em>not</em>, as you call it, &quot;bullshit&quot;, would be very much the worse for wear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ones that say reptiles from another planet have agents working here already springs to mind</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, your type of mentality - the type that unquestioningly accepts the regurgitated dogma of his or her state and is not intelligent enough to critically examine the world around them to realize that much of it is not as you are told - is the <em>exact</em> type of mind set that the 1% want.</p>

<p>You make the leaders of this world very proud indeed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the posts on this subreddit are nothing more than filler and no killer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See?  Listen to how you even phrase things.  It&#39;s a feeble (and exceedingly failing) attempt at witticism with no real substance.  It falls flat and succeeds at little but making you look like someone who is trying desperately to sound smart and cool, all the while being on a ship that&#39;s quickly sinking under the weight of its own ignorant pretense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone sits around agreeing with each other without providing substance or plans of action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really.  I&#39;m disagreeing with <em>you</em> right now, and have been through a good portion of this dialogue w/you.  And as far as not providing substance or plans of action?  I would differ with that as well, as the process of simply shedding the light of knowledge and awareness upon things that have been shrouded in dogmatic darkness is one of the first, most important steps that leads to the type of action needed to effect change in corrupt societies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then they criticize anyone that calls them out on it as cogs in the machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  Where do you see that?  I for one would AGREE if you were to &quot;call me out&quot; and say I&#39;m a cog in the machine.</p>

<p>That&#39;s part of what this entire thread is about:  Trying to let people know just how we are being used as cogs by a machine that is using us for nefarious purposes - purposes that we likely wouldn&#39;t agree with in the least if we actually <em>knew</em> about them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are wrong, the military does protect us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  The military is here to protect a way of life that rapes, kills, and consumes other people, cultures, and the planet in general.  You are taught and conditioned to believe that this is the best way to be - that <em>this</em> is the best society to be in.  America is cool in some ways, but has a <em>lot</em> to learn in terms of development and the evolution of the species toward better ways of being.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their existence alone prevents attacks and protects you every day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are wrong, my friend.  You couldn&#39;t be more wrong if you tried.  The existence of the military as an instigating weapon on this planet has been responsible for keeping the fires of antagonism and conflict going when nothing of the sort has ever been necessary to live in a world of cohabitation.  Right now, the world is far from one of cohabitation, and a large reason for that has to do with how the 1% are directing those honorable but entirely blinded and ignorant people in the military that think they&#39;re defending freedom when what they&#39;re really doing is defending a quickly materialising dictatorship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They may be used for evil agendas, but so are you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  Absolutely.  Of course I&#39;m being used as fuel for the 1%&#39;s evil agendas.  You&#39;re right about that.</p>

<p>The big question, however, is <em>what are you going to DO about it?</em></p>

<p>I&#39;m choosing to try to educate myself and others <em>about</em> this agenda as much as possible in the hopes that we as a species can evolve and become better - not worse.</p>

<p>You seem to be interested in remaining ignorant and doggedly supporting it.  That is unfortunate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You pay your taxes, you&#39;re another cog in the machine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this make you feel better?  Does it let you puff your chest out in the air more and go &quot;Hmph!  I told him!&quot;?  Is that what you were trying to accomplish with that last statement?  It certainly didn&#39;t shed any new information that wasn&#39;t already understood.</p>

<p>This is part of the reason FOR this subreddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny if you think about it, because with the very last sentence you posted, you&#39;re actually siding with and <em>agreeing</em> with the ultimate message that this subreddit which you try to deride so much is actually <em>about</em>.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all cogs in a machine.  There&#39;s no problem if that machine is a GOOD machine - a machine designed to help us all be better creatures - but that machine is NOT designed to help us become better creatures.  That machine works diligently and incessantly at keeping us ignorant.</p>

<p>lol.  It&#39;s not &quot;sleeping on it&quot; that&#39;s going to give you a different perspective.  It&#39;s looking at and critically examining the relevant information available.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether one objectively examines the data or not, however, the issue of reptilians is really small potatoes.  There are so many other issues on this planet that are hidden from people that deciding to fully investigate the issue of reptilians is of little consequence.</p>

<p>Someone who rejects the vast level of manipulation that exists on this planet by the 1% because &quot;the concept of reptilians is bullshit&quot; is missing the point of logical reasoning by at least a mile.</p>

<p>And everything I&#39;m claiming does not have to be true in order for you to still be patently incorrect in thinking that &quot;everything&quot; spoken about in r/conspiracy is false.  Don&#39;t know if you understand that or not.</p>

<p>Regardless, here&#39;s your first homework assignment:</p>

<p>Look up Dr. John Mack from Harvard and the research he&#39;s done.  If you can&#39;t understand the validity of his work, then you might not be able to get much further on things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Besides the fact that there are credible individuals who directly attest to having witnessed such beings (Credo Mutwa not being the least of which), besides the fact that - independent of Reptilians in and of themselves - there is a literal deluge of humans across the planet who irrespective of one another report the same beings (whether reptillian, nordic, tall white, grey, or otherwise), and besides the fact that there are various individuals infinitely more credentialed than you or I who have done extensive, clinical research on a <em>lot</em> of these witnesses (Harvard&#39;s Dr. John Mack not being the least of such investigators), there is the simple matter of numbers which, independent of any such reports previously mentioned here, play largely against the abysmally, <em>blindly</em> short-sighted notion that so many on this planet have which thinks that we are &quot;alone&quot; in the universe.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">Nothing could be further from the truth</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of all of this, however, it would be <em>extremely</em> erroneous of you to cite the data on reptilians as being the <em>sole</em> and only bit of information you hang your coat of doubt on.  It would truly be ridiculous on your or anyone&#39;s part to discard or discredit an entire field of research and variegated phenomena based upon a doubt or level of ignorance you have upon one specific and particular aspect of it.

<p>Yeah.  I just checked where the quote of mine you cited came from.</p>

<p>Uh, that was <em>waaayy</em> back when in the threads.  Why on earth are you bringing that up NOW?  What does that have to do with what we&#39;re talking about <em>now</em>?  It&#39;s like you just decided to throw that out there all the sudden as if I were even responding to anything having to do with <em>that</em> statement on my part.  Again, I was responding to something totally and completely different - and <em>much</em> more recent - that you asked and seemed to want an answer to.  Then you seemed to switch gears all the sudden and accused me of getting &quot;way off point&quot; when I actually <em>did</em> directly address you question.</p>

<p>facepalm.</p>

<p>Soooo.  Let&#39;s try this again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the question I&#39;m asking isn&#39;t prove what your saying about evil reptiles plotting against us, it is why did you make that statement in response to what I said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, I&#39;m assuming here that the statement of mine you&#39;re wondering about here is the one I, again, made back when regarding your alleging that you&#39;ve &quot;never posted sarcasm.  Everything I&#39;ve written is true.&quot;</p>

<p>First and foremost, your second sentence strongly implies (if not necessarily presumes) omniscience.  So you&#39;re saying you&#39;re omniscient?  You&#39;re saying you&#39;ve never told a lie?  You&#39;re saying you&#39;ve never fabricated something in your life?  You&#39;re saying you&#39;ve never been mistaken about something that you thought was initially true, written whatever you wrote, and then later found out you were mistaken?</p>

<p>If any of this is the case, you&#39;re either the world&#39;s smartest three year old (because you obviously couldn&#39;t have been alive too long if you&#39;ve never written anything you were mistaken about), or you&#39;re written almost NOTHING ever in your entire life.</p>

<p>And honestly? I don&#39;t have the slightest interest in going back over the dribble that has predominantly been this dialogue, but I can almost guarantee you that if I did, I&#39;d find enough in what you wrote that was either patently incorrect, logically absurd, or inductively fallacious to further illustrate the point being made here.  Either way, the point is that you or <em>anyone</em> stating that &quot;everything you&#39;ve written is true&quot; reeks of a level of ignorance and hubris hardly worth taking the time to validate or refute.</p>

<p>And as for your never having posted sarcasm, I quickly skimmed through, and although I found more than one post that absolutely could be construed as containing sarcasm (&quot;I&#39;m a simpleton who can&#39;t understand your logic, please explain it to me.&quot; is, believe it or not, sarcastic by virtue of the implied contradiction involved in your calling yourself something that you clearly believe you&#39;re not), I&#39;ve discovered that even though your posts haven&#39;t been <em>replete</em> with it, your ardent assumption that they had <em>none</em> of it indicates a level of, again, hubris that is simply extremely unbecoming of anyone trying to make any type of argument for themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make a general statement to this effect, as responding to you is no longer worth a sustained effort on my part.</p>

<p>You came one here aggressively responding to me and others in a manner that protects the military status quo and those that keep in power the blood-thirsty actions of a nation that seems hell bent upon conquest at the expense of anything just, moral, and pious.  While it might be understandable that you might be just plain ignorant and simply not know the information that&#39;s out pointing in this very direction, the arrogance and hubris with which you simply <em>assume</em> that you have an idea about what is going on is simply ridiculous.</p>

<p>Proving how wrong you are is absolutely nothing for me or anyone to feel good or happy about, however, as I would love for all the signs to <em>not</em> be pointing in the direction that they&#39;re pointing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lets drag this out a little more.  You&#39;re saying I&#39;m so ignorant that no one would listen to me.  Why don&#39;t you let one of your friends (real life friends, not r/conspiracy friends) read this and then ask if what I&#39;m saying appears to be ignorant.  </p>

<p>But that isn&#39;t even why I&#39;m dragging it out.  A couple of weeks ago there was a post asking what the biggest hurdle is in reaching more people with the information on this subreddit.  As always, the #1 comment was someone saying the usual bullshit about no one wanting to hear anything and didn&#39;t actually give any suggestions or identify any actual hurdles.  On it I posted something about how to sound less crazy when trying to communicate with others and the 2 points I made have been repeatedly violated by you.  Not just on this thread, a lot of what you post is in the same language and context:</p>

<ol>
<li> Reads like a 10 year old wrote it, lots of emotion and strong words making accusations.</li>
<li> Not clarifying what you&#39;re talking about.</li>
</ol>

<p>In support of this, just look up your 1st explanation.  When I read what you wrote, I had no idea what you meant.  It&#39;s been long enough now, that I&#39;m willing to bet that if you went back and read it again, you wouldn&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about either.  And the explanation you gave rambled on about things that didn&#39;t directly answer my question.  Then I asked you to explain why I&#39;m so ignorant no one would listen to me, and you didn&#39;t.  Even now, you didn&#39;t explain it.  You said you made attempts to explain it, where?  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like being called Smurfette, it makes me feel pretty, but you&#39;ve stated that I can&#39;t think objectively because I won&#39;t consider the possibility of evil reptiles plotting against us is a real threat.  I&#39;m not sure how you made that connection.  Then you spout more bullshit about the 1% preventing me from thinking clearly.  You&#39;re so angry when writing things that you forget other people can&#39;t read you&#39;re mind and don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.  Read the post you made in r/military that started all this, look at how you talked to a large group of people that don&#39;t believe in the things you do.  Would you listen to you?  You have a right to believe whatever you want.  But no one will listen to you if this is how you&#39;re going to behave.  A fucking 10 year old pretending he&#39;s smarter than everyone else because he thinks he can see behind the curtain.  If you talk to people in real life like you do here, you probably don&#39;t have many friends.</p>

<p>There is obviously some gross level of misunderstanding on your part, my part, or both parts.</p>

<p>I will have to return and respond to what you&#39;re attempting to get at a bit later, as I&#39;m a bit encumbered right now, and won&#39;t be able to spend the time trying to figure out what you&#39;re actually asking.</p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s possible, and it is how it should be. We could defend US territory for about 10% of what we spend now. I&#39;m all for it.</p>

<p>No. I think it&#39;s pretty far-fetched to suggest that China would invade us for our rare earth metals or natural gas or coal, even if we had no standing army at all.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that other countries wouldn&#39;t have people like this that we need to be protected from?  What simple question would you like answered? Russia and China would attack us, and will attack us eventually.  The only reason I read this subreddit is because of articles about peak oil and its related topics, but all the bullshit is getting too thick to wade through.  There is no doubt that we are becoming an evil empire, but there is no other place in the world that will accept, and protect you like this country will.  Where are you going to run to?  We&#39;re in this as a team, we need the military, alienating them because you&#39;re pretending the only evil in the world is our government won&#39;t prevent the resource wars that will come too soon.  You should stop pretending there are no other evil forces and accept the fact that, maybe, you don&#39;t know everything about how the world works.</p>

<p>Yes, we are all free to donate 1/4 - 1/3 of our pay to the governement. The rest of the time we are free to slave away at meaningless jobs for fiat Federal Reserve notes that have no value. We are all free to work for nothing. Yay!!</p>

<p>Did you get to eat breakfast? </p>

<p>Yes. I ate my GM franken food which is funded by the goverment. If I wanted to eat something that wasn&#39;t GM, I would have no real way of knowing if I was succeeding or not because the govt has blocked any labeling. If I choose to grow my own food, I am free to get my home raided by the military...oops, I mean the militarized police.</p>

<p>Doubtful, because I don&#39;t make enough money to feed myself and pay my bills, but it I did, the military has jack shit to do with it.</p>

<p>Cavemen had walking paths, no military needed!!!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you access the internet?</p>

<p>Yes, I am free to have everything I do captured, stored, sent to a fusion center somewhere, and profiled so that I can be arrested by the military if deemed a threat.</p>

<p>Hows that? You seem to think that if we didn&#39;t have a biggest, baddest, most kick-ass military in the world that we wouldn&#39;t exist. You completely fail to realize that the only reason we need to defend this country from &quot;terrorists&quot; is because the military forces its way into sovereign countries and kills civillians. You must also think that evil muslims attacked us on 9/11 because of our &quot;freedoms&quot;. I feel sorry for you.</p>

<p>Smurfette, you have <em>no</em> idea what sarcasm is or is not okay?  Seriously.  Get the fuck out.  Apologies for even <em>thinking</em> about giving you the benefit of the doubt in any previous statements I made.  You&#39;re just a plain idiot, sorry to say.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>That appears to be a pretty good dick move, antagonizing the people that protect you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You really, <strong>REALLY</strong> have to understand, Smurfalot, that these people DON&#39;T protect us.  They DON&#39;T.  You must understand that they&#39;re ruled over and take orders from an elite that are not interested in their protecting US - they&#39;re interested in using them to take over countries and acquire land that&#39;s not theirs.</p>

<p>They use the honor that these soldiers go in with and trample upon it with false promises and lies.  It is not antagonizing anyone if you go in there and let them know that they&#39;re being lied to.</p>

<p>Do you understand that?</p>

<p>That is not antagonizing.  It is doing your duty as a citizen by informing those that are meant to protect you that what they&#39;re doing is NOT protecting you.  The orders that they&#39;re following from the people that they&#39;re taking them from are hurting you as a citizen, and are hurting <em>them</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They have nothing to do with the decisions made about where they go, or what they do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  They&#39;re ignorant, right?  They don&#39;t know.  They&#39;re only supposed to do what they do without questioning.  Follow orders with honor - but don&#39;t question.</p>

<p>It would be even BETTER if they <em>do</em> question so that they can find out and see that the orders they&#39;re being given AREN&#39;T honorable.</p>

<p>Understand that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most just wanted to escape their past, or get an education. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is understood and granted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The military doesn&#39;t function well with the ideals they protect, so it bleeds over into their off time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then the world and the citizens need to do some <em>real</em> soul searching and question and wonder if the military and those that run it are the types that you really want to listen to and take orders from.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would they want the place they go to relax mentally to be another source of conflict?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because EVERY place in your life will be a source of conflict if you&#39;re called upon to do immoral things involving murdering other people and you don&#39;t question whether you should be doing it or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no conspiracy here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There doesn&#39;t <em>need</em> to be a conspiracy, nor am I assuming or saying there is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re a dick for doing that and they were right to ban you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m a dick for doing what?  For letting the people who are supposed to be sworn to protect us know that they&#39;re actually NOT doing what they&#39;re supposed to be sworn to do?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a dick move, Smurfette.  That&#39;s a service to the country.</p>

<p>I woke up today and still think that the idea of evil reptiles from other planets plotting against us is still bullshit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>lol.  It&#39;s not &quot;sleeping on it&quot; that&#39;s going to give you a different perspective.  It&#39;s looking at and critically examining the relevant information available.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether one objectively examines the data or not, however, the issue of reptilians is really small potatoes.  There are so many other issues on this planet that are hidden from people that deciding to fully investigate the issue of reptilians is of little consequence.</p>

<p>Someone who rejects the vast level of manipulation that exists on this planet by the 1% because &quot;the concept of reptilians is bullshit&quot; is missing the point of logical reasoning by at least a mile.</p>

<p>And everything I&#39;m claiming does not have to be true in order for you to still be patently incorrect in thinking that &quot;everything&quot; spoken about in r/conspiracy is false.  Don&#39;t know if you understand that or not.</p>

<p>Regardless, here&#39;s your first homework assignment:</p>

<p>Look up Dr. John Mack from Harvard and the research he&#39;s done.  If you can&#39;t understand the validity of his work, then you might not be able to get much further on things.</p>

<p>Proving how wrong you are is absolutely nothing for me or anyone to feel good or happy about, however, as I would love for all the signs to <em>not</em> be pointing in the direction that they&#39;re pointing.</p>
