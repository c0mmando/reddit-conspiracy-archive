<p>think about it this way - people can produce things at will, and take what they need, subject to overview and consent of the public.  nobody ever gets stuck doing something they hate, and nobody goes homeless or hungry, and no businesses go crazy and destroy the world in search of profit.</p>

<p>it works just fine, if you can educate people about how to participate in it.  </p>

<p>the last two links actually credit Nathan Rothschild (the earlier one) with starting the War of 1812, due to the expiry of the charter of the First Bank of the United States in 1811.  remember how there was a second war between the U.S. and Britain, a full 36 years after the revolution started?</p>

<p>i guess that&#39;s kind of a smoking gun.  i&#39;d definitely like to see a source for this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either the application for the renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rothschild agents who help with the creation of a central bank are usually rewarded with money, or marriage into the family, etc..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reality is that the USA was conned into fighting WW II to protect the Rothschild Zionist monetary system. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system</a></p>

<p>&quot;We were not foolish enough to try to make a currency coverage of gold of which we had none, but for every mark that was issued we required the equivalent of a mark&#39;s worth of work done or goods produced. . . .we laugh at the time our national financiers held the view that the value of a currency is regulated by the gold and securities lying in the vaults of a state bank.&quot;  -Adolf Hitler, 1937 (CC Veith, Citadels of Chaos, Meador, 1949.)   </p>

<p>&quot;And it proved sound. It worked. In less than ten years Germany became easily the most powerful state in Europe. It worked so magically and magnificently that it sounded the death knell of the entire (Zionist) Jewish money system. World Jewry knew that they had to destroy Hitler&#39;s system, by whatever means might prove necessary, or their own [system of usury] would necessarily die.   And if it died, with it must die their dream and their hope of making themselves masters of the world. The primary issue over which World War II was fought was to determine which money system was to survive. At bottom it was not a war between Germany and the so-called allies. Primarily it was war to the death between Germany and  the International Money Power.&quot; --William Gayley Simpson, &#39;Which Way Western Man&#39; (p.642) </p>

<p>I very much doubt it. If it was Washington Insiders, they would not be destroying the US economy. And make no mistake about it, the US economy is currently being thrown to the wolves. All the wealth generated over the last few decades has been transferred outside the country. </p>
