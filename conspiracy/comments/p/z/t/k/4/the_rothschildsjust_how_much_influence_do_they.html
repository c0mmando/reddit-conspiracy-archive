       I am sure it is a tried and true formula. Take over the banking and media ASAP. Then gradually pull all the resources into their businesses, capital funds, ect.

       it is definitely a very interesting topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       think about it this way - people can produce things at will, and take what they need, subject to overview and consent of the public.  nobody ever gets stuck doing something they hate, and nobody goes homeless or hungry, and no businesses go crazy and destroy the world in search of profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       it works just fine, if you can educate people about how to participate in it.

       They are not shareholders, they are lenders (bonds), which is very, very different. They lend banks/governments money, they do not invest in banks/governments or own them. This is their MO ( well besides diamonds/gold/bio-tech/pharmaceutics) and how they become rich. These are private firms with no publicly accountable information, so unless you break into their safes and find the ledgers you're not going to find shit for proof, they are not stupid.

       i'll tell you one thing, they view paper assets only as a medium for control, and precious metals (as well as land rights, properties, etc.) as "real wealth."  and guess which one can be easily hidden?

       here's are some good places to start:

       the last two links actually credit Nathan Rothschild (the earlier one) with starting the War of 1812, due to the expiry of the charter of the First Bank of the United States in 1811.  remember how there was a second war between the U.S. and Britain, a full 36 years after the revolution started?
      </p>
      <p>
       i guess that's kind of a smoking gun.  i'd definitely like to see a source for this quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Either the application for the renewal of the charter is granted, or the United States will find itself involved in a most disastrous war.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rothschild agents who help with the creation of a central bank are usually rewarded with money, or marriage into the family, etc..

       The Rothschilds don't have influence. They are influence. They
       <strong>
        are
       </strong>
       money. All those people who worship money are literally bowing down to the alter of Rothschild. They have trancended beyond the power of royalty and religions. They are the new world order.

       "We were not foolish enough to try to make a currency coverage of gold of which we had none, but for every mark that was issued we required the equivalent of a mark's worth of work done or goods produced. . . .we laugh at the time our national financiers held the view that the value of a currency is regulated by the gold and securities lying in the vaults of a state bank."  -Adolf Hitler, 1937 (CC Veith, Citadels of Chaos, Meador, 1949.)

       "And it proved sound. It worked. In less than ten years Germany became easily the most powerful state in Europe. It worked so magically and magnificently that it sounded the death knell of the entire (Zionist) Jewish money system. World Jewry knew that they had to destroy Hitler's system, by whatever means might prove necessary, or their own [system of usury] would necessarily die.   And if it died, with it must die their dream and their hope of making themselves masters of the world. The primary issue over which World War II was fought was to determine which money system was to survive. At bottom it was not a war between Germany and the so-called allies. Primarily it was war to the death between Germany and  the International Money Power." --William Gayley Simpson, 'Which Way Western Man' (p.642)

       I have no doubt a group of shadowy figures control much of what happens in this world, however, I doubt it's a family of old money and lean more towards Washington Insiders who were at the healm of major corporations.
      </p>

       Look more towards Goldman Sachs and Haliburton and less towards The Masons, the Rothschilds, etc.

       I disagree, as Goldman Sachs and Haliburton are corporations that cannot print their own cash. They are still subject to the ebb and flow of central banking.

       Goldman Sachs and Haliburton are the bishops and knights of the Rothschilds, but more likely the pawns.

       I very much doubt it. If it was Washington Insiders, they would not be destroying the US economy. And make no mistake about it, the US economy is currently being thrown to the wolves. All the wealth generated over the last few decades has been transferred outside the country.
