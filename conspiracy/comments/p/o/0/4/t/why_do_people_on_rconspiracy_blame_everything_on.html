       Seriously, I don't get it.   Are you all suffering from cognitive dissonance or what?   Sure Israel meddles with countries at it's borders, but the US is
       <em>
        invading
       </em>
       countries all over the world, and for a looong time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are people here more pissed at Israel than the US?

       I guess its pretty tricky to tell if oneself is in the category.  I mean much of human progress is thought to be related to standing on the shoulders of giants and so we naturally look for others for guidance and knowledge.

       If you read the very top comment here you might be persuaded the concept of nation is somewhat illusory.  That being said , in respect of slimbruddah's comment on britain, The city of london (square mile) seems pretty mysterious and a hub for financial control.

       tttttt0ttttt belives that the Jews of Europe are the "synagogue of Satan" spoken of in the book of Revelations and not Jews at all, but inferior Turkic Khazars (likely the descendant of Cain, which explain their inherent greedy and underhanded nature) who have suppressed all information of their true heritage to deceive the world. With that in mind, it's likely that he believes the Jews were given their power through a deal with Satan.

       The US "Christian" has been indoctrinated by a bible which for the most part was invented by

       Look into Evangelical designs on engineering the second coming. According to the Bible, the state of Israel is in existence at the time of the second coming and, as such, the evangelical population of the US has become unlikely allies with Zionists. Some are so heavily invested in seeing this idea come about that they are trying to engineer some of the preconditions for the second coming (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_heifer">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_heifer
       </a>
       ). That's a link to the article where Clyde Lott, a rancher who's teamed up with a Rabbi organization to try and engineer the red heifer described in the bible that is necessary for the sanctification of the "Third Temple" in Jerusalem.

       So are you saying there is no logical reason throughout history for this persecution?  Its an honest question as I have read some bits and pieces before about jews seeing themselves as the chosen people and other humans being animals in comparison.  I believe it is written in the talmud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Undoubtedly a certain subsection of the jewish people are genetically more intelligent than other ethnic groups.  That might be a generalisation but Jew stephen pinker seems to agree with the premise and also notes that even accounting for this elevated IQ are disproportionately represented in the U.s in positions of power and influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if the persecution factor is actually a factor that helps with jewish success .  A people who fear others and group together effectively acting in their own interest are much more likely to be more successful than the sum of their parts might suggest.

       And do you know why?
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Jews belong to a dark and repulsive force. One knows how numerous this clique is, how they stick together and what power they exercise through their unions. They are a nation of
       <strong>
        rascals and deceivers
       </strong>
       .” ~ Marcus Tullius Cicero. 106-43 BCE.
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <strong>
        Usury
       </strong>
       is the practice of lending money at excessive interest rates. This has for centuries caused great misery and poverty for Gentiles. It has brought strong condemnation of the Jews!" ~ Diodorus Siculus, fl. 1st century.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Jews should not be allowed to keep what they have obtained from others by usury; it were best that they were compelled to work so that they could earn their living instead of doing nothing but becoming
       <strong>
        avaricious
       </strong>
       .” ~ Thomas Aquinas, c.1225-1274.
      </p>
      <p>
       “
       <strong>
        Jewish usurers bleed the poor to death and grow fat on their substance
       </strong>
       , and I who live on alms, who feed on the bread of the poor, shall I then be mute before outraged charity? Dogs bark to protect those who feed them, and I, who am fed by the poor, shall I see them robbed of what belongs to them and keep silent?” ~ Bernidino of Feltro, fl. 15th century. (E. Flornoy, Le Bienbeureux Bernardin the Feltre)
      </p>
      <p>
       “But the Jews are so hardened that they listen to nothing; though overcome by testimonies they yield not an inch. It is a pernicious race,
       <strong>
        oppressing all men by their usury and rapine
       </strong>
       . If they give a prince or magistrate a thousand florins, they extort twenty thousand from the subjects in payment. We must ever keep on guard against them.” ~ Martin Luther, 1483-1546.
      </p>
      <p>
       “All the world suffers from the
       <strong>
        usury of the Jews, their monopolies and deceit
       </strong>
       . They have brought many unfortunate people into a state of poverty, especially the farmers, working class people and the very poor.” ~ Pope Clement VIII, 1536-1605.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Jews who have arrived would nearly all like to remain here, but learning that they (with their customary
       <strong>
        usury and deceitful trading with the Christians
       </strong>
       ) were very repugnant to the inferior magistrates... that the
       <strong>
        deceitful
       </strong>
       race... not be allowed further to infect and trouble this new colony.” ~ Peter Stuyvesant, c.1612-1672, Director General of New Netherland. (Letter to the Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch West India Company, from New Amsterdam, September 22, 1654.)
      </p>
      <p>
       “Henceforth no Jew, no matter under what name, will be allowed to remain here without my written permission. I know of no other troublesome pest within the state than this race, which impoverished the people by their
       <strong>
        fraud, usury and money-lending and commit all deeds which an honorable man despises
       </strong>
       . Subsequently they have to be removed and excluded from here as much as possible.” ~ Maria Theresa, 1717-1780, Queen of Hungary, Croatia &amp; Bohemia; Archduchess of Austria. (1744).
      </p>
      <p>
       “In whatever country Jews have settled in any great number... and when opposed have tried to
       <strong>
        strangle that country to death financially
       </strong>
       , as in the case of Spain and Portugal... For over 1,700 years, the Jews have been bewailing their sad fate... They cannot live only among themselves. They must subsist on... other people not of their race... If you do not exclude them from these United States, in their Constitution, in less than 200 years they will have swarmed here in such great numbers that they will dominate and devour the land and change our form of government, for which we Americans have shed our blood, given our lives our substance and jeopardized our liberty... If you do not exclude them, in less than 200 years our descendants will be working in the fields to furnish them substance, while
       <strong>
        they will be in the counting houses rubbing their hands
       </strong>
       . I warn you, gentlemen, if you do not exclude Jews for all time, your children will curse you in your graves.” ~ Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1790. From the dairy of General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a delegate from South Carolina, 1787.
      </p>
      <p>
       "When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes. Money has no motherland;
       <strong>
        financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain
       </strong>
       ." ~ Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821, Referring to the Rothschilds' financing both sides of the England-France war.
      </p>
      <p>
       “They are the great moneylenders and loan contractors of the world… The consequence is that the nations of the world are groaning under heavy systems of taxation and national debt. They have ever been the greatest enemies of freedom.” 
~ Charles Wyndham Stanhope, 1809-1881, 7th Earl of Harrington (Speech in the House of Lords, July 12, 1858)
      </p>
      <p>
       "I know in expressing with this frankness my ultimate opinion of the Jews, I expose myself to enormous danger. Many people share it, but very few dare to express it publicly, for the Jewish sect...constitutes today a veritable power in Europe. It reigns despotically in commerce, in the banks, and it has invaded three-quarters of German journalism, and a very considerable portion of the journalism of other countries. Woe, then, to him who has the clumsiness to displease it!" ~ Mikhail Bakunin, 1814-1876, Russian revolutionary. (Study of the German Jews, 1869)

       The main source for information about the world that is not available through one's own direct experience is the media. And in America the media is controlled largely by Jews. The information the media serves up is carefully filtered to comport well with Jewish ethno-politics.

       His point is trying to take the blame off Israel and put it on the US. Zionists always do this -- they try to mitigate the crimes of Israel by pointing out the failings of other countries, as if that has anything to do with Israel's crimes. It's misdirection.

       Because, first off, Israel is a front organization set up by the UN for political reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, Israel, which ties in to my first point, is a mistake in itself. That land never belonged to any Jew. That said, this isn't about hating on Jews exactly, (though it's warranted as much as the next race goes - niggers are lazy and promote crime - Mexicans work for less than the politicized average american and are happy to do so - etc etc) this is about a much larger scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, as my first point said, Israel is a front so, naturally, it's the one that gets the blame. The fact that Jews are associated with a farce was no mistake. And for that reason you can learn for yourself from any biblical scholar, or even a skin-head. Hell, read the Talmud, that'll tell you all you need to know.

       I recently say a documentary by an israel called 'defamation' I'd recommend it to anyone with any kind of interest in Israel.  It follwed the reporter on his journey to seek out anti semitism in the Ue.S . he gained access to abe foxmann the chief of the ADL.  Now make of this what you will but whether or not foxman was being dishonest with his remark, there was a point where foxman points out that he likes to play up his and the jewish lobby's influence in the U.S.  If that is the case and if there is much of this kind of thing going on then people are going to be suspicous of israels influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is undoubtedly a very resourceful country and by all accounts fought wars on multiple front without much help from the U.S some  decades ago.   Oil is an important consideration as is the petro dollar and in many peoples eyes Israel is in essence a U.S military base.

        /r/conspiracy

       don't seem to understand is that it's neither "Israel", or "America" - it's that the same club of high financiers out of London and New York(yes, some of which are "Jewish" - but it sure as fuck is not the same kind of Judaism given to the ignorant masses at the Synagogues, as is the same with the "Protestant" nobility, and the "Catholic" nobility, it's best to blend in if you intend to lead a herd) control both and direct them to the same ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those ends are NOT "zionism", zionism is one more pixel in a much larger picture of global dominance of the few over the many - it's really not that difficult to understand, and our resident jewbashers seem to be easily confused about this, having looked into and realized "hey, it's not racist, those zionists are evil!"; yes, that is true, but they aren't the end-all be-all, and if you looked into any other great power in the world you would realize the same is true about them.

       Maybe conspiracy theorists who blame israel/jews/zionists are like religous folk who believe things written down years ago without evidence.  I think people call that freedom of religion.  Some would say that is freedom to believe what you want which perhaps should apply in this case.

       I don't hate Zionist, I hate Jews.. These people are responsible for the major religious dogmas. They admit themselves that they are a corrosive force to, border, ethnicities, social institutions, patriotism, among others.

       As a pantheist, I agree that all theist religions are terrible for humanity.

       We've all heard how successful the 'divide and conquer' strategy is.  Religion more than anything else, effectively divides us into pieces.

       But don't hate jews, 99.9999% don't think for themselves (as llllllllll_ eloquently explains above), and that goes for people of all religions.

       Most Jews are not even religious. Many of the Jews who go to synagogue every Saturday are atheists. They go for the Jewish ethnic networking, not because they believe all the mumbo-jumbo about Abraham.

       I'm sorry, but in the thread where OP asks for a
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       to your opinion, you don't state that opinion again, but, provide reason.
