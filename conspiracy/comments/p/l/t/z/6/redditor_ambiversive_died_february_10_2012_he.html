       I am Ambiversive's ex-girlfriend. We were together for nine months in 2007 and also back together these past two months until he broke up with me 2 weeks ago via email and I never saw him again. I knew he was depressed but I had no idea how serious it was. In 2007 we did fight about the amount of time he spent alone on the computer but this time around we didn't. He also didn't have a lot of friends and I believe I am the only one his parents called. But I know he spent a lot of time here. He would have turned 30 in six weeks. I wanted you all to know. He was a trained programmer and we have lost his gifts. I don't think I understood the full extent of his talent in engineering because my degrees are in social science. In the summer he was also a common sight downtown where he would sell people drawings he did and spend a lot of time talking to whoever passed by. He suffered from bipolar disorder and my last attempt to get him to go to therapy was met with derision. Still he was a playful, fun-loving guy, extremely aware of his words and actions but with rapidly declining self-esteem through the years. So please if you are feeling depressed seek help and talk to the people around you. Don't be afriad to get help for your depressed friends as well. thanks

       Ambiversive exposed some great articles on this subreddit and
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       shared his opinion through the comments. He was a very active member of r/conspiracy, his input will be missed around here by both 'the lovers' and 'the haters'. Im sorry to hear he has gone, i offer my condolences to his friends and family.....and to you lolcats_cradle. Thank you for taking the time to let us know this tragic news, stay strong, im so sorry someone close to you has gone. Rest In Peace Ambiversive.

       Oh Jesus, I am so sorry he did that. Although I've seen some conflicts between him and other parties, he was not an evil guy and he was sincere in his posts and he did have an inquiring attitude towards the world. I know some of his posts showed that open and explorative attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       I urge anyone who suffers from depression to talk with other people when and if things get bad, you're not alone, not everything is hopeless. If someone has been hit with a disorder, sometimes there are drugs that can stabilize a person and level out ups and downs.

       thanks Pork2001. I think Reddit was a good outlet for him. Sadly with someone so intelligent with a mental illness they can be very good at hiding things from you.

       Well, I'm sorry for you as his friend to have gone through this, You are good to have posted and told people so they could know.  If you see his folks again you can tell them he had some friends on here who considered him a good guy who cared enough about this community to do some volunteer work moderating material here.

       As for hiding, yes. My ex had multiple personality disorder and was very good at hiding things. So it's not always easy to know the depths.

       I have been reflecting on this deeply all day because in the last week, in my professional life, I was able to talk two people down; one threatening and one despondent. Sometimes it is to end the pain and sometimes it is overwhelming despair. Why should anyone continue to remain conscious of only suffering or to continue to feel alone and hopeless just because that isn't true for us? I cannot express this paradox anymore clearly: on the one hand we want to respect a person's decision to live his life and end it how he chooses; on the other we want to intervene (and make promises we know we may not be able to keep).

       I'm sorry for your loss and thank you for your post. Depression is a terrible burden to those who experience it, and their loved ones. It's like an impenetrable wall for many, choosing to dwell and bottle things up inside, it slowly eats away at you day by day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure Ambiversive had made his own peace and taken much time to consider his actions and ultimately his final decision to move on. Try and take strength from that if you can, it was his wish to go. Suicide is like a bomb under the kitchen table, no one expects it, totally devastating for the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many young men commit suicide, more than ever it would seem. The burdens of this world weighs heavy on the minds of those who are aware, myself included, i have taken strength from your story as i too have severe bouts of depression and it has indeed cost me many friends and relationships - including my own daughter. So it perpetuates, the depression leads to isolation that in turn causes deeper set problems, regret and lament.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not doubt that something remains after our deaths, a part of us moves on, having fed upon this mortal, limited life our souls grow eternal towards the endless light. Like rain falling to the ocean we are all one and everything is connected. The mansion of eternity has many rooms, never doubt you will see his face again.

       thank you. This has left people here shocked and in disbelief, wondering how he could have believed that was his only option left. My Mom and I think if he had waited even a few days, his outlook would have improved. He really wanted a cat and I was about to get him one as a surprise. Now I'm never going to know how the cat would have improved his outlook on life and I think this is going to stay with me for a long time. I think for socially isolated people pets can be very helpful so you should consider one if you have gone through depression.

       I knew a talented guy with Bi Polar disorder who was hospitalized three times within a year and ended up losing his job. After losing his job he lost his insurance. The company has since gone out of business. Then he was bankrupted by the cost of treatment. Last I heard this all led to a divorce. What a mess.

       He wasn't employed but we live in Newfoundland in Canada so no one needs to pay for healthcare here. We've had universal healthcare for well over 40 years. Drugs often incur a cost to the user but his family was fairly well off so money wasn't an issue.

       And this my fellow conspirators is why I preach tolerance, understanding and forgiveness. So often we talk badly to one another here and we rely on the fact that the person you are talking to can handle it. I have even had people say things here on reddit that really made me feel terrible about myself because I knew what they were saying was true. I had some changes to make to myself if I ever wanted to be able to really happy with me. I have been able to successfully go through this on my own, but that makes me one of the lucky ones. My encounters with ambiversive were adversarial at times, and in hindsight I probably was not as nice to him as I should have been. I regret this so much. In a way this makes me feel slightly responsible. Not directly of course, but in an indirect way. I feel like a real asshole now. I never knew he was this unstable or I never would have thought about talking badly to him. I had to say this because I really feel awful about contributing to the depression and anxiety that led to him taking his own life. He never deserved this. From now on I will redouble my efforts to be kind to everyone here and to give compassion like never before. We are a community here and we need to look after one another.

       If anyone here ever feels like suicide is the right option, please shoot me a pm. I will be happy to talk. Just please, talk to someone before you attempt anything. You might not live to regret it if you don't. No one dies on my watch because they feel like no one cares. I care. I really really do. You are my brothers and sisters. Losing any of you is like losing a friend. I am really sad now.

       Nobody is to blame for this 9000sins. I knew him in real life, was aware he had been hospitalized for a breakdown in his early twenties and I still started a relationship with him and acted very immature when it started to go downhill. I am glad to have met him but I probably made him feel just as bad, if not worse, than anyone he communicated with online.

       Thank you for the reassurance. I still can't shake the feelings that I am having right now though. I will promise you this. I will make every effort as a moderator here to make sure that his memory will live on. I am now talking to the other mods about posting links to r/SuicideWatch in the sidebar. It may seem inappropriate for this sub, but as this instance shows we are a particularly high risk group for suicide. This will never happen again to anyone here if I can help it.

       as a person spreading the truth about these criminals for close to 5 years, know that we understand any aggression we receive. Most of us struggled hard against the truth when we began to awaken. Its a natural process, 1st they ignore you, next they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win. But to get a person to go from laugh to fight, is the same as convincing a person to put their hand into a fire. The 'extreme change' in perceived reality causes a response of "fear/pain". I do not believe I ever had the pleasure of talking to ambiverse, but I'm sure he took the things you may have said as the "fighting" process was going well, and even happy to see it.

       It's a little different than that. We got along on issues involving our political ideals and such, it was his moderation style here that was our main point of contention. If he had retained his mod position he might have stuck around. My main point here was that I contributed to his sorrow by making a stink about his style of running things, and I am sorry that I did. I wasn't the only one, but I was part of a crowd that ultimately stripped him of his modship and maybe contributed to his suicidal thoughts and tendencies. I am not blaming myself, because ultimately this was his decision. But if I had more compassion for his suffering maybe things would have been different. I'm so sorry amibiversive. I never meant to push you if I did. =(

       I'm so sorry to hear this. It makes me so sad to learn that we have lost one of our own. He was difficult to get along with at times, but he was a good guy. I hope you are able to find peace in this rough time. Suicide is never the right choice. I wish there was something I could have done.

       If this is real - then how fucking terrible I am so sorry. We had many disagreements recently over his modship and layout changes. I can't help but think that I was a link in this tragic chain of events even if it was never personal. As someone around the same age who has been through some shit I really wish we could have talked more. Once again, that's if this is real and not an elaborate psyop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though he was a bad moderator, he was a smart guy and a valued contributor to ours, and the greater human community at large. He knew more about permaculture than almost anyone I've met IRL or online. If this really happened, it's tragic losing someone with that kind of knowledge and passion. There just aren't enough of them out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit - It's either this story is true or that this has all been a psyop perpetrated on us. I hate to think it but it's a definite possibility considering you've given us no name, city, obit, other proof. It's hard for me to decide. Call me cold-blooded and if I'm wrong then I'm sorry I'm an asshole- my condolences were real. But I'm unable to decide how to feel with so little verifiable information.

       i had a similar thing happen to me a couple of years ago. She also stole my guitar that I used to record with (2 years later and I STILL can't afford to replace it. There goes my artistic outlet for depression as well). My friends weren't there for me at all and I ended up practically living outdoors for almost a year. I was living with the girl and I had no income at the time and nowhere to go. No one to depend on. I thought about suicide occasionally, but every time the thoughts crept up on me I told myself I was stronger than that. And I was. I eventually gave up. On everyone. This may sound depressing, but in the end it helped me to learn to rely on myself and no one else. I have also learned a valuable skill. The ability to make myself numb to emotional pain. In the end our story is similar, except I had no one to depend on. I had to make my own way back and it sucked.

       RIP Ambiverse. You no longer have to suffer. Wish it didn't come down to that. We are almost the same age and I've battled depression quite a bit. It got really bad 2 years ago. I remember hitting rock bottom, then a week later everything changed. Now I feel like I'm in a really good place in my life. I wish you would have waited just a little longer to see if things would get better. I don't know you, but it appears you touched a lot of people.

       This is the first time I've come across something like this where I "knew" (read) what a person thought and felt about that believed in similar things, or at least had a similar mindset to question reality and wonder what the fuck is actually going on.

       And lolcats_cradle, thanks for taking the time to post this.  If there is any afterlife, I'm sure he appreciates it.  If not, the community does.  When I pass on, I hope someone like you takes the time to notify people I know what went down, or to offer any sort of solace as to how or why anything happened.

       I've just found out and am sadden to tears.  Ambi was one of my first friends on reddit and I am so very sorry he got to that state and even sorrier I wasn't a better friend to him.

       I have a drawing of his titled The Dancers. I made a coat for him and we traded.  He told me his grandmother was sorry he had traded it away.  If his family would like the drawing I would be only too happy to send it to them.

       I believe they would want you to keep it to remember him. I am keeping a few of his pieces and the rooms where the wake took place were filled with his artwork. I will look for the coat when I look through his apartment. His folks said I could have anything I wanted from it. If you want I can send it back to you or if not, I'd like to keep it.

       That's a beautifu coat. You must be a really talented craftsperson. There was a picture of him wearing it at the wake. Also that drawing was framed and set up next to a sceen showing pictures of his life.

       It means a lot to me that he loved the coat.  He told me that he wore it a lot and that's a comfort though I'm still having a difficult time accepting all of this.  I mean I know it's true I just wish so much that it wasn't.

       Fuck.  I love you, man.  I wish I could've been there when you needed me.  Timing's a bitch, and we're only human.  I'm sorry for letting you down.  I'm sorry for your family, and your friends.  You had them even if you didn't realize it and we weren't always able to show it.  I don't know what's best for myself, let alone what was best for you.   Our world is a shitty place but it's much worse off now than it was with you here.  Dammit, I'm sorry.

       Is this the same guy that changed the look of r/conspiracy and caused a ruckus by banning people who complained? I see he is no longer a mod either. Was it because of that or his death?

       Rest in peace Ambiversive. I'm very sorry for your loss :( I'm sure he is in a happy place now.

       I've been feeling rather down lately too, perhaps it comes with realizing the real world view and how much wrong there is going on.

       Since this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       I will ask you this - you are sure that it was suicide and not that he found/spread some information which someone didn't like? Impossible to know I guess, and maybe far-fetched. Just wanted to ask.

       No, I'm absolutely certain it was a suicide and I think he might have been paranoid about being watched. He simply had a mental illness and could not accept it.

       Can you log into his computer?   If so, what was the last website shown in his browser history?   Maybe you'll be able to figure out what triggered his suicide if you find out what he was last thinking about.

       His last post...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Anonymous is a police/military intelligence operation designed to attract hacktivists and incriminate them by association. It is composed of two parts, the 'attracting' part, which, on the surface, appears to assist the cause of truth by releasing hidden information, and the 'incriminating' part, which appears to attack police, military, or governmental organizations. However, when they release information they are only releasing what the powers that be want released, and when they attack they do so only for appearances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the Guy Fawkes mask, a symbol of explosive violence. Consider the massive corporate funding behind making it a recognizable image. Consider their catchphrase 'We are legion.' which is straight out of the Bible (from the mouths of demons). Consider the so-called 'leaderless' nature, which allows for anyone to claim to 'be' a part of the group. Consider the escalation of targets, first it was Scientology, which attracted many, and then recently it is police departments worldwide? Also they are planning to 'take down' the Internet? Is this what a free-speech oriented organization would do?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is widely known that the voting on reddit is manipulated by the powers that be, so if you want the truth on Anonymous, look no further than the most downvoted posts in the threads about them.

       My condolences go out to his friends and family.
