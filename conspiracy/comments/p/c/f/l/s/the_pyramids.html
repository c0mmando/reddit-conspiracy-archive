<p>Histories Mysteries: Secrets of the Pyramids and the Sphinx.</p>

</ul>

<p>These two are well-compiled, well-presented videos. History channel or some shit. Good place to start... and get warmed up.</p>

<p>Secrets of the Pyramids</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_gETS401SM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_gETS401SM</a>
40 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a lecture of a sort. Camera man fell asleep, I think. I probably should have excluded this one, but I think the debunking of the &quot;post cave man era built these&quot; theory needed emphasis... and this guy kinda says it in a way we&#39;re all thinking.</p>

<hr/>

<p>So, if they&#39;re obviously not pharoahs&#39; tombs, what are they?</p>

<hr/>

<p>One theory</p>

<p>Solving the Pyramid Mystery</p>

<ul>
<li>Part 1 (Pyramidion Part 2A): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv8CB9VURNc">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv8CB9VURNc</a>
8 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>If this guy is right, would the use of something like this (the focused heat within the atmosphere) contribute to atmospheric warming? or would it, on balance, be a no-effect (it&#39;s still the same amount of sunlight hitting the earth, just some of it is being focused purposefully)? Oh, and... is this the Sun God reference?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Part 2 (Pyramidion Part 2B): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMhyPNme_fs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMhyPNme_fs</a>
8 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Part 3 (Pyramidion Part 2C): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWYJ82iXnWo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWYJ82iXnWo</a>
6 minutes</p></li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Another Theory</p>

<p>The secrets hidden in the pyramids of Egypt (Harun Yahya)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiMMERUpaNY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiMMERUpaNY</a>
11 minutes</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>So, there was this legendary advanced civilization, &quot;Atlantis&quot; or whatever you want to call it. It had this advanced technology. It was wiped out in a cataclysmic flood (the undersea pyramids off the coast of Japan). The surviving peoples re-established cultures and developed myths and religions to preserve the memory of that ancient, destroyed civilization (Noah/Gilgamesh). The pharoah kings pillaged the gold platings from these &quot;power plants&quot; or whatever they were, and took it all with them to their grave... these were the first few generations in charge of trying to preserve the remnants of the destroyed society. They, too, succumbed to various human frailties (hubris, war, etc.).</p>

<p>The collapse basically continued all the way through the fall of Rome. After which, humanity began struggling with being at the bottom. Science began to recover, but in the darkest secret corners at first. Almost taboo. Until it gained institutionalized acceptance - creating a whole new hurdle of &quot;taboo thought&quot; which had to be overcome... until ... finally....</p>

<p>Here we are today, actually taking a serious look at this ancient technology.</p>

<p>Close?</p>

<p>EDIT: Added another theory video about the purpose of the pyramids.</p>

<p>If the immediate proximity to the Nile and the associated astrological mythology aren&#39;t reason enough (evidenced in the first two videos, ala the pyramids in reference to the Nile and the stars of Orion&#39;s belt in reference to the Milky Way)...</p>

<p>... It is certainly conceivable, possible, and to a degree likely, that this would be answered along with &quot;why does the sphinx show evidence of intense water erosion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;However, the vessel may not have been designed for sailing (no rigging) or paddling (no room).</p>

<p>The history and function of the ship are not precisely known. It is of the type known as a &quot;solar barge&quot;, a ritual vessel to carry the resurrected king with the sun god Ra across the heavens&quot;</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s less, in fact. It&#39;s dismissal which serves only the hubris of institutional dogma, the same mentality that says &quot;it must have been the first early post-stone-age people who built the pyramids with copper chisels and stone hammers, because that&#39;s the only explanation that fits with current evolutionary time lines&quot;.</p>

<p>Hmm you might want to check your history books man. Rome didn&#39;t fall until 1452 for example. Science was not lost to the Byzantine Empire, nor to the Ottoman Empire, nor to the Indian subcontinent, and of course it was in no way lost to the Chinese Civilization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, are you saying the Chinese know how to power up these pyramids and make them operational again?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to argue with self-styled pseudo-academia about the triviata of the details of the institutional version of history (since the videos above show that the institutional versions can&#39;t be trusted for their accuracy or relevance - it all has to be taken with a grain of salt). </p>

<p>Furthermore, (and I find it difficult to fathom that you were unable to grasp, not only my previous point, but this as well), the point here is that there was an advanced civilization (not officially acknowledged by modern institutional academia) one day... and the next (figuratively speaking) it was gone.</p>

<p>And while the people alive in the aftermath began their new existences within the structural shells of their predecessors, they all continued to fall/collapse/decay... the only thing remaining of the pre-cataclysm society is myth and legend.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, you can pull some evidence out of your ass that the Byzantine, Ottoman, Indian, Chinese, or whoever... can fire up those pyramids and give us a demonstration this afternoon.</p>

<p>After the fall of Rome humanity was not at the bottom, only western Europe. Get your history right.</p>

<p>Also there was not an advanced ancient civilization, there have been many, many advanced civilizations before this one, and they all collapse its life&#39;s cycle.</p>

<p>Do you have any idea how absurdly ridiculous that is? No. Obviously, you don&#39;t or you wouldn&#39;t have posted it, right? And your arrogant delivery of this outright stupidity only reflects upon you, &quot;Jack&quot;.</p>

<p>meaning: You just made a huge ass of yourself in front of God and everyone on the internet. Have a nice life, if you can manage to live this down.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>watching any of the videos in my original post,</p></li>
<li><p>or providing any citation whatsoever to support what you&#39;ve said</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the intensity of your melodramatization belies a couple other things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>you know that no matter what the current state of discussion is about the Japanese &quot;natural rock formations&quot; turns out to be, it doesn&#39;t do anything to discredit the remainder of what I posted (above), and, thus...</p></li>
<li><p>you know that no matter where this discussion goes, it&#39;s moot and irrelevant, because Japan is a nuclear wasteland now.</p></li>
