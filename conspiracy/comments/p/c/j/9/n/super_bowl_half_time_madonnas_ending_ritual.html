       To me it looked like they got in symbolic robes, the dark over powered the white, the song is totally about worshiping something dark that makes you feel "great". There was a huge eye on the projector, and at the end it said world peace. Meaning they are doing this as a ritual to bring a dark power to bring false world peace.

       The entire half time show was 13 minutes of continuous Illuminati/Satanic symbolism.

       Here's my beef with all of these Illuminati/Satanic conspiracies...and that site you linked, too....they make no damn sense. Not only that, they're rooted in hardcore Christian theology that I just can't jive with. After reading some more posts on that site, here's how the writer feels about gay people:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The homosexuality that we see in America, is strictly coming from man made chemicals(BPA), which are deliberately being added to almost all of the plastic products which are sold in stores. But,the end game wasn’t homosexuality but instead it was trying to figure out a way to shrink brain size &amp; make people more controllable, so that when the Government says jump off a bridge, the dummy populations would jump off that bridge. Look at how most homosexual men tend to have brains which are stunted and stuck, in the realm of an adolescent female."
      </p>
      <p>
       He later continues with "No one wants to hear that their lifestyle or brain isn’t from God or that they are basically walking toxic waste but most gay people are nothing but toxic waste dumps, who eat fast food constantly &amp; are pretty much chemical enhanced and altered from birth due to the stupidity of their parents...Hollywood’s job is to come along and make one think that homosexuality, to the extremes which we now see it in 2011 America, is natural, which is why they have that He-She mixed thing (Chez Bono) on Dancing with the Stars."
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, what the fuck is that nonsense? I'm not denying that the SB halftime show wasn't a little weird, but every time I read about it being some sort of ritual, it just turns into crap like that, where they just start bashing gays, non-Christians, overt sexuality, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that site also had a bunch of photos of politicians caught in mid-wave, and it tries to depict them as throwing up some sort of "hand signal."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all down to hear everyone's theories, but when it turns into theology, slurs, and misleading pictures, then it's gotta' get tossed.

       This is the problem, Thinking of an idea and then looking for evidence that suits it, rather than looking objectively at the evidence.

       Straight up. This shit is so fucking deep.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so up front as of 2 years ago. This is getting very real very fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe this is actually happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like fuck! Look at what they just did on the most watched television day of the year!
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not Satanic. It's a dark ritual. Satan is a metaphor for dark which Christians confuse with a human like deity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was littered with dark symbolism.

       I'm sorry but I keep seeing your shit plastered everywhere about how you claim this isn't satanic and it simply is "dark".
      </p>
      <p>
       That is "simply" not the case. You may not believe it is satanic, but there are people who do believe it is satanic, and actively worship satan/luficer. These people are the "elite".
The word dark is hardly ever used, the connections to satan and lucifer however are frequently used. This halftime show was just proof of the connection, it's simple to see if you actually took the time to research it.

       when you say 'dark' its too much of a flippen term to use. The dark arts that we see is part of occultism which is in a sense satanic ritual.

       Yes, but it has to be realized that the people that it would need to piss off (i.e.
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       ) have been rendered VERY complacent and docile by a whole slew of methods, medication, entertainment, sports, etc, etc . . . Those people (again, us) have been conditioned literally from BIRTH to march to the beat of the status quo even when they
       <em>
        disagree
       </em>
       with that beat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  If all (or even most) of those people were to stand up and go against the elite, the elite would stand NO chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the people are too weak, and lazy, and content, and spoiled to do much more than lift an occasional, sleepy eyebrow at the constant wrongs that are being perpetrated against us on a near constant basis.  We tend to go right back to sleep when the news and the radio tells us not to worry, there's nothing wrong . . . go back to sleep.

      <p>
       And this is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       how they want you to keep thinking.  So long as you think this way, you won't act too vehemently over the wrongs you witness on a daily basis.  You won't react to the noose that is tightening around your neck.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's if and when we start to wake up and realize just how fabricated and manipulated our world has been and still is that enough of us will stand up and fight against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, not enough of us are awake.

       Madonna, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher are into Kabbalah.

       This is from Ynetnews a Jewish website.
       <em>
        Demi Moore, a follower of Kabbalah, has been undergoing intense spiritual counseling since being released from the hospital. Her faith in the Jewish mysticism has allowed her to view her current troubles as gift from which she can learn and grow.

       This is the post I was looking for. Madonna is a Kabbalah nut, so any imagery would be directly linked to it. When she was married to Guy Ritchie he made a movie called Revolver, which is absolutely riddled with imagery and parables pulled directly from Kabbalah.

       Check out that symbol! We have a crown, the Madonna in a red center circle, and olive branches around the outside - not to mention the red star at the bottom. It brings the phrase "Royal Womb" to mind.

       It's Madonna.  She's always put on artistic stage shows and it was the Superbowl so they had tons of money and cross promotion to throw at it.  However there was some interesting symbolism involved.  I'm not saying it was or wasn't some secret message, just that perspective is needed.

       In addition it seems, to me, far more that Madonna is offering herself up as an item of worship rather than anything else.

       I mean when they flashed the World Peace I think it was suppose to engage you emotionally even if it was largely fake and most of the video advertised Vogue. Other than that I do not see anything devious just using the current entertainment culture to make another wild super bowl performance. Weird yes.. Illuminati symbolism I seriously doubt it granted I do not put much legitimacy in the whole symbolism conspiracy. I think humans in their attempt to define what they don't know have created much of the mysticism within the Masons and other groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend brought up a good point with rap music. They mention the Illuminati, but many black people believe in it anyways so really the artist could just put in the symbolism himself. Essentially creating some mystery within their video.

XD joke aside, if this true I wont be surprised, ppl like Madonna only care 'bout money, so I think this show was a big spell to cater new fans, if this false, well I will say that was on purpose to generate reddit hits, pageviews, twitts and so on...

       In a time when America is in economic misery, many people are jobless and homeless, families living on the street, and we are at war in multiple countries, we need a halftime show that is uplifting and encouraging. And what did we get? A tribute to darkness and barbarism. The people who created this halftime show are sick and I'm thinking of writing the advertising sponsors and telliing them they can take their products and shove them.

       I made a strange realization the other day. Songs were not originally just entertainment. They were magical spells. The musicians were the sorcerers and witches, and they influenced small groups of people with their songs. Fast forward to the present day and songs are still being used the same way, just on a massive scale. Most musicians have no clue how powerful they really are.

       What is the Mxo symbol seen on the flags and on the stage (watch when she exits the throne as well as shortly after LMFAO). It's everywhere.

       I see that it contains MADONNA. However, there may be a benign explanation that I don't know.

       Do you find it amusing that Madonna worships the anti-Christ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason people like Madonna worship both Satan and Jewry is because the Jews’ highest holy book, the Talmud, is literally anti-Christ, meaning condemnatory of Jesus and his teachings, and
       <a href="http://www.revisionisthistory.org/talmudtruth.html">
        claims he’s in hell in boiling excrement.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even most non-Christians respect the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, but not Jewish supremacists and Satanists.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Greco-Christianity is the basis of  Western civilization. Hence Jewry is not only anti-Christ, but anti-Western civilization because of its Christian basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you say “I find it funny you commit your mind to fairy tales of deities being your enemy,” are you simply ignorant of organized Jewry and the Talmud, ignorant of Christianity, ignorant of Western civilization, ignorant of Zionism, ignorant of Satanism, or perhaps a Satanist yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, you shouldn’t be afraid to admit what you are. They’re coming out of the closet left and right, as anyone can plainly see.

       No I just see the basic symbolism for what it is. None of these names are really important. Yes, the history behind it is important. But all satan worship is dark and fear worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as jesus worship is light and love worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I  don't need characters from a book be a circumventor to the basic reality behind the symbols.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a dark ritual. Dark feeds off fear. Uses fear to control. The dark is in the shadows where the light doesn't reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shadow figures use deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Light is the exact opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening presently is we are moving into an era of light. The dark, know this and do not want this. They want to cast their shadow over the earth and human race in hopes of controlling this planet going into an age of light.
      </p>
      <p>
       This proves that they themselves are the true Gods for they accomplished going against the natural orders of the universe.

       You call them "Gods," I call them Satanists. You essentially say they feed off of fear and the dark side; I shorthand this to say they feed off of Satan, the god of evil.

       It's all samantics. The important message is that they do not want "world peace" even though they claim to, and they actually want the opposite. To me, that epitomizes evil, by any name.

       Speaking of
       <em>
        "World Peace"
       </em>
       - not that I watch much television, didn't watch the game - but did anyone catch the name of the new Survivor?

       Yeah man... really...

       "World peace" is coming. Are you prepared?

      <p>
       Yes, but it has to be realized that the people that it would need to piss off (i.e.
       <em>
        us
       </em>
       ) have been rendered VERY complacent and docile by a whole slew of methods, medication, entertainment, sports, etc, etc . . . Those people (again, us) have been conditioned literally from BIRTH to march to the beat of the status quo even when they
       <em>
        disagree
       </em>
       with that beat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes.  If all (or even most) of those people were to stand up and go against the elite, the elite would stand NO chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the people are too weak, and lazy, and content, and spoiled to do much more than lift an occasional, sleepy eyebrow at the constant wrongs that are being perpetrated against us on a near constant basis.  We tend to go right back to sleep when the news and the radio tells us not to worry, there's nothing wrong . . . go back to sleep.

       And this is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       how they want you to keep thinking.  So long as you think this way, you won't act too vehemently over the wrongs you witness on a daily basis.  You won't react to the noose that is tightening around your neck.

      <p>
       It's if and when we start to wake up and realize just how fabricated and manipulated our world has been and still is that enough of us will stand up and fight against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, not enough of us are awake.

       Great post. Honestly, the site I linked was the first I found that sort of explained some of the imagery. I didn't look around at any other content on it.
