        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ll start. It seems pretty obvious to me that Alex Jones clearly fits the bill, so I won&#39;t really focus on him. It has been said before that David Icke is also a disinformation agent, which is a far more controversial opinion to hold. Personally I&#39;m on the fence regarding DI, although I trust him far less than I used to. I am not simply dismissing him outright as I have read several of his books and watched hours of footage featuring him. He makes many excellent points and was a huge catalyst in my &quot;awakening&quot;. </p>

<p>Part of being awake and a truth seeker is that you have to have an open mind and consider ALL the evidence. So when a documentary surfaced called &#39;David Icke debunked&#39; I eventually checked it out. I admit that before watching it my initial immediate reaction was that it was clearly made by tptb to discredit him and make him lose his following. However the film actually raises several good questions, and Icke never really addresses these in any concrete way so as to disprove them, he just dismisses the whole thing outright by attacking the filmmaker himself. There are many other things I feel are wrong with him and also quite suspicious, but I&#39;m not ready to dismiss him just yet. I&#39;m interested to discuss this if anyone else has similar feelings in this regard. </p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMHO, all of them are either useful idiots or purposefully spreading disinformation.</p>

<p>Can you prove that you&#39;re identical to the name you use? Can you prove that you &quot;own&quot; the name you use, or anything else, for that matter? If you have a difficult time answering &quot;yes&quot; to these questions, why make the claims in the first place?</p>

<p>Could it be that most of us allowed &quot;our-self&quot; to be misdirected into blaming someone/something else, instead of setting &#39;our-self&#39; &quot;free&quot; by asking how we can help settle the matter honorably (accepting personal responsibility)?</p>

<p>Are you alluding to the whole strawman/maritime law thing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something similar, but everything I&#39;ve heard labeled with either of those terms was based upon making claims, which is the exact opposite of the idea I&#39;m sharing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there a specific subreddit for these issues?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are, but TBH none that I would recommend.  The link that I shared above is the only source for law related material that I can recommend, and I&#39;ve already saw/heard most, if not all, the other shit.</p>

<p>Talkshoe is a revolutionary website that allows people to organize conference calls in which participants can either text chat and/or listen via the website or join the call via phone.</p>

<p>If you visit the link I shared on Thursday nights, around 8pm or 9pm EST, there&#39;s usually a live conference call that you could join.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the recording that made it all &quot;click&quot; for me: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPHDrSszZAg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPHDrSszZAg</a></p>

<p>I know it&#39;s long, but I can almost guarantee that if you give it a chance you&#39;ll listen to the whole thing.  Sometimes I like to pause the recordings after hearing something interesting and do something else while thinking deeply about what I just heard.</p>

This video was posted a while back (perhaps by yourself) and after watching through several hours of these &quot;conversations with Batman&quot;, I must say it has completely shifted my consciousness of my own natural sovereignty.

    <div class="md"><p>Never make a direct attack. Infiltrate and undermine. Be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Encourage them to question themselves. Begin small and innocuous. Make wise suggestions about questioning authority, questioning one&#39;s preconceptions, questioning what one has been told by the institutions. Then, extend those wise suggestions to: questioning oneself, questioning the trustworthiness of those who have set them free, questioning even the alternatives wherein they sought refuge from the oppression of lies. The weak among them will begin to fall by the wayside and, with only minor encouragement, will rejoin us in undermining the rest. Eventually they will simply destroy themselves from the inside out.</p>

<p>Oh, and... um... I think ImJulianAssange may be some kind of agent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>I am an agent</strong> of positive change. </p>

<p>Western culture uses everything up and throws it away - including people. Many people are feeling used and discarded and are trying to figure out why? They cling to the paradigm that has made them victims because it once served them and they know no other. I encourage people to examine their beliefs. Sometimes we have to abandon our most cherished beliefs in order to find the truth. </p>

<p>I am a private person. I do not believe in the culture of fame and fortune. To the extent that I remain an enigma the more the imagination has to work.</p>

<p>I am just an ordinary person with no other viable way to influence so many people.</p>

<p>P.S. You have described my technique rather well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ImJulianAssange made the depth of botnets on reddit clear to me (and many others). I would agree that he is an agent of positive change, as I try to be in my daily life.</p>

<p>There are plenty of regular people explaining their understanding of the world (based on their mental state) on reddit; I&#39;d say those who are consciously told to promote a certain agenda are a low percentile. Those who have been told to act a certain way via social constructs, however, are always prevalent and easy to take note of. Personally, I don&#39;t think ImJulianAssange is either of the latter two types of people I mentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. When I started getting into conspiracies I started questioning <em>everything.</em> My thought processes would begin to include &quot;Could this be a conspiracy?&quot; and &quot;Who gains from this?&quot; and I thought it was bad at first, but then I realized that that thought process has been completely removed in our society and it&#39;s healthy to think like that.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve tried writing out the documentary topic twice but I can&#39;t seem to come up with a format I like. Plus I don&#39;t know whether we should have a voting day or whether that&#39;s too many threads, so if you want to take over you can.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a fanboy of Jones. I&#39;ve been quite critical about him. But at the end of the day, he strikes me as sincere about what he believes. That my criteria. He may be an egoist, he may be emotionally immature, but he really wants to expose the corruption and manipulation by the ruling class. Those who say he is somehow working for the elite haven&#39;t proved anything -- they are just making assertions. It&#39;s their opinion. Fine. My opinion is that he is sincere about what he does. And no, there isn&#39;t a &quot;plethora of information on the internet about why Alex Jones is definitely not genuine&quot; -- there&#39;s a plethora of baseless assertions to that effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like it was said above, he may be an egoist and always needs to get his voice and last word in, but your video only solidifies what was said and doesn&#39;t disprove Jones. Sure he can be arrogant at times but there is no doubt that he brings to light issues that get ignored from the MSM. Let&#39;s not teeter the thin line between conspiracy theorists and paranoids. Not everyone is out to get us, so long as we use the heads under our tin foil hats we can filter out what is true and what is crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. When I started getting into conspiracies I started questioning <em>everything.</em> My thought processes would begin to include &quot;Could this be a conspiracy?&quot; and &quot;Who gains from this?&quot; and I thought it was bad at first, but then I realized that that thought process has been completely removed in our society and it&#39;s healthy to think like that.</p>

<p>Also I&#39;ve tried writing out the documentary topic twice but I can&#39;t seem to come up with a format I like. Plus I don&#39;t know whether we should have a voting day or whether that&#39;s too many threads, so if you want to take over you can.</p>
