       I will say that AIPAC has a strong grip on U.S. foreign policy through it's influence over our communication channels.  Here's Glenn Greenwald talking about just one example:

       In terms of the Federal Reserve, I'm not sold that it's part of any Zionist conspiracy.  It's a bunch of rich dudes that control the money supply so that their rich banker friends and themselves can remain rich at the expense of the population.  Sure, some of these guys are Jewish, and other's aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what this guy's talking about in terms of "bankrupting national debt", as the President signs budgets, and TMK we haven't had a Jewish President nor a majority Jewish Senate or House.
      </p>
      <p>
       OWS?  What the hell is that even doing in that list?
      </p>
      <p>
       Police and surveillance state?  Now this dude's just ranting it seems.

       The founders of the Federal Reserve were in the Zionist movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The British government and the Zionist leaders struck a dirty deal. The Zionists were led by Chaim Weizmann, the man who one day become the first President of the State of Israel. The idea was for the Zionists to use their influence to drag the mighty USA into the war on Britain's side, so that Germany and it's Ottoman allies could be crushed. In exchange for helping to bring the USA into the war, the British would reward the Zionists by taking over Palestine from the conquered Ottomans after the war was over. The British had originally wanted to give the Zionists a jewish homeland in an African territory. But the Zionists were fixated on claiming Palestine as their land. Once under British control, the jews of Europe would be allowed to immigrate to Palestine in great numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff, and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson. Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty “Huns”, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous year’s Lusitania “incident”, entered the war on Britain's side under the ridiculous pretext of “making the world safe for democracy”.

       What you've said definitely sounds interesting, but until I see some credible sources (that aren't youtube videos and holocaustdenier.com), I'm not really sure what to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically in regards to your claim that Zionists wanted to pull the US into a war against the Germans and Ottomans so as to eventually secure Palestine for themselves, do you have a credible source that discusses this?  What about the claim that the British were considering an African territory?
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side question, do you support a two state solution with mutually agreed upon land swaps as a fix for the IP conflict?

       Don't let the Holocaustdenier title fool you. Eric Hunt's video

        "The Last Days of Big Lie"

       is an incredible piece of research and work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please research the Balfour Declaration and the Haavara (Transfer) Agreement. Uganda and Madagascar were offered as potential Jewish homelands, but were rejected by the Rothschilds and the Zionist organization. Research all the names above and their influence on Woodrow Wilson, Zionism and the Federal Reserve.

       Honestly, I am for any solution that respects Palestinian rights. The original agreement was that all current inhabitants rights would be respected.

       bumblingmumbling is openly hateful of Jews and has mentioned his support for the KKK on several occasions. He talks about the Holocaust as if it was a complete fabrication and is convinced that "The Jew" runs every government in the world except Palestine.

       So you agree with KKK/Stormfront philosophy, am I getting this right? And if they no longer exist, who runs

        this site

       ? And why should I defend Zionism? I have no love for Zionists. I do, on the other hand, firmly believe that someone with a Stormfront/KKK/White Nationalist philosphy like your own is too blinded by their own hate to make any sort of objective statements about anything involving Jews.

       The real racists are Zionist Jewry. They have been directly responsible for 6 million deaths in the Middle East since about 1980. The Arab Holocaust. I can't think of a more racist state than Israel.

       You're changing the subject (and making up facts, 6 million deaths? Wherever did you get your numbers?) So I was 100% correct, is that what I said, is that what you're saying? Why were you so opposed to it then?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: This is what I find hilarious about you people. You accuse "Zionists" and "Hasbarats" (words which I doubt you can even define properly) of avoiding questions and changing the subject. Yet, when asked simple questions, all you people do is try to change the subject to how eeeeevil Israel is. And you're all too cowardly to come out and admit anything. Like, you will never say that you're not an anti-semite (because you are) so instead, when asked, you'll probably just change the subject or try to redefine what antisemitism is because you're too much of a coward to admit to your own racial prejudices.

       The race card no longer works for Zionist Jewry. Too bad so sad. Zionism has become the ultimate form of White Supremacy. Diverse groups of people are becoming aware of Zionist hypocrisy with each passing day. Less and less people want to fight and pay for wars for Israel anymore.

       That's it pull out the RACIST bogeyman Yserbius. The classic KKK false flags by the likes of the SPLC for MEGA fundraising. BTW, where is one post or comment showing my so called KKK support?

       Yes, if the racist bogeyman does not work pull out the Holocaust Card. Yes, I do question the official Holocaust dogma of six million gassed, cremated, made into lampshades and soap. I don't question that people were rounded up, lost their property, were mistreated and placed in labor camps and died from typhus.

       Lol, just putting 'Zionist' before 'Jews' in a sentence doesn't make it legitimate. Note I didn't get an answer.

       Hahah, seriously, I've been getting downvoted continuously for the past 2 days for merely asking questions about news reports from corporate media outlets that have been lying America into wars for decades.  No replies or anything, just straight downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes, I don't think downvoting should even be allowed if you don't leave a comment.  Downvoting is essentially censorship.  Sometimes, when really important issues are being discussed, it seems like it's too strong of a censorship tool to be left to anonymous users (assuming they aren't sockpuppets to begin with!)

       Like the "censorship" of the spammed UFO comment from yesterday or crackducks US article in world news... Oh wait, it's policy in world news not to have anything to do with the US, even if it's a war.

       For the record, if an article can stand up to scrutiny by it's own merits, then it shouldn't be deleted from /worldnews in my opinion. Like this one:

       You don'tr honestly think, for even the blink of an eye, that a source you consider "credible" is investigating r/worldnews do you?

       Erm, that's a bit out of character considering I spent an hour chatting with crackduck yesterday about the exact same topic - a US news article getting removed from /worldnews due to being about the US. I agreed with him that it was a tenuous rule to have and even the moderator who removed the article thought the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like there isn't enough places to criticize the US on reddit...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Edit
       </strong>
       : The middle paragraph just clicked. The difference is I don't need to perform a futile task to know that US news will be removed from /worldnews/ - it's not even a hidden policy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="/r/Worldnews">
         /r/Worldnews
        </a>
        is for major news from around the world except US-related news (especially US politics).

       those submissions were banned. There is definitely a propaganda movement by the US government to promote the invasion and destruction of Syria and Iran.

       Well the US has definitely started shit in Syria and Iran already but it is merely mercenaries and agents at this point.  What you are probably referring to is missiles, cannons and artillery.

       So, just a day after I make that comment, some news sources are reporting that Iran are sending 15,000 troops as we speak.  RT has cast doubt on it though.  I find the report suspicious too.  It would be just the sort of nonsense you'd expect to be put out there to try and whip up some support for an invasion of Syria.

       Well regardless Syria is the Western front.  A full out offensive against Iran will need to partially go through Syrian airspace.  I don't think that the Turkish people are much interested in having bombs explode on their people if they took a major part in the attack.  Then when you get up into the Black Sea you are in Russia's territory.  Syria is just critical to the whole operation.

       If they have a military propaganda campaign against the citizens and I am vocally resisting then I am likely considered an homegrown extremist.  Since I am not living in the US there is already a precedent for the government assassinating insurgent citizens living abroad.  Fortunately for me I am a white citizen and not a brown citizen with a beard although I have faith that someday the government will become equal opportunity in this regard.

       I'm starting to almost enjoy getting downvoted when discussing Iran/Syria.  It tells me that I'm making people uncomfortable by challenging their worldview, and hopefully it means that the cognitive dissonance within the downvoters is slowly withering away.

       Given that the average person on Reddit doesn't have too strong a stand on this, it seems more like the neocon and/or government shills are active, shaping perceived opinion. They are certainly demonstrably active in other areas here, which reinforces the likelihood.

       When you refer to "here" many people might think that you are referring to the current subreddit that you are in.  Its better to say at "reddit" to be general or "r/blahblah" if you are referring to another subreddit and "here" usually means the current subreddit.

       Recently I posted something to r/worldnews that was critical of NATO regarding Syria and I received -15 votes.  Then within 1 hour a more popular post that I had made here in r/conspiracy that had 15 points accumulated over 2 days quickly went to 10 points.  The bastards were combing through my history.

       Not surprised at all. His internet connies most likely associated straight from syria to minimize public outcry ALMOST got Bashar Al Assad on Time 100 List. I was spamming that shit on my FB so many times, even here a couple times but without any response at all.

       slightly random but Assad created the first computer club at his uni, he's pretty well versed with computers, believe his wife's got a degree in CS as well.

       U.S. is not the only country that has a vested interest in Syrian regime change. Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Gulf Countries have shown unabashed support, both diplomatically, and financially for the rebels, many of whom represent Salafist and hardline Islamist movements. See:

       I suspect you are correct and further, --and even though I'm a new member myself, I have lurked for a long time before joining-- but noticed a remarkable change in a more (for lack of a better word) conservative right-ward bent in the last few months. Both toward Israel and neocon bullshit ideology as something out of Samuel P. Huntington's, The Clash of Civilizations. And recently commented on it here:

       People get angry when they see people have callous disregard for the suffering of innocents.  Even if you think everything coming out of the Assad regime is 100% gospel then how do you explain the videos of his military shelling cities?  Are those really rebel tanks and artillery?  Maybe the helicopter gunships belong to the rebels too.

       I didn't say you did but the standard response out of r/cons is that anything the US government says is good, is automatically bad.  A lot of times this means this sub get's filled with propaganda that is literally designed and published by high dollar New York PR firms or state controlled media simply because it is the opposite of the quote unquote American view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try and be as objective as possible and I have been watching the region for a long time.  I could point to more human rights violations done by the US and those representing our government than any of the tinfoilers here so I have no agenda with America always being right.  What I see coming out of Syria are a people who are mostly committed to non-violent resistance meeting a dictator and military that have no problems killing to stay in power.  Naturally, a portion of the population is going to turn to violence when the military starts driving tanks down residential streets (I would be one of those) but the bulk of the movement is still non-violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they getting support from the west and GCC?  I have not seen concrete evidence but if I was forced to speculate I would say probably.  That might bother me if Assad was a genuinely benevolent leader ala Mosaddegh but the second he doubled down and used the military against protesters, he lost me (again, don't kid yourself, those are not rebel BMPs).
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think the US should invade and make it look like Iraq?  FUCK NO.  Would I be opposed to NATO destroying his military from the air (no fly/drive zones) and more or less siding with the lesser of 2 evils in the situation?  I would like to say yes because anyone who will purposely targets civilian populations with heavy weapons in this day and age doesn't deserve to control those weapons.  That being said I do see the massive potential for blowback.  We could see a talibanization of the Gulf region that might even end in the al-Saud family being toppled.  On the other hand these countries could emerge as global players on the world market with secular, representative governments.

       This wicked witch of North America and Crown Agent sister needs to be stopped, she’s out of control. She is now panicking that Emperor Juan Carlos will punish her for not completing his wishes and in the time frame he laid out with his Union for the Mediterranean tyranny. Hillary Clinton is a sore loser and is struggling to get the jackals to whack Assad. It was Hillary Clinton who had Robert Kennedy Jr assassinated. Hopefully Vladimir Putin will put a stop to this old lesbian hag who’s stuck up the backside of the Senior Executive Service, Crown Agents and the Livery Patent Pool. May I add that Hillary Clinton is a patent lawyer and it was she who patented the QRS-11 Gyrochip in Canada used for the precious guidance air attacks executed by the Royal Canadian Air Force and Bombardier Master Trust on September 11th 2001. Bombardier Master Trust being the World’s number one in electronic warfare. The same Hillary Clinton who has used Al-Qaeda germ rebel terrorists against Assad and sovereign Syria. The same Hillary Clinton who has used Al-Qaeda rat rebels on Gaddafi and sovereign Libya. The same Hillary Clinton handled by the founder of the Senior Executive Service which created Al-Qaeda through the U.S. Small Business Administration’s 8(a) program. You have been conned left, right and center, do not fall for it any longer.

       If I would have to guess, it's probably because other than the Syrian government, virtual all news sources point to Assad's military as the source of the violence.

       If Assad is not the source of the violence, who is? Also, how is that comment thread an example?

       Assad's forces are certainly guilty of violence.  They're just fighting against armed groups that are violently looking to overthrow his regime.  Civilians are caught in the crossfire, and are no doubt being killed by both sides, but to say that anyone's just going around killing civilians for fun is ridiculous.  It's a power struggle for control of the country.

       In that thread, I was downvoted for linking to this thread that seeks to show credible links to what's going on in Syria.  That's fucked up.

       The report is adamant. There was no organized, lethal repression by the Syrian government against peaceful protesters. Instead, the report points to shady armed gangs as responsible for hundreds of deaths among Syrian civilians, and over one thousand among the Syrian army, using lethal tactics such as bombing of civilian buses, bombing of trains carrying diesel oil, bombing of police buses and bombing of bridges and pipelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, the official NATOGCC version of Syria is of a popular uprising smashed by bullets and tanks. Instead, BRICS members Russia and China, and large swathes of the developing world see it as the Syrian government fighting heavily armed foreign mercenaries. The report largely confirms these suspicions.

       When you refer to "here" many people might think that you are referring to the current subreddit that you are in.  Its better to say at "reddit" to be general or "r/blahblah" if you are referring to another subreddit and "here" usually means the current subreddit.

       I didn't say you did but the standard response out of r/cons is that anything the US government says is good, is automatically bad.  A lot of times this means this sub get's filled with propaganda that is literally designed and published by high dollar New York PR firms or state controlled media simply because it is the opposite of the quote unquote American view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try and be as objective as possible and I have been watching the region for a long time.  I could point to more human rights violations done by the US and those representing our government than any of the tinfoilers here so I have no agenda with America always being right.  What I see coming out of Syria are a people who are mostly committed to non-violent resistance meeting a dictator and military that have no problems killing to stay in power.  Naturally, a portion of the population is going to turn to violence when the military starts driving tanks down residential streets (I would be one of those) but the bulk of the movement is still non-violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they getting support from the west and GCC?  I have not seen concrete evidence but if I was forced to speculate I would say probably.  That might bother me if Assad was a genuinely benevolent leader ala Mosaddegh but the second he doubled down and used the military against protesters, he lost me (again, don't kid yourself, those are not rebel BMPs).
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think the US should invade and make it look like Iraq?  FUCK NO.  Would I be opposed to NATO destroying his military from the air (no fly/drive zones) and more or less siding with the lesser of 2 evils in the situation?  I would like to say yes because anyone who will purposely targets civilian populations with heavy weapons in this day and age doesn't deserve to control those weapons.  That being said I do see the massive potential for blowback.  We could see a talibanization of the Gulf region that might even end in the al-Saud family being toppled.  On the other hand these countries could emerge as global players on the world market with secular, representative governments.
