    <div class="md"><p>I will say that AIPAC has a strong grip on U.S. foreign policy through it&#39;s influence over our communication channels.  Here&#39;s Glenn Greenwald talking about just one example: <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/12/12/anti_semitism_charge_backfires_on_ex_aipac_flack/">http://www.salon.com/2011/12/12/anti_semitism_charge_backfires_on_ex_aipac_flack/</a></p>

<p>In terms of the Federal Reserve, I&#39;m not sold that it&#39;s part of any Zionist conspiracy.  It&#39;s a bunch of rich dudes that control the money supply so that their rich banker friends and themselves can remain rich at the expense of the population.  Sure, some of these guys are Jewish, and other&#39;s aren&#39;t.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what this guy&#39;s talking about in terms of &quot;bankrupting national debt&quot;, as the President signs budgets, and TMK we haven&#39;t had a Jewish President nor a majority Jewish Senate or House.  </p>

<p>OWS?  What the hell is that even doing in that list?</p>

<p>Police and surveillance state?  Now this dude&#39;s just ranting it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The founders of the Federal Reserve were in the Zionist movement. </p>

<p>The British government and the Zionist leaders struck a dirty deal. The Zionists were led by Chaim Weizmann, the man who one day become the first President of the State of Israel. The idea was for the Zionists to use their influence to drag the mighty USA into the war on Britain&#39;s side, so that Germany and it&#39;s Ottoman allies could be crushed. In exchange for helping to bring the USA into the war, the British would reward the Zionists by taking over Palestine from the conquered Ottomans after the war was over. The British had originally wanted to give the Zionists a jewish homeland in an African territory. But the Zionists were fixated on claiming Palestine as their land. Once under British control, the jews of Europe would be allowed to immigrate to Palestine in great numbers. </p>

<p>Zionists powerbrokers such as Bernard Baruch, Louis Brandeis, Paul Warburg (father of the US Federal Reserve), Jacob Schiff, and others immediately went to work to put the screws to President Woodrow Wilson. Overnight the Zionist influenced press transformed the German Kaiser and his people into bloodthirsty “Huns”, determined to destroy western civilization. In 1916, the US, with the help of the previous year’s Lusitania “incident”, entered the war on Britain&#39;s side under the ridiculous pretext of “making the world safe for democracy”. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;ve said definitely sounds interesting, but until I see some credible sources (that aren&#39;t youtube videos and holocaustdenier.com), I&#39;m not really sure what to think.</p>

<p>Specifically in regards to your claim that Zionists wanted to pull the US into a war against the Germans and Ottomans so as to eventually secure Palestine for themselves, do you have a credible source that discusses this?  What about the claim that the British were considering an African territory?</p>

<p>As a side question, do you support a two state solution with mutually agreed upon land swaps as a fix for the IP conflict? </p>

<p>Please research the Balfour Declaration and the Haavara (Transfer) Agreement. Uganda and Madagascar were offered as potential Jewish homelands, but were rejected by the Rothschilds and the Zionist organization. Research all the names above and their influence on Woodrow Wilson, Zionism and the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>Honestly, I am for any solution that respects Palestinian rights. The original agreement was that all current inhabitants rights would be respected.  </p>

<p>So, let&#39;s summarize my original comment to see how accurate it was :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bumblingmumbling is openly hateful of Jews </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and has mentioned his support for the KKK on several occasions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just said that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He talks about the Holocaust as if it was a complete fabrication </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not <em>complete</em> fabrication, just 99.999% &quot;Zionist lies&quot;. Same difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and is convinced that &quot;The Jew&quot; runs every government in the world except Palestine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ditto. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And he was busted a few months ago running at least 3 alternate accounts to talk to and upvote himself

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re changing the subject (and making up facts, 6 million deaths? Wherever did you get your numbers?) So I was 100% correct, is that what I said, is that what you&#39;re saying? Why were you so opposed to it then?</p>

<p>EDIT: This is what I find hilarious about you people. You accuse &quot;Zionists&quot; and &quot;Hasbarats&quot; (words which I doubt you can even define properly) of avoiding questions and changing the subject. Yet, when asked simple questions, all you people do is try to change the subject to how eeeeevil Israel is. And you&#39;re all too cowardly to come out and admit anything. Like, you will never say that you&#39;re not an anti-semite (because you are) so instead, when asked, you&#39;ll probably just change the subject or try to redefine what antisemitism is because you&#39;re too much of a coward to admit to your own racial prejudices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Erm, that&#39;s a bit out of character considering I spent an hour chatting with crackduck yesterday about the exact same topic - a US news article getting removed from /worldnews due to being about the US.

<p>It&#39;s not like there isn&#39;t enough places to criticize the US on reddit...</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The middle paragraph just clicked. The difference is I don&#39;t need to perform a futile task to know that US news will be removed from /worldnews/ - it&#39;s not even a hidden policy:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say you did but the standard response out of r/cons is that anything the US government says is good, is automatically bad.  A lot of times this means this sub get&#39;s filled with propaganda that is literally designed and published by high dollar New York PR firms or state controlled media simply because it is the opposite of the quote unquote American view.</p>

<p>I try and be as objective as possible and I have been watching the region for a long time.  I could point to more human rights violations done by the US and those representing our government than any of the tinfoilers here so I have no agenda with America always being right.  What I see coming out of Syria are a people who are mostly committed to non-violent resistance meeting a dictator and military that have no problems killing to stay in power.  Naturally, a portion of the population is going to turn to violence when the military starts driving tanks down residential streets (I would be one of those) but the bulk of the movement is still non-violent.</p>

<p>Are they getting support from the west and GCC?  I have not seen concrete evidence but if I was forced to speculate I would say probably.  That might bother me if Assad was a genuinely benevolent leader ala Mosaddegh but the second he doubled down and used the military against protesters, he lost me (again, don&#39;t kid yourself, those are not rebel BMPs).</p>

<p>Do I think the US should invade and make it look like Iraq?  FUCK NO.  Would I be opposed to NATO destroying his military from the air (no fly/drive zones) and more or less siding with the lesser of 2 evils in the situation?  I would like to say yes because anyone who will purposely targets civilian populations with heavy weapons in this day and age doesn&#39;t deserve to control those weapons.  That being said I do see the massive potential for blowback.  We could see a talibanization of the Gulf region that might even end in the al-Saud family being toppled.  On the other hand these countries could emerge as global players on the world market with secular, representative governments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This wicked witch of North America and Crown Agent sister needs to be stopped, she’s out of control. She is now panicking that Emperor Juan Carlos will punish her for not completing his wishes and in the time frame he laid out with his Union for the Mediterranean tyranny. Hillary Clinton is a sore loser and is struggling to get the jackals to whack Assad. It was Hillary Clinton who had Robert Kennedy Jr assassinated. Hopefully Vladimir Putin will put a stop to this old lesbian hag who’s stuck up the backside of the Senior Executive Service, Crown Agents and the Livery Patent Pool. May I add that Hillary Clinton is a patent lawyer and it was she who patented the QRS-11 Gyrochip in Canada used for the precious guidance air attacks executed by the Royal Canadian Air Force and Bombardier Master Trust on September 11th 2001. Bombardier Master Trust being the World’s number one in electronic warfare. The same Hillary Clinton who has used Al-Qaeda germ rebel terrorists against Assad and sovereign Syria. The same Hillary Clinton who has used Al-Qaeda rat rebels on Gaddafi and sovereign Libya. The same Hillary Clinton handled by the founder of the Senior Executive Service which created Al-Qaeda through the U.S. Small Business Administration’s 8(a) program. You have been conned left, right and center, do not fall for it any longer.</p>

<p>If I would have to guess, it&#39;s probably because other than the Syrian government, virtual all news sources point to Assad&#39;s military as the source of the violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assad&#39;s forces are certainly guilty of violence.  They&#39;re just fighting against armed groups that are violently looking to overthrow his regime.  Civilians are caught in the crossfire, and are no doubt being killed by both sides, but to say that anyone&#39;s just going around killing civilians for fun is ridiculous.  It&#39;s a power struggle for control of the country.</p>

<p>In that thread, I was downvoted for linking to this thread that seeks to show credible links to what&#39;s going on in Syria.  That&#39;s fucked up.</p>

The report is adamant. There was no organized, lethal repression by the Syrian government against peaceful protesters. Instead, the report points to shady armed gangs as responsible for hundreds of deaths among Syrian civilians, and over one thousand among the Syrian army, using lethal tactics such as bombing of civilian buses, bombing of trains carrying diesel oil, bombing of police buses and bombing of bridges and pipelines.</p>

<p>Once again, the official NATOGCC version of Syria is of a popular uprising smashed by bullets and tanks. Instead, BRICS members Russia and China, and large swathes of the developing world see it as the Syrian government fighting heavily armed foreign mercenaries. The report largely confirms these suspicions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say you did but the standard response out of r/cons is that anything the US government says is good, is automatically bad.  A lot of times this means this sub get&#39;s filled with propaganda that is literally designed and published by high dollar New York PR firms or state controlled media simply because it is the opposite of the quote unquote American view.</p>

<p>I try and be as objective as possible and I have been watching the region for a long time.  I could point to more human rights violations done by the US and those representing our government than any of the tinfoilers here so I have no agenda with America always being right.  What I see coming out of Syria are a people who are mostly committed to non-violent resistance meeting a dictator and military that have no problems killing to stay in power.  Naturally, a portion of the population is going to turn to violence when the military starts driving tanks down residential streets (I would be one of those) but the bulk of the movement is still non-violent.</p>

<p>Are they getting support from the west and GCC?  I have not seen concrete evidence but if I was forced to speculate I would say probably.  That might bother me if Assad was a genuinely benevolent leader ala Mosaddegh but the second he doubled down and used the military against protesters, he lost me (again, don&#39;t kid yourself, those are not rebel BMPs).</p>

<p>Do I think the US should invade and make it look like Iraq?  FUCK NO.  Would I be opposed to NATO destroying his military from the air (no fly/drive zones) and more or less siding with the lesser of 2 evils in the situation?  I would like to say yes because anyone who will purposely targets civilian populations with heavy weapons in this day and age doesn&#39;t deserve to control those weapons.  That being said I do see the massive potential for blowback.  We could see a talibanization of the Gulf region that might even end in the al-Saud family being toppled.  On the other hand these countries could emerge as global players on the world market with secular, representative governments.</p>
