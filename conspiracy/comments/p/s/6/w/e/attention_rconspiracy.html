<p>Take <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/pqopk/food_police_reject_homemade_lunch_force/">This post</a> for example, which was at the top of this subreddit most of the day, posted by <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/noluciferians">noluciferians</a>. <strong>Look at his profile.</strong> He most likely works for the &quot;show&quot; that is PrisonPlanet. </p>

<p><a href="http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/blog/2012/02/15/a-north-carolina-non-troversy/">Here</a> is an end to this bullshit story, and all the incredible nonsense that goes along with it.</p>

<p><strong>Alex Jones isn&#39;t helping anything.</strong></p>

<p><strong>He makes us all look stupid.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Regularly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you really want to make a difference you need to know what you are talking about, and be able to support your theories with evidence in a calm and non-confrontational manner.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Also know that the mere mentioning of this guy results in instant skepticism, and for good reason.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Edit: EyesFurtherUp posted a great YouTube series relating to this very subject. Thank you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAwyPc7mWtY&amp;feature=related">www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAwyPc7mWtY&amp;feature=related</a></p>

<p>Edit 2: From the Youtube comment, because it is very relevant.</p>

<p>William Cooper exposes Alex Jones for being a fear monger, despite the fact that Alex Jones does expose some interesting issues, it is a confirmed fact that he follows up on news that are fake, he does not investigate, he does not care to investigate. He does what he does for profit and his 250.000 to 400.000 d√≥lar money bombs are his goal. He is making a huge fortune from spreading fear. He is a puppet. </p>

<p>I do not say not to listen to him, I say you should confirm his claims with other sources, since he doesn&#39;t care. He doesn&#39;t care about the New World Order, the Illuminati, FEMA, the corruption, the dangers we are facing, since it&#39;s all about the money.</p>

<p>You have to question, you always have to question what he and anyone else claims to be the truth.
What is truth? 
If we had the truth in front of us, would we recognize it? 
No!
All that we can and must find, is our truth.</p>

<p>Wake up, the New World Order train is on it&#39;s way to your homes and many &quot;truthers&quot; have join that train to gang bang you.
Question the &quot;truthers&quot;, investigate, then question yourselves and finaly you will find what you need, you will find your answers, your truth.</p>

<p>Remember that no one can really wake you up, they can alert you, they can arouse your curiosity but only you can wake yourself up and is done with looking for the answers to your questions. 
Waking up is slow and sometimes painful process, <strong>and it is a lonely road where no one can show you the way.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aside from the common theme of fear mongering, I personally like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaQNACwaLw">Alex Jones</a>. I&#39;ve never had to pay for any of the videos I&#39;ve watched from him, and he brings to light many issues that most of our society chooses to ignore. Yes he is over the top, and maybe he is trying to make a buck - but that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t just listen to what he has to say once in a while. Sometimes it&#39;s a very nice change from the 100% BS that is the MSM. To each their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Aside from the common theme of fear mongering, I personally like Alex Jones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the core of the problem: Alex Jones operates <em>only</em> on fear mongering. That&#39;s his brand, his product, that underlies absolutely everything he says. His message is toxic with hate and fear.</p>

<p>So people think the MSM is crazy because they are fear mongerers, what with their wars, terrorists, crimes and fires, and they jump in the arms of another fear mongerer, but believe they&#39;ve made real progress. It&#39;s like trading cancer for AIDS, it&#39;s not any better. Or it&#39;s like saying &quot;I&#39;m not racist, I have lots of black friends!&quot; and then hating Arabs and Asians.</p>

<p>Jones points out real problems in society, but he does in it such a way that he discredits the whole effort of criticism by showing us only one way to criticize: by yelling and shouting and being scared as shit of everything. Nevermind criticizing by being calm, productive, and recommending solutions, which he never does. He&#39;s also incredibly biased, and a terrible, terrible, just plain awful &quot;reporter&quot;, if he&#39;s at all worthy of the name. I mean, he sees a rock on the ground and finds links of how the CIA wants to use it to destroy the universe.</p>

<p>There are serious problems in society. It&#39;s important we are honest with ourselves and try to fix them. We need to stay calm, positive, recommend solutions, promote and implement them. There are lots of people doing it already, they&#39;re called volunteers and activists. Their message is positive and productive, it&#39;s not scary, paranoid and paralyzing.</p>

<p>Fox News is one extreme, Alex Jones is another. I choose the middle path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to agree and this is the problem with many conspiracy theorists.  There are real conspiracies that happen in the world and sometimes there are valid stories that are posted on r/conspiracy, but the the problem is that so often many of the real facts just get drowned out by sensationalist stories, wild eye fear mongering, and hyperbolic conclusions.  The USA has done many things in the world that clearly do not live up to our narrative of promoting freedom and democracy, but that does not mean that everything bad that happens in the world is due to the USA or that everything this country does is out of malice and spite.    Just because something may not be reported in the &quot;mainstream media&quot; does not automatically give it credibility, there needs to be evidence for claims to be taken seriously and folks like Alex Jones have no care for such a thing because that gets in the way of the sensationalist story he is promoting.  It often breaks down to a feeling that if you talk to a regular person about their shadow, its just a shadow, but if you talk to r/conspiracy about their shadow it turns into a secret government agent that is trailing them personally with nefarious intent</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally feel that most conspiracy theorist have some crazy quirk that invalidates or discredits them. A simple question, if Alex Jones was nice and calm and told everything like it is and left all the gray area that comes along with conspiracies, who would listen to him? I mean, sure you could say &quot;yeah! I&#39;d listen to someone like that&quot;. You might be one of the few. Alex Jones is on the radio, and it&#39;s about listeners. No one is going to listen to a guy that talks about stuff that kinda might be happening some of the time. Maybe Alex Jones is a part of the great Illuminati puzzle. Something tells me that we know about these people david icke etc, because of their quirks, and not because they tell us about stuff that might sorta kind of be happening.</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>: a place where people can share information and speculation regarding conspiracies</p>

<p>Fear mongering is entirely optional, and I would argue, detrimental, to the whole effort of conspiracy theorists. People like Alex Jones are often unbalanced and obsessed by conspiracy theories, forgetting all the other perspectives you can have on life. Anger is unhealthy, it&#39;s no better than denial. It&#39;s possible to study and follow conspiracies without turning into a madman.</p>

<p>How does the bullhorn take down Bilderberg?</p>

<p>Does &quot;60 Minutes&quot; use a bullhorn?</p>

<p>But &quot;60 Minutes&quot; just reported on Insider Trading in Congress 2 months ago, exposed an issue -- and generated a groundswell of support for an anti-Insider Trading law, which Congress was shamed to pass last week.</p>

<p>If Alex had been involved, no law would&#39;ve passed.</p>

<p>How does a bullhorn take down Bilderberg?</p>

<p>Will reasonable people suddenly say &quot;Look!  There&#39;s a guy ranting with a bullhorn.  He must be right.  I&#39;d better look into the Bilderbergs.  Screaming bullhorn people are always insightful, especially the raving ones.&quot;</p>

<p>Real truth-tellers die.  They die fast and TPTB don&#39;t give a shit who&#39;s left asking the questions.</p>

<p>Just ask the folks who leaked the truth about DeepWater Horizon.  Or Banking Mortgage Fraud.  Or the News Of The World scandal.</p>

<p>Alex Jones, David Icke... all of these fucknuts exist to make the real truth seekers look like crackpots.</p>

<p>You have to understand - They made an entire country hate <em>anyone</em> who questions the official, ass-backwards and full-of-holes story about 9/11.  Made them mock the &#39;Truthers&#39; who... just want the full, unbiased story about what happened to their dead loved ones.</p>

<p>That is the true face of the forces you&#39;re fucking with.  Not &#39;reptoids&#39; or fucking &#39;interdimensional elves&#39;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re dealing with sociopaths, unchecked greed and way too much fucking power put into far too few hands.</p>

<p>Again, Devil&#39;s Advocate -</p>

<p>That, or the fact that he&#39;s the most well-known conspiracy theorist in the <em>world</em> today, and everyone (both haters and followers) are watching him like a hawk. Imagine if he was found dead, even if it looked like an accident, the first thought would be murder, and his followers would think &quot;well, of course they killed him, and this only underlines everything he&#39;s been saying - he was killed b/c he was right.&quot;</p>

<p>His detractors/haters know this - so they let him live - so guys like you will say <em>exactly</em> what you just said, all the while trying to marginalize him more.  Keeping him alive, they think, is benefiting them more than killing him.</p>

<p>Sure, his presentation is shit, sure he fucking flies off the handle all of the time, and he <em>does</em> sound like a ranting/raving lunatic - but presentation aside - tell me where he&#39;s wrong. I don&#39;t take anything he says at face value, but anytime I&#39;ve bothered to research the rabbit hole of information he spouts - he&#39;s been right.</p>

<p>And, David Icke? Total different ballgame. That guy may be right on some things, but he&#39;s obviously a total <em>kook</em> on the lizard bullshit. That clearly has no basis.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re just criticizing him on his presentation, hey I&#39;m with you. He&#39;s horrible.  But, if you&#39;re saying he&#39;s intentionally lying - ok - I&#39;m all ears/eyes - show me.</p>

<p>Most shows tell people what they want to hear. </p>

<p>But more importantly just because the owner of the station advertises gold coins that are over priced ( for people looking just buy gold at close to melt value ) does not suddenly invalidate everything Alex jones has ever said.  I would recon that say Jon Stewart probably doesn&#39;t like junk food commercials in the Daily show. That doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t believe in what he&#39;s saying. </p>

<p>Broadcasters have to roll with the punches a little, sometimes fight for editorial control, some times they have to deal with shitty owners, sometime they have to fill the slow news days with waffle. It does not mean alex jones is &quot;cruddy&quot;. He has to work within the system to provide decent information that he beleives matters.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Cruddy owners or advertisers does NOT mean a cruddy Host or presenter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although this is only one of many shady areas Jones is involved in let me make this clear to you, as you did not read it all.
Ted Anderson owns Genesis Communications Network which in essence owns Alex Jones radio show, he also owns Midas Resources which sells it&#39;s &#39;Gold and Silver&#39; to people via adverts on Alex Jones show and elsewhere. 
The gold is sold as a solid investment and also sold at &#39;wholesale price&#39;
What they don&#39;t tell you is that they are not selling you bullion but numismatic coin and this is a completely different thing to investing in gold.</p>

<p>It is a complete scam which is covered by a very effective disclaimer (small print contract).</p>

<p>Honestly it is genius, run a radio show designed to appeal to people who are prepared to believe horse shit (like this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYop_8Rd48E&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYop_8Rd48E&amp;amp;feature=related</a> and thats just one show)and can&#39;t or won&#39;t research stuff for themselves and then sell them junk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they prefer numismatic coins because they have dual value.  There&#39;s the melt value, but there is also the collectable value.  There is also the argument that coins with numismatic value are less susceptible to government confiscation.  They are also much more expensive, because they are generally designed coins sold in small values with collectable cases, and not just blocks of metal.  That value is justified because they are stamped by a government as being a specific percentage of pure.  When you try to sell them, it&#39;s easier to sell coins from the US Treasury than it is to sell blocks of gold.</p>

<p>But, whatever.  Do you get this bent out of shape by all businessman, or do you just hate capitalism?  It seems like the people who made those purchases in 2009 made a better investment than most anyone else.  What&#39;s the problem?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might think that numismatic coins are better but you are just wrong.
Gold is gold, it is easy to test and has no problem being sold whatsoever.
This is why people buy any form of scrape gold it is easy to value and test for purity. 
Gold in 2009 would have been a great buy but this is not what these people were buying, although they thought they were.
Numismatic coins require age and rarity to be of value. Ted Anderson sells numismatic coins which he markets as gold but they have a value around 200% below what you could sells them for at scrap value, its a con pure and simple.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the crazy.  I found it.  You have no idea what numismatic means.</p>

<p>I have a 1 oz Ultra High Relief Double Eagle from the US Mint.  That coin has three different values.  Its face value is $20; its melt value is $1,725; its numismatic value is somewhere between $3,000 to $5,000.</p>

<p>On what fucking planet do you live on where the numismatic value is ever less than the melt value?  I want to go there to do business.  Only fucking morons there.</p>

Chinese GDP will pass the US GDP in 2016.  There are over a hundred banks set to be downgraded this week.  Interest rates are low, because if they were rased people would lose their houses.  Yet, the Fed also has to lie about the inflation numbers, because if they were reported accurately, cost of living increases would break the treasury.</p>

<p>I have seen Alex Jones post more compelling and eye opening stories than the one you got so upset over.  Chicken nuggets, really? </p>

<p>If you really want to make a difference you need to know what you are talking about, and be able to support your theories with evidence in a calm and non-confrontational manner.</p>

<p>Yes, but you also need to think outside the box, connect the dots, and see the bigger picture, while still keeping an open mind.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alex Jones isn&#39;t helping anything.
He makes us all look stupid.</p>

<p>Speak for yourself! I happen to like Alex Jones.  While I may not agree with everything he says, I believe his intentions are for the greater good and I love his interviews.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I say he makes us all look stupid, because really what he does is completely discredit the movement. Yes, you are entitled to watch/listen to whatever you want, but throwing around his jargon while attempting to shed light on someone who is asleep is like asking the most liberal of liberals to bow and call Limbaugh &quot;god.&quot;</p>

<p>Not to mention his stories, which aren&#39;t even his most of the time though he takes credit for them, and of which he makes the boldest of assumptions in a most matter of fact way with no supporting evidence. He literally could be the conspiracy wing of FOX news. </p>

<p>And why do people watch FOX? Because it&#39;s bright and colorful and tells them what they want to hear in an entertaining format while blasting the liberals. It isn&#39;t really news at all, just opinion. Same with Jones. Sure there are tidbits of good information in his &quot;work,&quot; but I&#39;m sure of the same for FOX..... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When dealing with conspiracy theorists there is going to be some level of character bashing and skepticism.  It comes with the territory.  I don&#39;t really see the connection between Limbaugh and Jones other than the fact that they&#39;re both loud and heavy. What it comes down to for me is the information presented.  I like how he takes stories and puts them all together.  In the end I make up my own mind how much weight I put into them.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t compare FOX to Jones, that&#39;s like oil and water,  totally different and they just don&#39;t mix well.</p>

<p>I always hear Jones comment on his team of researchers and how they all gather the information that is presented. So I can&#39;t say I agree with you on how he takes all the credit himself.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s worth mentioning if they were legitimate, they would just offer proper attribution and then continue to post my stuff. Heck, if I was operating at their level I would give independent journalists at least $5 just for reposting their article because I know how much blood, sweat and tears we put into this with no monetary return.</p>

<p>I&#39;d totally be open to having them post my stuff again but I think it says a lot that they would stop after either I a) asked for attribution or b) criticized Jones because he misrepresented information. I&#39;m not sure which one it was that actually caused it or maybe a combination of both.</p>

<p>Surely you don&#39;t actually believe that it isn&#39;t possible to be less accurate than the MSM.  After all, if everything the MSM reported was obviously false, no one would believe it.  Instead, we must be on guard for sources that are usually accurate, but occasionally deceive their audience.  In this way, the audience does not notice they are being deceived, and takes in the false with the true indiscriminately.</p>

<p>As far as the OP&#39;s comment, we can never apply full-blown belief or skepticism to anything. Alex Jones has been seen out cavorting with Bush&#39;s/etc., so it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if he were part of their fold. He gets people to think outside their norm, but in a very fearful and angry direction that usually won&#39;t solve anything. That being said, who knows when he starts telling the truth either?</p>

<p>I think you should just post under a pseudonym. Especially if your true intent in modding on r/conspiracy is to improve a forum dedicated to promoting truth, growth, and quality (if this is not your intent then you probably shouldn&#39;t be a mod). Yes things have cycles, and new members join the sub daily. They may not know all these things and are a major reason for reposts all across the board in every sub. Having a mod who is deferring to quotes from pee wee herman isn&#39;t really helping though. My opinion of course.</p>

<p>In this subreddit, saying that Alex Jones is full of shit is like saying 9/11 was an inside job -- just another circlejerk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the more learned, absolutely. But if you look, there are many people who still buy it all hook line and sinker. Hence my attempt to convey some truth. Which managed to produce quite a few rational arguments by all types of people. Success in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t have to like it, but I do have a right to have and express it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. I also have a right to question it. As you mine.</p>

<p>Yes and no. Opportunity simply knocked. I spent three years of my life pursuing this moderator position <strong>specifically</strong> for the purpose of using it to destroy a man&#39;s life (one who wronged me 12 years ago). Once I got the position, I realized that I no longer wanted that revenge... I even confessed all of this to the other mods. And, now I can truly say that I resisted the temptation to drag another man&#39;s life into the shitter, simply because I could (even though he did that to me).  yep... Now, I can say &quot;been there, done that&quot;. </p>

<p>You just gave me a free pass to walk away from this shit. Thanks.</p>

<p>I doubt that.</p>

<p>The one thing Username_Tokin had in his favor was that he was dedicated to exposing conspiracies. This was his greatest asset to this subreddit, and this subreddit will be less effective in that respect in his absence. And while that doesn&#39;t change the fact that he was an opinionated ass....  by the same token, exposing conspiracies does not require politeness or political correctness, despite your incessant whining about it in this thread.</p>

<p>My intention here is to encourage you and others to think for yourselves. If you want the truth you should IMO, take the evidence alone from any program and sort it out yourself, instead of letting someone else fill your head with their own. Like how the msm works, keeping people asleep, Alex&#39;s show is controlled awakening. You are awakened to an opinion that is not your own and think that&#39;s the way it is. What is the difference if you&#39;re asleep or awake if you&#39;re still letting someone else think for you? </p>

<p>It seems to me that you are saying if you listen to alex jones you are too stupid to tell the difference between a well presented evidence based presentation and a speculative poorly referenced presentation or an interview with a well informed source from an interview with a detatched poorly placed source. that is everyone apart from you.  </p>

<p>Well thanks for the insult but I ( and probably everyone else on this sub reddit ) can tell the difference between quality Alex jones materail and poor alex jones material. When added to MSM I appreciate the breadth of opinion and information he provides, it does NOT mean I believe anything he says. We may not be as smart as you &quot;FightForYourRight&quot; but grant us with some intelligence please. The very fact that we tune into Alex Jones and r/conspiracy shows we are skeptical people. Why would we not also be skeptical of alex jones? Makes no sense. </p>

<p>TL;DR Just as we are not MSM sheep we are not alexs sheep either. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, your tone. Do you see the reaction you get from people? Look throughout your comment history at the response to the angry accusatory fashion in which you shape your words. It isn&#39;t always what you say, but how you say it. Patience and politeness will enable you to get a lot further in any attempt to &quot;wake someone up.&quot; But always remember that people won&#39;t see something they don&#39;t want to see, it&#39;s can sometimes be described as cognitive dissonance. Badgering them with self righteous hate will accomplish only ostricism. And never immediately discount any opinion, there are bits of wisdom in the silliest of arguments. </p>

<p>I never said Jones was untouchable. In fact, if I recall correctly, you were the one who said that he was a shill for not getting killed early enough. You need to tone down a notch on the doublethink.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt that great patriots such as Jones and Cooper will inevitably be arrested or killed for their efforts against the beast system of the New World Order. That is to be expected. But in the end, all the Zionists and Luciferians are heading to hell in a handbasket, and the true God-fearing patriots will triumph over Lucifer&#39;s regime of totalitarian big brother hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point entirely. </p>

<p>Anything can be a source when you know what you&#39;re looking for. And any source can have false information planted in it. Cointelpro is not some underfunded government half ass program, nor are the people running it stupid. You need to be able to filter the information for something useful, and combine it with other useful bits of knowledge you&#39;ve picked up on the way. But in order to do this you have to think for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say he hadn&#39;t woken anyone up. It&#39;s just not very effective in actually getting anywhere with &quot;the movement.&quot; He&#39;s been broadcasting for quite a while, yet his reporting shows not a single bit of evidence for this NWO conspiracy that has made one shred of difference in the fight. The order is moving further along its agenda faster than ever. Most of the people he does wake up, are out there screaming ranting and raving about every piece of information he puts out there, in an ignorant and accusatory fashion, which is actually what keeps us ostracized from what is considered acceptable by most people, hence undermining the movement from within. Doesn&#39;t really help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been concluding that Jones is indeed more of an opportunist than a reasoning freedom fighter. A carny.  I see that he and Rense are increasingly used as vehicles for disinfo, too. I read somewhere that godlikeproductions is a tool of the Tavistock Institute. Always be skeptical and measure twice before cutting once.</p>

<p>Also, a good way to damage all opposition is to set up gaudy sideshows that are obviously phony, and that pollutes the entire alternative media stream. So it&#39;s not inconceivable Jones is such.</p>

<p>Finally, how many of the ideologically-motivated left go around hawking things to make a profit? Henry Makow points out that Jeff Rense asks for donations to his site but owns a nice house in Oregon and a $30,000 Harley trike and other bikes. Anyone making comfortable bucks out of  disseminating disinfo is suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones had turned into a complete disappointment.  I enjoyed a couple of his early DVDs because of his smart use of local newscasts, particuarly in the case of the Oklahoma City bombing -- where the &quot;official&quot; narrative wasn&#39;t yet in place and actual facts were getting through.</p>

<p>Aside from that, Jones&#39; &quot;showmanship&quot; has eclipsed whatever his work might have been about in the beginning.</p>

<p>OP is correct.  I click the &quot;hide&quot; link on every infowars/prisonplanet link I see.</p>

Like other commenters stated, you never have to pay to view any of his documentaries.  I check out his show before I go to any mainstream media, but just like acid, too much will make you crazy.
I also agree, never bring up Alex when you&#39;re trying to wake someone else up, they&#39;ll shut down before you can finish the &quot;s&quot;. There are better sources out there for spreading a message. However, AJ remains my once a week guilty pleasure. I call it Jones&#39;n. 0_o </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember seeing one of the advertisements he plays on his radio show on one of the big mainstream cable tv stations that he supposedly is &quot;against&quot;. I thought that was odd.</p>

<p>On a side note, does anyone remember that documentary by Jay Weidner on the Kubrick film The Shining? Toward the end of the video he talks about a &quot;Tang&quot; drink. Now I&#39;ve noticed Alex starting to promote some new drink on his show called &quot;Tangy Tangerine&quot;. I thought this was odd too, but its probably just a coincidence. </p>

<p>Here it is, start at 8:10..

    <div class="md"><p>Alex is like many of us, aware of the corruption within the government and handling it in his own personal way. He may go overboard on some issues but that&#39;s because he&#39;s extremely passionate about what he&#39;s doing. Rather than just reading a ton, this guy made it his life&#39;s mission to be a part of the conflict. He&#39;s not a millionaire from this and is putting himself in considerable danger by talking about this stuff. Whether or not you agree with his approach, it&#39;s wrong to hate the man.</p>

<p>People need to lighten up and be more accepting of others and their approach to problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your concern and do understand where you are coming from. However, I am trying to look at this from an objective point of view.  When discussing conspiracy in the government and the ways to counter-act the elite, it would seem that Alex is doing a great job of shining light into dark corners. Is he doing it perfectly, no, but then again who does. Take for instance his infiltration of the Bohemian Grove.  This alone, exposed many people to what&#39;re kind of crap our leaders are involved in.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since I am a Truther, I listened to Alex Jones from 2002 to 2009. I started to listen to his show because he was the only one talking controlled demolition about the towers. For years, it was all about proving HOW the towers came down, what actually hit the Pentagon and the crash site in Shanksville, PA. It&#39;s pretty much understood the towers came down in a controlled demolition....but then the suject moved on to WHO actually commited 9/11 and he began his mantra of &quot;9/11 was an inside job.&quot;... but that is where he stopped.  And his suggestion is that it was all US Government which is a load of bullshit.
 Anbody that has actually researched 9/11 QUICKLY finds out that Israel played a huge role in the planning an execution of 9/11...Alex Jones will not talk about Israels part. He is a Zionist gate keeper for Israel that mixes the truth with outright bullshit and lies. He is there to confuse people, Not educate them.  </p>

<p>I love logic.</p>

<p>If you wanted to pull the world together under your thumb, and had the influence and power to do so, the last thing on your mind would be peoples awakening. Hence all the anti this and that playing out in the media every day. Hence the war on islam/terror, call it what you want we&#39;ve almost or are about to have invaded every islamic nation in the name of corporate greed, and Israel.</p>

<p>And to think that that is the worst thing that could happen is akin to burying your head in the proverbial sand. Fascism is not cool. </p>

<p>Absolutely. But using war and lies to bring about such a uniting is groundwork for disaster. For 99% of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones IS helping.  He just had a guest on yesterday that wrote a book about U.N. Agenda 21 and they had a discussion for an hour.  How does that not help.  It was very interesting and she gave specific examples how they are destroying hundreds of road in Sonoma County, California and effectively isolating property owners out there and destroying the value of their property.  Seriously discussions like this reaching such a wide audience is a good thing.  You are going to disregard Alex Jones completely because you disagree with his speaking style?  He&#39;s one of the good guys, and arguably reaches the largest audience.  In fighting is a strategy of the N.W.O., Alex Jones isn&#39;t going away, embrace it, figure out ways to help out.</p>

The order is moving further along its agenda faster than ever. Most of the people he does wake up, are out there screaming ranting and raving about every piece of information he puts out there, in an ignorant and accusatory fashion, which is actually what keeps us ostracized from what is considered acceptable by most people, hence undermining the movement from within.

<p>No, I was posting from several websites. You need to look a little closer, Fight. Your insults and barrages were nonstop, coupled with pathetically weak lies.</p>

<p>As for your false dichotomy, I don&#39;t need to choose either of your false choices. I am here to share information. If I learn something along the way, that&#39;s great, but I am primarily here to educate others.</p>

<p>You on the other hand, Fight, seem to be here to suppress others. You seem to be on a crusade against alternative opinion. I really wish that weren&#39;t the case, but the reality is there is a tightening grip of control on Redditors, and you are making the problem worse by your active suppression of the truth.</p>

<p>Edit: I originally missed your point, sorry. It isn&#39;t hate though. I&#39;m tired of seeing this mans &quot;empire&quot; grow, feeding on the energy from seekers of truth. Like it or not there are only two ways to go about acting in life: Serving yourself, or serving everyone. Alex Jones serves himself. That makes him not one of me. And I don&#39;t hate him at all. But there is a difference between hating someone and warning others of their trap. I don&#39;t even think he believes half the things he says.</p>

<p>he fact that he hasn&#39;t yet been found with two bullets in the back of his head and a suicide note pretty much sums up all the &#39;truth&#39; you need to know about what this man is spewing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, Devil&#39;s Advocate -</p>

<p>That, or the fact that he&#39;s the most well-known conspiracy theorist in the <em>world</em> today, and everyone (both haters and followers) are watching him like a hawk. Imagine if he was found dead, even if it looked like an accident, the first thought would be murder, and his followers would think &quot;well, of course they killed him, and this only underlines everything he&#39;s been saying - he was killed b/c he was right.&quot;</p>

<p>His detractors/haters know this - so they let him live - so guys like you will say <em>exactly</em> what you just said, all the while trying to marginalize him more.  Keeping him alive, they think, is benefiting them more than killing him.</p>

<p>Sure, his presentation is shit, sure he fucking flies off the handle all of the time, and he <em>does</em> sound like a ranting/raving lunatic - but presentation aside - tell me where he&#39;s wrong. I don&#39;t take anything he says at face value, but anytime I&#39;ve bothered to research the rabbit hole of information he spouts - he&#39;s been right.</p>

<p>And, David Icke? Total different ballgame. That guy may be right on some things, but he&#39;s obviously a total <em>kook</em> on the lizard bullshit. That clearly has no basis.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re just criticizing him on his presentation, hey I&#39;m with you. He&#39;s horrible.  But, if you&#39;re saying he&#39;s intentionally lying - ok - I&#39;m all ears/eyes - show me.</p>

I&#39;ve watched several of Jones&#39;s videos and while they start off compelling enough, there never fails to come that WTF moment where he makes some utterly ridiculous claim and thereafter loses any semblance of credibility IMHO.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to apologize for something I didn&#39;t say:</p>

<p>Is what I said. Your opinion here didn&#39;t express any of these qualities.</p>

<p>As for the rest I&#39;m glad that when you attained the power you sought, you acted appropriately with it. Shows a lot of character even if your original motives were less than pure.</p>
