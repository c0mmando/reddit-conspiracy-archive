       And it's about time America stopped denying this hard truth.  Countless ex members of the Intelligence community have admitted this.  Gary Webb wrote an expose in the San Jose Mercury News proving it, then later a book.  He then "committed suicide" by shooting himself in the back of the head.  Twice.  Check out statistics of the world's opium supply coming from Afghanistan; first before any invaders, then after the Russians, then the current American occupation.  Learn about the Opium wars, it's history continuing down a well-documented path.

      <p>
       Edit: Spelling.  Also, here's a link to the articles.  There's a Q and A at with Webb at the end.

       Dig a little deeper, that was a plot (conspiracy if you will) to drive up the price.  They banned cultivation for 12 month periods and since their creation had a minister of drugs who approved production for export.

       Orthodox?  That is not a term used in Islam.  You might be thinking about the Sunni Wahabbis and Takfiris that made up the Taliban and in that case you would be right, anyone caught using drugs or alcohol would be punished.  On the other hand cultivation of opium for export only was deemed halal by the leadership.  Again they had a minister who talked openly about this stuff pre-2001.

       Islam doest speak english, (some) muslims do and their vocabulary are just as likely to include this word as a christians vocabulary. Orthodox means adhering to the accepted or traditional and established faith and can be applied to any religion. An orthodox muslim would be a muslim that adheres to the traditional and established faith of islam.

      <p>
       Media usually call them radicals and islamists and not familiar words like conservative or orthodox, Repeating the established medias talking points doesn't usually fly in this sub-reddit.

       Islam doesn't speak english?  Islam is a religion that spans the globe, not a country.  The VAST majority of Muslims around the world only know the Arabic associated with the Quran and couldn't hold even the most basic conversation in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "Orthodox" is used in reference to Eastern European Christians and Jews.  Islamic radicalism comes in many flavors which is why it makes it necessary to break them down a little.  For instance, hardline Saudi wahhabis will see a Shia Muslim as no different than any other non-Muslim where as a lot of the Shia population doesn't hold the reverse view.  There are also Takifiris who believe that they themselves can decide who is and who isn't really a Muslim (believe it or not most of the people they declare "non muslims" are those civilians killed in their suicide attacks).

       I remember verifying this by looking up the UN statistics reporting on opium exports from the region year by year - it was pretty revealing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the size of the US military, it's not actually possible to achieve anything by acting unilaterally. The US is forced to choose between supporting one of two competing power bases that exist in the country to get anything done (eg.  drug lords or the Taliban).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 80's the US chose the Taliban, in order to take the Cold War to Russia and give it its own Vietnam. In the last decade, the US switched sides and allied with the existing structures created by the drug lords, because radical Islam is perceived to be a threat and/or can be used to persuade domestic opinion in support of the war.

       Well, Brzezinski the architect of the initial Afhan involvement, disregards the nature of the Taliban threat, even going so far as to dismiss them as 'stirred-up Muslims'. Good enough for me.

       Hey, I'm not the one that suggested the taliban was
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       than the US occupation. I really am surprised at this because you suggested growing poppies was bad, even though so many Redditors suggest growing marijuana in the US would provide a profitable crop that isn't subsidized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit also is anti-religion and anti-male dominated society. I seriously find much hypocrisy here. Either that or the anti-America crowd is larger then the anti-religion/pro-drug crowd.

       Way back in the 80's i remember Chuck D from PE talk about how all the talk in Queens &amp; Harlem in New York was over CIA goons from outside coming in to NY in the late 70's early 80's to punt coke and crack on to the poor black communities on purpose, to clear areas of residents for some vague agenda.
      </p>

       I have strong doubts that the CIA was selling drugs to promote gentrification.  They sell drugs to get a (bigger) black budget to play with.

       , it's an amazing book. It all started with US intelligence's connections with Lucky Luciano's global drug trafficking network out of South France/Turkey which later shifted to the Golden Triangle in Indochina then shifted the Golden Crescent where we now have Afghanistan growing over 90% of the world's opium. CIA has been there every step of the way.

       The sinking of the Lusitania.  This passenger ship that was also carrying weapons was intentionally sent into German controlled waters to provoke an attack in order to increase U.S. support for the war.  1,200 people died in the attack.  Many Americans signed up for WW1 because of the act.  To further prove the attack was warranted, the Germany Embassy took out an ad in the New York Times to warn Americans of the danger of boarding the Lusitania.  Here's a link to that ad:

       Back in the day China realized the opium England was smuggling in from India was fucking up their people, so they made it illegal.  Wrong move bro. Prohibition attracts the worst kind of criminals due to high stakes and high profits (and high people).

       Furthermore, historical evidence indicates that the Vietnam War was a continuation of the two Opium Wars of the Nineteenth Century in which the Western powers forced China to import opium. As governments learned more about the dangers of opium and heroin, it became unnacceptable—purely for public relations reasons—for the Western powers to overtly export narcotics to China and other countries. Over time, drug trafficking continued but its management shifted to international espionage services and organized crime which were secretly sanctioned by the Western governments. Eventually drug smuggling began to drive the foreign policies of the Western powers, and vice-versa. This entanglement, in my view, became the impetus behind Western involvement in the Vietnam War. It also appears that this situation was exploited by friends of Israel as a means of setting up the assassination of President Kennedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As previously stated, it was Jewish gangsters—such as "Legs" Diamond, "Dutch" Schultz, and Meyer Lansky—who introduced the heroin business to the American Mafia in the 1920s. In addition, the American Mafia—which was primarily of Sicilian origin in the 1920s—forbade involvement of either narcotics or prostitution. Such activity was left to the Jewish gangsters.11 This is a critical fact that further supports my conclusion that a Jewish conspiracy as the ultimate sponsor of the Kennedy assassination.

       Then they moved into Central and South America for cocaine in the 80's. That is where Iran Contra (Israel) got going.

       You're misrepresenting Gary Webb's writings. He never once claimed that the CIA directly aided drug dealers; only that they were aware of Contra cocaine smuggling. It's definitely possible the same thing is currently occurring in Afghanistan; there's no evidence for it, however, and there's no evidence that the CIA has ever directly aided drug smugglers.
