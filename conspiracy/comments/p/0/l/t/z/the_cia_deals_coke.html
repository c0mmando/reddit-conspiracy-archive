Countless ex members of the Intelligence community have admitted this.  Gary Webb wrote an expose in the San Jose Mercury News proving it, then later a book.  He then &quot;committed suicide&quot; by shooting himself in the back of the head.  Twice.  Check out statistics of the world&#39;s opium supply coming from Afghanistan; first before any invaders, then after the Russians, then the current American occupation.

    <div class="md"><p>Orthodox?  That is not a term used in Islam.  You might be thinking about the Sunni Wahabbis and Takfiris that made up the Taliban and in that case you would be right, anyone caught using drugs or alcohol would be punished.

</blockquote>

<p>Islam doest speak english, (some) muslims do and their vocabulary are just as likely to include this word as a christians vocabulary. Orthodox means adhering to the accepted or traditional and established faith and can be applied to any religion. An orthodox muslim would be a muslim that adheres to the traditional and established faith of islam.</p>

<p>Media usually call them radicals and islamists and not familiar words like conservative or orthodox, Repeating the established medias talking points doesn&#39;t usually fly in this sub-reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Islam doesn&#39;t speak english?  Islam is a religion that spans the globe, not a country.  The VAST majority of Muslims around the world only know the Arabic associated with the Quran and couldn&#39;t hold even the most basic conversation in the language.</p>

<p>The term &quot;Orthodox&quot; is used in reference to Eastern European Christians and Jews.  Islamic radicalism comes in many flavors which is why it makes it necessary to break them down a little.  For instance, hardline Saudi wahhabis will see a Shia Muslim as no different than any other non-Muslim where as a lot of the Shia population doesn&#39;t hold the reverse view.  There are also Takifiris who believe that they themselves can decide who is and who isn&#39;t really a Muslim (believe it or not most of the people they declare &quot;non muslims&quot; are those civilians killed in their suicide attacks).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember verifying this by looking up the UN statistics reporting on opium exports from the region year by year - it was pretty revealing. </p>

<p>Despite the size of the US military, it&#39;s not actually possible to achieve anything by acting unilaterally. The US is forced to choose between supporting one of two competing power bases that exist in the country to get anything done (eg.  drug lords or the Taliban). </p>

<p>In the 80&#39;s the US chose the Taliban, in order to take the Cold War to Russia and give it its own Vietnam. In the last decade, the US switched sides and allied with the existing structures created by the drug lords, because radical Islam is perceived to be a threat and/or can be used to persuade domestic opinion in support of the war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;m not the one that suggested the taliban was <em>better</em> than the US occupation.

<p>Reddit also is anti-religion and anti-male dominated society. I seriously find much hypocrisy here. Either that or the anti-America crowd is larger then the anti-religion/pro-drug crowd. </p>

It all started with US intelligence&#39;s connections with Lucky Luciano&#39;s global drug trafficking network out of South France/Turkey which later shifted to the Golden Triangle in Indochina then shifted the Golden Crescent where we now have Afghanistan growing over 90% of the world&#39;s opium.

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, the Opium Wars were for Albert Sassoon&#39;s business. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eRvKKDy6nM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eRvKKDy6nM</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, historical evidence indicates that the Vietnam War was a continuation of the two Opium Wars of the Nineteenth Century in which the Western powers forced China to import opium. As governments learned more about the dangers of opium and heroin, it became unnacceptable—purely for public relations reasons—for the Western powers to overtly export narcotics to China and other countries. Over time, drug trafficking continued but its management shifted to international espionage services and organized crime which were secretly sanctioned by the Western governments. Eventually drug smuggling began to drive the foreign policies of the Western powers, and vice-versa. This entanglement, in my view, became the impetus behind Western involvement in the Vietnam War. It also appears that this situation was exploited by friends of Israel as a means of setting up the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>As previously stated, it was Jewish gangsters—such as &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond, &quot;Dutch&quot; Schultz, and Meyer Lansky—who introduced the heroin business to the American Mafia in the 1920s. In addition, the American Mafia—which was primarily of Sicilian origin in the 1920s—forbade involvement of either narcotics or prostitution. Such activity was left to the Jewish gangsters.11 This is a critical fact that further supports my conclusion that a Jewish conspiracy as the ultimate sponsor of the Kennedy assassination.</p>

<p>Then they moved into Central and South America for cocaine in the 80&#39;s. That is where Iran Contra (Israel) got going. </p>

<p>You&#39;re misrepresenting Gary Webb&#39;s writings. He never once claimed that the CIA directly aided drug dealers; only that they were aware of Contra cocaine smuggling. It&#39;s definitely possible the same thing is currently occurring in Afghanistan; there&#39;s no evidence for it, however, and there&#39;s no evidence that the CIA has ever directly aided drug smugglers.</p>

<p>He then &quot;committed suicide&quot; by shooting himself in the back of the head. Twice.</p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080507054818/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/news/story/11772749p-12657577c.html">quite a bit of evidence</a> that he was planning suicide for a long time, and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_gunshot_suicide">multiple gunshot suicide</a> is not unheard of. Additionally, there&#39;s the question of motive: Why would the CIA want to silence a journalist 10 years after he published his expose? </p>
