<p>Yeah.  Although my looking at files on the net started quite a few years <em>after</em> I stopped looking at tv altogether, I will say that internet content is a lot better, as it affords one a much better educational level of critical examination.</p>

<p>Ha.  Me too. :)</p>

<p>I&#39;m at such a point of aversion in terms of being more aware of how the 1% manipulates the masses through the MSM, that I can&#39;t even watch any tv show really.  I&#39;m sure there are a few out there that are not horrible, but almost everything on tv <em>reeks</em> to me of propagandism on one level or the other - sometimes very subtle, sometimes not so subtle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I basically gave up TV just after the Internet came about in the later 90s... So let me vent a bit about how it sucks:</p>

<ul>
<li>So many girlfriends have been of the idea we are spending &quot;quality time&quot; together when we watch it for hours... no we are not, we are staring at a tube together.</li>
<li>The prevalence of crime shows, crime news and sheer terror on the tube really has made people think the world is unsafe and worry about nonsensical things (like pop stars marriages etc...).</li>
<li>Shows like Survivor etc... have been instructing people that the lowlife who can lie and cheat the most somehow &quot;wins&quot;.</li>
<li>Since I dont watch too many advertisements, I think my life is OK :)</li>
<li>When I do watch it I am amazed at the portrayal of men on it. Their all mainly bad, rapists and/or lost without a woman guiding them.</li>
<li>With so many horrific images on the tube I feel people are being desensitized to real human suffering and horror.</li>
<li>Since I don&#39;t see a lot of ads for stupid crap I think I save a lot of money, time and effort in my life</li>
<li>Reading on the net about different views and being able to exchange views with real people has challenged me, made me learn more and even sometimes changed my mind about a lot of my views.</li>
<li>I have better conversations with people as I am not just talking about what was on the tube last night.</li>
<li>I dont care very much about Hollywood or Royalty... I tend to care more about my fellow man and the promotion of equality and freedom for all.</li>
<li>I am much more critical of and aware of the power structures in society and how they actually work, I think... making me a better citizen.</li>
<li>I have been educating myself on various interests for years and feel better about myself versus blandly watching a tube for years and gaining nothing but a media-induced headache :). MIT has classes, I can read papers from all over the world and can learn something!</li>
<li>The sad part is that a lot of the Internet is now resembling TV...</li>

<li>So many girlfriends have been of the idea we are spending &quot;quality time&quot; together when we watch it for hours... no we are not, we are staring at a tube together.</li>
</ul>

<p>Couldn&#39;t agree with that more.  I had this conversation with my girlfriend the other day.  Although I don&#39;t have a tv, I almost feel that watching almost ANY type of programming risks &quot;disengaging&quot; a couple from direct focus and concentration upon one another.  While this might not be a horrible thing in and of itself, it should also <em>never</em> be used as any sort of crutch.  Blach.</p>

<ul>
<li>The prevalence of crime shows, crime news and sheer terror on the tube really has made people think the world is unsafe and worry about nonsensical things (like pop stars marriages etc...).</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely.  More propaganda and fodder in order to manipulate public opinion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Shows like Survivor etc... have been instructing people that the lowlife who can lie and cheat the most somehow &quot;wins&quot;.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen this show, but I&#39;ve heard something similar mentioned about it before.  That&#39;s unfortunate.</p>

<ul>
<li>Since I dont watch too many advertisements, I think my life is OK :)</li>
</ul>

<p>While I agree with the general sentiment, I will also say that it seems the entirety of our lives are inundated with advertisements <em>independent</em> of television programming.  Billboards, bus stop signs, and general street ads are literally everywhere you turn.</p>

<ul>
<li>With so many horrific images on the tube I feel people are being desensitized to real human suffering and horror.</li>
</ul>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<ul>
<li>Since I don&#39;t see a lot of ads for stupid crap I think I save a lot of money, time and effort in my life</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s good that you feel that way.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s likely an accurate personal assessment.  However - and again - keep in mind that the societal manipulation spills over beyond tv and many are adversely influence just by the &quot;beautiful people&quot; they see in street ads every day.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have better conversations with people as I am not just talking about what was on the tube last night.</li>
</ul>

<p>I remember I used to always feel bad, stupid, and embarrassed in gradeschool because I was regularly the odd one out of the conversations that dealt with &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; new movie that was on HBO the night before.  I actually can&#39;t be more grateful now that I&#39;m older about my parents decision to NOT allow the household to have cable television.</p>

<ul>
<li>I dont care very much about Hollywood or Royalty... I tend to care more about my fellow man and the promotion of equality and freedom for all.</li>
</ul>

<p>...very little of which we have at this stage of our civilization, unfortunately.</p>

<ul>
<li>I have been educating myself on various interests for years and feel better about myself versus blandly watching a tube for years and gaining nothing but a media-induced headache :). MIT has classes, I can read papers from all over the world and can learn something!</li>
</ul>

<p>Yep.  This.  There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.  They seem to rock pretty hard as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>The sad part is that a lot of the Internet is now resembling TV...</li>
</ul>

<p>And this is exactly how the 1% would love to have it.  There are still areas of critical thought and &quot;free&quot; speech.  It&#39;s just getting more and more difficult to readily come across them, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Oh absolutely.  Agreed.  Don&#39;t underestimate boobs, however.  They&#39;re everywhere, and oftentime people find themselves buying not the product that has the best, most objective and reliable user reviews and feedback, but the one that gets blasted across the airwaves and has the nicest pair of tits next to it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Torture as entertainment is the thing that pisses me off the most. It&#39;s so obvious that we are all being conditioned to accept the use of torture by the authorities set over us. Almost every action drama has a torture scene, just as almost every action movie has a torture scene. It used to be only the &quot;bad guys&quot; doing the torture, but around about 1995 it started to be the &quot;good guys&quot; doing the torturing, and also humiliating other people for their amusement. Sickening.</p>

<p>I did that for a while, but stopped watching news when I was asked to add sound effects to carpet bombing footage, and I haven&#39;t watched TV news since. What you see on the news isn&#39;t real, and they do a great job of distorting reality to appeal to their advertisers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do own a tv, but I mainly use it as a second PC monitor. Sometimes I give it a shot, but most of the times I get frustrated after 5 minutes of skipping channels and turn it off. Most stuff that comes off the tube is outragingly degenrating. The only programs I preferably watch are scientific documentaries (as opposed to historical ones) and sometimes news (if information is significant, I compare it to news from alternative unrelated sources to receive a second half of the story). </p>

<p>Internet is by far superior to television by offering (at least for now) a freedom to choose  what to watch and who to listen to. It&#39;s really no wonder that some people are looking to enforce Internet censorship and try to obtain complete media control.</p>

<p>Over the past few very short years (2-3), I&#39;ve actually listened to a few independent internet reports here and there that dealt with various news-type topics.  The news that I pay most attention to now is the kind that involves a &quot;non newscaster&quot; civilian type - i.e. an ordinary person with a camcorder or a cam-phone reporting on and recording something that&#39;s happening.  That&#39;s oftentime proven itself to be the best most accurate manner to understand what&#39;s really going on.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s funny that you mention this, because the decision I made later in life to not watch any tv was quite possibly directly related to and influenced by the fact that my parents never let the household have cable television during the entire time I lived with them (twenty plus years).  I remember I used to be SOOO mad at them for that when I was young.  I mentioned this to another on here, but I used to always be the odd ball out of every &quot;cool&quot; conversation in school that had to do with kids talking and laughing about the newest cool movie that showed on HBO the night before.</p>

<p>My parents, however, were - wittingly or not - conditioning me to <em>not</em> be dependent upon MSM programming.  By the time I lived on my own, I didn&#39;t really have enough money to afford cable (barely enough for a tv), and when I finally moved out of state a few short years later, I simply left the tv behind and haven&#39;t looked back since.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There has been a time or two when I&#39;ve found myself at someone&#39;s house, for example - house sitting or whatever - and have decided to sit down and just see what this whole &quot;tv craze&quot; is about.  I can&#39;t do it for more than a very short while, for it feels like I&#39;m literally getting <em>dumber</em> by the moment.  It really is infuriating, as you kind&#39;ve mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes.  I&#39;m not opposed to watching an occasional movie of my own choosing.  Most of the crap that&#39;s come out on the big screen lately, however, has actually shocked me with how stupid it is, so I&#39;m not all too enthusiastic about even watching <em>that</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t watch regular cable television, and in fact have cancelled my cable television subscription. Nothing comes over the air where I am without a big antenna, which I don&#39;t have, so no television for me. I haven&#39;t watched television on a regular basis for going on ten years now.</p>

<p>I do still have two televisions. The one in the living room never gets turned on, but is set up to be able to play DVDs. The one in the upstairs bedroom will play DVDs and compressed video files. I watch movies on that one. Never any news, regular drama shows, reality shows, or sports. I didn&#39;t even try to watch the Superbowl, just because I didn&#39;t give a fuck who was playing or who won.</p>

<p>And stopping my televison viewing habit was the best thing I&#39;ve ever done. My mind started to awaken as soon as I stopped watching television. It was like getting out of a gas-filled room and into the fresh, open air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family has an old SD CRT TV from about 2004, maybe earlier. I end up watching a few hours a month of actual television on the TV on average. I will occasionally watch The Big Bang Theory. I don&#39;t give a shit about what&#39;s on TV (so much &quot;reality&quot; TV bullshit these days), and the news is all bullshit to get people to watch for ratings.</p>

<p>The vast majority of my content consumption is via online video or podcasts.</p>

I downloaded what I wanted to watch and had a 42&quot; Plasma that I sold in 2009 when I moved from my old town. I was without a TV for over a year until about 6 months ago when I bought a Samsung 46&quot;. I watched a lot of shows I downloaded (I hate ads--they rot your brain, so I prefer to download)...yep...wasted a lot of time in front of that TV. It&#39;s being sold now...as I&#39;m moving to Australia in a month...going all the way back down to one laptop, a cellphone and some clothes :)</p>
