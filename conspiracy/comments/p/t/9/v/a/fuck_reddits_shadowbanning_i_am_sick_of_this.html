       Well yeah. That's why we call it a conspiracy. We aren't allowed to speak the truth where and when we want to. And it's not just on Reddit. Our supposed "free" speech is controlled, and sometimes we are punished for what we
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       (not what we
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       , but what we
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       ). If that sounds fair to anyone, you are a proud member of the fascist machine, even if you don't realize it.

       No doubt - I bet it does. But I propose that not every time you cant see a post, it is shadow-banned. Just makes sense.

       ....so EVERYONE and ANYONE who is not 100% convinced of your accuracy and credibility (even after having discussed things with you), is a paid member of the government?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously man - take a LONG.hard.look.at.yourself. Maybe get some air. Some sunshine. Plant some food (god knows we will need it). Just stop attacking people.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: No one is out to get you. No one cares about what you think (mostly because they are too preoccupied with themselves) - and certainly, no one cares enough to send government agents after you, personally. Sure - agencies have a habit of employing people to do just that. But in numbers so small it is insignificant (they just don't have the funding). The chances of you coming across them are tiny. Yet you are seeing them in anyone who questions you. Be careful. The cliff of sanity is steep, high and hard to climb back up once you have fallen.

       Don't take this guy too seriously. This kind of attack is juvenile at best. Most of us are actually quite reasonable, but we have our occasional paranoid posters accusing almost everyone of being paid by some organization or another to hold their viewpoints. In reality such organizations do exist and are quite a bit larger than you might expect, but chances are most opposing voices are not those of paid shills but are in fact those of people still invested in the current system. People who would lose big time if the conspiracies were true. These are the most vocal and the most passionate critics we face and sometimes some of the smartest.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't all think everyone who opposes us is an agent of the NWO, but that does not eliminate the possibility. Chances are you are just some young guy with little political experience. But Im just guessing here.

       "chances are most opposing voices are not those of paid shills but are in fact those of people still invested in the current system"
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you calculate such chances?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you are right or wrong but simply wondering how you come to that conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actually facts show it is extremely inexpensive to hire people to manipulate reddit  because people have posted the outreaches they see or receive from those trying to recruit, we know the pr organizations now recognize that reddit is the number 1 site referring  site on the internet, they know it's daily readership is the highest of any , we know billions - yes billions - of dollars are being spent by pr, lobbyist's, political "institutes", etc to influence public opinion and that they target reddit (they even say so on their websites).
      </p>
      <p>
       so given the immense amount of money allocated and the cheapness and importance of hiring reddit influencers, isn't it more reasonable to assume that: anytime someone takes a corporate opinion counter to widely known facts that the person is not an innocent ignorant person unaware of the truth but is in fact a paid shill on reddit?
For example everyone who paid attention now knows fukishima leaked radiation, is still leaking, it hoit America and is causing helath concerns, there are signs that the reactors are still reacting on their own in an uncontrolled fashion (elements still being released that only happen if that is still the case), and that their are huge risks that it will get far worse and affect AMerica's food supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet post any factual story discussing that to reddit and you will immediately get many downvotes to bury the story and most of the naysayers will be the same people who have naysayed since the first news of the accident yet their story's and replies won't have changed dispite all evidence revealed since the first news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me it is MOST likely MOST of those  opposing people are industry shills - not innocent ignorant regular people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my logic. now support your opposite position.

       Hopefully some enterprising young individuals will develop something new that rewards both users, managers, admins and owners. A real community that does not succumb to ownership and manipulation by a few or serve any diabolical political agenda or fall under the control of a financial monopoly.

       Agreed. Alex Jones...gawd..my favorite part was where he claimed the "elite" were consuming DMT to communicate with the "clockwork elves" to receive evil instructions on how to enact a NWO. If you believe in demons etc - and consume DMT - your mind will destroy itself. You will have no rational way to interpret the new information regarding the universe you have unveiled to yourself. You will simply see personal demons- exclusively - and they will leave you bed ridden in shock. Luckily - I don't believe in them - so I have had more pleasant and enlightening experiences. 'Sif Alex Jones didn't take DMT - saw only personal demons - which led him to make such ludicrous statements.

       You are so correct. But those of us who do know what's going on, are much nicer and logical than this guy. I unfortunately spent a good bit of time attempting to show him the error of his deleted ways, but in his mind I must be a government shill attempting to silence his free speech.

       I'm always amazed at peoples naive sense of the world.  Reddit fits into the media pyramid quite nicely, and plays the game just like any other media outlet.  When a message comes down from above to filter some views, it will happen as quickly as fox news.  Occasionally people have a peek behind the curtain and realize the game is rigged - hence this topic.
      </p>

       Yeah, this place started out with a lot more freedom, but then something happened - it became big.  Being big costs money, and with money comes a responsibility - just not to us,
       <em>
        to the owners, and their owners
       </em>
       .

       Linking to Infowars/PrisonPlanet is fine if it's quality original content - but often their content is just someone elses content but with their ads on it.

       That's what irks me about most of the RevolutionaryPolitics.tv links - often its just something from YouTube but in their player with their ads.

       Most social news sites, Digg, Reddit, whatever else is out there - prefer users to link to the original source of content.  Linking to a blog which then links to the content is called
       <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=blogspam">
        blogspam
       </a>
       and is pretty widely frowned upon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to read your article, we want to click on your submission and go to the article.  We don't want to click on your submission, go to someones blog where we can read a couple paragraphs, then click on a link there to read the full article.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Infowars or any other blog is adding commentary to the piece, then it's a different story.

       Actually they do add something by editorializing the headlines now and then. And the occasional picture or written commentary.

       Alex Jones does enough kooky-looking stuff that he admits to that you don't need to resort to attacking him with these pathetic lies that you're pushing. But the real reason is for media attention. Like the

       These kind of attacks happen against Alex Jones on a daily basis now.
      </p>
      <p>
       One voice in the comment saw it for what it was:
      </p>
      <p>
       "This is ludicrous. What exactly did he do wrong? NOTHING! He did not "get perverted" with a female listener whatsoever. Just because someone makes a comment, they are suddenly "getting perverted"? You make it out like the guy rubbed her breasts or something! What a joke this. Just another video in an attempt to distract from the truth that Alex Jones portrays, speaks out on, and﻿ displays in his broadcasts."

       Look genius, why don't you call his show since you seem to be absolutely obsessed about Alex Jones to the point of constantly talking about him all day long. I'm sure he can give you a better answer than I could.

       definitely noticed comments of mine of totally unpolitical nature not showing up in threads in spite of the comment count going up. i think there's a glitch going on but i dont think you are being suppressed.

       Hmm that is weird then. Reason I asked is because I've had that happen not only on reddit, but other sites, using mobile internet... due to break in coverage or whatever.

       You probably have, but in case you haven't, check for the comment permalinks after posting and/or see if you find them when loading the page with a different device. Sorry to be captain obvious, and im not trying to imply youre paranoid, just saying.... maybe your cat, uh, walked over the backspace key while submitting. Or something.

       hehehehe. That is why I generally avoid /conspiracy. I generally have too many good intentions, and do too much straight shooting to be surrounded by paranoiacs.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I love a good conspiracy, but other than the specifically targeted individuals, I usually debate the significance of people with bad intentions. Politicians, CEO's or not. They always fail.

       You're losing by 595 karma.  So why would you even try to use that as an argument?

       I'm referring to link karma, the original "karma". Comment karma was a more recent addition to Reddit.

       Reddit was made in 2005, comment karma was added in early 2008.  I'd hardly say that was recent considering it's been four years since they've added it and it took less than three years for them to implement it.  I've used reddit before you could comment as well.  That doesn't make my opinions or arguments automatically more substantial than a person who's been here a few months.

       I didn't say that, though, did I? I said "Comment karma was a
       <strong>
        more recent addition
       </strong>
       to Reddit."

       If you trolls actually read what your target enemies said, you might be somewhat successful. Then again, I doubt you'd know what to do with it after reading it properly.

       Why? I'm not that famous and Jones has a following like you. Bill Cooper already exposed this guy and I find it funny that you still think he's in it for you guys. He's just in it for the MONEY.

       Okay good. Another thing I wanted to mention is that I see you have a fondness of Alex Jones and his work. I just wanna let you know that he does have some good stuff but, some of his other works is complete sensationalism. Take for instance the [Y2K incident](
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFEaam2cojY">
        www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFEaam2cojY
       </a>
       ) where he said the world was over and he scared the shit out of people. So, with that being said just take everything he says with a grain of salt and double check him. :)

       I'm just saying that people with the real truth are always constantly being watched and sometimes end up dead like Bill Cooper. Alex Jones just sells sensationalism and marks everything as true. I remember last year he tried to say that we were going to war with Iran within two weeks and it never happened. He's a fearmonger at the end....even if he does say some truths, I will only listen with one ear.

       Don't listen at all. If you don't trust him, you shouldn't give him any ear. Here's why - those who tell you the truth 98% of the time but lie 2% of the time are VERY, VERY DANGEROUS. So if you distrust him, don't EVER watch his show.

       How is he not a senationalist? I suggest you look up his connectioons with Jesuits. He gets very flustered whenever anyone asks him about it.

       Yeah, I was gonna throw in Bill Cooper too because that is the other main thing disinfo agents use to try and discredit Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, just because Alex has a personal disagreement with somebody, doesn't make him a shill. Bill Cooper, much like Alex Jones, had a very important message. They mostly said the same things. Where they disagreed was tangential and not really significant in the big picture. I pretty much agree with all of what Cooper said minus the personal rant on Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see you also brought up Jesuits. That is another target on the disinfo playlist. But you missed how Alex Jones is a Jew, his wife is a Jew, and Alex Jones is really an alien reptoid. Yeah he gets that, too.

       Not by standards for the sake that they are mine. It's a complicated discussion on education and education. But generally yes. Law, math, hard science, esoteric liberal sciences, philosophy tend to produce the higher ups based on the GMAT and LSATs which test argumentative skills. Argumentative skills which researchers(Vytgotsky, Kuhn, Dewey) correlate to intelligence.

       But yes, my standards, because my standards are conclusions based on evaluation.

       No one is educated(which implies one is done with the education process.) The minute you are "done" you are either stupid or dead. I'm not calling you stupid, we have different definitions on education.

       The reason my comment karma is low is because I generally don't comment (until more recently) and when I do comment it is anti-establishment and controversial, two things Reddit has a hard time dealing with.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll tell you one observation of mine - I don't think the average Redditor has a problem with the controversy of my submissions (compare comment karma to karma), but there is a large coterie of trolls that work together in tandem duping accounts 24/7 to ensure that, on average, nothing serious in Reddit challenges the political status quo.

       Only the admins can shadowban. Mods cannot do this, but mods do have the ability to delete comments or submissions on threads they moderate. As for shadow banning comments I didn't even know that was a thing.

       You are not shadow banned. Did one of your old accounts get shadow banned? As a mod I can tell you all the shadow ban posts hit the spam filter first, and clearly yours did not. I hope this helps.

       I dont know anything about the OP - but the responses to him - and his responses in this thread - completely vindicate him as a reasonable person (as I said - in this thread). Some of you people are aggressive and tough-internet-guy a little too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he is right - then fuck - thats shit. If he is wrong - meh. Whatever. But ffs Reddit - stop being so "hatey". I have noticed a significant change in the tone of comments over the past 6 months (new shadow-account here). Daily, it seems, more and more people are becoming aggressive wankers.

       OK I concur then. You are slightly mad, showing typical symptoms of someone who smokes too much cannibis in isolation from people with differing perspectives. That used to be my problem too.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Not saying you are wrong - as far as I can tell by browsing, all of what you say is true (and I was already aware of them). The problem is interpretation of something's value, and the probable outcomes of such things. The government has a history of wasting money on useless projects.

       Yes, well - not all lack of perspective results from smoking cannabis. Frankly most people would benefit from weekly joints. I think where we differ in opinion is where the significance of such conspiracies lie. For numerous reasons, I have learned to openly laugh at any conspiracy. Here is just one simple reason why: An industrial collapse will soon be upon us. Noone can tell when this will happen, but the best guess is sometime after fuel costs rise above $US10-12 per gallon ($AUD3 litre) for the average person. At this point, the profit margins for almost any type of entrepreneurship - including farming - become so small that it is no longer feasible. This will occur AFTER a financial collapse. A financial collapse will APPEAR to be the final consequence, but it is really just the beginning of consequences. Signs of a financial collapse are everywhere right now, but may still be quite a while away (noone knows just how robust or resilient our current systems are - its like watching someone die of massive poisoning - you know they WILL die, but it can be surprising just HOW LONG it can take them to die).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, my point is this: How successful do you think ANY conspiracy can be, in the face of this? True power only lies in controlling people who themselves have some limited power - hegemony over a bunch of body-lice eaters is no real power at all. They cannot work or produce anything. There is nothing to take from them. Having total control and power over every last one of the 1 million or so chimpanzees on earth will get you nowhere. The most you could hope for is managing a million strong barrage of chimp faeces all hurled in the same direction at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       All attempts at control, are doomed to failure. And this is just ONE of the reasons why. There are many more.

       mmhmm - and paranoia is not truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Forgive me - I don't visit /conspiracy because there are never any posts of things I am not already aware of. Also, I got over my phase of being so self-indulgent that I could seriously consider that anyone gave a crap what I personally thought. You see, there is this thing loosely called entropy - this physical fact, results in universal conspiracies being doomed to fail. Are there "evil" people in the world? - yeah, sure. Are they selfless enough to be organised appropriately? - no, they are not. Is human nature bad enough to make sure we fall short of Utopia? - absolutely. Do any of the above military/intelligence projects have a chance of making any real, noticeable difference to the course of events in the wider world? Not really.

       FFS bro - grow up. Read what I have posted to you. It was a gift you should learn from. Also, learn to recognise sources of good information (eg NOT Alex Jones). The first rule to understanding the universe and human nature: Acquire the skills to identify credibility and a superior perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, dont - and continue to be ridiculed by other childish randoms. I came out in support of you. You then proceeded to ridicule me for having a differing opinion. You lose. Enjoy delusion and self-knighthood.

       Yeah - whatever "Logic Master". As I said - I came out in defence of you. No wonder you have 8 comment karma in 6 months - 8!!!!!!

       Have a good look at yourself, and stop - just for a second - believing that the reason the world is not to your liking (and doesn't like you) is because IT is fucked up, but YOU are awesome. Just for a second. You might be surprised what you see and learn. Not all people are idiots and dismissable as simply text on a screen.

       Dude, comment karma says one and absolutely only one thing - how much of a smartass you are. People downmod insightful comments all the time. Smarminess is what gets you comment karma, and I'm sure you know all about comment karma whoring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only meaningful statistic in Reddit is link karma, which was the original karma, because it is the submissions that matter most in social bookmarking websites.

       reddit is owned by a corporation, i guess if they deem a comment offensive, or that there's a potential of a lawsuit, or legal implications from a comment then it'd be deleted?

       I'm not talking about that kind of censorship. Somehow I don't think a PrisonPlanet article comment is going to put Reddit in legal peril. I haven't said anything that would cause such attention.

       Is it not this sort of strike on personal opinion that caused the recent self-demise of a contributer here? seriously, attacking the character doesn't quell the arguement; we can all agree that being shadowbanned is like being tin-hatted by those who have all been accused of the same...

       If you read the top post from the redditor who claims to be his girlfriend, it seems he was one person. I only say "claims" because I've learned after being here for 4 years to take every unconfirmed statement with a grain of salt. I mean no offense to his family, friends or anyone else who knew the man. I enjoyed his posts, and he will be missed.

       Does the comment still exist in under your user page? If I go off the page and then back, the comment won't show, but it shows up later. Maybe your concerns are over the time delay?
