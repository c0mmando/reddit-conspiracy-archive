       I was thinking something similar, but at the same time also this post had me thinking about the intentions of those we think of as the elite and who they are and I can't work out in my mind any of these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP raises some interesting points but I cannot help but feel that those directing things need the cooperation of the population or at least a passive confused, distracted herd who accept the ever changing status quo.  I think there is a lot of evidence for a long history of propoganda and other efforts to shape opinion even truth and keep people in the dark generally and if that is the case then why?  Is it because the masters are non benevolant or because manipulation creates less friction than physical force?
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly though physical force is routinely used in war and the threat of prison hangs over anyone who deviates from what is acceptable.

       hmm, never came across that before.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is hard to say whether or not this is confirmation bias but it seems that distrust  and a questioning attitude towards authority has been growing.  Logically the internet has created this effect and so that would seem like where the battleground is, and that is where we are.

       Have you ever played chess?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is amazing how many times you can turn around a position. Right now the situation is pretty close and the situation is even quite promising. I used to play chess a lot as a kid, and was the Nordic champion for example. I managed to turn around a lot of positions just by not resigning the game when it turned bad. Over the past years a lot of people have been trying the same both on a local and on a global level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The elites can only react and counteract what these people, organizations and in some cases countries are doing to prevent them from reaching their goals. A lot of progress has been made and it doesn't need a whole lot more to tilt things the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment you decide there is no chance is the moment you've lost. And there is no excuse for giving up at this point.

       I think March 20th is the key date. That is when Greek debt is due, and Greece at this point is expected to default. An uncontrolled Greek default alone could spell disaster for the financial empire of the elites, but there are other moves that seem to be materializing and they could deal the mortal blow. Iran has declared it is going to start an oil bourse on the exact same date where they will exchange oil for currencies other than the US dollar. I don't think it is a mere coincidence they have chosen that date, and I think it is a signal to other countries to take action as well. India has declared its willingness to purchase Iranian oil with gold. Russia and China have been gradually reducing their exposure to US treasuries. And Japan has announced it may take over its own central bank. I think we have the perfect storm, and this may be the time when we may witness the undoing of the western financial empire.

       First off you are probably living in the heart of the machine, so your perspective is quite skewed with fear.  There are a lot of places on Earth that are free and will be for a long time to come.  Secondly what will happen if the "elites" win and get total control?  You don't know.  Maybe once they have total awareness they will finally be able to recognize what is good and turn off their evil system.

       You really think that the elite sociopathic .0002% of the population can enslave the rest into lives of misery, poverty, and slavery forever? Bullshit. We have Oathkeepers to keep the military in check, we still have a few good cops, we have a LOT of gun owners who are carrying more and more. As someone who worked with directed energy weapon R&amp;D at Aberdeen Proving Ground, I can say that yes, we do indeed have some mindblowing sci-fi shit in the hands of the military and police right now.....
          But those in power have been screwing the military over worse and worse since vietnam. They're telling dying 9-11 responder cops to go die on their own dollar. So until they have an army of humanoid robots that can tend to their every need, the elite are extremely vulnerable to well-deserved betrayal from any and all of their underlings.

       the jackboots, even considering wannabe law-enforcement tools like the TSA, are 1%. The clerical class..priests, rabbis, evangelists...far less than 1%. Federal employees total, most of who are involved in clerical or benevolent positions...maybe 3%. Military, including burnt-out troops on their umpteenth deployment, oath keepers who refuse to obey unconstitutional orders...1.5%. 
It' all illusion, the idea that they have enough people to even realistically ruin everyone's day if they try to bring the hammer down across the board. but if they are allowed to attack unopposed, they will gradually roll across us all, killing and imprisoning all dissenters.

       It isn't just the enforcement that keeps injustice rolling, it's the support they receive from the fairly well-off, who do not desire to lose any of the advantages that they have, rightly or wrongly, been able to secure.

       true. crime is only allowed to propagate downhill. enough money will make the most disgusting and barbarous abuses 'legitimate'....after all, if i BANK wants to illegally seize a home without proper paperwork, they'll get it...as they have been doing for 8 years.

       It is quite interesting that the more we attempt to fight the system, the easier it is for societies elite to control us. THough we think we live in a relatively free society, every facet of our lives is controlled and monitored. The problem we face is our inability to coordinate an effective and streamlined resistance which encompasses the majority, the public. Our continued content with the tightening grip of our governments is our undoing. Similar to the ranking of a battalion, the general cannot fight the enemy when his troops are in disrepute. The only reason they have control is because we give it to them, in return for safety, oppression and security.

       individual mindset and knowledge how mass psychology works is more important than paranoid fear of opressive technology. think of 1984 and brave new world as cultural inoculums, artificial implants of our (sub)consciousness that we have to replace with our own culture, own myths and own visions and paths to our different future. we must work on that, throw out the old and
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       the new - they (1984, bnw and all their cultural derivatives) are nothing but attempts at a self fulfilling prophecy. toxic programming. most of our culture is just that or was hijacked to be just that. mostly it is created out of thin air.
      </p>

       but fatalism is not a healthy mental attitude. the essence of being alive is to change freely in response to the environment.

      <p>
       malignant technology is pointless if you consider that the elites need us way more than what we need them. today, noone is detached from the society and if they choose to kill us, they will be gone too. therefore their tech and power are like a potemkin village, a facade with real living people on both sides. mirage. maya. once we are all fed up, unified actions will make surveillance useless - if we are
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       against the system the system will be too overwhelmed to respond effectively (like a universal ddos attack) - there is a definite cut-off point in the pyramid, below which things run out of control... and when i say
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       i dont think the population of the us, but all (99.999%) of us. they are wastly outnumbered.  when will this change happen is really up to us - the people, not r/conspiracy mind you - and making it happen will involve some self sacrifice, but we are used to that already, aren't we?

       The chances are 100%. There is no reason to 'beat' them, since they are either going to be crushed under the wheels of progress or destroy themselves. Their reign is coming to an end one way or the other. The only problem is weather we will survive the process.

      <p>
       No, you have gotten it all wrong: that is a property of a primitive life form. Most people are still rather entangled with their primitive instincts, but for quite some time there have been those who are above savagery and irrational madness. On an intelligent level dominance is understanding of others and making all resistance unnecessary. Greed and lust cannot coexist with true intelligence. The smart crave not for power and wealth, but for knowledge, understanding and unity.

       More intelligent in what form? Calculating the trajectories of sand particles in a sandstorm? This artificial 'intelligence' does not necessarily include consciousness and therefore most likely wouldn't possess intelligence any greater than a bucket of rocks.

       None of us would be here if we would believe otherwise. While I cannot contribute on behalf of other people in here, I can speak freely for myself. I personally have faith in humanity, since there's really no other way to go about it. Sure, I know of the problems we are having: religions of mass destruction, stupidity, greed, corruption, outdated economic system, energy crisis, massive conspiracy to keep the humanity enslaved and approaching overpopulation issue in the horizon. The best solution out of this crisis would be one that would not result in destruction of the human civilization and would bring as little suffering as possible. While most people are unable to comprehend this picture, it is quite easy to avoid unnecessary suffering just by letting people know what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that the elites are struggling to hold their power. They know they are running out of time. Desperate times require desperate measures. Their best attempt to hold power would be to postpone the inevitable by causing wars and destruction. I myself believe that they have been creating and preparing America and ultimately Israel for this war. They want to revive the current economy and to diminishing the human population by the means of war. Their plan to avoid the after-war crisis is to replace the Old World Order with a prison planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The front line at the moment is the Internet. With free Internet they cannot push through their plan forward and so they invest into censorship, political corruption and blogola (misleading the public by implanting seeds of doubt and by providing crazy conspiracy theories which would only distract people from the real issues at hand). Our best chance is to spread information, protect the Internet and to stand against war and violence, which they would want us to have. In my opinion r/conspiracy is doing pretty good job. Keep it going guys/gals!

       We are the system. Those who would control us only number a few hundred. Their power comes from the positions they hold and those are mostly electable. Even the police and army is us. Even if we're only following orders, it doesn't take much to change who is giving the orders. Stop acting like 300 million people are controlled without their cooperation.

       Maybe I am trying to be too rational about it and using my limited technical knowledge cannot understand how it would be possible. Is it not the case that your wifi adapter generally has only a certain range so a secret network router for want of a better word, how does your adapter communicate?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say recording audio. do you mean via the phone  or another way?  Ive heard before that its possible to eavedrop on a phone even powered off and the paranoid remove their batteries, but I think you tend to notice  a much shorter talk time if there if the phone is transmitting a call.

       I think that is bogus. There is no way a satellite from orbit can connect to the network card on your computer. I would be far more likely to believe that they can eavesdrop on you using a van parked nearby via some security whole in the proprietory Mac/Windows OS network stack. That would be a reasonable proposition. But to say they can spy from orbit is absurd. Not even the FBI can violate the laws of physics. A healthy dose of paranoia and doubt is always healthy, but at these levels you are only doing damage to your sanity.

       I think fighting the system is a massive misdirection from your true calling.  There are ways out of the prison, but I don't think its through fighting 'the guards'.  They have been here for millennium and are well prepared to stay guardians.

       Also, your perception is another big part of it.  If you perceive yourself to be a victim then behold that is your reality.  Remember the duality of this realm - all it takes is a change of perception to see everything in a new light.

       Legend has it, we did once capture control from our masters...and that time was Atlantis.  Imagine yourself sitting building wonderful little cities out of Lego, and as soon as you accomplish your goal someone (much larger) comes and smashes it up.  This cycle continues to happen and you grow frustrated until it dawns on you...you don't need to build to become enlightened.  You sit quietly and meditate and the 'master' comes along, nods in acknowledgement..'you're ready to play outside' he/she says.

       As long as we draw breath; as long as our hearts keep beating, there is always a chance to win.  Right now we're fighting for the hearts and minds of the populace, the true citizens of the U.S. and the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an uphill battle and always will be--people almost always believe "credible" news sources such as CNN, Fox, NBC, etc. without thinking for themselves.  I was once one of those people until my veil was lifted.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is always hope and for the sake of the generation that will come after us, we must never surrender--we must fight until our bodies are shattered and our minds are torn asunder; and then we must get back up and continue fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our enemies are deeply entrenched and have access to virtually unlimited resources, but the will of the people is unstoppable.  One falling stone could become an avalanche, sweeping away all traces of evil and corruption beneath its righteous fury.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our enemies are human beings, and human beings eventually end up making mistakes.  When our enemies make that large mistake, we will seize it to turn the tide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is our sword and the desire for justice is our shield.  We will become an unstoppable phalanx.

       I can't help but agree.  Our so-called "enemies" who control the mass media are simply sick.  Most are afflicted with a spiritual blindness.  This makes them unconscious of their evil actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they have already made their mistakes.  It's too late.  They may try one last clampdown but it is doomed to fail.  The system really exists in the minds of the brainwashed, and those are mostly old geriatrics.  It's laughable actually, how pitiful it is.  Are we gonna prop up a mass of old people with life extensions just to keep their votes coming?  All it will take is a small catastrophe to thin out this herd, and that is exactly what the 'Old World Order' does not want.  They want everything as is, forever.

       They played their hand too soon.  Any further power grabs are too obvious now.  Its like the saying "the stronger you tighten your grip, the more slip through your fingers".  Every move they make will only shrink their influence until they are ultimately irrelevant.

       I agree, brother or sister.  Action must be born of realization--we as Americans no longer have the luxury of sitting back and muttering "well it's always been this way and will always be this way. Why bother trying?"

       We are all here on this planet together.  That includes the slave (you) and the master (elites).  We are all human with flaws.  But the masters are sick.  They actually need our help.  They are spiritually blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what you need to learn through practice and confidence.  When you do you can stand up to those you consider your enemy (or those who consider you their enemy) and talk to them in a manner which will persuade them to the side of good.  See the potential in them, buried, have sympathy for their situation.  Not everyone chooses to be brainwashed, and even fewer realize that they have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our only way out of this mess is together.  It is actually MY/OUR/YOUR responsibility to heal these sick "elites" and anyone who supports them.

        I see absolutely no way to win. What does everyone else think? Are you content with little victories on the Internet, or showing up to some protest? Or, do you agree with me, and think there is absolutely nothing we can do.

       Not at the rate we as a population are going - no.  We're way too stupid, divided, ignorantly opinionated, and emotionally attached to incorrect perspectives to sufficiently change and deal with the manipulation on this planet.
