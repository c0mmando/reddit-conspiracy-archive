       Osama Bin Laden et al were motivated by American foreign policy in the Middle East, specifically support for Israel.  Yet this fact has been the most vehemently suppressed, and was actually omitted from the 9/11 commission report (along with many other things).
      </p>
      <p>
       I must clarify first that I AM skeptical about WTC7 as well.  I have been consumed for many years with the miniscule details of the events of 9/11, specifically the buildings' collapse.  However, I have begun to realize that architects/engineers for 9/11 truth cannot relate to the average person (nor rouse up a collective movement) with their technical details, and this focus actually serves (albeit involuntarily) to withdraw attention from the most egregious and blatantly obvious explanation for 9/11.  This explanation, if exposed on a grand scale to the masses, would redirect all skepticism towards a productive end, and a better, safer future for us and our children.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 - whether conducted by Bin Laden (official story), Mossad or the CIA - was instigated by US FOREIGN POLICY.  This obviously fits into the first (Bin Laden) explanation quite well, and I believe does not merit further scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Mossad were to have carried out the attacks, 9/11 would have served the interests of ISRAELI AND AMERICAN foreign policy, justifying American expansionism and the continuation of brutal policies inflicted on the Palestinians by Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were the CIA...again, 9/11 has provided carte blanche for American militarization and foreign policy expansion throughout the mideast and into Central Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not discrediting Engineers/Architects for 9/11 Truth, or anyone else that raises questions regarding the physics of the buildings' collapse.  The point I am trying to raise is that American foreign policy, specifically support for Israel, is the ultimate culprit, and that this has unfortunately been lost in the details of our cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       By attempting to argue about specific details, rather than the elephant in the room, we are exhausting ourselves and our focus in the process.  We have effectively fragmented the opposition with these details just as those who questioned JFK's death have emphasized gunshot angles and grassy knolls for 50 years to no avail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, please, please try and understand where I am coming from, it is all I ask.  I know how much it can piss me off when I have put so much effeort into focusing on one thing and someone tells me I have been doing it wrong all along.  But that's not what I am saying.  All I would like to see is an attempt to create a movement for 9/11 truth that focuses on the root causes first.  Once this gains traction we can use the details of 9/11 to hammer our cause home for good.

       With all due respect... skeptical?

       Three gigantic buildings collapsed within seconds. The foundations of all three buildings basically evaporated. I'm sorry, but all the complex-popular mechanics shit explaining it means nothing. We have videos that show the buildings collapsing from the bottom up, when two them were struck at the top and one of which wasn't struck. It's basic fucking physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were explosives in all three buildings. It's a
       <em>
        fact
       </em>
       . Those who refuse to believe are simply afraid to take the wool blanket from their eyes.

       However, I ask why is it this way? The money trail appears to lead to the house of Rothschild,  blonde haired, blue eyed, Arian banksters who funded Hitler while hiding behind the religion of those they slaughtered.

       Sadly, they've succeeded in keeping everyone confused, though... so I expect many of the people in this subreddit feel that the only solution is to blame "The Jews".

       The problem is that the obfuscation of disliking Zionism being equivalent to racism has been created in order to deflect attention away from a very influential group of people- when in fact, Zionism is a form of racism in itself.

       When push comes to shove, the Rothschilds will turn those "very influential" people in to the Nazis/DHS for internment and execution in order to protect their own vested interest in controlling all of the moneypower. Just like they did to all those wealthy Jewish people during WWII. Israel is a Rothschild creation and, I can assure you... they'd nuke it off the face of the earth if that's what it took to retain their power control. Make no mistake. These people are the living embodiment of Satanism (love of money is the root of all evil, and no one loves their money and associated power more than the Rothschilds).

       You are correct, no doubt! But we should stand tall in our beliefs that 9/11 was a farce! There were valiant Germans who stood up to Hitler when he carried out false flag terror ops! We should do the same.

       Yes, you make great points, but stand tall and say openly that the official story is laughable and we will be in full agreement.
