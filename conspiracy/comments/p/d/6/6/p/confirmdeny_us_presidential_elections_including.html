        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everyone knows that George W. Bush couldn&#39;t have made it into the oval office without some rigging. Everyone knows about Diebold.</p>

<p>So what about Romney?</p>

<p>Republicans spent all day hating wall street and politicians, and then they pick a &quot;businessman and politician&quot; as their candidate for president? Seems fishy.</p>

<p>Seems obvious to me, just by looking at Romney, Newt, and Santorum, that the RNC probably knew Romney was going to win all along. (Sidenote: This is similar to the Obama/McCain election, where it was obvious that McCain/Palin was just a big joke and the election seemed to be being thrown by the Republicans (indicating/confirming that the difference between R and D really is only skin-deep)).</p>

<p>So... Does anyone know of any verifiably independent polls/studies that show that the RNC results correlate with independent polling (e.g., does it make sense for 50% of Nevada RNC primary voters to vote for Romney)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Primaries aren&#39;t proper elections and rigging them would be a piece of piss. The political parties are private clubs and they can fix these primaries if they want to, I am guessing, without even breaking any laws.</p>

<p>It is much harder to fix national elections. Well, unless electronic voting machines are used, of course. Genuine democracies don&#39;t allow these, because of the risks involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it makes perfect sense for Romney to do as well as he did. He&#39;s a Mormon --Clark County has tons in, ie. North Vegas -- he&#39;s the frontrunner, he spent an assload, he just won big in Florida (&quot;momentum&quot;) and the other candidates aren&#39;t exactly lighting the world on fire as regards to inspiring enthusiasm. </p>

<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/what-we-learned-from-nevada/#more-25509">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/what-we-learned-from-nevada/#more-25509</a></p>

<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/the-nevada-caucus-look-for-romney-to-win-and-paul-to-outperform/#more-25345">http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/the-nevada-caucus-look-for-romney-to-win-and-paul-to-outperform/#more-25345</a></p>

<p>And yes, Paul can easily outperform the polls without the polling representing some conspiracy. As Silver points out, turnout was quite low. Answering the phone and saying you&#39;d vote for so-and-so isn&#39;t the same as getting off your ass and actually doing it, and given everyone knew Romney was going to win and Paul supporters are the only ones who&#39;re trying to talk themselves into the viability of a delegate strategy, a lot of Newt and Frothy Mixture fans just stayed home.</p>

I was at a meeting where both the Democrat and Republican candidate was chosen from the group of people in the room and yes, one of them won.

<p>Just because you find a few bad beans doesn&#39;t mean you throw out the whole bucket of beans. It&#39;s about making up your own damned mind about what you see and hear. If you don&#39;t want to know shit outside your own bubble, better just stay away altogether. Otherwise, get out of the bubble and jump into this head first.</p>

<p>Also, bullshit called on your &quot;personal experience&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rely on what questionable sources?</p>

<p>People have this odd notion that Alex Jones and Ron Paul and David Icke are our gods. I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, that you have no fucking clue as to who or what any of us are. And to throw everyone who is a regular here into the same bunch is a damned tragedy as I&#39;m sure most of us could easily get along. Instead, go ahead and continue with the belittlement and denial.</p>

<p>This subreddit is NOTHING like those rambling, ignorance regurgitating, tweenage twats you see on YOOSTOOBS.</p>

<p>If you want some sources you need but ask. Hell, half the people that spam <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are trolls.</p>

<p>See, what I don&#39;t understand is how someone can throw out an entire documentary or lecture or article because of something considered &quot;crazy&quot;.</p>

<p>The earth doesn&#39;t really revolve around the sun. </p>

<p><em>Now you have to ignore and bash and belittle me and call anyone who agrees with what I say a retarded conspiracy theorist who still lives in their parents basement and eats hot-pockets and has unlicked cheeto fingers</em></p>

<p>Get real.</p>

Diebold is a voting systems company among other things. They (and the other voting machine companies Premier/ESS/Sequoia/Dominion) have about 80% of the US &#39;market&#39; aka elections. Be careful researching this stuff.</p>
