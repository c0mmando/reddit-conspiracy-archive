        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you are a fan of Chris Hedges, you will likely know that his recent publication labeled &quot;The Death of the Liberal Class&quot; outlines in great detail the ways in which the left has really been characterized by inaction and disconnection from reality, utterly convinced (through uni education and &quot;feel-goodery&quot; - like reddit) that they are fighting the good fight.  This book profoundly changed my outlook, which consisted of &quot;this ideological offshoot is more important and moral than that one&quot; because if it does not involve action, THEN IT DOESN&#39;t FUCKING MATTER.  This is the main point of Hedges&#39; argument in his book, in reference to the ideological left, but it applies to everything - conservatives, anarchists, communists...you name it.</p>

<p>We are doing the same thing, by going on this website, ranting and raving, but never doing anything constructive about it!  There are so many of us with the same point of view.</p>

<p>A you all may have heard, the Canadian government, along with most western governments, have unleashed in unison an unprecedented attack on the freedom of the internet, calling for a new, regulated version in which the government has the ability to limit our accessibility to certain sites, and even &quot;wiretap&quot; internet dissent.</p>

<p>The &quot;child pornographer&quot; has served the same role for proponents of internet regulation as the terrorist has served for those proponents of curbing civil liberties.  Fear is at play in this all-out battle against internet freedom, just as it has been in the war on terror, and those who oppose government action/regulation are supposedly &quot;with&quot; the child pornographers, just as those who once opposed curbing civil liberties have been labelled &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and &quot;with the terrorists&quot;.</p>

<p>We all like to bitch on this website, like many other similar sites, and sometimes we fester up half-assed action (like the reddit blackout) that temporarily signifies progress, but these MOTHERFUCKERS are unrelenting, and have all the patience &amp; resources that make time of no importance.  THEY WILL GET WHAT THEY WANT.</p>

<p>We need to introduce a counter-bill in all these countries that will effectively quell all future attempts to regulate the internet, and WE NEED ACTION NOW, or else it will be too late.</p>

<p>I propose that we start a movement, RIGHT HERE, ON THIS SUBREDDIT, that serves but one purpose:</p>

<p>Absolve the internet from all government regulation in the future through the integration/amendment of each countries&#39; &quot;BILL OF RIGHTS&quot; (as in Canada, and an amendment to the &quot;CONSTITUTION&quot; in America) so that the internet cannot be included in any future regulation.</p>

<p>I NEED YOUR HELP REDDIT, and I DON&#39;T know what to do.  My government has convicted numerous  internet pedophiles AND terrorists without regulation of the internet...THEY WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO QUELL INTERNET DISSENT IN THE FUTURE (it could be 10 years from now, or 50 years from now, it doesn&#39;t matter), and this is extremely dangerous to what freedoms we have left.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s organize, by country (and region in the EU&#39;s case), and introduce OUR OWN FUCKING LEGISLATION.  I really think we can do it, but I need your help (whether you are lawyers, govt officials, or ordinary citizens)!</p>

<p>WE&#39;VE GOT TO BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF ORGANIZATION, OR ELSE WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE ON SUCH A GRAND SCALE EVER AGAIN WITHOUT THE INTERNET.</p>

<p>WHAT DO YOU THINK!!??   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s far too late to try to think the the existing internet structure is either free of or not infested with government software/monitoring. Currently none of us are using a free internet, but most just don&#39;t realize it.</p>

<p>In an effort to combat the &quot;DNSChanger Trojan&quot;, the FBI installed &quot;clean&quot; DNS servers that the United States will have been operating through, as of March 8th, for 120 days.</p>

<p>There have been a few stories floating around about a &quot;potential government shutdown&quot; of the internet on March 8th. What this actually means is that any sites that aren&#39;t showing themselves clean of the DNSChanger Trojan will be denied access to the DNS system after March 8th.</p>

<p>What it means for you and I is that we&#39;ve all (in the US) been operating off of an FBI run DNS system for the last four months.</p>

<p>Do you think for a moment that they haven&#39;t captured every single transaction that ran through their DNS servers over the whole time period? Do you think it hasn&#39;t been shared with every single law enforcement agency out there?</p>

<p>If people want a truly free internet system we will have to create our own private nets using either the existing networks with different protocols or creating our own separate &quot;dark net&quot; that operates outside of the existing structure.</p>

<p>Then we will spend 150% of our time trying to ensure that we are only giving access to the dark net to the correct people and we&#39;ll let any number of moles slip through in the chaos. We will then monitor our own people with a heightened sense of paranoia to the point where we won&#39;t be paying attention to outside threats any longer.</p>

<p>An entirely new system of communication needs to be created outside of government regulation that the people can consider a safe place to talk, and even at that, it will only be temporary.</p>

<p>Thinking that we can enact legislation at this point that will guarantee our freedoms is naive at best and terminally dangerous at worst.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Citizens trying to go against their governments nowadays?<br/>
You&#39;ll be hit by a stray bullet while your walking down the street. Look at OWS. Plenty of people participated. But the government virtually kept them off the air. Or made them out to be the bad guys. Corporations own all these news outlets. If your not shoot dead by a &#39;stray bullet.&#39; The media will turn you into an extremist or someone with mental health issues.  Your only way to truly change anything is to get an in, with &#39;certain&#39; organizations to increase your power as a single person.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming face to face with how monumental the task is of effecting change is still not a sufficient reason to think that the only way to change anything is to work within the confines of the system of corruption that is enslaving you.</p>

<p>That will ultimately keep things as they are.  There are various ways to change things, one of which is the entirety of the 99% banding together and moving as one against the slavery that has been imposed upon us.  Now, <em>will</em> the 99% do that?  It seems a very tough undertaking to say the least.  However, this doesn&#39;t keep it from being a bonafide way to definitely change things that do <em>not</em> involve giving in to the status quo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everything is controlled by visible Government. Not to mention, It would never happen unless the entire 99% saw it with their own eyes. Currently Baby boomers are running the country. Most of these people watch the TV broadcasts and read the newspapers. Many aren&#39;t good with computers. They are the ones in power. But they are kept in control by the media. That 99% also has vastly different people in its demographics. Most of who side with these republican or democratic canidates. Lets take Ron Paul for example. He may not be the best for the job, However, his ideas are different than the majority of those running. He has been censored and cut out of many events. So the people who get their news from the TV and Newspapers or major media outlets are ignorant of his existence and ideals. This is called control. </p>

<p>The US whether you hate to admit it or not has a very tight grip on the psychology of its citizens. This population of people you speak of who will do drastic things to change this government is one of the most highly censored groups in America. They are only known as good by those familiar with the internet. Otherwise they do not exist to the main demographic. Now compared to other countries the citizens here actually live a solid controllable life. There is no war, no shortage of food or water. The main demographic will not do anything because of this one psychological detail.....EVERYONE HATES CHANGE. When things change people worry and stress out. because they are used to this life style.  This government has a democratic face, but the insides are not democratic anymore. YOu want change?  Like a virus you must penetrate a system and spread information from the inside out, so it forces to change and it can&#39;t use force to fight back. It can only sit there and the watch the old ideas collapse. If you want power, you must go with the flow, but not get lost within it. Illuminati are tough to get into, However the masons are well within our grasp to enter.  Many senators and presidents have been with the masons. They are brotherhood, and because of that they all work together to realize each others dreams. In short...The system you want to fight against, is more so a dummy system, a front, to hide the real system within. </p>

<p>Not everything is controlled by visible Government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heck, the <em>majority</em> of the world isn&#39;t controlled by a visible government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention, It would never happen unless the entire 99% saw it with their own eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be too entirely sure about that.  There are some individuals that are discerning and critical enough thinkers to understand where evidence <em>points</em> without actually having to be hit on the head with the obvious of what&#39;s actually happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently Baby boomers are running the country. Most of these people watch the TV broadcasts and read the newspapers. Many aren&#39;t good with computers. They are the ones in power. But they are kept in control by the media.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a good, although very discouraging, point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US whether you hate to admit it or not has a very tight grip on the psychology of its citizens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh absolutely.  Much as I may indeed hate to admit it, I do 100% acknowledge it, for it is absolutely true, unfortunately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This population of people you speak of who will do drastic things to change this government is one of the most highly censored groups in America.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And are also a younger generation - which doesn&#39;t help in terms of getting the Baby Boomers to understand what they&#39;re saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now compared to other countries the citizens here actually live a solid controllable life. There is no war, no shortage of food or water. The main demographic will not do anything because of this one psychological detail</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a great, truthful point, but I have a feeling that we here in the U.S. are moving very ominously toward a state of control and <em>lack</em> of freedom - even if the majority of the population is being brainwashed into not seeing that it&#39;s happening.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EVERYONE HATES CHANGE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would seem valid, but for those who understand that change is necessary in order to prevent an even worse state of existence, then change is welcomed and implemented.  I understand your point that many don&#39;t feel that we are on our way to &quot;a worse state of existence&quot; however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The system you want to fight against, is more so a dummy system, a front, to hide the real system within. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  Incorrect.  Don&#39;t make the mistake of assuming which system it is I want to fight against.  It is not limited to one.  It goes much deeper than the inner core of the Masons or the Illuminati even.  It includes them, but is in no way limited to them.</p>

<p>Without visible evidence of what exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It would take too long to accomplish this and the forces to be have too much at their disposal. Otherwise, even if this news were to come out, they can change the information or destroy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus far, the internet&#39;s archiving capabilities make it difficult to <em>not</em> leave a trail of your activities - whether civilian or military.  I think it would be difficult to erase EVERY bit of damning information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have learned that there is not much people can do to avoid this fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to be dense here, but what fate exactly?  Government/The Elite&#39;s corruption of facts, etc?  If that&#39;s what you mean, then although I DO think it&#39;s very difficult, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an impossible battle to fight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as technology came out, it was used against us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree, but we as a people also had a bit of technology that we could use ourselves.  It might not be much in comparison, but the 99% can still accomplish a lot by virtue of sheer numbers if it (we) just unite and band together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These forces have the latest and best at their disposal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  But they&#39;re only as strong as those in the 99% who WORK for them and do their bidding.  The moment those in the 99% find out that they too are just as much an enemy and a disposable pawn of the 1% as the rest, then they will more likely work <em>against</em> them.  At that point, it really doesn&#39;t matter how big the gun you have is if you don&#39;t have anyone to pull the trigger for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The events currently happening are the prerequisites to our fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The events currently happening are the prerequisites for <del>our fate</del> what they&#39;re trying to accomplish.  It doesn&#39;t HAVE to be our fate if we realize just how much power we have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humanity has to change it&#39;s ways and humanity itself must be destroyed in the process to make way for change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, now wait a minute.  Let&#39;s take this statement here bit by bit:  Humanity does indeed have to change its ways.  Yes.  Agreed.</p>

<p><em>&quot;and&quot;</em> humanity itself &quot;must&quot; be destroyed in the process to make way for change?</p>

<p>Please explain what you mean by this.  Yes.  I agree.  Humanity must indeed change its ways to make way for change.  This is true.  Much of that change will involve very uncomfortable things too, because people might have to give up certain things they&#39;ve grown used to that might actually be <em>worse</em> for them and/or the environment.</p>

<p>However, is this what you mean? or do you mean that &quot;ALL of Humanity must be destroyed to make way for change&quot;?  Again, please explain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You and millions of others want change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh . . . yes.  Okay.  And?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Evil must be done in order to accomplish change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Define evil.  That being said - and depending upon the level at which you mean it - I would say this statement is incorrect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Millions upon millions of People need to die</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No they don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They must starve, they must face extreme persecution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would disagree with this.  Why would you feel such a thing?  The word &quot;must&quot; implies that it &quot;has&quot; to be the case.  A lot of people might currently seem to <em>deserve</em> death because of the harm they cause others, but I wouldn&#39;t say they &quot;must&quot; die.  Again, explain yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>War must come. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it mustn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people of this earth need to face a sudden and harsh realization. That they themselves can be destroyed by themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh, I want to say that this realization is actually not all that big a deal actually considering that many humans already <em>have</em> this realization and already know this.</p>

<p>The Earth probably won&#39;t be that effected, but we humans can certainly kill each other off.  That much seems to be the case, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the only way for the people of this planet to learn from their mistakes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Na.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the <em>only</em> way.  See, this is the thing.  There is a cabal of rulers on this planet that <em>do</em> seem to be &quot;evil&quot; (for lack of a better term).  I am convinced that the human population in general would be a LOT more civilized and advanced if there weren&#39;t such a strong consortium on this planet manipulating everyone to be stupid, unthinking, aggressive, and ignorant.  If those rulers valued development, advancement, and growth, we as a people would be <em>much</em> better off than we currently are.</p>

<p>In other words, the shitty state that we are in isn&#39;t necessarily because we as a people are sloths and idiots, but because we are being controlled by a group that keeps a lot of information from us that would otherwise help us develop and advance further.  We can and SHOULD destroy this group, but that&#39;s another ball of wax altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peace and War are two things that must go hand in hand for people to survive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the physical, 3rd dimensional plane of existence as we currently know it, that would seem to be the case.  However, not only does there not need to be as MUCH war as there currently is, there is actually a state within which war as we know it can be entirely abolished.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There should always be as much evil as there is Good to keep balance in the world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The true essence of balance rises above both good <em>and</em> evil, so neither should actually be in the equation really.  All that being the case, my ultimate point is that on this planet there actually ISN&#39;T a balance of good and evil.  There is a LOT more evil than good here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Currently that balance is tipping and must be corrected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That balance has BEEN tipped for a <em>very</em> long time in one direction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Peaceful negotiations will not solve this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Peaceful negotiation doesn&#39;t <em>need</em> to.</p>

<p>Visible evidence of the entire system of corruption in the entire world. You need to unite the world, in order to take control of the forces that are purposely causing destruction, to stop what is already in motion</p>

<pre><code>&gt;It would take too long to accomplish this and the forces to be have too much at their disposal. Otherwise, even if this news were to come out, they can change the information or destroy it.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Thus far, the internet&#39;s archiving capabilities make it difficult to not leave a trail of your activities - whether civilian or military. I think it would be difficult to erase EVERY bit of damning information..&quot;</p>

<p>This could be true. However, The Illuminate Believe it or not do not use the internet for communication. They still relay on carriers and the mail system. Not to mention various small business to send out communications. Yes they use the internet. But not like you think. Plus these societies also use their own internet, much like the hackers that made Darknet. These people know how to cover tracks and the people who do find even the slightest hint are dealt with. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question of War, Death and Destruction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whether you agree or not, you cannot stop what is going to happen. People need war to be reminded of the Good on a global level. Negative and Positive forces must be in balance. </p>

<p>The Human race has Forsaken Nature itself, they have forgotten the roots in which they came, They treat the other living beings of this planet as trash, Using them as food, Trophies, and &#39;herbal&#39; medicines to the point of extinction. Man has been destroying the land and the trees all for amusement and profit.  Man should stand on equal ground with the rest of Nature. Civilization can still exist, animals can still be eaten in mass.  However. We have forsaken all respect from the dirt in which we came. For this, humanity needs to be restarted.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;This is the only way for the people of this planet to learn from their mistakes.
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;Na. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the only way. See, this is the thing. There is a cabal of rulers on this planet that do seem to be &quot;evil&quot; (for lack of a better term). I am convinced that the human population in general would be a LOT more civilized and advanced if there weren&#39;t such a strong consortium on this planet manipulating everyone to be stupid, unthinking, aggressive, and ignorant. If those rulers valued development, advancement, and growth, we as a people would be much better off than we currently are.&quot;</p>

<p>Money has corrupted us. It will continue to corrupt. Men and women with Integrity are rare in big country politics. They are usually bought out. There are other ways. If Humanity develops space colonization in the next 30 years, than we can take the strain off this earth and possibly revitalize it. But, Humanity would need to come together as a whole for a project of that scale. The percentages of this happening are slim. But possible.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;There should always be as much evil as there is Good to keep balance in the world
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;The true essence of balance rises above both good and evil, so neither should actually be in the equation really. All that being the case, my ultimate point is that on this planet there actually ISN&#39;T a balance of good and evil. There is a LOT more evil than good here.&quot;</p>

<p>Once again, I will correct the statement. Positive and Negative must be in balance. Negative is currently tipping over Positive forces. So the powers that are, are systematically bringing destruction to reset this world.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the &#39;bad&#39; must happen in order to restore balance on this earth. This balance goes far beyond human corporations or Ideals. This goes into the very fabric of this planet and the life force which feeds and keeps all of us alive. We are heavily damaging this sphere of life with our selfish desires for power. As of right now, Humans in major countries care more about making money than anything else. Because without that money they cannot live, nor do they have power. Money is a human ideal. One that destroys this scared ark. </p>

<p>As we stand. We will be destroyed. </p>

<p>After the sacrifice of a billion or more.  You will see sunrise in the middle of the night. Than be gone in an instant.</p>

<p>After months or years of nights like that. Humanity will have a second chance.</p>

<p>See the best part about this... Is that since we&#39;re in the conspiracy subreddit, I can talk to my hearts content about this and nobody else would believe me, and that fine with me. It&#39;s fun talking about things you&#39;d normally have to hold in. Even you or anyone else knowing this won&#39;t have an impact.</p>

<p>In closing,
There are some things, Humans are better off not knowing. Everyone should appreciate that saying &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;   </p>

<p>That much seems apparent.</p>

<p>The types of resources we use and in the way that we use them - yes.  Granted we don&#39;t need to consume on this planet the way we do, however.</p>

<p>It would seem that a better way of living could have been possible without having started in the manner that the &quot;leaders&quot; of the human world began.  A lie on top of a lie doesn&#39;t fix much of anything.  It only compiles lies.</p>

<p>&quot;Without visible evidence of what exactly?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Visible evidence of the entire system of corruption in the entire world.
I would say that the visible evidence is literally EVERYWHERE for those that are willing to look for it.  Unfortunately, most seem willing to remain asleep, but the evidence IS there.  Again, it&#39;s everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to unite the world, in order to take control of the forces that are purposely causing destruction, to stop what is already in motion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  You DO need to unite the world.  However, the manner in which the implementation of it is being attempted does not seem very intelligent or advanced.  Also, those forces that are presently causing its destruction are actually those forces that are attempting the &quot;uniting&quot; - and are doing it in a clandestine manner.  This is because the uniting is through undermining and nefarious means.  All this is to say that the intention is not a noble or honorable one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These people know how to cover tracks and the people who do find even the slightest hint are dealt with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems valid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether you agree or not, you cannot stop what is going to happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course not.  What <em>is</em> going to happen, however, is something that those who attempt to control and manipulate it may be not be as aware of as they might think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People need war to be reminded of the Good on a global level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  Some might, but many don&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Negative and Positive forces must be in balance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And war is not the only means available.  Heck, war is likely a means that brings about INbalance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Human race has Forsaken Nature itself, they have forgotten the roots in which they came</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They treat the other living beings of this planet as trash, Using them as food, Trophies, and &#39;herbal&#39; medicines to the point of extinction. Man has been destroying the land and the trees all for amusement and profit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cannot agree more with this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Man should stand on equal ground with the rest of Nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Civilization can still exist, animals can still be eaten in mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not happen to feel that the latter it necessary in the least.  Indeed, it is in part eating animals in mass and the mentality that partakes in that kind of activity that has gotten the human race in the mess it&#39;s in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However. We have forsaken all respect from the dirt in which we came. For this, humanity needs to be restarted.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would not entirely disagree with this either.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Money has corrupted us. It will continue to corrupt. Men and women with Integrity are rare in big country politics. They are usually bought out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  Absolutely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Humanity develops space colonization in the next 30 years, than we can take the strain off this earth and possibly revitalize it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Incorrect.  At the rate that we&#39;re going as a civilization, we will not be allowed off this planet.  Matter of fact, there is much, <em>much</em> evidence that suggests we have had the capability to go WAY off planet for quite some time, but have NOT been allowed off Earth.  We as a population are effectively on &quot;quarantine&quot; status by other races that know better.  We need to get our act right first, and <em>then</em> we might be allowed to go outside of this little plot of land called Earth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humanity would need to come together as a whole for a project of that scale. The percentages of this happening are slim. But possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Positive and Negative must be in balance. Negative is currently tipping over Positive forces. So the powers that are, are systematically bringing destruction to reset this world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those powers, then, are themselves entirely ignorant of the manner in which to reset that order.  They themselves are a manifestation of more evil than good, and will <em>not</em> in fact restore any type of balance if they attempt to implement things in that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the powers that are, are systematically bringing destruction to reset this world.
Otherwise, the &#39;bad&#39; must happen in order to restore balance on this earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s, in fact, what is ALREADY happening actually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are heavily damaging this sphere of life with our selfish desires for power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly.  Agreed.  However, those who are attempting to change the balance are doing so within the same paradigm of ignorance that is being responsible for the INbalance in the first place.  Therefore, the attempts will NOT accomplish the desired result.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As of right now, Humans in major countries care more about making money than anything else. Because without that money they cannot live, nor do they have power. Money is a human ideal. One that destroys this scared ark.

</blockquote>

<p>Fair enough.  As we stand, we will be destroyed.  However, we don&#39;t have to STAND this way.  Some are trying to stand differently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can talk to my hearts content about this and nobody else would believe me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t use the word &quot;nobody&quot; because you would be incorrect.  There seems to be truth in some of the things you say.  You seem misguided in other things.  Such seems the case with all human beings.  One should take in as much information as they can and work at sorting it all out as best as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even you or anyone else knowing this won&#39;t have an impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depending upon how one means it, everyone and everything has an impact . . . or no one and nothing does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In closing, There are some things, Humans are better off not knowing. Everyone should appreciate that saying &quot;Ignorance is bliss.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, ignorance is actually NOT bliss.  Knowledge is the path to liberation.  Ignorance keeps the slave bound.  Secondly, there is ultimately a point where one begins to realize that bliss is not necessarily the end to be striven for.  Bliss is a concept that exists within that same paradigm within which good AND evil exist.  You cannot have bliss without having evil, ignorance, and death also.</p>

<p>In order to do away with one, you must do away with the other.</p>

<p>I entirely and wholeheartedly disagree here.  You have to realize what it is you&#39;re actually saying here.  If the 99% truly stand up and become aware - if not only the civilians, but the armed forces realized just how heinous and manipulated is this entire ruse called &quot;western civilization&quot; - then who exactly is it in this &quot;US Government&quot; that would launch the weapons needed to &quot;bury&quot; the population?</p>

<p>Think about it.  One person can stop one ant.  One person can even stop 100 or even 1,000 ants.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU&amp;amp;feature=related">But million ants?  A billion?</a></p>
