       I'm thinking of turning End the Lie into a multi-user blog so people could create their own blogs and run them on my server. I was thinking we could come up with some kind of revenue sharing formula if we get network-wide sponsors or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I would in no way dictate what can and cannot be posted. I think it would be cool if everyone had their own subdomain so people could have myblog.endthelie.com or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone ever thought of something like this? Any opinions?

       Not sure of the details but newsvine seems to work something like this. I didn't check out the details but I happened to come across the site when a few submission from there were posted.  They seem to give ad revenue.

       is going to want to do and I think you should save the userbase for something better instead of potentially wasting them and invalidating their efforts on such a shitty site. Seriously, I would be incredibly disappointed if this idea ever took off for that reason.

       I would like this. Reddit will always be my number one until there is no more reddit. But I fear with the current climate of Internet legislation and the quickly dissolving freedom of speech that soon sites like reddit would become illegal. I'm always looking for the next spot to dethrone reddit as king, but right now this is one of the largest conspiracy discussion hubs out there. This is my place for now, but in the future that may change. When and if it does I will need somewhere to post my crazy thoughts.

       They have datacentres and currently host about 1% of europes hosting. They have the advantage of cheap electricity from the geothermal, cooling and in addition a 500million fibre optic cable is in the process of being constructed.  Yes I hear Norway is expensive.

       I think I'd be lying if I said it would be easy. From my limited knowledge at looking into it in the past it seems involved but a shit load of work has gone into the development over the years in orderi to have it work well, and so if you were looking for something with the potential to handle volume it would be a good choice.

       I think they have ready built packages which include everything. I've been renting a vps for a while now since i was frustrated with shared hosting and was meaning to see about playing around with setting up reddit for giggles.  If and when I get around to that, I'll let you know what is involved.  I know it uses a nosql database called cassandra , probably nginx and memcache

       You have to understand how easy it is for those with the money to simply buy your movement, infiltrate it, and entirely undermine it by posting disinformation shills in it and completely putrifying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't go the route you're going if you want to have an honest movement.

       While that sounds good - even noble - I'm discovering more and more, unfortunately, just how tricky, underhanded, and complicated are the schemes that moneyed infiltrators have with regard to undermining a movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if I were a corporate type and money was really no object to me, and your movement threatened my work, I could just as easily eventually buy one or more dissidents to infiltrate your movement and, in representing it with their bad actions, make your movement look pretty bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       That or, if I had
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       much money, there's really a chance that I'd have enough money to completely bypass you and simply buy your sponsors.  That way I'm undermining not just you, but the people that might even wish to
       <em>
        support
       </em>
       you.  This is the tactic that is often used with the news media - i.e. the news won't cover an important story because the companies that bankroll them are also beholden to a higher power that says "thou shalt not tell that story or support any organization that does."
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately what I'm trying to say is that whenever you get
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       tied up in money, you're eventually going to run into who the
       <em>
        source
       </em>
       of that money and funding is - and it's likely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       who you're directly dealing with/who's directly funding you.  They themselves are beholden to yet another, more powerful, boss, and
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       boss might not like what you stand for if you become too powerful.  If that happens, then they can just as easily pull the plug on the franchise that's sponsoring you and, by proxy, shut your organization down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This might sound a bit far-fetched, but it unfortunately happens regularly enough to be a real scenario.

       I think it's a great idea, particularly in an era of increasing censorship, both statist and corporatist censorship. Who knows what forum will be censored next.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also like the idea of making it pay. Uncensored free enterprise is a noble and courageous pursuit. Not only that, but truthers, conspiracy  theorists and alternative politics are easily marginalised by the mainstream because its difficult to compete with those who can earn lots of money by towing the corrupt, status-quo line.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you can find a way to make alternative media pay, it will help the cause (because people who otherwise write part time and often for free can hence dedicate more time to their activism) then more power to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find a way to put it together, I'm in.

       I like the direction you heading in but not the details. First off we need an evolution in information distribution not more of the same. Reddit is a democracy of information. We need a Republic of Information to process and distribute quality information to the masses. I would like to see EndTheLie become the front page to a republic (rule by law not force or mob) which operates with the openness and privacy of reddit. Elected or hired officials of the site (about 150 per topic) would act like congress where as everyone else that is subscribed would act like the house of representatives. House should be equal to Congress in being able to pass articles on to the president Ruppert where he will get final veto power over the article. This should lead to quality fact driven socially aware articles about the world around us. The next stage in information evolution!

       I've already been avidly avoiding all endthelie.com links (no matter how many you submit) regardless of your theoretical content, because of the early 90's formatting of your site, the annoying sidebar ads that you've sold and the fact that your pages bug the shit out of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why on earth do you think people would pay money for that antiquated bullshit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Sorry, that ended up sounding way too harsh, but my point stands, your pages annoy me rather than make me want to either read them or take them seriously. I think you have a public perception problem to work on before you consider monetizing or creating any kind of group forum. I have a hard time considering you in a more serious nature than beforeitsnews.com right now.

       Wouldn't this turn it into another beforeitsnews? It depends on what direction you want to go with the site because a lot of it's content is unsubstantiated at the moment and allowing anyone to post won't improve on that. Are you wanting to become a 'social hub' or something that can actually be linked as a legitimate source? Would it not be better to start this off as a side project?
