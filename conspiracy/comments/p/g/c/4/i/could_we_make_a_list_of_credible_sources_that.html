    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m most shocked at is that no corporate media outlets are asking questions about anyone that&#39;s being killed by the Assad regime (and they haven&#39;t necessarily proven that the Assad regime has authorized any attacks).</p>

<p>They assume that anyone killed by Syrian forces <strong>must</strong> have been an innocent civilian waiving the peace sign.  We don&#39;t know who these people are that are being killed, and we don&#39;t know who&#39;s killing them.  If anything, this seems to be a horrible yet necessary struggle that needs to run its course without foreign interference (for once).</p>

<p>Imagine what Americans would have said if the Chinese showed up to the US during the Civil War and told both sides that they needed to stop fighting so as to &quot;protect civilians&quot;.  I&#39;m pretty sure they would have told the Chinese to fuck off...</p>

<p>Why do you think the regime would do this?  It seems to me that a move like this would be more trouble than it&#39;s worth, as it essentially lets the corporate media write the story of what&#39;s happening over there with zero challenges to their narrative...</p>

<p>the media shows video from 2008 and claims it is from Syria, but qualifies the video as unconfirmed or unconfirmable.. well, it&#39;s been confirmed.  fake. </p>

<p>&quot;United States PSYOP units and soldiers of all branches of the military are prohibited by law from targeting U.S. citizens with PSYOP within the borders of the United States(Executive Order S-1233, DOD Directive S-3321.1, and National Security Decision Directive 130.) While United States Army PSYOP units may offer non-PSYOP support to domestic military missions, they can only target foreign audiences.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.dp-news.com/en/detail.aspx?articleid=111067">This article</a> seems to show the entire situation in a nutshell:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Syrian opposition rejects any talks with the regime</strong> and says they accept nothing less than President Bashar al-Assad&#39;s departure. </p>

<p>The U.N. estimates the government crackdown has killed more than 5,400 people since March, making Syria&#39;s conflict one of the deadliest of the Arab Spring. </p>

<p>Hundreds more are believed to have died since the U.N. released that figure in January, but the chaos in the country has made it impossible for the world body to update its figures. </p>

<p><strong>Human rights groups and activists say more than 7,000 people have been killed by Syrian security forces</strong> since the uprising began in March. </p>

<p>But <strong>the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says at least 2,000 members of the security forces have been killed fighting &quot;armed gangs and terrorists&quot;</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Syria has blocked access to trouble spots and prevented independent reporting</strong>, making it nearly impossible to verify accounts from either side as the conflict spirals out of control and turns increasingly violent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why has the opposition refused to hold talks with the Assad regime?  This &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach doesn&#39;t seem constructive.</p></li>
<li><p>Why would the regime prevent independent reporting?  </p></li>
<li><p>Is it even members of the regime that are preventing independent reporters from getting too close to the action?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This seems like a classic &quot;he said, she said&quot; dispute, I guess you&#39;d have to be there to fully grasp the situation...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve looked at every one of those videos now and I see no troops other than the two tanks driving down a street. Everything else is the aftermath of things that are claimed to be done by Syrian forces. From what I see, those things could have been caused by anybody. The &quot;this child was hit in the head&quot; video looks strangely familiar, just like one shown four years ago of a Palestinian child during Operation Cast Lead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;“It’s like building a place where you can put together a hospital room, a hotel lob­by, and an office space side by side and even shoot scenes sequentially,” he said. ABS-CBN is the first among the local TV networks to pioneer the construction of state-of-the- art soundstages as it was also the first to build state-of-the-art TV studios in the 90s. Aside from soundstages, Bulaong said ABS-CBN will also be constructing back-lots which are areas adjacent to a sound stage that will enable them to shoot exteri­or or outdoor scenes like streets in foreign countries, a slum area, or even a generic street in New York City with­out the need to travel to far flung places.</p>

<p>“With these facili­ties, you can easily do that. You just replicate the scenes,” he said. Bulaongsaidthecon­sumers stand to benefit from the plan. “ABS­CBN is producing a lot of TV shows aired on channel 2, Studio 23, cable TV channels like ANC, movies by Star Cinema,” he said. ABS-CBN programs are also aired in North America, Middle East, Europe, Australia and Asia Pacific including Japan via TFC.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) the camera is on a tripod??  who is filming?  the &#39;demonstrators&#39;?  where is the mass of protestors audible in this video? Video is consistent with security forces trying to protect civilians from sniper gangs and hunting down the killers.</p>

<p>2) same scene as 1)  you can more clearly see there is no mass protest and the audio does not match, it seems to have been added (compare with first video...did they reuse the chanting?)  I like the touch at the beginning where he has to show proof of date.. good forethought.  again the video shows them protecting civilians and the protest chants come from where???   I&#39;ll check out the rest, but so far it doesn&#39;t seem convincing.</p>

<p>from the uploader comment in the last video you mentioned &quot;Note: date and location may be incorrect as both are the responsibility of the 1st uploader&quot;</p>
