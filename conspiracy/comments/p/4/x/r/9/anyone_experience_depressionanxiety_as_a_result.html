        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am interested in whether any of you find that it is a burden to be aware of the elitist forces that reinforce inequality, war and economic hardship for the majority of the world&#39;s population? I have always been a skeptic and critical-thinker, and I take pride in asking life&#39;s difficult questions, but the fact that so many people are willingly ignorant is really weighing me down. I thought that as I got older this would begin to pass, but it seems to just grow.</p>

<p>I sincerely feel enlightened when I gain alternative perpspectives (backed up by facts), but these perspectives can often make me feel overwhelmed with cynicism and frustration. </p>

<p>I suppose my background is relevant as well...I completed my honours degree in Environment/Resource Studies and a post-grad in environmental engineering, and have been trying to find work in my field for over 6 months to no avail. In fact, I can&#39;t even land a crappy &#39;survival job&#39; at a coffee shop or factory because I am &#39;over-qualified&#39;. This has increasingly made me feel trapped, especially with a debt load in excess of 45k that I watch increase every month, and I can&#39;t do a damn thing about it. This also ties in whith the fucked up nature of our society that has commodified post-secondary education, and is just another reminder of the state of the world we live in.</p>

<p>The best way to describe the way I feel is depressed, and this depression reinforces my anxiety when I interact with people and hear the dumbfoundingly ignorant shit that people parrot off without shaping their own worldview. I mean, the other day some dude&#39;s argument was &quot;there&#39;s no such thing as a free lunch&quot;, and I&#39;m just thinking, where the fuck does that explanation fit into the complex nature of our world? But it&#39;s an easy point of view to have, and I found myself slightly jealous of his blind, comfortably numb stance because he didn&#39;t feel the frustration I feel. I am ready to quit browsing this subreddit, as well as worldnews and politics, but I can&#39;t help but feel that I would lose a part of me that I have for so long felt very strongly about, and formed an identity around.</p>

<p>Have you guys ever felt this way for an extended (years) period of time? How does it get better, and where should I go from here?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marijuana really helps me cope with my anxieties, as it simply helps me to keep too many simultaneous thoughts out of my head, and focus on what I want. When I first became aware of the breadth and depth of government corruption I became obsessed with discerning truth from fiction. I spent as much as 14 hours a day reading about it, I was just dumbstruck with the things I was reading, and it sort of took over my life.</p>

<p>Here we are about 1 year later and I mostly play Battlefield 3 because I&#39;m laid off, and waiting for work. I may spend an hour or 2 a day researching and discussing conspiracy theories these days, and it doesn&#39;t always occupy my thoughts anymore. I&#39;ve just learned to live with the knowledge (beliefs) I have, and to hope for the best. I feel as though it&#39;s my duty to spread awareness, but to not become engrossed in it. I often feel as though I&#39;m just along for the ride, and there isn&#39;t much I can do accept prepare, and convince others to do the same.</p>

<p>We certainly can&#39;t save everyone, but we might be able to save ourselves and the ones we love. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m totally convinced that some sort of apocalyptic event is going to happen, but I am saying it <em>might</em>. </p>

<p>EDIT: I just want to add that marijuana is only good as an anti-anxiety solution in very small doses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been smoking pot daily for almost 5 years, and it used to be an effective release.  I strongly believe, however, that entheogens like mushrooms can be applied to break through the debilitating anxiety/depression far more effectively than chronic use of anything.  Ultimately drugs mean different things to different people, and unfortunately weed no longer means to me what it used to.  </p>

<p>If you smoke on a daily basis, I dare you to quit for a week, let alone a month.  It&#39;s funny you mentioned pot, because I am currently experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms (sweating, chills, no appetite, insomnia, terrifyingly vivid dreams) that I thought only coke-heads and heroin junkies witness (check out <a href="/r/leaves">/r/leaves</a>, pot is way stronger than it used to be!).  Moderation is key of course, but when you feel the way I do on a daily basis, you have no capacity to moderate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Living in Holland here, been really smoking a lot less since I&#39;ve got here. I hear you on the general malaise thing, but if you want to do something about it, the power is on your hands. The trick is, for me, is to realise that these issues are your responsibility &amp; yours only, so it&#39;s up to you, and no one else, to deal with them.</p>

<p>What works for me - yoga, running, chopping wood, baking cakes and as all that doesn&#39;t completely sort me out; St John&#39;s Wort. Seriously, that stuff is incredible, you can get a years supply for 20euro (1kg of powder), it doesn&#39;t take anything away from you like the SSRIs, but it feeds your energy, your light. It&#39;s a beautiful little herb which just loves holding your hand. It doesn&#39;t mix badly with lots of other drugs, medicinal &amp; recreational, so do your research, but it <em>really</em> helps me.</p>

<p>We&#39;re heading for a preiod of transititon, we need to be strong, level headed &amp; with as few needs/addictions as possible. Think about CBT (Cognative Behavioural Therapy), that one can really work in re-wiring your brain, and if you do it yourself, you do it on your terms. It&#39;s a great thing about CBT, you can totally do it on your own!</p>

<p>Other than than, buy some silver &amp; gold, waking up in the morning to that nice little adrenaline hit associated with being right ;)</p>

<p>Good luck brother/sister, I&#39;m sending you a load of love from a good place.</p>

<p>A little quote which I&#39;m trying to internalise at the moment, &quot;If anyone can take your peace, you happiness, your love away from you, you are the loser. If anyone can make you angry, you are the loser.&quot; Bikram If you can get that one down, you win!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to be compassionate with you about your depression issues, but I also want to be realistic.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got the same education debt issues as you ($57k last time I heard from them, I think -- and going on 12 years of varying states of un/under-employment). The psychology of depression is amplified during an ongoing state of economic depression (I can&#39;t tell you how insulted I am every time they call it an &quot;economic downturn&quot; - all of the stock markets have crashed and the only &#39;recovery&#39; has been for the corporations via bailouts... which amplifies the depression for the common citizenry, because they&#39;re forced to carry the burden).</p>

<p>So, yeah... I get where you&#39;re coming from. I can relate... all too intimately... with the sense of futility. I wake up to it every morning: I&#39;m one of the many who have been cast aside as having no value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does it get better,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m still waiting to find out. And, while I don&#39;t want to impose a curse of suffering upon you, I hope you&#39;ll wait with me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and where should I go from here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you find a place better than here, please come back and let me know where it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is depressing to learn that we are living in a system where elites have an unfair advantage and are skimming off the rest of us.  I began to understand this when I went on a reading and documentary viewing rampage to make up for a lack of material to study after finishing college about 8 years ago.  Here is my advice:</p>

<p>Eat properly, eat FRESH fruits and vegetables daily.  If you don&#39;t like eating them, get a juicer.  It sounds like an infomercial, but it has really benefited me.  Most (Americans at least) have a horrible diet.  This has a direct effect on your mental and physical well-being.  As you get older you will notice that inputs affect your body more directly and obviously.  </p>

<p>Exercise as much as possible, especially if you begin feeling funky.  </p>

<p>Regain your sense of humor.  Learn to find some level humor in the preposterousness of events an cover stories, or the inconsistency in logic and justification for events.</p>

<p>Grow some of your own food (as much as you can) and do other DIY projects, you can also use this as a cost cutting entertainment method if you live in an area where you can have projects like this.  It&#39;s healthier and better for your wallet than shopping for imported products.  If you don&#39;t live in an area like this, maybe that is also part of your issue.</p>

<p>Maybe you are in a bad job market.  Look at Google&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_#ctype=l&amp;amp;strail=false&amp;amp;bcs=d&amp;amp;nselm=h&amp;amp;rdim=state&amp;amp;ifdim=state&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;dl=en">public data</a> on unemployment.  Move to (or job hunt in) a job market with a lower unemployment rate. </p>

<p>Read any economics article on inflation you see, until you understand the issues.  You can see inflation at the pump and at the supermarket.  When your dollar buys less, inflation is happening.  Despite this, the fed has announced they will be keeping rates fixed at least through 2012.</p>

<p>Prepare yourself, our monetary system is also a depressing issue to learn about (if you haven&#39;t already).  IMO, understanding the business cycle is the largest way to protect yourself.  It is the difference between purchasing a property at the bottom of the market to realize the rise, or purchasing near the peak to experience the dump.  Easy rules, don&#39;t use credit, don&#39;t buy what you don&#39;t need.  You don&#39;t have to participate in the consumption culture very much at all, if you don&#39;t want to.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to keep reading conspiracy news.  Once you understand that it is a scam, whatever happens on a day to day basis is essentially irrelevant.</p>

<p>We live in a corrupt, scam; that is life in the world at this time.  You can still create a very happy and comfortable life for yourself and your family.  I am nearly positive it beats the dark ages (and many other chaotic and violent ages).  If the tide begins to turn you can participate in that.  Until that time, get your own life in order.</p>

<p>If you plan to purchase property or have material possessions, you should get an understanding of the business cycle and then check in on the economic news at least every other week.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What really irks me is the way people label me as depressed and too anxious when I discuss anything deeper than the latest episode of Jersey Whore.  Even deep-thinkers like my fiance&#39;s parents get turned off by &#39;conspiracy&#39; discussions and start pointing out that I should be living in the moment and not worrying about the future. I want to slap them in the face but I also question whether they know what I am saying and just DGAF or if they really don&#39;t understand. So yes, it is quite frustrating and often times feels pointless to know this stuff. Regarding employment, I would tell things are gonna get better, but I think we both know that is BS. So, in the meantime keep reading, keep informing yourself so that YOU are prepared for the coming events.</p>

<p>I clicked on this link because it describes how I feel, some of the time.  Knowing that I &quot;know&quot; more than most people makes me at times depressed, like the original poster, but I fluctuate between that depressed feeling with minutes or hours or days of outrage, fury, calm, peace, confusion, shock, awe, bliss, hatred..</p>

<p>It&#39;s like a rollercoaster.  I just hate that I&#39;m sometimes hopeful and sometimes depressed (and everything in between and at each spectrum) that I&#39;m riding on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that feel bro. I haven&#39;t experienced it for very long, but sometimes I have a hard time just thinking so much and I have a sense of responsibility for some reason to be a part of the resolution or solution to the problem. I don&#39;t know what to do other than try to make others &quot;aware&quot;, or just to tell them to start thinking for themselves and start looking outside the mainstream. </p>

<p>Just last night I asked my fiancee if she has any favorite musical artists that have never made a top 40, and she couldn&#39;t think of one. I&#39;m trying to figure out a way to get through to people and I think when I asked her that, she actually thought for a minute about why she couldn&#39;t name one. </p>

<p>As far as advice, I don&#39;t think I can really help there, but I feel for you for sure. Good luck man, it&#39;s nice to hear when people actually do use their brains. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am fortunate that my wife and I have always been employed. She&#39;s a nurse and I own a commercial print business. We are in our 40s and live in Canada.</p>

<p>Although we are both fairly well established, professionally, we have two teen-aged children. We both want our kids to stay in school and acquire as much education as possible. My wife is more prone to think education is an implied guarantee of success in life; however, I am not so sure of this societal assumption.  </p>

<p>I worry about the massive debts building up in countries throughout the world. I worry about the eroding rights of citizens. I worry about the American economy circling the bowl. I want to leave this world better than I found it and I am afraid this will not happen.</p>

<p>As a parent, I&#39;m supposed to know what to tell my kids. I often have no idea where we are all heading. Sometimes the world is a dark and fucked up place. Keep putting one foot in front of the other. I wish you luck in landing work that challenges and rewards you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have an opening in Halifax that I cannot fill, but that&#39;s another issue.  </p>

<p>I am unsure of your personal situation; however, I know there is a big demand for managers &amp; workers in the North. There was a head hunter in Atlantica recently looking for retail store managers for various cities. These retail &quot;hot spots&quot; sell everything the local community needs ... food, alcohol, clothing, electronics, tobacco, RX drugs, etc. This is not what you are trained to do - but $100K/ year + is worthy of consideration. I hear the hours are long; however, the money is huge and they fly you home every few weeks for a break w/ family. </p>

<p>This is not for guys w/ kids (or a SO); however, it will help you to tackle that mounting debt load. My brother in law declared bankruptcy with a huge student debt load and it has been a huge cloud of bad karma hanging over his head for years. He compares the arm&#39;s length relationship with these counselors to being on parole from prison.   </p>

<p>Have you been in touch with a head hunter? It is such an inefficient waste of industry to have Canada&#39;s educated youth sitting idle. Keep on keeping on ...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, I really like the reality tunnel concept you describe, and it reminds me of how enthralled I was with hunter s. Thompson&#39;s style, which made me bellow in laughter at the absurdity of our social organization.  I think of the scene where there&#39;s a national police convention, and as he trips on who knows what, they turn into swine at the trough.</p>

<p>Best advice thus far.  </p>

<p>Can I ask, where would you suggest I look into meeting free-minded, critical thinking people. Is there a bank somewhere hoarding them or something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first off, I love hunter s Thompson and completely agree. I too, often find myself depressed about the current situation. Even my gf who I admire for her intelligence would rather fb than read intellectual material (I encourage her to do so, but she would rather I told her instead of her doing her bit of research). Tbh I was in a dark place until recently. I constantly smoked weed and partied and it felt good to fit in with the people who didn&#39;t know, care, or care to know. I am without a doubt labeled a conspiracy theorist amongst the people I know with a small handful of people I would consider awake. Things didn&#39;t really start getting better until I recently got my new job. It&#39;s not so much finally having work, although that is a plus. Rather it is the work I do. I fundraise for a child centered community development organization which does great things around the world. It&#39;s entirely rewarding to be affecting positive change. It really is up to you to decide if things get better. I haven&#39;t found many open minded critical thinking people, but the ones I have found have been through spreading what I know. Best of luck to you, my friend. edit: sp</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does get a little better.</p>

<p>Mostly due to normal adaptation to a new psychological environment. Unfortunately, you&#39;re likely to be an outsider for the rest of your life. It&#39;s not so bad, though. Find the others. If you&#39;re around people who are sympathetic you&#39;re likely to have an easier tome psychologically. This does not merely mean finding people who agree with you. Find people who are good people and surround yourself with them. You still don&#39;t know shit. Remember that. If you think you know what&#39;s up you&#39;re already mentally dead. Learn as much as you can about everything you can. Find other people who like to learn (look into Robert Anton Wilson, by the way). Really, though - surround yourself with good people.</p>

<p>As per doing something with the knowledge you do have:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m awake 8 years this May, I sometimes regret taking the red pill. Then I realize, I would have just been ashleep (sheep &amp; asleep, corny I know LOL). </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t really <em>regret</em> it, I just wish the world I was in <em>9 years ago</em> was the <em>real</em> reality.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Hell. Literally. We are <em>literally</em> in Hell. What are we &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; experiencing on a daily basis? Torment? Frustration? Depression? Hopelessness? Feels like your soul, your actual essence, is being tortured non-stop?</p>

<p>This experience is the <em>definition</em> of Hell. </p>

<p>Being a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; at this great time, is probably the single worst experience your soul will <em>ever</em> have to endure in the infinite number of lives you&#39;ll have.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s worth it. Because we can say we were awake years before everyone else. We had a unique view of History, we watched the Human Race, this great, tragic species, become One, right in front of our awaiting eyes. We watched it unfold!!</p>

<p>And when it came, it was like a sunrise after a long, cold, dark night.</p>

<p>8 years. 8 Long, long years. Coldest years of my life. And now I&#39;m starting to see the sun rise above the horizon. They are marching as one!! They have seen the light!! Marching as the 99%, in <em>thousands</em> of city&#39;s across the world!! </p>

<p>It can&#39;t be the light. I must be dreaming. Or I must be dead. No! Because I&#39;ve been dead for eight years. The Light!! The Light!! That <em>is</em> light. That <em>is Light!!</em> Then it&#39;s finally <em>over</em>. It&#39;s over!! The Light!! THEY HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT!! THEY HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT!! THEY HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel for you - I&#39;m kinda there too.  For me it&#39;s almost been like going through phases of learning you are going to die.  At first I was in denial, then I was angry, then I was majorly depressed, and now I&#39;m in kind of an acceptance mode - and I&#39;m doing whatever I can, at a basic and localized level to prepare for whatever I can prepare for.  I think my deep Christian faith helps me a lot too, to be honest.  Gives me hope that everything is working as planned even if it seems to be unraveling.  It does feel odd though to be making plans for the future on one hand, and believing there isn&#39;t much of a future in store for us on the other - but I don&#39;t know any other way to face life.  You got to keep on keeping on, and hope for the best while planning for the worst I guess.  Sometimes I wish I had never read what I&#39;ve read, or seen what I&#39;ve seen - because life would be blissfully ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, sorry to hear about your troubles I come offering advice based on similar experience I had, coincidentally enough involving similar circumstances to yours.
I wont get in to any of the details of the mechanics of depression because frankly there&#39;s another million people that can tell you them far better than I could.
But, when I was experiencing my battle I found this was all people had to offer, that and vague philosophical rambling.
Practical advice was very seldom given to me so I will share with you the few snippets that really did help over the four years that I dealt with these feelings.</p>

<p>Diet and exercise, I know they&#39;re fucking obvious but please don&#39;t just pass them aside. Personally staying in shape and striving to be healthy has become my biggest motivator. </p>

<p>Take ten minutes out of your day and just say &#39;fuck it all&#39; put on a song and convince yourself for a brief moment that it is the only single thing in the entire fucking universe that matters right now, become blissfully ignorant, lie to yourself and chose to believe it. You&#39;ll be able to come back to reality feeling more focussed and recharged, something about living in the moment.</p>

<p>And lastly, I Don&#39;t really have a final point...something about reality being a construction of our own imaginations where death is freedom but life is for living so enjoy the moment?</p>

<p>I hope that somewhere in this rambling you find something that helps, perhaps you learnt a new word along the way ( I doubt it, my vocabulary isn&#39;t that great )
But if you have any questions or just want to talk to someone don&#39;t hesitate to message me.</p>

Along with frustration, anger, and any number of emotional responses. The old saying &quot;curiosity killed the cat&quot; works here. Everyone who is reading this, at some point in the last few months or weeks or perhaps years, decided that they didn&#39;t accept everything they had been told, so they went out an looked for answers. We all got our answers, for the most part anyways. But now we know what we didnt before, so that puts even more stress and worry on an already likely overcooked or burdened existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seek out like-minded individuals and build/make something meaningful with them. Loneliness is always a major factor to depression. Your current company is making you ill because you can&#39;t share anything meaningful with them. Cults, psych-workers, idiots, and gurus will likely be a waste of time and resources, but being able to engage in meaningful dialogue with another breathing, living human being will go a long way toward easing your pain because it will give you an immediate bit of purpose to know that you sincerely matter to someone and vice versa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pursue a hobby you&#39;re passionate about and you&#39;ll run into someone who has a similar passion. Make sure it&#39;s something creative and challenging though, not a movie or trivia club. Those things are too passive and trivial to be meaningful. For example, learn to carve small ornaments from someone more patient, skillful, and wise and you&#39;ll begin to develop meaningful connections that reward with something in return for the time commitment. Avoid wasteful individuals like the fucking plague! They&#39;re usually vacant, pointless little vampires and no matter how much time you spend with them, you get virtually nothing in return but emptiness and loneliness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are speaking my language. I too feel depressed, frustrated and overwelmed as i watch everything crumble and everyone cheering the madness on instead of trying to stop it. Everytime I try to talk to anyone about it, they just dismiss me as if I&#39;m the crazy one. They have sooo much blind faith in our government and don&#39;t even bother to question why the government does what it does. It makes me angry. I just want to slap them, shake them, anything to wake them up! It&#39;s so sad. I often feel anxious about what&#39;s going to happen after the elections are over. What&#39;s going to happen before the elections are even done. I wish so bad i could be blind again, happy burying my head in the sand as everyone else seems to do, but it&#39;s just too much to ignore. I feel as though we are all standing on a cliff and any moment now we are going to get a violent push off into a world much like 1984. I&#39;m anxious for my kids who will have to grow up in that kind of world. It makes my heart ache for them. I want to scream and cry. But despite all of that I do still have some mild hope that if Ron Paul, and people just like him can get into office then maybe, just maybe we can stem the tide. Anyway, thanks for sharing and putting a voice to what I&#39;m going through. :)</p>

<p>It can be read as metaphor for the law of conservation of energy. You can&#39;t walk five feet away from your monitor right now without expending any work, otherwise you&#39;d have perpetual motion machines.</p>

<p>In economics, taking the spirit of the phrase literally would mean that, should one be given a &quot;free&quot; lunch, it isn&#39;t really free since it cost somebody labor to make that lunch, even though you didn&#39;t have to pay for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>first off, I love hunter s Thompson and completely agree. I too, often find myself depressed about the current situation. Even my gf who I admire for her intelligence would rather fb than read intellectual material (I encourage her to do so, but she would rather I told her instead of her doing her bit of research). Tbh I was in a dark place until recently. I constantly smoked weed and partied and it felt good to fit in with the people who didn&#39;t know, care, or care to know. I am without a doubt labeled a conspiracy theorist amongst the people I know with a small handful of people I would consider awake. Things didn&#39;t really start getting better until I recently got my new job. It&#39;s not so much finally having work, although that is a plus. Rather it is the work I do. I fundraise for a child centered community development organization which does great things around the world. It&#39;s entirely rewarding to be affecting positive change. It really is up to you to decide if things get better. I haven&#39;t found many open minded critical thinking people, but the ones I have found have been through spreading what I know. Best of luck to you, my friend. edit: sp</p>
