       It sucks, every time I see a story from this board on my front page I think "Oh it's from the conspiracy board, it's probably not true..."
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again, believing there aren't any conspiracies out there is pretty naive. We live in a time of great power held by the few. Of course they're going to discuss things over drinks in their huge houses with droves of guards protecting them from being heard. And they have the resources to carry their plans out.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be this mentality to just, seemingly make things up, or puzzle things together. The belief that you figured something out, just because it seems to make sense to you and your like minded friends...
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know. I just wish there was a little more credibility. As it is now, it just seems like a lot of speculation and "what if" scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's hard, the nature of this stuff makes evidence hard or impossible to get. The guys pulling the strings make damn sure that none of the evidence gets out, they plan very carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh well, just my two cents. Keep up the good work guys.

       Don't you realize you've been programmed through Hollywood and the media to automatically put conspiracy theorist in the "tin foil hat crowd"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at how conspiracy theorists are portrayed in movies...
      </p>
      <p>
       There's just no good reason to ever believe the governments official version of anything. They have too many shady interests.

       America is a fascist Oligarchy run by corporations and elites. Obama is a intellectual, you don't honestly think he'd continue the war on marijuana if it were simply up to him do you? I'm just using this because it's a good example of the power the man DOES NOT HAVE. If it were up to him he'd legalize medical marijuana yesterday. He's nothing more than a frontman, a figurehead, a politician.

       That's not true at all. I don't watch those sort of movies as they're usually really badly written.

      <p>
       I'm a skeptic. If you propose something, I want to be given reasons to believe it. Many times those reasons just aren't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe the government is corrupt, and now they aren't even hiding it. The evidence supports the claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I hate the "News Media". The only show I watch for news is Countdown, and even then, I have my own opinions on everything. I don't blindly follow or take peoples words for things, though I do delegate to trustworthy experts. There's no way to research everything yourself.

       If you watch any television at all, attended public schools, etc, you're a victim of social engineering. We are all products of our environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't think that much of what this subredit talks about, is all that far fetched. Sure, occasionally people may talk about a secrete race of aliens disguised as humans, or something equally ridiculous, but most of what we deal in is actually quite logical. Conspiracy theories can be looked at very easily when it's apparent who's benefiting the most, and exactly how they're benefiting: usually money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take Afghanistan and 9/11 for example: American companies have owned literally trillions of dollars worth oil and natural gas in the Caspian region of the Middle East for decades. We negotiated with the Taliban as far back as the early 80's to establish an oil pipeline running through their country. These negotiations went on into the 90's with the defeat of the Soviets. At one point it was virtually set in stone that we'd run a pipeline through Afghanistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       American companies built a training school there in order to train the locals how to build pipelines, a large one at that, costing millions, and capable of training hundreds of people at once. But for some reason we'll probably never know, negotiations fell through with the Taliban. It may have something to do with opium production, as they eradicated most crops. Anyways, thats besides the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is negotiations fell through with the Taliban for the pipeline, and then 9/11 happened. If America can't successfully negotiate with another nation, than they'll find another way to get what they want. Unfortunately for the American people it was a false-flag event to justify the Afghan invasion. Take a look at Google Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at Afghanistan and it's northern neighbors. The 7 Sisters of big oil own roughly $14 trillion dollars worth of oil and natural gas in all of those old USSR satellite countries. Getting those resources out of those countries has been a logistical nightmare for these companies for over 30 years. 9/11 made it all possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're talking trillions of dollars you're talking god money. That's the type of money the government is willing to kill anyone or any amount of people over. Why are we so foolish as to not see the lengths the government is willing to go to?

       any news program on tv is designed to program the audience. whether its the obvious advertising or the more hidden social engineering, tv is a tool to control the masses. some conspiracy theories are difficult to accept because cognitive dissonance forces you to reject it. if the evidence is rational, then you should not disregard the theory. science and all other investigative endeavors work in a similar fashion.

       It's wrong to excuse Obama because he's "only a politician." Obama could tell the truth to the American people. He could speak his true beliefs, if he wanted to. He doesn't do it because it would cause complications and draw criticism, and he is content to just slide along on his naturally oily nature. Just as Clinton was content to just slide along. Clinton and Obama are two peas from the same pod. Neither had any real moral center. They did what was in their own career interests.

       They were/are certainly just playing the part. It's definitely for nothing more than personal gain. I'm just saying Obama knows prohibition doesn't work, and that if he had the power most people imagine he has, he'd decriminalize drugs.

       We have a bad reputation because we tell the truths that no one wants to believe. Our bad reputation is given us by the powers that be so people will have the exact reaction you do: oh, it's on r/conspiracy, it's probably not true. Meanwhile the people in power are robbing us blind, dumbing us down, poisoning our air, food and water, destroying families, society, education and medicine.

       This seems really judgmental.  There are nutters in every community, the only difference here is they feel more comfortable being themselves.  You never know where a good idea is going to come from.  I think William Cooper said it best, "Read everything, listen to everybody, don't trust anything unless you can prove it with your own research."

       I'm just telling you how it came across.  That may not have been your intention but that's how it came across to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've been trained to disregard conspiracy.  We've been trained to find research and reading boring, unless it's the new pulp novel pumped out by some big name author.  There is literally no way we could have a better reputation, it's the nature of the beast.  Even if you could get rid of all the really "out there" conspiracies (Of course the term "out there" varies from person to person)  you would still have a majority of people that discredit the information off hand.  Simply because it challenges their view on the topic.

       I was thinking about this the other day. I think people think conspiracy theorists are crazy is just because we like to throw out new ideas, with or without evidence. No matter how insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's just toying with new ideas a lot of times. Like worst case scenario analyisers or something. If you notice how many conspiracy titles are a question, like What if Aliens like white bread only? That kinda of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there are proven known conspiracies throughout history, but a conspiracy theorist that reads about that stuff learns about those pretty quickly. So, it would just get boring to talk about those over and over. But we will if you ask.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't know if there's a subreddit, or website or something where only proven conspiracies could be posted. But even if, most people would still find this one more interesting probably.

       I feel like the second we get even half was organized and identify the threats, they'll just hit the doomsday button and kill us all rather than let us win. So many lose/lose situations for us.

       Why not just go after the clear and present threats. Get rid of the propaganda first. That is constructive. That's accomplishing something.

       I think the whole concept of a conspiracy makes it kinda hard. If you're working under the idea that the system is keeping the truth from you, it's kinda hard for everyone to agree on what the clear and present threats really are I guess.
      </p>

       I do wish we would hold ourselves to more accountable standards sometimes. So many people use it as just a form of entertainment I think. But I don't know if that'll ever happen.

       Fundamentally, conspiracy theories encourage you to use critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a misconception that conspiracy theories are just speculative conclusions hastily drawn from loosely assembled puzzle pieces. The reality is that most of the 'conspiracy' material has to do with actual evidence - real-world facts that you can verify. The conclusions you draw from those facts are up to you. You have to do your own research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because the material that is presented is very non-mainstream so it always challenges my accepted worldview. I always want to be challenged and I can never accept having a stable, immutable belief system. I realize that it takes time though, and maybe that's why people hate conspiracy theories - they don't want to spend the time thinking for themselves.

       I view conspiracy under one of two possible types. The first type involves money or power at it's core. JFK, 9/11, endless war, false flag events. The second type involves wacky stuff. Nazi Reptilians, aliens, UFOs, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first type occur daily all over the world. Much of this type of shenanigans gets well documented on this forum . The second type does little more than contaminate the well of credibility. Any beings with technology to manage time &amp; space would plunder and massacre our species for whatever resources are on our planet without resorting to anally probing toothless West Virginians.
