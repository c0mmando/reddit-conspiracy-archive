       Among his claims:
      </p>
      <p>
       Witness to a UFO over fort Knox, which precipitated him being recruited into a group that did manual labor and mechanical work underground
      </p>
      <p>
       Witness to
       <a href="http://www.rense.com/ufo/boringmachine.htm">
        high tech drilling machines
       </a>
       able to bore through solid rock at incredible pace
      </p>
      <p>
       Witness to triangular and disc shaped craft used to transport cargo to and from the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       Claims he was transferred to Germany before being discharged because he asked too many questions.  He says that many (but not all) in his platoon who were not recruited after the UFO incident denied it ever happened, even though he know they saw it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, this wouldn't be the first UFO incident near fort Knox...see:
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantell_UFO_incident">

      <p>
       I plan on doing a full interview with him, he is truly concerned that his life would be in danger if his identity was revealed.

       sounds a lot like what a lot of people have reported. its a good thing this persons uncle isnt dead, because sadly thats what happens to a lot of inquisitive military personnel. beyond treason is a documentary that explains what happens to those who ask too many of the right questions. its just too bad them and their families are all sick and dying from the depleted uranium they came in contact with which, by the way, none of whom are receiving health care, since for some reason, doctors cant "prove" that theres anything wrong with them.

       True.  I was overdosed on dexedrine when I was younger and couldn't sleep for 3 days thinking that I was Jesus.  I read really fast, a book a day.  The Dr. ended up realizing that checking my levels might help.  What an idiot.  Most Doctors are just testing out meds like we are some sort of lab rat.

"oh, weve only met a couple of times, youre suffering from a little bit of sadness, let me give you this pill that supposed to make you happy but really chemically alters your brain. that way, once youve taken it for so long, you dont know whats reality anymore, so you end up shooting your children then writing your suicide letter and shooting yourself."

       my uncle sounds like he has schizotypal personality disorder because of some extraordinary claims I transcripted to Reddit?  You'll make a great doctor.  Are most schizotypal patients able to disassemble and reassemble a car engine?

       Here are the "symptoms" of schizotypal, for those interested.  sounds like anyone who isn't a drone and is open to reality could be diagnosed with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference) 
Odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is inconsistent with subcultural norms (e.g. superstition, belief in clairvoyance, telepathy, "sixth sense", or bizarre fantasies or preoccupations) 
Unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions Odd thinking and speech (e.g. vague, circumstantial, metaphorical, or stereotyped speaking) 
Suspiciousness or paranoid ideation Inappropriate or constricted affect Behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric or peculiar Lack of close friends or confidants other than first degree relatives
 Excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and tends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative judgments about self.

       I'm working on it.  I plan to do either an audio or video interview.  He told me an incredible amount of information that I have heard from other sources that he could have never known that I would have known...he has been the black sheep in our family for years and sadly I now have a better understanding of why his family...my family...has treated him they way they have.  He sounds crazy!  But he really isn't.

       I haven't gone down that list with him, but he has mentioned a fair few off the top of my head.  He didn't give a damn if I believed him that he witnessed a UFO...So I don't think he would doubt others.

       lol are you serious? That guy's "downvote invasion" was completely natural, it happened as a result of him pitching himself as an expert when he wasn't, then giving insubstantial, sometimes totally incoherent answers to questions.

       He was effectively censored.  I don't particularly care
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       , the fact remains that he was invited to do an AMA, comes here, tries to answer questions and engage with those who are interested, and a minority silenced him disrupting the AMA and censoring him.  That's not right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, in this specific case, the "invasion" I refer to was one organized by some of the religious subreddits.  They even tried to have the AMA cancelled prior to it happening.

       man you've got to be kidding. Go read that thread again! The guy came in with his claims of knowledge sounding like a fool and even still reddit respected him and played nice. The crowd should've been rough and it should've been an upward battle to be taken seriously right from the start, but instead people were asking normal questions interested to hear what answers he would bring to the table. So the guy then proceeds to copy and paste the same nonsense reply to like 30 posts in a row. Seriously this paste job didn't even make sense by itself, and it wasn't relevant at all to pretty much any post it responded to, but there it was 30 times. The guy asked for his downvotes, it had nothing to do with any minority. Even after this happened he started answering questions more normally, people were finding his responses in the the thread and following along, but even still his answers were all inadequate and all he did was claim a bunch of knowledge while not making any sense. I was there, were you there? This is what happened!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT, also
       <a href="/r/Christianity">
        /r/Christianity
       </a>
       didn't try to get the IAMA cancelled. I investigated that too, did you? What they did was simply object to the claims that this author was an academic or had credentials, because he didn't, but the mods for some reason allowed him to pass as though he did. For real, go look that up too, you're way off, they even specified really clearly the whole time that they weren't trying to silence anything, it's plain as day if you read it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2 one of the guys from
       <a href="/r/Christianity">
        /r/Christianity
       </a>
       even came here and clarified extensively, even while
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       was being alarmist and twisting the story around. He was very nice and clear even as people were insulting him, his subreddit, his religion etc. for no reason. I believe his name was TruthBeTold or TruthWillBeTold or something, if I recall he had education in the fields of theology/textual analysis and his only point was that analysis of historical documents was a very particular discipline this author was not qualified to associate himself with. Point being, it wasn't a religious censorship issue etc., it was just a false credentials issue
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       blew out of proportion and tried to turn into a coverup like they do with pretty much everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3 his name was
       <a href="/u/TurretOpera">

       I'm not so convinced, check the responses he gave once he got the hang of reddit.

      <p>
       The community has been more forgiving of less-reddit-savvy AMA hosts.  Every single response of his was downvoted to oblivion, destroying the interactivity and censoring the host.

       Here's a multi-part question for him:
If he was ever briefed on or did he pick up knowledge of different races of extraterrestials?
How many and could he give minor details on each?
What does he know of their presence relating to our moon in the past or present?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please express our gratitude and love for this man, it is so rare for someone to stop playing the game and turn their head towards revealing truth.

       he told me that he believes our concept of aliens is a psyop, and that what we call greys are biological machines sent back from future earth humans to correct something in the past to help their future survive.  This resulted in the Roswell crash, which screwed up both our timeline and theirs, because the military industrial complex was essentially given super technology from the reverse engineering of their craft.  He said a lot of our modern day mainstream tech has also come out of this engineering work, including semiconductors and fiber optics.  He says that he does not consider flying saucers spacecraft so much as he  considers them time machines.  The ability to fly interstellar, he says, means you also have the ability to move through time.  He says he personally did not witness "aliens" or other such beings underground, as he was just doing manual/mechanical labor. But he did say he saw the aforementioned tetrahedrally shaped crafts.  He said it was absolutely massive in size...as large as a football field, or thereabouts.  Actually, I can't remember if he was saying the craft was that large or the hangar that housed it was that large...I will clarify when i do the interview.

       i tried to talk to him about the beneveloent force, but he didn't know much about it.  He had a lot to say about 2012 and ascension, but not in the context of the law of one, vibrational change or anything like that.  He is the son of an Irish immigrant so all of his spiritual understanding is derived from the Christian theology...but he still said a lot about 4th density if you knew what to listen for.

       I've heard of the high tech boring machines. They use some sort of plasma to melt solid rock which is extruded back through the machine and into forms surrounding the walls where it hardens. The walls appear to be made of glass...

       I've only been exposed to him for about 10 years and he has never fully been in my life.  I only have seen him around holidays in the last 10.   He said wacky things, in the context of 5 other adults and a bunch of kids...So I haven't really had much of a real long conversation with the guy until now.  The first time I spoke to him for more than 30 or so minutes, it was when he disassembled my AR-15 and showed me how to put it back together, and that was a few months ago.

       I had a friend once who was sharp about technology to some level, but he would say odd things sometimes.  He talked about his inventions, some of which seemed plausible but if you knew science would realize were badly thought out and wouldn't work. Over time it became clear he was imaginative but not wholly rational. I later found out he suffered from schizophrenia. I felt sorry for that, I had to take lots of what he said with a grain of salt, very carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       My friend completely exhibited the majority of the symptoms of schizotypal behavior you listed. And yet he was great at auto repair and electronics. Although he also made very dangerous mistakes in his work.
