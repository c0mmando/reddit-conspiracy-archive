USS LIBERTY MEMORIAL SITE</p>

<p>In 1967, US best friend and ally, Israel, opened fire on the USS liberty with multiple air and torpedo attacks. The liberty was able to send a distress call before its communications were cut off, but the rest of the fleet was ordered to stand down. The injured crew was able to manage to keep the boat afloat and returned to base. The crew was ordered to never tell anyone. Survivors still want an answer from the US government. Phillip Francis Tourney was part of the crew and is willing to share his story. He is on facebook and is accepting new friends.</p>

It appears that the US knowingly sent the Liberty into harm&#39;s way, holding back support ships that would have normally accompanied it to whatever harbor or shoreline it was dispatched to.  It seemed to me that Lyndon Johnson and Robert McNamara were very much complicit in this heinous act. </p>

<p>Are you referring to the ship not sinking, or the Russians pulling up and recording it, that made the Ashke<strong>nazis</strong> back off, or the pilot serving 3 years in jail for not dropping his bombs?</p>

<p>As those are the few things that <strong>in fact</strong> went wrong. The plan was (if it did not go wrong) to turn Cairo into a glass parking-lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reason school history books are not on line and in hypertext is because the old world order could not stand the truth being linked in and getting out.</p>

<p>Wanna see something scary? Look at this flag: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_(1707).svg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_(1707).svg</a>  and this flag: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Union_Flag">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Union_Flag</a> The (German, Ashke<strong>nazi</strong> rented army?) read coats marched right up cuz when they saw the flag they thought Washington was surrendering! </p>

<p>That Betsy Ross creating Americas first flag story is demonstrably untrue. The charters for the 13 colonies remain as they were before the war. The Pairs Peace Treaty of 1786 is worded like a surrender instrument, and it took 10 years for the British to leave afterwords. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that was part of it.</p>

<p>I think it was definitely to also burn some act of Congress record, but I couldn&#39;t prove exactly what.</p>

<p>I heard a law was passed that made it so if you are a USA &quot;law&quot; &quot;judge&quot;, you could not be anything else. (like being a UCC judge or a maritime law judge or an administrator of anything.) Something to do with mixing &quot;Government&quot; and &quot;corporation&quot; not being allowed. </p>

<p>See: <a href="http://www.amendment-13.org/">http://www.amendment-13.org/</a> but the dates seem about 7 years off. (Maybe rewritten/re-enacted?)</p>

<p>Do you know what year your town was incorporated? If something is against Burger-King corporate &quot;code&quot; that does not make it against the &quot;law&quot;. If something is against Your-City code it does not make it against the &quot;law&quot; it just seems like it when one does not really know what the real deal is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>aaand you lost my attention the moment you said all Jews worship satan. </p>

<p>This is what&#39;s wrong with <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Not the theories themselves but the blatant &quot;every jew is born evil, no exceptions&quot; bullshit that&#39;s being allowed.</p>

<p>Just so you get it through your head, There are thousands of Jewish people who do not support Israel for various reasons and there are so many Jews, Israeli and non-Israeli, who can be and most definitely are the nicest damn people one could ever meet.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t mind the Zionist NWO stuff that goes on in this subreddit but for the love of God and all that is holy, just everyone quit it with the unfounded anti-Semitic crap.</p>
