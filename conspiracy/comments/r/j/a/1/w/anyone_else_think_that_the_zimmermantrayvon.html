       pretty much my thoughts exactly - stir up racial tensions, make all the white people (or i guess non-black people) feel guilty about not voting for a 'black' guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's all part of the divide and conquer strategy. notice how the media focuses on pointless dichotomies and whips up public anger about it. examples - gay marriage, racial tensions, abortion, republicans vs democrats, liberals vs. conservatives

       From talking about bankster's names and crimes, probably. Or the Murdoch scandal. Or the increasing militarization of the police, financed by the banking cartel. Or the increasing development of legal framework for the militarization of police, bought and paid for by the banking cartel. Or the development and upcoming deployment of thousands of drones, paid for with banking cartel money, and one of the gloriously ironic ways how Obama claimed to cut defense spending (something the left imagined would make the world LESS like 1984). Or the clamping down of internet anonymity. Or the rape of Greece by the banking cartel, and how now (not even wiping themselves off after) the same people, the same cartel, seem preparing to do the same to Spain. Take your pick!
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is not a special case. This media mouthpiece serves the banking cartels. I would wager that whatever would threaten them the most is what is being avoided by "reporting" endlessly on other things.

       every day there's a new controversial story, and in the end none of them matter. one day there's a huge uproar over some injustice, then tomorrow a new story pops up and everyone moves on. everyone focuses on only one problem and the problem before that is lost in time.

       Definitely...there are those "big" controversial stories which stick around for a week or 2 and constantly get recycled through ALL the big media channels.  The morning shows, the evening shows, the opinion shows, the comedy shows, the radio shows.  If any story has a smoke-screen purpose it's these all-encompassing shitstorms.  It's slightly creepy how it runs like a well-oiled machine.  It's just a big mindfuck machine that never sleeps.

       I think it was hyped up intentionally though, florida is a big factor in the elections in november. I think Obama reassured him some of the black peoples vote, who may have had higher expectations of him and had previously decided to not vote.

       His point is that black voters are not a monolithic group who can be easily played in the manner you stated. Black people give a shit about the issues, too. And talk about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd know that if you thought for a second black people were three dimensional human beings. And you'd know that if you interfaced with them on a regular basis.

       As you can see from his reply, no that was not what he was referring to. Also lol at trying to paint me as a racist, but 95% of voting black people voted for obama last election, its just obvious to me that he is trying to activate as much of the black population as possible.

       Black people voted for Obama perhaps because the propaganda meant to brainwash people in to voting for McCain was pointedly NOT aimed at black people and the issues they face? Perhaps black people were more interested in Obama's message of unity and self-reliance?
      </p>
      <p>
       You state that Obama is trying to ACTIVATE black people. You mean like a sleeper terrorist cell? Why do black people need to be ACTIVATED to be effective or have opinions?

       Ginned up yes but then so were the Afghanistan shootings to although the event has one purpose of being a distraction, I don't know what we are being distracted from.  I think the purposes of this type event are layered and complex.  So, I think the distraction aspect is not the only component here.

       It's just another story to feed the feeble minds, to milk ratings, to invigorate emotions and mislead the MSM consumers into placing their energy where told rather than where they would expend it if they were given the real news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think there really is "one" story they tried to paint over but rather the entire reality that is the global and national climate.  I havent seen REAL news on tv for about 10 years now (I also watch zero TV in my own house and do not have cable).
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it sad, pathetic, and shameful that most people I talk to that identify themselves as "politically active and socially aware" are just dipshits that are addicted to the 24 hour news cycle and the propagandist hate-mongers that call themselves anchors, pundits, experts, consultants, and politicians.

       No. The Zimmerman-Martin media feeding frenzy was initiated as a way to forward the anti-gun agenda ... specifically, to make whites feel guilty about owning and using guns.

       Do you think the insanity in the press to lynch Zimmerman just happened? The mainstream press has been waiting for something it could manipulate to put pressure on white Americans to feel guilty about buying and using guns. The  government has painted white Americans as the enemy. They have been branded as potential terrorists -- all because they are the group most likely to resist (effectively resist, as opposted to breaking a few store windows) violence against the general population by the government.

       So in response, white Americans are buying into hysteria instead of shunning the propaganda and joining with their class brothers of all colors all over the nation and the world. Sound reasoning, that.

       His point is that black voters are not a monolithic group who can be easily played in the manner you stated. Black people give a shit about the issues, too. And talk about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd know that if you thought for a second black people were three dimensional human beings. And you'd know that if you interfaced with them on a regular basis.
