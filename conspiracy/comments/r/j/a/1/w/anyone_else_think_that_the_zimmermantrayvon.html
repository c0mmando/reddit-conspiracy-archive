<p>it&#39;s all part of the divide and conquer strategy. notice how the media focuses on pointless dichotomies and whips up public anger about it. examples - gay marriage, racial tensions, abortion, republicans vs democrats, liberals vs. conservatives</p>

Or the increasing development of legal framework for the militarization of police, bought and paid for by the banking cartel. Or the development and upcoming deployment of thousands of drones, paid for with banking cartel money, and one of the gloriously ironic ways how Obama claimed to cut defense spending (something the left imagined would make the world LESS like 1984). Or the clamping down of internet anonymity. Or the rape of Greece by the banking cartel, and how now (not even wiping themselves off after) the same people, the same cartel, seem preparing to do the same to Spain. Take your pick! </p>

<p>But this is not a special case. This media mouthpiece serves the banking cartels. I would wager that whatever would threaten them the most is what is being avoided by &quot;reporting&quot; endlessly on other things.</p>

<p>Not sure how I&#39;m the one doing the painting when the brush is in your hands. </p>

<p>Black people voted for Obama perhaps because the propaganda meant to brainwash people in to voting for McCain was pointedly NOT aimed at black people and the issues they face? Perhaps black people were more interested in Obama&#39;s message of unity and self-reliance?</p>

<p>You state that Obama is trying to ACTIVATE black people. You mean like a sleeper terrorist cell? Why do black people need to be ACTIVATED to be effective or have opinions? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just another story to feed the feeble minds, to milk ratings, to invigorate emotions and mislead the MSM consumers into placing their energy where told rather than where they would expend it if they were given the real news.  </p>

<p>I dont think there really is &quot;one&quot; story they tried to paint over but rather the entire reality that is the global and national climate.  I havent seen REAL news on tv for about 10 years now (I also watch zero TV in my own house and do not have cable).  </p>

<p>I find it sad, pathetic, and shameful that most people I talk to that identify themselves as &quot;politically active and socially aware&quot; are just dipshits that are addicted to the 24 hour news cycle and the propagandist hate-mongers that call themselves anchors, pundits, experts, consultants, and politicians.  </p>

The mainstream press has been waiting for something it could manipulate to put pressure on white Americans to feel guilty about buying and using guns.
