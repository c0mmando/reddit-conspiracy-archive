<p>that&#39;s a nice thought, with a fairly sound factual basis, too, but people aren&#39;t going to understand how easily they&#39;re tricked until they understand how they&#39;re being tricked now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true, but both you &amp; I do not <em>need</em> the sheeple to understand the utterly incomprehensible. The real value in &quot;sharing&quot; our conspiracies is the shock factor in that your mind can take the [objective] perspective of any <em>potential</em> scenario; they realize the importance and security in thinking for and believing in yourself. </p>

<p>Without doubt, some people are bound to a destiny that does not include conspiratards. Why should one impose (dogmatize) hir personal understandings on other individuals (no matter how blind &amp; dumb)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Written 14 years before the Titanic sank.</p>

<p>Audio book&lt;<a href="http://librivox.org/futility-or-the-wreck-of-the-titan-by-morgan-robertson/%3E">http://librivox.org/futility-or-the-wreck-of-the-titan-by-morgan-robertson/&gt;</a>
Read online &lt;<a href="http://www.titanic-titanic.com/wreck_of_the_titan_1.shtml%3E">http://www.titanic-titanic.com/wreck_of_the_titan_1.shtml&gt;</a></p>

<p>In 1898 a man named Morgan Robertson penned a book titled &quot;Wreck of the
Titan&quot; about a luxury liner deemed unsinkable that was going too fast in
the North Atlantic in April and hit and iceberg killing most everyone on
board due to lack of lifeboats.</p>

<p>14 years later this fictional book would play out in real life exactly down
to the name, with the wreck of the Titanic; but this time it would have
major political implications. Some of the wealthiest men in the world were
on that ship and some were opposed to the Federal Reserve and central banks.</p>

<p>FACT: JP Morgan funded/built the Titanic </p>

<p>FACT: JP Morgan was booked on the voyage but canceled at the last second. </p>

<p>FACT: Friend of JP Morgan, Milton Hersey, also canceled at the last moment and survived to build the Hersey
food empire. </p>

<p>FACT: There were no red flares on board to signal to any boats for rescue. Only white flares that signal a party and that everything is okay. </p>

<p>FACT: It was the first ship of its kind with the ability to seal decks electromagnetically which could also seal people below deck. </p>

<p>FACT:The Captain Edward Smith was one of the most decorated Captains of his time and would have been totally out of character by avoiding precautions. </p>

<p>FACT:The author of the book was poisoned to death a couple years after the Titanic sank. </p>

<p>FACT: The Federal Reserve was formed the very next year.</p>

<p>FACT: The Astor Family was one of the richest families in the world and John Astor III opposed the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>Did JP Morgan get the idea of how to kill off the opposition to the Federal Reserve from a book written 14 years prior? This was a book titled &quot;The Titan&quot; published 14 years before the Titanic sank and look at the similarities. Did they hatch a plan at Jekyll Island to build a ship to eliminate the competition?</p>

<p>Similarities to the Titanic.</p>

<p>Although the novel was written before the Olympic-class Titanic had even been designed, there are some remarkable similarities between the fictional and real-life counterparts. Like the Titanic, the fictional ship sank in
April in the North Atlantic, and there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers. There are also similarities between the size (800 ft long for Titan versus 882 ft 9 in long for the Titanic), speed (25 knots for Titan, 21 knots for Titanic) and life-saving equipment. </p>

<p>Beyond the name, the similarities between the Titanic and the fictional Titan include:</p>

<p>Described as &quot;unsinkable&quot; The Titanic was the world&#39;s largest luxury liner (882 feet, displacing 63,000 long tons), and was once described as being practically &quot;unsinkable&quot;. The Titan was the largest craft afloat and the
greatest of the works of men (800 feet, displacing 75,000 tons), and was considered &quot;unsinkable&quot;. Shortage of lifeboats The Titanic carried only 16 lifeboats, plus 4 Engelhardt folding lifeboats,less than half the number required for her passenger capacity of 3000. The Titan carried &quot;as few as the law allowed&quot;, 24 lifeboats, less than half needed for her 3000 capacity.</p>

<p>Struck an iceberg Moving too fast at 22½ knots,the Titanic struck an iceberg on the starboard side on the night of April 14, 1912 in the North Atlantic 400 miles away from Newfoundland. Also on an April night, in the North Atlantic 400 miles from Newfoundland (Terranova), the Titan hit an iceberg while traveling at 25 knots, also on the starboard side. </p>

<p>Sinking The unsinkable Titanic sank, and more than half of her 2200 passengers died. The indestructible Titan also sank, more than half of her 2500 passengers drowning. Went down bow first, the Titan actually capsizing
before it sank.</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; have fucking microwave guns . I guarantee that when the time comes we will not be able to match their force even if we have the numbers. Now I&#39;m not saying we should give up but we definitely need to play it smart. Really, if we got enough willing participants together we could organize elaborate pranks and stage incidents and really buck the system. Like if we could get everyone on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to call companies and media outlets with fake stories and complaints.... Really get them into a frenzy so they out themselves as the spineless cowards they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What im saying is that cops are usually outnumbered 10th to 1, there is no way they can control a crowd of people unless the people comply, but most people are not willing to cross the line that is striking a cop, weve been conditioned that its about the worse thing someone could do.</p>

<p>Look at the occupy protest videos of people being arrested one by one. The only reason the police can do it is because they know people won&#39;t help each other when police are involved. </p>
