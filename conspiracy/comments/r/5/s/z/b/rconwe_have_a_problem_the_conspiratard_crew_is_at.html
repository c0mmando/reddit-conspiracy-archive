        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today, the nolibs/conspiratard crew <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/r4y5t/graped_in_the_mouth_summarizes_pretty_much_every/">squeezed in and managed to up an /r/bestof of article to the front page</a>; It claims to briefly explain all common conspiracy theories, but actually links people to an over-simplified &quot;explanation&quot; that popped up in r/conspiratard, becomeing one of their highest up-voted comments ever.  It ends in claiming all conspiracy theorists are neo nazis and further ostricizes our growing subreddit by claiming to have all the answers in five easy to read paragraphs.  While this might be reassuring to the average citizen, we know, through our growing numbers and continually confirmed stories, that this is not true.  The Reddit-sphere is clever enough to know the truth; why should they believe it to be a fantasy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s imperative that we get this off the front page and out of the ether of reddit, lest we further become known as the tin hatters and the nolibs crew grows in strength and its ability to troll through here, leaving a trail of false claims and wasted straw men in it&#39;s wake.  I propose we all get over there and offer a downvote and true explanation of one of the these claims.  It only takes a couple of minuets, and if we each focus on one of the explain-aways that Graped_in_the_mouth has made, people will see this link for what it really is.  I doubt it will take us long to show them that 4000 nay-sayers (assuming they arent a bunch of duplicate accounts) just doesn&#39;t stack up to the 50,000 here who have seen the light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps if I could come to r/conspiracy <strong>just once</strong> and not be called a Zionist despite not having a Pro-Israel stance, I&#39;d give your accusations some merit.  No, you&#39;re not <em>all</em> neo-nazis, but your community uplifts and enables them.  </p>

<p>Prove me wrong.  Seriously.  This isn&#39;t a troll, it&#39;s a challenge: ostracize those among you who sow the seeds of hatred and bigotry.  Stop upvoting guys like Occidentalist, tttt0tttt, bumblingmumbling, BenShalomBernanke2 and every other person who can&#39;t go 20 minutes without talking about Jews and how evil they all are.  Because as it stands, these people seem to be widely respected among this community, and I see their posts with upvotes in the double digits, and often as the highest comment in a thread, for no other reason than that they said something awful about Jew bankers.</p>

<p>That thread isn&#39;t being upvoted because we have an upvote brigade - r/conspiratard has maybe 20 members who are <em>actually</em> active, and before it hit r/bestof, the post had maybe a dozen upvotes.  Reddit saw what I wrote, and by and large, they thought what I said had merit.  </p>

<p>Insult me all you want, talk about duplicate accounts and how unlike you, we haven&#39;t &#39;seen the light&#39;, all that does is prove <em>exactly</em> what I said about unsubstantiated assertions and the cultist mindset.  Why don&#39;t you try doing <em>the opposite</em> for once?  Provide a logical rebuttal to my points, and give me something to think about, instead of an insult to dismiss.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m really not here to piss you off, I&#39;m hoping for an actual person to step up and give me something substantial.  Hate me if you must, but I&#39;m not your enemy; I don&#39;t hate you, and I don&#39;t wish for your destruction.  As I said <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/r4y5t/graped_in_the_mouth_summarizes_pretty_much_every/c4332uv">here</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think a dissenting, questioning community, however crazy their majority is, serves a useful purpose. But that population only serves this purpose as long as it remains reasonably small, and as long as they do get a bullseye every once in a while. While I dislike the community over at r/conspiracy, I think the fact that they exist at all is probably a good thing, if they can stumble on to even one relevant conspiracy. That said, I&#39;ll still work to debunk the bad science/journalism/investigation, and treat those whose &#39;theories&#39; are rooted not in evidence, but bigotry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I think the vast majority here are misguided, I think that most (though not all) of the theories proposed are based on conjecture and circumstantial evidence, and I think the growing number of hatemongers in your ranks are being enabled, upvoted and encouraged, I also think your community serves as an important voice of dissent, and the mere fact that it exists unhindered is proof that the police state you all fear so much hasn&#39;t arrived yet.  </p>

<p>I mock you when you&#39;re off the deep end.  I question you when you fail to provide evidence.  But I don&#39;t hate you.  So why is it that you here hate me so much?  Why do I always find myself being called &#39;Zionist&#39;, or some other name that just means &quot;you&#39;re an evil, greedy Jew, regardless of your beliefs or actions&quot;?  When you can answer this question, we&#39;ll no longer have reason to quarrel, and I can go back to attempting to debunk the theories I think are wrong without such vitriol.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>certainly: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/top/">today&#39;s top posts</a>; not one mention of banksters, zionist&#39;s, Jews, or Israel...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/top/?sort=top&amp;amp;t=week">This week&#39;s</a>; with the exception of a poignant, and broadly-accepted (in journalistic circles atleast) cartoon about Iran&#39;s Nukes vs Israel&#39;s nukes, no mention of Zionism, Jews, or any anti-Semitic insinuations</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/top/?sort=top&amp;amp;t=month">This Month</a>; more of the same..</p>

<p>While there may be some extremely loud voices promoting their anti-Semitic agenda here, it simply isn&#39;t something that has infected our entire community.  We have a very skeptical group of individuals here and I gamble very few would make assumptions about such a large groups of people without doing their own research.  But if your always  come here to attack our community, making intentional motions to constantly disprove the things we dig up or claim that we are crazy for doing research into darker regions of our planet&#39;s past, our politician&#39;s plans, and where things are headed, then, yes we will be on the defense.  Those that hold the belief that it is Israel/Zionist at the helm of these maneuvers are just faster and less discriminate about placing the blame, so they can easily and quickly displace your opinion and move on unhindered by cognitive dissonance.  But unlike r/politics, r/worldnews, and most of the larger subs, we choose not to silence any voices.  Even the anti-Semites that reside here occasionally point out imperative information that results in clarification but I find that they still regularly get slapped down.</p>

<p>Infact, I just took it upon myself to check all of today&#39;s &quot;hot&quot; posts and found nothing that denounced Jews, Israel, or blamed it on banksters and a Zionist plot.  Can you find a comment or two that does promote these anti-Semitic ideals that made you choose to include it in your &quot;explanation&quot; of conspiracies?</p>

<p>Check out &quot;Toulouse Shootings - Gladio and Mossad&quot;, the topic I referred to in my first post in this topic.

    <div class="md"><p>I did indeed check it out; he did not post in r/con, and besides, look where it got him.  The posts got 4 up total; what does that really say about our community? that soccer represents it?  I think not</p>

<p>We had one bad seed and everyone else took two steps back... soccer participated in our election here a few months back and won by making  a lot of promises and swearing to stay neutral; at the time, none of us knew about his connection to the white pride sub, but what can you do in retrospect.  </p>

<p>And dont say &quot;it speaks volumes&quot; that we are trying to defend our sub; Graped made a blatant attack on us that painted all r/con subscribers as neo-nazi scum, when it has so little to do with the larger community here; again, i plea that you post a link to a post or comment HERE IN OUR SUB that is relatively recent and make anti-Semitic statements that you find offensive.  I dug around through the top 3 pages of hot items, this week, month, and year&#39;s top items, and a page or two of new and I honestly didn&#39;t see anything of the sort, or atleast anything that had any support behind it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey. I remember you! We had a pointless back-and-forth some months ago where I essentially advised you to stop feeding trolls. I guess you didn&#39;t listen because, as you so deftly pointed out, hate speech gets double digit up-votes here. To think, in a community of over 5-thousand subscribers, a thread critical of Israel and her proponents can get as many as 10 aggregate up-votes. Perish the thought!</p>

<p>Yet the irony of your indictment is apparently lost on so many; because you&#39;re now attempting to have the community effectively conspire against opinions that you (and many others) find unpalatable. And in lieu of gaining an adequate consensus here (your own grapey cohort of down voting zealots?), you turned to the greater reddit body politic to disparage all 5-thousand(+) subscribers of r/conspiracy as bigots, amongst other things. </p>

<p>However, all you&#39;ve proven is that instead of contributing competing content, you chose instead to peer long and hard at the most disagreeable corner of this subreddit. Essentially, you saw a pile of dust in the corner of the living room and concluded that the only feasible action left was to burn down the house. Good job!</p>

<p>So let&#39;s all just fuck the articles that deal with finance or politics or the threads that revealed KONY 2012 as the fraud it was while the rest of reddit was busy stenciling Invisible Children logos on their MacBooks. Fuck the submissions that counter the fear-mongering and war-mongering that dominate American dialogue. Fuck the thought-provoking documentaries, the Chris Hedges features, and MSM clips. Fuck it all to the ground because your fit of indignant myopia won&#39;t allow you to look past the &#39;growing hate-mongering here&#39;. But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll gladly defend your crusade of labeling myself and others as bigots because, thankfully, there&#39;s more to this subreddit than a bundle of janky quirks (yourself included). Seriously, abandon the chip on your shoulder on you just might like the place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skeptics and conspiracy theorists don&#39;t go hand in hand.  A skeptic actually looks into all the information and makes a judgement accordingly and welcomes all valid information. Conspiracy theorists ignore all the information that doesn&#39;t agree with them and says the government is behind a cover up with evidence they don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>With the Kony campaign it was the skeptics who were saying it was a pretty bad charity and looking into it and exposing it. While conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones was saying it was a government propaganda machine and Angelina Jolie should be up for war crimes based on no evidence.  See the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is this monolithic definition of what a conspiracy theorist is? Since when have we had such convenient categories that defy the intent of language? I don&#39;t really understand why conspiracy would, by your definition, be incapable of healthy skepticism. </p>

<p>I&#39;m beginning to suspect that we&#39;re thinking in parallel and without any real convergence. </p>

<p>For the record, I consider anyone who deduces alternative explanations from available information to be a &quot;theorist&quot;. A &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; arrives at explanations that suggest a concerted effort by two or more individuals to promote an inaccuracy. Now theorists of all flavors can arrive at some sensational claims, but I can&#39;t understand why their categorization, and not each individual theories, is sufficient enough to warrant a blanket dismissal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok lets just take September 11 as an example. If you believe September 11 was an inside job by the government who blew up the towers you have to be ignoring an extremely large amount of evidence because you think it is fabricated with 0 proof that it is fabricated.  This makes you a conspiracy theorist, a skeptic wouldn&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>I would say the difference between conspiracy theorists and skeptics is a conspiracy theorist will only look at evidence that supports their belief. A skeptic looks at all the evidence.  </p>

<p>No matter the crime or disaster - the Holocaust or last year&#39;s earthquake and tsunami in Japan as real examples - there&#39;s a large group of people r/conspiracy who blame it on Jews.   The votes for such posts are overwhelmingly UP.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy earned its reputation.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong>  Oh look!  The very next post blames this afternoon&#39;s earthquake in Mexico on a radio antenna in Alaska!  Yet another event blamed on the Swiss Army Knife of submoronic tinfoil-hattery, HAARP!</p>

The person posting <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/duplicates/r5u3d/toulouse_shootings_gladio_and_mossad/">the claim</a> all over reddit that Jews were responsible for yesterday&#39;s shooting attack at a Jewish school in Toulouse, is a moderator on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!  Who could have seen THAT coming?</p>

We allow them to post here in the name of free speech because we stand firmly against censorship. The general attitude of the moderators on this is that we can&#39;t really stop them from posting here so we may as well allow them to within certain guidelines. They like to bend the rules but never really break them, so even though we might not like it, we dislike censorship a lot more. You insinuated that we are all antisemites. One of our moderators here is Jewish. You are just as bad as a racist because you spread hatred. We are all about peace here, and you guys are all about war. Who is the hater here?</p>

<p>My own experiences confirm this.  It might be more like 12, but it&#39;s not a large number.  Here&#39;s the thing: if they weren&#39;t such prolific posters, and their comments/links weren&#39;t so heavily upvoted, I&#39;d have no problem.  But as it stands, I watch them spew hate speech to the reddit equivalent of applause.  This is my problem with r/conspiracy, and I&#39;d love nothing more than to see this trend change, so you can continue to serve your societal function.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tend to be neutral toward them and try not to give encouragement to hateful behavior or materials. I understand where you are coming from, but we really do not consider this a racially biased sub. I understand that element is here, but because of our stance against censorship these types of materials will continue to exist here. I just feel that the racist label only applies to a very tiny minority of active users here and has been unfairly blanketed over us all. A lot of people here see this as a subversion of conspiracy thinking by associating the content of our sub with racism against the Jews, which is simply untrue for the majority of us. Also I feel that downvotes are reserved for the worst case scenario, not to be tossed around lightly. I guess I&#39;m just extremely neutral about things that do not concern me much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>About bumblingmumbling, he is actually quite the gentleman if you actually speak to him like a person all racism aside. I don&#39;t neccisarly approve of all of his material. The real reason for taking his side is that he wasn&#39;t the one stalking other users and spamming the sub with the same post over and over again. Crack was an abusive ass, hands down, not just with bm, he was generally shitty with anyone who engaged him. He was a pain in the arse and we are glad to finally be rid of him. </p>

<p>Your sub is a hate group. You hate us, the people who are probably going to save your asses from a global threat that isn&#39;t Islamic extremism. You encourage others to engage in mockery of people who do not always believe what we are told by the media and government agencies in a quite successful effort to keep everyone&#39;s mind in line and to prevent free thought by creating a hostile environment for those of us who think outside the box. It&#39;s quite a hateful thing and this is why I called you a hater. You have the power to change but it&#39;s all up to you. </p>

They were only posted in response to bumblingmumbling&#39;s hard-core antisemitic spams.  But there&#39;s your double standard again.</p>

They went through a relatively dormant phase last summer, but starting early this year they have become a lot more active.

    <div class="md"><p>As reddit <del>heart-breakingly, painfully</del> moves up in mainstream consciousness, it is going to be linked to something tangible to non-users (vast majority of the US alone). How the media approaches this is, and how reddit presents itself as a brand with a fiercly loyal userbase, is going to have tremors along the way. Within the community the users/mods/admins have an effective triangle of balance and can self-correct. Outside the community, with older, non-techie generations voting equally incompetent leaders, ripples that are picked up by the media are blown like stoking a fire to the non-users.</p>

<p>Harsh reality sets in as the broadness of our community ponders the implications of being linked to something 99.998% of the community does not believe in (I&#39;d even wager more voters would be FOR whatever the post was about, but voted PRO government restrictions than users of reddit who did it). The triangle becomes imbalanced (obtuse?) as admins enforce alarmist legislation.</p>

<p>As users, we seek new ground elsewhere with a possibly smaller social circle to draw knowledge and debate within. Reddit turns into digg, and on Pi Day we cook bacon and drink it with vodka in a solemn tribute to what was. </p>

<p>fast forward to 2015</p>

<p><em>You go back to your computer, because the new social news site from Sweden features live video from your webcam/tablet/phone, so you sigh and start drawing the latest meme on your forehead backwards. A guy on the conspiracy/new section flexes his tongue into the screen like a snake at the sight of you. You sigh and nod approvingly, a lone bacon flavored tear streaking down your cheek.</em></p>

<p>4) Blatant bigotry.
This one&#39;s usually about Jews. There&#39;s a crowd over at r/conspiracy - and they&#39;re getting louder and more numerous - that honestly believe that Jews are a homogeneous ethnic/religious group which thinks, acts and donates money with a single hive mind, intent on making Israel the most powerful nation in the world, and creating a one-world government. To support these claims, vague figures about Jewish wealth are trotted out, as well as obscure Talmudic passages...and, of course, the most common &#39;evidence&#39; used to support the claims of Jewish Hegemony and evil are simply the words of other conspiracy theorists, who are themselves quoting conspiracy theorists they&#39;ve heard. The number of verifiable primary sources is precisely zero.
They tend to use the word &#39;Zionist&#39; in place of Jew, so they don&#39;t sound so bigoted, but don&#39;t be fooled; if you&#39;re of Jewish descent, you&#39;re a Zionist, no matter how you feel about Israel. I&#39;m &#39;Jewish&#39; (an atheist, but Jewish by birth, if you can&#39;t tell by my adorable flair here on r/conspiratard), and I&#39;ve talked to these people. I&#39;ve stated - in no uncertain terms - that I have no love for Israel, and don&#39;t support many of the actions of the Israeli state. I&#39;m still told I&#39;m a Zionist Racist Jewish Supremacist pig...not because my comment history actually supports this, but for no reason other than because I have Jewish blood. If you want to see what these people actually think, look up tttt0tttt, Occidentalist and bumblingmumbling; they&#39;re the best examples, especially since I&#39;ve seen each one at one time or another express admiration for either Nazi Germany as a state or Hitler as a person (while assuring me they&#39;re not bigots, all Jews are bigots!) *<strong><em>I&#39;ve never in my life encountered a higher concentration of anti-semites outside of a literal neo-nazi forum than I have at r/conspiracy.</em></strong>*</p>

How the media approaches this is, and how reddit presents itself as a brand with a fiercly loyal userbase, is going to have tremors along the way. Within the community the users/mods/admins have an effective triangle of balance and can self-correct. Outside the community, with older, non-techie generations voting equally incompetent leaders, ripples that are picked up by the media are blown like stoking a fire to the non-users.</p>

<p>Harsh reality sets in as the broadness of our community ponders the implications of being linked to something 99.998% of the community does not believe in (I&#39;d even wager more voters would be FOR whatever the post was about, but voted PRO government restrictions than users of reddit who did it). The triangle becomes imbalanced (obtuse?) as admins enforce alarmist legislation.</p>

<p>As users, we seek new ground elsewhere with a possibly smaller social circle to draw knowledge and debate within. Reddit turns into digg, and on Pi Day we cook bacon and drink it with vodka in a solemn tribute to what was. </p>

<p>fast forward to 2015</p>

<p><em>You go back to your computer, because the new social news site from Sweden features live video from your webcam/tablet/phone, so you sigh and start drawing the latest meme on your forehead backwards. A guy on the conspiracy/new section flexes his tongue into the screen like a snake at the sight of you. You sigh and nod approvingly, a lone bacon flavored tear streaking down your cheek.</em></p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I like reddit how it is. Thanks for being a great mod.</p>

<p>After moderating r/conspiracy for several months I can assure you that most of the antisemetic sentimate and postings come from less than 10 users</p>

<p>My own experiences confirm this.  It might be more like 12, but it&#39;s not a large number.  Here&#39;s the thing: if they weren&#39;t such prolific posters, and their comments/links weren&#39;t so heavily upvoted, I&#39;d have no problem.  But as it stands, I watch them spew hate speech to the reddit equivalent of applause.  This is my problem with r/conspiracy, and I&#39;d love nothing more than to see this trend change, so you can continue to serve your societal function.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be buried deep within my comment history...but I promise, I&#39;ll try to find it for you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it wasn&#39;t something like &quot;kike&quot;, but a constant referral to me as a Zionist/Jewish Supremacist without evidence.  The words themselves were only racist because of the context of being used as a blanket insult.  </p>
