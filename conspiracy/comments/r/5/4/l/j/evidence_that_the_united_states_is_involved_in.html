    <div class="md"><p>Well, the real story of Afghanistan is a bit more complex than that. If you can imagine a bunch of vultures surveying a freshly killed zebra - then you can out this into perspective.</p>

<p>Not every vulture wants the hindquarters - they will settle for some thing else and be quite happy.</p>

<p>So here you are:</p>

<p>The oil people can start getting their pipeline from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan down through Pakistan and avoid the whole Persian Gulf. Karzai used to work for Exxon.</p>

<p>The secret services get to run their drug trade with a lot better profit, and this in turn boosts the banks as they move the money and get quite a bit from that.</p>

<p>Quite a few big corporations are going to exploit that nice trove of rare earth minerals, and in the process gut China of cornering the market.</p>

<p>The military-industrial guys get to build bases and sell billions while maintaining the war machine there.</p>

<p>The IMF and other banks get to wade in and have the Afghanis sell off their public utilities, minerals, water etc... to western companies. Dont forget someone gets the contracts to &quot;rebuild&#39; the country - with names like Haliburton...</p>

<p>With rebuilding the charities and NGOs get a nice slice of development and rebuilding money. Probably quite a few nice slave-shop factories get to go in also... in time.</p>

<p>The Afghani central bank gets to impoverish and debt-slave the county for quite a while.</p>

<p>You need to research things yourself sometimes of course. First question to ask is who the hell was this Northern Alliance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Consider that the poppy farming was all but extinct under the Taliban. It now flourishes. </p>

<p>Britain solved their tea trade deficit with China, by openly bulk shipping opium right up until the 1940&#39;s. When the Communists took over, the Brits must have moved the operation underground.  I can&#39;t see how the opium suppliers just decided to quit. That is a lot of money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think about the billions of dollars the pharma companies are saving now that they have an almost unlimited cheap supply of opium to make in oxy and all the various other opiate based &quot;legal&quot; drugs out there. Also think about how much the prescription drug trade has boomed since 2001, so now we have addicts to this doing anything they can to get put on pain meds, we have more people going into the prison system feeding the beast and the war on &quot;illegal&quot; drugs is still being waged. That&#39;s 3 - 5 major industries that just got richer when you look at it, prison industry, police, pharmaceutical, healthcare, and last but not least the insurance industry. I have nothing to back this up except for knowing some dealers and some addicts but I&#39;m not even sure how even the dumbest person could not connect the dots with this conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not by any means saying this is why 9/11 happened and then going after Afghanistan, but when you look at it this seems like an easy leap to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it is hard to believe, it is more or less insane. But there might be some deeper reasons for this. Oh, and its not just heroin, its all the drugs.</p>

<p>First off drug use can quiet down those uppity minorities from real political voice, change or gain. Imagine being a black man and knowing you have a 25% chance of going to jail in your lifetime! Hard to make changes when your neighborhood is a war zone, single mothers are trying to just feed their kids whose fathers are in jail and there is nothing but violence and intimidation from the police.</p>

<p>Then add in the the fact that many states never let you vote again if you are a convicted felon. Just how many black and other minorities are completely cut off from the political arena then? Remember how close the race was with Bush and Gore? Even a few hundred black votes could have swung that the other way - but they could not vote.</p>

<p>You get a wonderful source of basically free slave labor in the brand new prison factories. Makes millions for lots of people. With that you also get a nice reduction in social programs as more and more of the tax dollar goes to prisons and not to good things like schools and treatment programs. And that has a vicious cycle of more violence and more drug use and sales and even more people in prison.</p>

<p>The secret services also have a huge pipeline of money, power and influence with criminal gangs. And those gangs come in handy to know what is going in with crime around the world... it also helps to fund all those nice black-ops all over the globe. </p>

<p>Remember those banks in the US that were laundering drug money? Just how much did they really make with billions flowing through their coffers? The money made was massive, just massive...</p>

<p>Now, just think about this. Imagine if drugs were legal or de-criminalized - what would happen?</p>

<p>Many jails would be closed due to a lack of inmates. Black men and other minority peoples would be working and helping raise their families. Kids would have a mother and father and just be better all round individuals as they grew up. things would be better.</p>

<p>Thousands of police and agents would be laid off. Policing would be easier as whole areas are no longer unsafe due to drug sales and the inherent violence of the gangs and criminals.</p>

<p>Criminal gangs would lose their money, and thus their power...</p>

<p>Communities would get more tax dollars to improve their lives and from that you would have a better country, safer cities and better citizens.</p>

<p>When people feel safe, have decent communities and have a half decent life they then might think about making political groups and maybe trying to make changes... and there are certainly a lot of people who would never want that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It goes way back to Sassoon/Rothschilds and the Opium Wars. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eRvKKDy6nM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eRvKKDy6nM</a></p>

<p>Historical evidence indicates that the Vietnam War was a continuation of the two Opium Wars of the Nineteenth Century in which the Western powers forced China to import opium. As governments learned more about the dangers of opium and heroin, it became unacceptable—purely for public relations reasons—for the Western powers to overtly export narcotics to China and other countries. Over time, drug trafficking continued but its management shifted to international espionage services and organized crime which were secretly sanctioned by the Western governments. Eventually drug smuggling began to drive the foreign policies of the Western powers, and vice-versa. This entanglement, in my view, became the impetus behind Western involvement in the Vietnam War. It also appears that this situation was exploited by friends of Israel as a means of setting up the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>As previously stated, it was Jewish gangsters—such as Arnold Rothstein, &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond, &quot;Dutch&quot; Schultz, and Meyer Lansky—who introduced the heroin business to the American Mafia in the 1920s. In addition, the American Mafia—which was primarily of Sicilian origin in the 1920s—forbade involvement of either narcotics or prostitution. Such activity was left to the Jewish gangsters. This is a critical fact that further supports my conclusion that a Jewish conspiracy as the ultimate sponsor of the Kennedy assassination.</p>

<p>After Vietnam the drug operations turned to central and South America and Iran Contra (Israel). Gary Webb wrote about this. He is dead now. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6dHqP9wc3k&amp;amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6dHqP9wc3k&amp;amp;feature=related</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>This gut dont say that I claim it did not happen he said that I dare to question and that it somehow bad thing to do. There is a lot to question, the numbers which come from Talmud prediction that &quot;6 millions must die&quot;. Chemical analyses of camp wall paint that show no traces of gas. The fact that there was pool, theater and even kiosk selling beer and cigarettes to prisoners, also water well which would poison everyone if there was mass graves around it. The use of same dozen of eyewitness testimonials over and over in all holocaust literature and fact that topic is tabu and further researching like scanning location with ground penetrating radar looking for graves is forbidden is suspicious on it own
Also we should not forget that Soviets took over that place for many years and gave no access to anyone so they had enough time to manufacture what ever propaganda they like, and they did make ridiculous claims during the trial that Nazi had not only gas chamber but also electric chambers, steam chambers, crushing chamber, giant human meat grinders and even force Jews to claw on trees and then shake trees so jews fall down. Lets not forget debunked soup, clothing out of human skin and skull  ashtrays .  I have no doubt that there was such camp just like in America there was camps for Japanese, what I question is intentions of such camps as death camps instead of labor camps that was starved due to bombing of  food supplies </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it&#39;s fine to ask questions about the details.  do you agree that the Nazis attempted to wipe out the Jews (and others) completely. and would have done so if they could?  I think this is the biggest criticism you face, and rightly so.  there&#39;s so much evidence.  if you disagree, then fix this page:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp</a></p>

I mean was he even in such position to do so? even if he was mad there was whole pyramid of people in power I dont think all of them was mad by some coincidence, most people will oppose ideas of racial cleansing even racists  usually just want to distant them self and not actual death of disliked subject, due to evolution most humans oppose to murder</p>
