<ol>
<li><p>SSgt. Robert Bales worked as a liaison to the surrounding communities. Part of his job was to gather intelligence from the locals.</p></li>
<li><p>My friend contests that this &quot;slaughter&quot; was a planned Black Ops assault against terrorists and/or insurgent informants identified by SSgt. Bales.</p></li>
<li><p>This assault, being conducted by a Black Ops unit, is consequently being completely denied by the US government despite reports confirming that there were up to 20 soldiers in the village during the massacre.</p></li>
<li><p>SSgt. Bales <em>is</em> the cover story. The government will conclude after his trial that he is mentally incompetent to stand trial and will be held indefinitely by the government. At which point, SSgt. Bales will either be put in the Witness Protection Program and be given a new life <em>or</em> join a Black Ops unit.</p></li>
<li><p>My friend suspects that SSgt. Bales may <em>already be</em> a Black Ops operator who was working covertly to undermine suspected terrorist activity.</p></li>
<li><p>The government has now paid large amounts of money to the victims of this assault. My friend is insisting that this is <em>proof</em> of a cover-up and that the money comes with the stipulation of shutting up about what happened for good.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m curious. Does this even sound remotely possible? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This assault, being conducted by <strong>a Black Ops unit</strong>, <strong>is</strong> consequently <strong>being</strong> completely <strong>denied by the US government</strong> despite reports confirming that there were up to 20 soldiers in the village during the massacre.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing suspicious about this. It happens all the time. In fact, it&#39;s standard operating procedure for &quot;black ops&quot; activities. It&#39;s not always easy to tell if they want you to know about it or not. Take, for example, &quot;killing bin Laden&quot; - they wanted you to know that, so the &quot;black ops&quot;/&quot;special forces&quot; aspect was headline grabbing. In situations like this, acknowledgment/denial may or may not be relevant, depending on how it unfolds and what precisely is being acknowledged/denied.</p>

<p>tl;dr: #3 is a weak argument. Other than that, my only other comment is: If, at this point, you don&#39;t instinctively distrust the government (especially the US government) at least a little, then you really aren&#39;t paying attention, now, are you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no free press in America.  If you have not been threatened with death or lost family members, you can rest assured that you are comfortably removed from an ability to accurately describe reality.</p>

<p>There are plenty of retards who never concern themselves with reality.  Probably 20-25% of the population.  Another 10% or so see the game as rigged (Ron Paul supporters, etc.) but still buy into the idea of a free press through cointelpro operations like Alex Jones.  The large majority keep their heads down because everything is monitored.</p>

<p>Along the lines of this particular thread though, a friend of mine was special ops back in the 90s.  His unit found Kony on multiple occasions and was given stand down orders.  In other words, Kony was a western agent.  Now he is the pretext for invasion of Africa and the seizure of Chinese/Russian assets there in preparation for thermonuclear WW3 to head off a population which is awakening to its masonic masters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Plus, what a PR nightmare this has been for US forces in Afghanistan. It doesn&#39;t make sense to perpetrate a massacre to kill a few &quot;informants&quot;. They would&#39;ve just used a drone and claimed collateral damage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Fair Play</p>

<p>2) Conjecture. There would be many better ways to do it that this elaborate scheme.</p>

<p>3) Rests on #2 being true. reports of &#39;maybe more than one assailant&#39; aren&#39;t the same as &#39;confirmed reports of up to 20&#39; - I&#39;d be interested to know where your friend who doesn&#39;t go on the internet got this figure from, or was it pulled out of his arse?</p>

<p>4) Conjecture - they&#39;ve already released his name and could&#39;ve kept it quiet / private from the start if they wanted to.</p>

<p>5) Conjecture</p>

<p>6) Is nothing out of the ordinary, foreign citizens and their families are compensated for any loss (the article I read the other day stated there are guidelines for the amounts)</p>

<p>How does your friend who isn&#39;t on the net come up with all of this? or is he one of the people who fits the situation to their conclusion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Extremely unlikely. Weigh the cost to USG in money, goodwill, and prestige against the supposed benefit of 20 dead afghan insurgents. Following on the heels of korans burnt, and urinating on corpses, it is almost unimaginable that this would have come from above... I don&#39;t see smoke here... Especially when the stress and trauma, pstd, make a much more believable modus operandi. Another post mentions this  sergeant was deeply indebted before joining the army (unconfirmed) circumstantially points to a weak character in the accused... My two cents. I don&#39;t have sources, I&#39;m not going to argue with anyone, draw your own conclusions etc.</p>
