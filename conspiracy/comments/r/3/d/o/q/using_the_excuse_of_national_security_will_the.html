    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.</p></li>
<li><p>Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of &quot;need.&quot; The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.</p></li>
<li><p>Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.</p></li>
<li><p>Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.</p></li>
<li><p>Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.</p></li>
<li><p>Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government&#39;s policies or actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.</p></li>
<li><p>Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.</p></li>
<li><p>Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.</p></li>
<li><p>Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.</p></li>
<li><p>Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.</p></li>
<li><p>Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is currently happening. I would put the start of the transformation at the moment Kennedy&#39;s head assploded. Transforming a &quot;democracy&quot; into a quasi fascist pseudo-democracy takes time.</p>

<p>I mean, shit. We regularly bomb or invade other countries - and coming this summer - we will have drone spy planes over US soil, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-02-06/unmanned-drones-share-faa-airspace/52994752/1">cleared by the FAA</a> and suddenly available for purchase by local law enforcement using federal (tax payer) based funds given to the local law specifically to buy second hand military equipment and shit like drone planes. </p>

<p>ALSO this summer your <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-57397452-261/riaa-chief-isps-to-start-policing-copyright-by-july-1/">ISP</a> will be alerting you when you are piracy bad! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement">SOPA, ACTA, FUCKSTICKS</a>, etc, all concerted efforts at killing the toobs! &quot;They&quot; are afraid of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring">American Spring</a> based on uncensored information and culture and a generally disgruntled population! <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/16/bilderberg-2011-tipping-point">COULD IT BE THE BILDERBERG CONFERENCE PLANNED ALL THIS SHITE?</a></p>

<p>If you are on this board, then you are probably as tinfoil hat as I am in regard to 9-11 - read Reichstag fire... The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnac#.22New_Pearl_Harbor.22">PNAC</a> - the connections between the Bush family and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">Business Plot</a> and fascism in Germany...fuck fuck fuck.</p>

<p>In short, yes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>On Nazi Germany:</em></strong></p>

<p>Germany lost the war, but fascism won.</p>

<p>Operation Paperclip should have never happened, no exceptions. Just following orders is not a pass to avoid charges. If you actively support evil you and it flourishes you are to blame for your actions. There is no lesser of two evils, evil is still evil. People today are actively supporting &quot;evil&quot; practices and most may not even be aware of it.</p>

<p><strong><em>Comments:</em></strong></p>

<p>In the public&#39;s eyes the globalist elite have no official nation, no official language, no official religion, no official political viewpoint, no official form of economic control. They will change their appearance/views to whatever suits them and advances their globalist plans. It is easy to say one thing and do another.</p>

<p>Reptilian Shape shifters do not exist in the physical sense, It is simply a metaphor for an actor. Those who change their role in politics or those who change their role in a falsified news story, it makes no difference.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the globalist elite do not have an official nation, language, religion, and or political viewpoint, form of economic control behind closed doors. Many will make the argument that they do indeed have an official viewpoint on each one of these.</p>

<p>They have a plan for most things. Whether their official financial sector may be london/new york, bank vaults in switzerland/vatican/fed, their religious sector/religion may be the vatican/israel/mystery babylon &amp; satanism, their rule of law/sector may be washington dc/pennsylvania/common law/admiralty law, their army be the us army/nato/un/mercenaries/pirates, their form of economic control may be communism/socialism/facism/cronyism, it makes no difference.</p>

<p>One can be a devout mormon who is running for the president of the united states on the outside, but really be a satanic zionist on the inside who is being put in place as head of the corporation by his puppet masters to give the false sense of change. They are just playing their role. Again, it doesn&#39;t make any difference.</p>

<p><strong><em>Solution?</em></strong></p>

<p>You may destroy one but they have a plan for another thing to take its place. They are not able to operate without support of their cause, knowingly or unknowingly. It seems the only way to stop this is not to support any lesser evil. Educate yourself and others. Everyone deserves a second chance at rehabilitation, don&#39;t discard someone because you think they are &quot;unworthy&quot; of your superficial constraints or too much of a &quot;sheep&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US already has torture and detention camps, secret military prisons.  Replace Jews w/ Arabs, Hitler with Shadow Gov&#39;t.  US already has Secret Police and monitors it&#39;s citizens.   US no longer has the Bill of Rights nor the gov&#39;t cares for the Constitution.  Assassinations on its own citizens, quelling of any form of dissent is already well known.</p>

<p>10-20yrs is optimistic but 5yrs ago would be pretty accurate.</p>

I think naziesque laws and communist laws are already in place, and I think they&#39;re not going to use them until the election season is over. so I recon if obama wins, we have until december, if its not the incumbent we have until january. all the laws are in place now, obama gets reelected he&#39;ll have no reason to hold back</p>
