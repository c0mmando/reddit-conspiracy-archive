I just finished watching War by Deception again a few minutes ago and it leads me to this... There are so many people involved in this cover-up. We&#39;re talking thousands. Why has NOT ONE PERSON involved come forward, through either guilt, or possibly for profit to admit what they know about 9/11? How can that many people continue to cover up what they know in good conscience? Is money that powerful? I don&#39;t have any, so I wouldn&#39;t know, but can we seriously believe that that many people could cover up something like this for the past 12 years, all for the sake of money? One of them MUST have a conscience? A burning need to tell the truth. I would like to think that people cannot be this evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure that it is thousands of people. </p>

<p>The biggest problem is rigging the WTCs with explosives. This is a highly specialized trade, and the few demolition experts who can do that probably know each other, have learned from each other and hired each other. It is hard to believe that the conspiracy</p>

<ul>
<li><p>trained or hired a (probably largish) team of rogue demolition experts without the other craftsmen noticing it</p></li>
<li><p>used untested new demolition technology for the biggest, most complicated job ever</p></li>
<li><p>could rely on the tight lips of that team, or, disposed of those people without making waves</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It is quite puzzling how anyone, even a sufficiently patriotic or evil agent, could honor the offer of blowing up the WTCs. That anyone must assume that the consequence of that deed is certain death, because Dick Cheney can&#39;t take any chances on that one. </p>

<p>Conversely, it is not even plausible that Dick Cheney and his minions can feel safe about the whole thing if twenty or so demolitioners are involved, because making <em>absolutely</em> sure that all of them disappear before even one of them smells a rat and blows a whistle is virtually impossible. I know nothing about clandestine warfare or organized crime or demolition, but the whole plan sounds extremely fragile and sensitive to d√©sastre. </p>

<p>It is obvious that the official model has serious plausibility problems, but so has the truthers&#39; explanation. I&#39;d be happy for any idea that sheds some light on this issue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No acrobatic talent, no muscle memory training, but my point here is that the controlled demolition biz is highly empirical and somewhat of a black art, because you can&#39;t learn it from a book. Physics plays a central role obviously, but the devil is in the details. You can&#39;t learn it all from a book or design it on a computer based on mechanical theory alone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>U.S. officials tell The Associated Press that they believe that <em>none</em> of the Navy SEALs who died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan had participated in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, although they were from the same unit that carried out the bin Laden mission.</p>

<p>(my italics)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a defense expert, but elite soldiers are not usually stupid. If you are asked to blow up a famous skyscraper in the center of NYC, you must assume that you will end up dead eventually. I find your explanation rather unconvincing. </p>

A large part of it being 9/11. Why have none of these people come forward with what they truly know? They left and have all kept their mouths shut ever since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there is this thing in psychology where a lot of witnesses can actually hurt somethings chances of being reported.  If one person sees a crime they see it as their obligation to say something.  When lots of people see it nobody knows who&#39;s job it is or who&#39;s &quot;place&quot; it is to do something about it, and generally nothing is done.</p>

<p>Also psychopaths.  Psychopaths don&#39;t care.  It is beyond them.  When doing things like this only hire psychopaths.  Very important, and there are plenty around.  They are in business, they are in law enforcement, they are in criminal organizations, they are all over.  Recognize them, select them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are a few things at play here. As someone else mentioned, compartmentalization is a huge factor. But there is also the fear factor. I&#39;m referring to the people who would be in the know, like the guys watching the radar blips at NORAD. Those guys are making 50k to 60k a year. Are they really going to say something? Think about it. Those guys just watched the federal government ram 3 airplanes, and attempted a 4th into buildings, killing 3000 people in broad daylight while the television cameras are rolling. Are those guys going to risk the lives of their families?</p>

<p>The media certainly isn&#39;t going to say something either. All the media outlets are partly owned by corporations that profit from war. 9/11 meant war and they knew it. War means money. Are those guys really going to come out and do the honest thing and lose billions of dollars in contracts?</p>

<li><p>You&#39;re transferring your personal morals/ethics on to those involved. You may have a conscience, but it doesn&#39;t mean those who took part in the planning and implementation do. Some people will do shocking things for money or basic sociopathy/psychopathy. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, money is that powerful. So is fear. The ones that profited directly, the ones that made the big bucks won&#39;t talk obviously, the bottom-feeders that managed or tried to steal crumbs that fell off the table <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/sept11/stockputs.html">(2.5 million in unclaimed trades anyone?)</a> won&#39;t either because they know they wouldn&#39;t make it to the courthouse steps or TV studio if they tried to profit from snitching. Btw, wasn&#39;t there some guy who spoke about 9/11 plans he heard in jail or something like that? Maybe some have come forward, but you know, <a href="http://listverse.com/2011/08/18/top-10-witnesses-who-died-suddenly/">odd things happen to people that were in the wrong place at the wrong time.</a></p>

<p>Conscience? People have done worse things and you see them smiling beatifically in TV or feigning surprise when exposed and jailed. Maybe, maybe there are some manuscripts being written right now, some Word documents or somber self-made video confessions to be put in safes and security vaults, as <em>insurance</em> or some kind of twisted legacy. Maybe decades from now, a son, an inheritor, an executor, a librarian will find something odd squirreled away and make historic headlines. Maybe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most that are involved in the &quot;cover-up&quot; believe they are only covering up government incompetence and failure, not a staged terror event.</p>

<p>Most people are not naturally skeptical and believe what their authorities tell them.  We&#39;ve been conditioned since birth to trust the government.  There&#39;s a huge psychological barrier to even question the official story to begin with.  So when they personally know something that doesn&#39;t jive with the official story, then it&#39;s easier to dismiss it as incompetence.</p>

<p>Also there would only need to be maybe a hundred people actually &quot;in the know&quot;.  There was certainly agents on the inside working to counter any response by those not involved.</p>

<p>And computer systems were probably hijacked by remote access. (Ptech)  So there&#39;s no telling what information FFA and Norad were actually getting compared to what was actually happening.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That barrier is purely social. I&#39;ve noticed that disaffected groups in America are much more likely to disbelieve the official story than the comparatively affluent majority groups (those that directly and immediately benefit from towing the line). This is because the disaffected have dealt with and been more directly affected by government malfeasance, and perhaps have more experience with it&#39;s need to cover up it&#39;s problems with lies and misdirection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Double think, as well as a brilliantly executed deception. Patsy or not, &quot;al quadea&quot; was technically involved in the &quot;attack&quot;. It&#39;s easy to believe the official story when its forced down the worlds throat so hard. Also, financial/job ruin, being labeled A nut etc is pretty good reason not to speak out. Their entire structured world depends on the official story. Plus whatever benefit they&#39;re getting from it currently surely helps. It&#39;s a secret club and you ain&#39;t in it - GC</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually very simple, more simple than people make it out to be.</p>

<p><strong>The government is filled with sociopaths.</strong></p>

<p>That sounds like a flip statement, but think about it. During the Bush era, what was he constantly doing in the background? Appointing heads of government agencies. Remember the DOJ scandal? When they were requiring loyalty oaths? Did you know that was PLAN B to replacing DOJ employees en masse? Do you think this structure went away when Obama got in office? What was Obama&#39;s response to every question about his experience level? That he would &quot;listen to his advisers&quot;. And he has. Which is why he&#39;s just a better spoken Bush in policy respects. </p>

<p>Plus, there&#39;s the killings. Not of Middle Easterners, of those few people who DO come forward. You don&#39;t hear about them because they&#39;re not all as smart, connected, or lucky as Sibel Edmonds. Some of them have family. Some of them love the benefits the Government has given them more than life itself, (especially the part where we blame poor black mothers for being the preeminent drain on your public coffers) and some of them are just total narcissist True Believers that convince themselves every day that the end justifies the means. There was a story building in 2008 about the HUNDREDS of whistleblowers that were waiting for 21 Jan 2009 (Bush out of office) to come forward with their stories. Much like the public, they assumed that BUSH was the threat. They found out instead with Cheney&#39;s death squads that it&#39;s the GOVERNMENT, and the lead puppet doesn&#39;t matter. Just like a lot of Obama supporters are now finding out. </p>

<p>As far as administration of a cover-up, well, that&#39;s easy. Warrantless Wiretapping wasn&#39;t for the TERRORISTS, you ninnies. It was to find out every last speck of dirt on lawmakers, secretaries, legal paiges, to get everyone in the pocket of the shadow government apparatus. Once you know enough about a person you can easily control them. And if that person is a part of a rigid government structure with strict penalties for doing anything outside of procedure, then you can reliably predict responses to your planned action and work out contingencies for any unforseen variables. </p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m kind of amazed that people have a hard time believing this, since this is the PRIMARY function of government, even when not engaged in cover-ups. It&#39;s a natural extension to use the SOP of government to cover up the litter box of private policies. We have think tanks working on &quot;what if&quot; situations all the time. That&#39;s how PATRIOT Act was ready to go before anyone could even understand where it came from, that&#39;s how we had plausible Iraq invasion plans with no intel, and that&#39;s how we couldn&#39;t find bin Laden living 20 feet from a Pakistani military base. </p>

<p>We live in an inherently sick society. People are going to have to accept that if we want to change it. But for every one that knows that, there are 25 that claim America is the Greatest Nation on Earth while ignoring what is done in their name. </p>

<p>See, there are sociopaths in the public too. And the media outlets use them to catapult the propaganda, telling the rest of us that we believe what sociopaths believe. And that if we don&#39;t, we&#39;re uncool, ugly, communist, socialist, basically un-American.</p>

<p>They get you early when you&#39;re a kid by getting you interested in following fads and trends that your by-chance picked classmates are following, and then it naturally extends into adulthood, training you how to be a good consumer and how to stomach working for a sociopathic business structure.</p>

<p>The 9/11 coverup is perhaps the best demonstration of America&#39;s inherent mental warfare. As they fight them over there, so do they fight us here. This is already a Global conflict. Our only effective weapon is information, so stay informed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of good comments here, only thing I can think of to add regards coming forward to the press.... Imagine you were one of the lower or mid level types involved... you put together facts and decide to go public. Most media companies are infiltrated at the highest levels. If I ran one of these companies, here&#39;s what I&#39;d do: </p>

<p>I&#39;d be very friendly and do everything possible to gain your trust. I&#39;d help formulate a plan to release your information. I&#39;d lie about having others in the wing and that you are part of a consortium of people wanting to get the truth out. I&#39;d stall and find out everything you knew. I&#39;d find who else you may have shared this information with. And once I was certain I had everything, I&#39;d pull the rug out from under you. At this point, the roundup would occur, you&#39;d either get arrested, coerced into defeat or suicided. Any others that may have been involved would get similar treatment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the kind of person who would ever do anything of that nature, but sadly, I think I&#39;d be very good at it.
In the long run though, I don&#39;t think this occurs often, because anyone involved in these types of activities have no privacy whatsoever. As a regular citizen, my email, phone calls and all online activity is copied meticulously to servers within the NSA and Googleplex. I can&#39;t imagine the level of oversight directed onto those within fragile positions of government, finance, industry and the war machine. They&#39;ve got eyes and ears on all of these people; if any of them do anything out of the ordinary, it&#39;s over for them and their families.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason no one has come forward is because the scenario that is usually presented by conspiracy theorists is fictional, and ridiculous. It didn&#39;t happen. There are only two thing we can be sure about concerning the 9/11 truth -- most of the hijackers were Saudis, and Israel&#39;s spy and murder organization, Mossad, knew about the attacks in advance.</p>
