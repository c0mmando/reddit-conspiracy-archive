    <div class="md"><p>I have strong reason to believe that Wikileaks themselves are on-the-level - my family in Australia grew up friends with Julian Assange and apparently he&#39;s been a counter-authoritarian since he was about 10 years old.</p>

<p>Who knows how accurate the Stratfor memos are, though, even if Wikileaks is on the level and doing the best job they can?</p>

<p>I was personally fairly sure that Bin Laden had been dead for years when the US government reported that they&#39;d gotten him.  Now I&#39;m not so sure, but I&#39;m also not sure he died when they said he did, or that they really buried his body at sea, or indeed much of anything.</p>

<p>The one thing I think we can say for sure is that Bin Laden is definitely dead, and was by the time they announced that he was dead.  The USG is pretty stupid, and pretty dishonest, but I don&#39;t think even they would be dumb enough to announce Bin Laden&#39;s death unless there were absolutely sure he was dead - imagine the embarrassment if he then popped up with a video!</p>

<p>Did that raid kill OBL or was he dead, perhaps long dead?  There just isn&#39;t enough information to answer this.</p>

<p>If he was killed by that raid, I&#39;m not surprised that there are no pictures floating around the internet.  If you remember, the USG has had six years since the Abu Ghraib photos came out to figure out how to deal with cameras.  </p>

<p>Based on guess-work and some information that&#39;s been floated to me, it&#39;s likely they&#39;re doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Everyone on &quot;sensitive&quot; operations is electronically &quot;swept&quot; for unauthorized gadgets before they start.</li>
<li>Soldiers on sensitive operations now have helmet cameras that automatically record and transmit.</li>
<li>All this material is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganographically</a> marked so that even if you edit it, they have a good chance of detecting.</li>
<li>They also have very good image matching software so even if you rewrite all the bits and crop they can still match your stolen photo to the source and probably catch you that way.</li>
<li>Everybody involved has been threatened to within an inch of their lives.  If you release unauthorized photos, you&#39;ll be charged with espionage and spend decades in a military prison;  if someone in your unit releases unauthorized photos and you knew anything about it, you&#39;ll also be charged with espionage; even if you didn&#39;t know about it at all, you and everyone else in your unit gets busted down to Latrine Private.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the deliberate side-effects of the persecution of Bradley Manning  (a <em>real</em> hero) is that people who might be tempted to have done something to get the information out are now justifiably terrified to think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very confusing situation we have here. So my understanding is that all the information from Stratfor is considered by the majority on here to be complete misdirection? I feel we have already passed the point where the gov just shotguns information out there at such a level to completely dilute any possible leads. I know some here feel they have the ability so sift through it all but it&#39;s a full time job. If you ask me the disinfo agents have effectively won. How can the average person possibly have a life and at the same time spend the amount of time needed to make sense of this deliberately complex mess. It helps to trust a source to sift for you, but as many have stated already you must listen to all sources to get an accurate picture. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so clear.  We can be getting misinformation from the Stratfor releases in several different ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wikileaks edits it or makes it up wholesale.</li>
<li>Stratfor deliberately fed Wikileaks this packet, including selected misinformation.</li>
<li>The government deliberately fed Stratfor selected misinformation out of distrust for them.</li>
<li>The government and Stratfor were fed misinformation by some third party.</li>
<li>Correct information got garbled by an honest mistake, editing or data error during any of the transmission steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, I&#39;m going to just discount 1 out of &quot;personal information&quot; but reasonable minds might differ on this issue.</p>

<p>As for 2, I think Stratfor is just too stupid - I am inclined to rule out 2 almost entirely.  The memo release makes them look like idiots, and I don&#39;t think these guys would be devious enough to have everyone laugh at them to accomplish some obscure counter-espionage effect.  I&#39;m prepared to argue this point, even!</p>

<p>3, 4, 5 - these sources of information - US government, third-party, actual errors - are almost certain to have occurred.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that Bin Laden had been dead for years before the supposed operation.  It would make perfect sense for US government counter-intelligence to plant a lot of these &quot;body moved from carrier&quot; emails in various places that they suspected might have particularly weak security - because if you believe that Bin Laden&#39;s body was not buried at sea, you are forced to accept that they had his body in the first place...</p>
