       Without knowing much about the guys private life it's difficult to say. There is something 'not right' about him, the Kony screening video is just weird, listent o the way he speaks. and this

       Not really. There are no recreational drugs that produce breaks like that. LSD has been known to cause schizotoxic individuals to go full on schizophrenic. That isn't schizophrenia. Perhaps with enough sleep deprivation from meth use one could lose their shit like that, but people don't just start staying up for days out of the blue. You kind of work up to that, a downward spiral if you will. What drug do you think he got
       <em>

       Okey dokey. I didn't take recreational drugs and have a psychotic break. You know what happened better than I do, random guy on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I don't know what I took; a guy I knew handed me a water bottle with a little bit of whisky at the bottom of it and I stupidly drank it, I've been assuming there was probably LSD or MDMA in it, but I guess I'll never know. A few days prior to that I did a bunch of whippits, which I'd never done before; I've been thinking that may have had something to do with it. I spent the next three weeks in two different mental hospitals. I'm pretty sure I wasn't tripping for three weeks straight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless; its just an assumption that they guy was on drugs. Whatever caused it, the guy is pretty clearly experiencing psychosis. This is definitely something I could see someone doing in such a state.

       Okay, let's use this example. You took an unidentified drug given to you by a guy, whose motives for giving this chemical to you gratis are unclear. I'm sure that is exactly what happened to this poor bastard. Now we just need to find out who gave it to him and what his intentions were. Which is sort of what I have been saying.

       No, my point is drugs can cause psychosis. If you don't think that's the case, you just don't know what you're talking about. To assume people don't just take drugs because they want to, you also don't know what you're talking about. When you take a drug for the first time, you don't know what it'll do to you, and you can certainly have a terrible response to it like I did. Unless there's some evidence of foul play, I don't really see a reason to think the cause of this event goes beyond that.

       So you think this person was just experimenting with drugs, as his age, with his connections and funds? Like he's some college kid at spring break with no life experience and ingesting anything handed him, like yourself?  What ever comes out about this just remember that he is suffering from Dehydration, and Malnutrition. If that changes in the slightest, whatever story they tell you, you will know for sure that they lied the first time and every other story is suspect.

       I can think of quite a few compounds that might produce this behavior. I just don't want to list them, as I wouldn't want anyone to experiment on their own. A lot of these aren't even regulated. However, no one uses these for fun. I would say the same for PCP. I know of people that do consume it on purpose, but this man is not even close to being one of those people.

       You're an idiot. If recreational drugs couldn't cause these symptoms then why is there a video right there in the OP where someone acts the exact same way after taking recreational drugs? You don't know what you're talking about.

       Show me a video of someone that isn't living in a CIA created drug ghetto willingly smoking PCP. Show me a video of someone that isn't black willingly smoking PCP. By the way, where do you think Dip&amp;Fry got their drugs, and what do you think they know about them? I doubt they call it PCP, I doubt they know what PCP is.

       It doesn't matter if Dip &amp; Fry know the chemical composition of PCP, they obviously know its effects. Free will exists!

       Yeah and of course you don't believe me. LOL. Is that how it works? You only accept the information that fits into the worldview you already have? Dude I've smoked PCP so many times. I've done MANY drugs. People like me exist.

       something strange is going on here.  the big red flag is how IC's proposed solution to the Kony "problem" was U.S. military intervention.

        eason #10: Invisible Children is funded by a core of notorious right wing donors including the Discovery Institute, which Bruce Wilson fingered in a March 11 Talk 2 Action piece as the leading funder of efforts to promote the replacement of biological sciences in schools with "intelligent design,"along with the Caster Foundation and the National Christian Foundation, all prominent backers of anti-gay referenda, politicians and initiatives in the United States and around the world. The Ugandan regime of Yoweri Museveni is a favorite of theirs for having passed legislation making it a criminal offense to be gay, punishable by a life sentence.  Credible African journalists like Keith Harmon Snow have also alleged that Invisible Children's white and male  leaders have direct personal connections to US intelligence agencies.

       &lt;-- watch this for about 4 minutes.  his lead takes us to the Enough Project and the Center for American Progress, the two organizations that have been pushing this Kony agenda so hard in the last few weeks.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Clooney was also accompanied by John Prendergast of the ENOUGH Project which is a self-described sister organization of Kony 2012. Enough was formed in 2007 as an offshoot of the Center for American Progress, the neoliberal “moderate dems” organization headed by a former Obama adviser and DC lobbyist. Prendergast isn’t just an advocate for the poor peoples of Africa. He has a much more… political background, shall we say.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prendergast is the former Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council. He served in the Clinton State Department under now UN ambassador Susan Rice and in 2001 he became Special Adviser to the President of the International Crisis Group on Africa issues. The International Crisis Group is a neoliberal globalist institution pushing regime change all across the globe at any cost to the people who happen to be living there at the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also of note, Prendergast has won such prestigious awards as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award and the  U.S. State Department Distinguished Service Award. Can you imagine a moral courage award bearing the name of Lyndon Baines Johnson? Why not rename that one to the “Shoot Your President in the Back and Hand Over the Country to Oil Men and Bankers” award? Or better yet the “Bloody Coup” award for short?
       </p>
       <p>
        What Clooney and his pack of Kony 2012 CFR/ICG propagandists were doing in congress was asking them to support a piece of legislation that will impose serious sanctions on Sudan (not South Sudan mind you where they actually killed thousands of their own people and burned as many as 7,000 villages less than a year ago) and set the ball in motion for yet another bloody regime change for control of oil reserves and pipelines.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       the major scandal here appears to be in the fact that the U.S. backed the genocidal Sudanese government, while they used Kony as a scapegoat, for decades.  this seems to be just an expansion of that.

       I've seen people lose their shit like this from recreational drug use and from totally random psychotic breaks, triggered by nothing. Seen it in real life I mean, not on the internet. Sometimes it just happens. I've also tripped out pretty hard myself from PCP as well as DXM and Ketamine which are both pretty hardcore dissociatives like PCP, and I don't think it's fair to say the symptoms indicate PCP or dissociative use. They really don't. The similarity between these videos is pretty funny, kind of remarkable really. I made the connection myself when I first saw the TMZ video, I was familiar with the PCP video already. Me and my friends were joking about it before we saw anyone on the internet say anything about it. However the most I can say about the similarity between the videos is that it's just coincidence. I have no reason to suspect anything weird here.
