       The state of Michigan has officially declared war on family farmers. Bakers Green Acres raises pigs in a humane way. This evidently creates a competition threat to the pork industry, and the government-sponsored mega-corporations can’t have that, so look out small family farmers, here comes the state of Michigan to correct the problem by declaring any pig NOT the right color to be “feral” even if it is raised on a farm and eats at the family dinner table. Bakers Green Acres is fighting back. After all, they really have no choice. It is either that or face the mass killing of their livestock at the hands of the Michigan pig police and the ruination of their farm and livelihood.

       The US Political Establishment does not want anyone to be Self-Sufficient. Regardless of the rhetoric, authentic sustainable living will be fought tooth&amp;nail by those very regulators that preach on and on about population growth and  "Sustainability" (read:regimentation). Genuine sustainability is antagonistic to the regulatory revenue streams and the behavioral/nutritional control schemes that have been established. Farming is about Husbandry with Earth, not about the regimented uniformity of food.

       This really upsets me. I grew up in Michigan and my whole family lives there. One of the special treats I remember growing up is when a family member or friend of the family would slaughter a pig and give fresh meat to all their friends/family. Fresh ham during the holidays, and fresh eggs with fresh bacon for breakfast.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is obviously purely a form of control. Being from Michigan, if there's 2 things the residents there love: Meat, and Shooting things. If they want to get rid of these "extra" wild pigs, let the citizens take care of it. Hell, if I lived there, I'd be out pig hunting right now.

       While the hog they are raising are not "feral" but are the same breed/genitics as wild/feral hog that are causing mass landscape and farmland destruction when left on thier own in the wild. This is big problem in the southern states now. Feral hogs have an open season here, with no limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the population of these hogs should be controlled, but the government has no right to tell them what to do on their own property and under control.

       how OP and most commenters here so far denounces "Michigan DNR" (code for "Big Gub'mint") but
       <em>
        not a single mention
       </em>
       of who rules Michigan:  the DNR and all of Michigan government is ruled by
       <em>
        Republicans
       </em>
       and they are staging a coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governor Snyder asserts that
       <em>
        he has the right to negate elections, replace officials, declare "emergency powers", seize public assets, sell public property to his cronies without any bid process or public input or oversight
       </em>

      <p>
       But he's a small-government Republican!  There must be some mistake!  It's a liberal plot!  Lies!  Can't be a Republican!  Get rid of the DNR instead, which worked fine for 50 years until Republican Snyder &amp; his wrecking crew took over!

       Why aren't more people concerned by and following this issue?
This issue effects every American who eats﻿ food. Today it's pigs of a certain color and phenotype, with or without ears &amp; tail (no joke-look it up, that's what the Michigan DNR put in their declatory ruling), maybe tomorrow it will be what kind of apples we are "allowed" to have and grow...  With an 'ISO' Invasive Species Order in hand the DNR becomes the agency in charge of the so-called invasive species. It can be pigs or plants but once the agency (DNR) writes up the document defining a particular plant or animal as an "invasive species" it's game on for DNR.

       while i do think that laws such as this are an issue, its important to remember both sides of the story...the story that was not included here. i am not saying its at all the farmer's fault, however there could be more to this situation than we know.

       that said, political power is manipulated all the time by corporate lobbying and as a michigan resident, stories such as this do alarm me.
