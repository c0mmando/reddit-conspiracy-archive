        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It all started when I submitted a story to worldnews about a Palestinian kid who got shot in the face by Israel. </p>

<p>The story made the front page of r/worldnews but then suddenly vanished. I asked the mods why, but just  got a reply from davidreiss666 telling me to take the story elsewhere.</p>

<p>Later on r/wtf I noticed a a picture from that same story was at #2 on that subreddit. Then that too vanished. The mods, including Lynda73, where far more helpful - by being taken in Palestine the image  violated the &#39;no politics&#39; rule.</p>

<p>Later I noticed another poster elsewhere  had commented that his post about a militant zionist gang had had been deleted from TIL. One reply, from the same Lynda73, had said that was because of TILs  &#39;no politics rule&#39;.</p>

<p>On checking the TIL rules it does say no politics, but it also says that &#39;historical politics are fine&#39; and I believe the story posted to TIL was from the 1940s. </p>

<p>So it seems to me that their is abuse of the &#39;no politics&#39; rule to get certain posts removed. As for my original story. I tried posting the story a few times as messages to the mods met with no reply. Finally the story got posted again, it made it to the front page again and got deleted again. This time my question asking why, was met with a ban.</p>

<p>I think their is something very fishy going on, and stories pertaining to Israel are being censored. In some cases by misuse of the no politics rule, and in other cases my abusive mods. I believe the mod responsible in my case was davidreiss666, who was the same mod accused of getting the TIL poster censored and also banned.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: Noticed that now when I try to post i get this message &quot;Looks like you&#39;re either a brand new user or your posts have not been doing well recently. You may have to wait a bit to post again. In the meantime feel free to check out the reddiquette or join the conversation in a different thread.&quot;</p>

<hr/>

<p>Here is a link to the version that finally got posted after another mod intervened</p>

<p><strong>Update this story has since been banned/filltered.</strong></p>

<p>I agree with you on this one, I have no love for religion or tradition.</p>

<p>Yet you are completely wrong comparing these two. The Shabbat Goy is not held in contempt (except for religious zealots, maybe), neither he is cynically used, he&#39;s well aware of the purpose he serves and is compensated for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is worrying and something I&#39;ve noticed as well.  A lot of sub reddits have the rule &quot;no politics&quot;.  Ok fine, but then that leaves us with just a few sub reddits to post this stuff in.  Those reddits left are r/politics r/worldnews etc...but they have some shady stuff going on it them like you have noticed.</p>

<p>So the stories get pushed out of all other reddits by the &quot;no politics&quot; rule, and into easily controlled reddits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way: the more r/conspiracy and a handfull of others become the only non-censored, non-Zionist-certified outlets, the more people will come this way to get an understanding of what&#39;s really going on.</p>

<p>What the pathetically weak and conformist totalitiarian mind doesn&#39;t undertand is that life and truth will find a way. Totalitarian movements and their ideologues think they can combat truth and reality with censorship, coercian and force, but always fail in the end.</p>

<p>If the Internet was around in the Commie and Nazi era, there&#39;s no way they would have gotten as far as they did. In fact, its amazing the Zionists have gotten as far as they have, given the rise of the Internet, but they had already penetrated the establishment well before the Internet got so big, so we are seeing the full force of that penetration today.</p>

<p>But just like the Commies and Nazis, they will inevitably fall to life, truth and reality.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t agree with the policing that you have encountered, I doubt it was nefarious. Israel gets <strong>plenty</strong> of bad press here on reddit. Some of the mods just want to avoid the drama that comes with anti-Israeli topics.</p>

<p>Nowhere does the OP say that he was lied to or presented with falsehoods. He was asked to take his business elsewhere, which depending on the context, can be a raw deal but is not inherently wrong. </p>

<p>As for conforming to standards...if I run a website is it wrong for me to ban people who spam the forums with ads and child porn? Is it wrong for me to request that guests who visit my home use the toilet to defecate versus shitting on my living room floor? It is all in the context and you seem to have taken it to an extreme from which there can be no resolution.</p>

<p>And what is <em>your</em> idea of reddiquette? That is something that will vary greatly from person-to-person, from sub-to-sub. It is to be expected.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, it will vary due to standards. One mod will feel that removing a post that comes from a unaccredited news source is fair, another will not. One mod will feel that removing posts that are likely to inflame the community or bring unwanted attention is valid, others will not. Some mods will adhere to a very rigid set of rules when posting and think it is valid, others will not. I am not defending this exact instance that the OP is involved with, but the reality is pretty damn gray. </p>

<p>I also want to stress this again - you can make your own community. You are not obligated to visit their subs, subscribe to them, post content to them, or vote on submissions that are found in them. </p>

<p>If the OP truly has a desire to share content that he feels exposes violence, doubles standards, and the history of certain agendas then he ought to make his own sub, or his own website, or continue to contribute valid content in other subs under their guidelines. It is not difficult, though at times frustrating (as all things are).</p>

<p>I feel that people here are <em>trying</em> to make this into a bigger issue than it is. </p>

<p>I never said you have no right to voice your opinion on their moderation techniques. I did say that this incident may not be nefarious, malicious, or corrupt. Though it may be exactly that as well. I implored the OP to seek further info from the mods as well. I did say that it is <em>their</em> sub, and they can moderate it as they please. You have no right to dictate it and they have right to force you to view it. That is as fair as anyone can be. <strong>FFS <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> even has rules!</strong></p>

<p>I do think that the majority of the folks here are actively fishing for boogie-men and conspiracies even though they may be none. I am willing to bet that the mods just did not want the JDL spamming their sub with bullshit due to an anti-Israel article popping up in it, or the articles were clear violations to their posting guidelines. One thing that may help is if the OP would post the links he tried to submit. </p>

<p>What is reddiquette? Your standards will differ from mine, and mine will differ from a mods, and so forth...Their is no set list of rules which are enforced and adopted by all. The closest thing are the laws that are enforced by the country in which reddit resides and operates. In other words, there is nothing that is violated.</p>

<p>Correctspeak.  The truth needs to rise to the top.  The establishment is using all of the black-hat tools of the trade to get their propaganda out there.  They control the media, they use shills on sites like this one to delete opposing and &quot;dangerous&quot; views, and promote party-safe views.</p>

<p>As warriors on the front line of an information war, we have to fight fire with fire sometimes to get the truth out there, and if that means playing by their rules, then so be it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, if we&#39;re playing &quot;name that logical fallacy&quot; invoking the Jewish Reptilian Alien Alliance would be poisoning the well, not a strawman. This is because I didn&#39;t actually say that you believed there was a Jewish Reptilian Alien Alliance, I didn&#39;t even mention it when truly challenging your perspective. I threw it in only at the end. But semantics don&#39;t really matter, I&#39;ll concede that it&#39;s inclusion was a logical fallacy and not a proper argument.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s focus on your actual statements then. Do you honestly believe that people are paid to remove/downvote certain articles about Israel from r/worldnews?</p>

<p>What&#39;s the criteria? Do they remove any which reveal too much? Any that are faintly negative? Do they have to be popular in order to qualify for censorship?</p>

<p>If you think mods are involved do you think they get paid off after becoming a mod or are there users who work towards being a mod just so that they can finally start really censoring articles which bash their paymasters?</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t that seem really silly to you? Israel has a lot of foreign and domestic issues to deal with. Why would they waste any of their hired government officials on browsing/censoring reddit? </p>

<p>Retarded strawman.  The people mentioning Jews have no evidence, and worse, their problem is not with Zionism or some belief system, but with <strong>Jews as an ethnic group.</strong>  This would be like if someone pointed out that the Klan hated black people, and your response was &quot;Oh, are blacks untouchable? Why do you want to silence the mention of them?&quot;  I mean, seriously, did you read this before your posted it?  </p>

<p>Fuck you.  There is no &quot;the jews&quot;.  That&#39;s the point of all this.  Jews are not an ethnic group that holds weekly meetings about how to further our agenda any more than white Christians are.  Your attribution of evil and selfishness to <strong>an entire fucking people</strong> is just proof of your own ignorance.</p>

<p>No Jew owes a goddamn thing to you.  No Jew owes <strong>you</strong> some action before you &#39;stop the hate&#39;.  Hate isn&#39;t the default, until you&#39;ve proven that you&#39;re worthy of being treated like a human being, and your implication that it should be for this one particular group you don&#39;t like is fucking disgusting.  </p>

<p>Sorry to say, but after reading tons of his posts I can confirm he IS in fact an antisemite. A real one. Not an israel-critic, not an anti-zionist - an antisemite. So your advice to him to not say &quot;jews&quot; cause it makes him &quot;look antisemitic&quot; is sadly wasted. He doesn&#39;t really care.</p>

<p>With you on this. It&#39;s the same mindset that blames all Muslims, blacks, Mexicans, etc. for everything. </p>

<p>The &quot;blame the Muslims&quot; mindset has permeated much of American culture, replacing the previous &quot;blame all the Communists&quot; mindset. Perhaps the ignorant find that life is easier for them by blaming one group alone for the world&#39;s ills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I&#39;m curious about something, and I thought you seem to be the perfect person to ask.</p>

<p>My grandmother was raised Irish Catholic. She is also antisemitic. Refuses to even say &quot;Jews&quot; - to her, it&#39;s &quot;Heebs&quot; or &quot;Kikes&quot;. I didn&#39;t know this until I was a teenager because my parents insisted that my grandmother never <em>ever</em> use language like that in front of me, but I found out one day when something happened. See, Grandma was adopted by some second-generation Irish farmers in rural Canada. My family didn&#39;t really know too much about her birth family except that her birth mother was one of those classic &quot;teenage girl in trouble&quot; sort of situations. One day, she gets a letter from a genealogist/lawyer saying that they&#39;re looking for a woman who fit Grandma&#39;s profile. After some back &amp; forth, it turns out that Grandma&#39;s birth family was looking for her. It seems that her birth mother&#39;s greatest regret in life was giving up her baby, so near her death, she told her other children that they have an older sister they never knew about. After some effort in dealing with what precious few records existed, they managed to track down Grandma.</p>

<p>Turns out, they&#39;re Jewish. By Jewish law (as far as we can tell), that means Grandma is also Jewish. You know, Jewish parents and all that. Kind of a sad situation, really - Grandma refuses to have anything to do with them, and aside from a few apologetic phone calls (she said some... unkind words), the two families never really talk. Not surprising, really - no shared family history or experiences kind of makes things difficult. Throw in the fact that the only tangible link we have with them actively refuses to even speak of them and even casual conversation is just awkward.</p>

<p>In your opinion, is my antisemitic, Irish Catholic grandmother who has never so much as looked at a kosher meal in her life a Zionist? My Catholic grandfather was a mechanic his whole life, and Grandma&#39;s highest-paying job was at a grocery store. Do you consider me saying that she has nothing to do with any kind of media conglomerate to be doing a &quot;hasbara dance&quot; (not sure what that means, but I can guess from the context)? Do you consider her a &quot;Jew&quot; as much as HorseSteroids&#39; girlfriend? What term would you use to describe my grandmother?</p>

Like I said, there were apologies over what she said (I don&#39;t even really know what that was), but realistically, I don&#39;t think anybody has any interest in pursuing anything more. They&#39;re a completely different family. Joining two different families is tough enough for married couples, and the only relation we have to them was an adopted infant back in WW2. An adopted infant who now has no interest whatsoever in anything of the sort.</p>

<p>No need for sympathy, either - at this point, it&#39;s little more to most of us than an interesting quirk in the family tree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This seems right. It&#39;s all screwed up, it can only remind me of what i posted here recently, about my dads theory that there are people who are actually employed to basically remove anti establishment / dangerous to the establishment, news and conversation from popular media such as reddit. From what i was told it does seem to take place in youtube, and i can imagine the same goes on here :/ </p>

<p>Thing is, we&#39;re confined to the &#39;conspiracy&#39; bit because so many people will dismiss people here as &#39;nutjobs&#39; and whatnot. =/ it ain&#39;t good</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? You really think that there are people who are <em>hired</em> to remove certain links from reddit, or videos from youtube. Who hired them? How do they decide what to remove? Are they given a list of current evil projects and told &quot;remove any posts that seem to know too much about our various schemes&quot;?</p>

<p>This seems to display the absolute worse combination of delusional grandeur paranoid fantasy.</p>

<p>... then again, maybe I&#39;m making this comment because the Jewish Reptilian Alien Alliance pays me to disparage anyone who seems to know too much ...</p>
