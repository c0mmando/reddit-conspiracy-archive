       They are working in "terrorist intelligence" which is pretty much spying for key words on the internet, and listening to phone calls. What I wasn't supposed to know is that these "terrorist intelligence" programs specifically spy on social networking sites. They told me they, and their team create false profiles, and even update fabricated information to see who runs to correct them, or who seems to have more info than they should. I asked if which social networking sites were targeted and I got the "That's classified". I asked about
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com">
        www.reddit.com
       </a>
       and I got a smile. I'm sure you've already suspected this, but I am confirming it. When I asked what happens to people that have been flagged their response was "Their information gets collected into a large data base.". That was that.

       Absolute scum, these lowest of the low, truly unworthy of belonging to humanity, crawling, miserable, wretched, fevered little filth with no purpose for existence other than the monitoring and subjugation of others. There must be something truly wrong with a person who behaves in this way; something foul must exist in the core of their being, whether they understand it or not. Like maggots feeding on the corpse of freedom, breeding and hatching into pestilent little flies that buzz around with compound CCTV eyes.

       You could be right. But for every reaction there exists an equal and opposite reaction, so if there are loving and nurturing people who want to help humanity reach a higher level of consciousness and awareness - there also exist somewhere people who embody the polar opposite. Its them I addressed. They have my pity more than my hatred. If I am to relax then I must acknowledge that they are a part of nature and life, but that leaves me with a conundrum: to accept what they're doing to other humans. This is the hard part.

       It's because the drive and passion of their own lives has dissipated.  Siphoned by the capitalistic machine that devours communities and morals.  I see it all the time, people with nothing to do in their life so they gossip about other people's lives.  They lack their own will and must parasitically bind their attention/focus on what you're doing because their life has lost meaning.

       Thanks man.

       Nice to have a bit of confirmation, I think we all knew it...

       A lot of the personalities I've come across on this subreddit have fit the bill perfectly. People whom seem obsessed to an unhealthy degree with smearing this community. I don't think it matters how much resources they pour into smearing alternative media, they are losing the war of information, as they could never, ever, compete with the billions of rational, loving, compassionate, human minds on the internet. And while it may be hard to see the love these days, it's still there, in the heart of man, and it can never be extinguished. It just takes a bit more to bring it out of people these days, but, I have faith, that when things are as bad as they can get, people are as good as they get.

       Funny, when I was growing up, the media always made a big deal out of the Russian Government spying on it's own people. That was a major distinction between our freedom in the US and their lack. Now spying on their own citizens is commonplace for the American Government. I really wonder where this is all heading?

       Your subconscious is very eloquent and subtle, some call it your inner voice, other call it intuition. Whatever we label this as, it happens in an instant, and most of us never listen to it.  I propose that our subconscious makes that determination instantly, and we just ignore it. Discuss.

       You're a nut kid. Any post about the Republicans may contain a reference to Paul. But they are not all about Paul. Submissions about Gold are not about Paul. In short, the whole world is not about Paul.

       It was fully deployed on reddit during aftermath of the wikileaks release of those videos of that photographer's death. That first two weeks or so, all of the threads on this topic were crawling with "proud American servicemen defending everybody from child-eating Islamic terrorists" and shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the US government isn't the only one doing it. Israel's made the news on this topic, as well.

       Wouldn't spying on reddit, as a US based company, specifically be DHS or FBI territory? Like demostic survallience has specifically been laid out in NDAAs since 9/11 as being the responsibility and under the authority of the FBI.

       so what do they do with this intelligence, stare at it? Unless you're looking at "subversive" websites from an IP in yemen, no channels exists for the Army to act against you on US soil, you'd be free as soon as someone tells the DoJ you're missing, if there is one thing you should know about federal baeurocracy is that they don't like having their toes stepped on (=less funding next FY).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this doesn't happen under the FBI or DHS (it does, usually on obvious targets) but the narrative you're painting doesn't make much sense.

       I can also attest that this is true, but don't voluntarily give up your voice for fear of surveillance!  Speak out when you want about what you want, and say what you mean.  Don't make references to violence, and stick to the facts as much as you can.  Most of all, if you find out that they're spying on you... Laugh in their face and do your best to explain to them just how silly and pointless their job is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually there is a person watching.  It's not always automated sock puppet bots.  When you
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       encounter the person, their job is to figure out whether your dangerous and move on to the next subject as quickly as possible.  Don't be overly hostile, but please do mention the bill of rights and ask which laws you have broken.  They're evasive, don't expect them to answer any of your questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll eventually draw back a little bit and let you "alone".  I had a stint where I was being investigated for merely emailing the whitehouse and speaking frankly about the disastrous war, privacy and trade policies these fools are clinging to.  I gave them my full name, telephone number, address, where I work, email... They opted for the surveillance, instead of replying to my pleas and insults (I was an asshole about it, but I never hinted at violence).
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, free speech can apparently cost you your 4th amendment under the PATRIOT Act.  (that's my best guess at what happened, anyway).  I knew that I was being watched for months before the confrontation with the agent, whoever he was, happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       They aren't sneaky about it at all.  They try a more blunt intimidation-style approach.  Unmarked cars passing by your house while your smoking on the front porch.... They slow down to a crawl in front of your house, then slam on the gas when they get past.  Hah!
      </p>
      <p>
       A pair of agents always parked down the street... Not hidden in any way.  Staring right at you.  Many times they'll get out of the car and go get something from the trunk if you stare back at them for too long... Then they get back in the car.  They're not going anywhere!  (I just look up at the sky and smile, then look back at them and smile)
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple people walking up to you out of seemingly nowhere, asking if you want to buy illegal drugs, or hook up with a prostitute.  This had never happened to me in my life until I said what I wanted to say to the whitehouse, now, I've got this shit coming out of the woodwork!  (haha!)
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that I don't know the severity of the damage they can do in my life.  Nobody does.  I said my piece, emailing the whitehouse several times per week for nearly 5 months.  I tore apart every policy which I view as a detriment to the wellbeing of humanity.  Everything from him caving to the Military Industrial Complex and launching a full-scale occupation of Afghanistan, to allowing children in Indonesia to assemble our shoes for less less than $2.00/day.
      </p>
      <p>
       My argument was that he should launch an offensive against these senseless wars and hold the corporations who are enslaving and extorting the rest of the world, and outsourcing our jobs ACCOUNTABLE!
      </p>
      <p>
       Nope.  You get spied on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully I can still fly?  I'm hoping to go see my dad this summer.  We'll find out.

       If you even did your research on JCM then you would know that he has a history of trolling people. Ive also looked into the guys name which has citations from social media books which means he makes money off of doing this. I even asked him myself how he got such a job and he told me through a University Job Fair. He deleted the comment quickly after posting it...

       I have done my research. I have seen you be antagonized by him, and his...what would you call them? I know of the subreddit created in your honor, or dishonor, if you will. I also have seen them accuse other people of being you. It doesn't diminish my suspicions much.

       They are stalkers and they are participants in a witch hunt that has been on-going for years. This, for the most part, is politically motivated. They are Ron Paul supporters and everyone on their "shill" list is opposed to Ron Paul. That's really what this is all about.

       The subreddit in question is owned by JCM, but I forget it's actual spelling and don't feel like wading into the cesspool of his comments to dig it up. There is a cow, a cartoon cow, black&amp;white. That's was it's most remarkable feature and all that I remember.

       I'm not sure how realizing the monetary aspects of JCM's activity equates to this conversation. I asked a simple question, all I wanted to know was how you end up in conversation with these people, or become the topic of theirs without your presence. You have nothing to prove, I'm just wondering.

       I'm not sure why you keep pushing this part of the discussion. It is interesting, and perhaps other people would like to know about it. I haven't brought it up, and keep ignoring it when you do. This isn't what I was asking about.

       My only question would be "why the Army?"
      </p>
      <p>
       r4ygun is right in that it seems an odd branch of national defence to use, but at the same time I've got to question his "the Army are incompetent goofs" rhetoric. Sure, your average Government library may be outdated, but if you seriously believe that the defence industry is struggling for technology, I doubt you know as much as you're saying you do.

       because the air force has an entire Command dedicated to cyberwarfare - Cyber Command.  it's right up there with USAFE, PACAF, or any other.

       It's really annoying when this happens, but he responded to my comment with:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I did not mean that they are incompetent, but let's be honest, the Army is by and large populated with grunts (by design). They exist mostly for their ground assault value, not intelligence services. If someone told me that one of our actual intelligence agencies, I would find this more plausible."

       I deleted them.  My comments were getting downvoted to negative numbers for no apparent reason other than me using logic and my past experience in the military to have a conversation. A friend and I had a laugh when I told him "don't ever refute a conspiracy in r/conspiracy. You will get downvoted no matter how much sense you make."

       Your subconscious is very eloquent and subtle, some call it your inner voice, other call it intuition. Whatever we label this as, it happens in an instant, and most of us never listen to it.  I propose that our subconscious makes that determination instantly, and we just ignore it. Discuss.
