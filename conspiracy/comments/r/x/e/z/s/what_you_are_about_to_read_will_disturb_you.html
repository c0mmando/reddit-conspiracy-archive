        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am a active military officer posting from a throwaway, and using a public computer to keep this from being tracked back to me. I have recently received a top secret briefing about project called Operation Navajo, in which the CIA is attempting a coup d&#39;etat in Mexico using Brazillian prefab mexican born leader with U.S. agenda. From what it sounds like there is going to be a pre-eminent event similiar to 9/11 that happens right before election and will threaten U.S. security with Mexico, Causing border security and military, then mexican citizens will be labeled terrorists and hauled to fema camps before being transported back to mexico on trains. This all sounds very outlandish and it has caused me health problems just thinking about everything I have absorbed I feel like I just have to get it off my chest. I am as close as I ever have been to taking the easy way out for I know that this will only jeapordize my position and ultimatly result in my death.</p>

I honestly think with increased border tension and a mexican government that is on the verge of legalizing drugs to combat the literal drug way in that country I can very much see the powers that be getting a bit nervous. Also its could have a double purpose of intimidation and fear mongering. With the instability going around the world our country could be trying to make an example. </p>

<p>Fee free to email me. My name and email address isn&#39;t hard to find. </p>

<p>Also note the US military is throwing &quot;whistle blower honey traps&quot; operations around at this time. They have five such operations running in the pacific ocean theater, the atlantic, close to DC and virginia, along the US gulf region and near SF. The goal of such operations is to create credible yet utterly faked narratives such as you describe to make soldiers in key positions leak false info, and then allow them to apprehend them and use excessive force as a public example. </p>

<p>So if you collect &quot;evidence&quot; of what you describe be very safe and have at least several exit strategies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>With apologies, I&#39;m not convinced The Company would give briefings on things like that below very high levels, nor to any branch of the military. It&#39;s just very bad OpSec when you are trying to overthrow a government. Further, I don&#39;t think they would classify it Top Secret clearance level. This scale of covert anti-government operation would be set up not to put details into the US government system that tracks classified information. Why? Because it could become a future embarrassment. Doesn&#39;t the CIA have its own compartmented system, anyway. Finally, I don&#39;t see an officer with high enough clearance to be briefed like this being a poster to Reddit. If you&#39;re real, I apologize.</p>

<p>this step could be incredibly difficult, and even then, they would have to rely on the assumption the information he provides is accurate just to narrow the search down, which might even just be false.
