       Patriot act, SOPA, H.R. 347 (Anti-Protest Bill), the list of attacks on the American people by a government, "by and for" the people, is staggering.

       Prisons are being sold to private companies, as long as the government promises to keep them 90% full. The newest, houses 2 million inmates.

       I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War. Terror. Disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you and in your panic, you turned to the now President in command Barack Obama. He promised you order. He promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.

       Congratulations.  You're "awake" now.  The problem still remains.  We must stay in our seats.  We must not cause disruption in the government's affairs in any way.  We must pay our bills and not express political views outside of the narrative our government endorses.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who say things like this online have had their phones tapped, their Internet activity, GPS location, emails, bank transactions, medical records, school and work history, friends and family compromised and datamined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wiretapping obviously isn't what it used to be.  Voice recognition software and Artificial Intelligence can flag you.  As a dangerous dissenter for any reason they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the secret interpretation of the PATRIOT Act that our Senators are shitting their pants about.  The DOJ considers political dissent as an act of terrorism now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody who publicly criticizes the government is investigated as if they are a potential terrorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why the PATRIOT Act must be abolished.  The 2001 AUMF must be abolished too. The NDAA 2012 must be amended immediately...
      </p>
      <p>
       We've got our work cut out for us.  We have to be smart and act in civil, nonviolent ways.  We have to demonstrate our purpose and show the errors of the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use truth as your weapon.  Fight until the day you die.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expose lies when you find them, and never bow to intimidation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fight for truth, peace, and justice.  I'm with you.  I'm going down with the ship, along with the rest of you, if we have to...

       If someone/something else (Patriot act, SOPA, H.R. 347, the list of attacks on the American people by a government) is causing "the problem", what can YOU do, other than complain and hope others join some cause?  Who wants to join any cause where the current members constantly complain and reek of victim mentality?  Even if you do somehow manage to get "enough" members, then what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, if you're currently causing "the problem", could you identify where the mistake's being made, and change to become the solution?

       Cute post. You make the error a lot of people make, that of blaming the victims. We are not the problem. We had no say in what happened. The belief that we control our governments is an illusion. We don't. The rich and powerful do what they want to do, and they manipulate us into going along with them. It's always been this way. The best we can hope for it a system that hold the rich and powerful accountable for their actions -- a set of laws set over the rich and powerful by which they must abide. This is no longer the case in the United States. The rich and powerful have decided that they can disregard the Constitution, and the rule of law. But this is not our fault -- this is their fault. They are to blame, and they need to be punished.

       Well they have the elections rigged, the media and congress are bought and paid for and lobby groups run the world with instructions from round table groups such as the builderberg group, the ADL and others. We were born into the perfect human trap and flawless secret one world government. It's real and it's been here for a long time. All you have to do is open your eyes and you will see. Welcome to the real world.
