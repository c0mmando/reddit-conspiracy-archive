       , Patrick J. Conway is going to be hosting an IAMA at Noon EST and he will stay around as long as interests remain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't downvote this because you aren't interested in religious history, there are many people here who are. I would like them to have a chance to see this so they can participate tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major religions of the world are confused because of this event Patrick will be detailing tomorrow,  History as we know it has been lead down a path of war and constant strife in an attempt to cover-up the truth of what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you hear what Patrick has uncovered in his 40 years of dedicated study, the evidence will speak for itself.

       Hi everyone. First post here, but I wanted to clear something up. I'm a scholar of the New Testament, versed in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. I have two degrees in New Testament from Princeton. I am a regular contributor to r/Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I and other scholars on r/Christianity were petitioning for was that someone with no degrees, no tenure, and no teaching experience in the field of religion, whose only religious-studies publication was through a press he owns and funds (basically, a vanity publication), not be referred to as a "scholar" in the AMA title. That's it. Period. None of us asked that his AMA be suppressed, or silenced in any way, just that he not be allowed to flagrantly misrepresent himself and his expertise. We are not seeking to censor, only to clarify the title to more accurately reflect the reality of his credentials.
      </p>

       There is no license, educational accomplishments, or other established criteria required to use the word "scholar" - it simply means someone who studies.

       That's true. On the other hand, creating an AMA saying you were a theoretical physicist when what you meant was you'd read a lot of Brian Greene books and knew some basic calculus, seems a little duplicitous. Am I wrong?

       Sure, it would be disingenuous - but that doesn't imply that I have the right to censor and control what he says on reddit.

       This is a community site, not a blog.  If the guy is lying, it's up to the community to discern that and downvote him.  You don't have a right to police information for everyone else.

       A degree and tenure do not make you a scholar.  Since you've labelled yourself as one with said credentials, you are probably aware that throughout history, many scholars had no tenure or degrees.

       This post hi-lights the importance of clarifying the title, at least in our minds. In a community already predisposed against religion (Reddit), this AMA might serve to confuse people about a number of important points:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         An academic, "scientific" study of religions, apart from practice of and devotion to those religions, exists in universities around the world. The perceived silliness of the subject matter does as much to tarnish the rigor and reality of those disciplines as the silliness of a lunatic's delusions does to tarnish the reality and rigor of clinical psychology.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are atheist scholars of religion, as well as scholars of religion that do not practice or affirm the religion they study. As such, they have no vested interest in its truth or success.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Criteria exist for the study of religion, history of religion, and religious texts which are very much like the heuristics employed in sociology, secular history (if there is such a thing), and study of non-religious classics and literature. It is not handled with kid gloves in the academy.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In a community that already feels that any study of religion is crack-pot and a waste of time, I think it would be detrimental to the general knowledge and perception of Redditors to get an experience of a religious "scholar" who confirms their worst fears, and leaves them confused about what the academic study of religion really means.

       Theist here. I wouldn't exactly say that it would confuse people and therefore we cant allow it, but isnt this the mentality of most christians? The blind faith mentality that just because someone says something about Christ and the way things are the they should automatically believe it. Now ive read a few books on the legitimacy of the biblical texts and teachings and challenged my faith, which some Christians see as heresy. I challenged it to the point that ive renounced my faith in an organized religion where open minded discussions and personal perspectives on God and his teachings is frowned upon and quickly silenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people wish to believe blindly thats their fault for not questioning what thay are told to believe. I was taught from a very young age to always ask "why", and when someone tells me to do something because God says so I ask why and 7 times out of 10 its turns into a circle jerk of "the bible says you should" and "God wrote the bible so its right. And don't think im saying all Christians because i know that doing so would be a fallacy.

       Hence why TurretOpera is asking for
       <em>
        clarity
       </em>
       of label, not censorship of material.  In short, I believe TurretOpera is stating that Patrick J. Conway does not in any way form what-so-ever represent the entirety of Christian doctrine/beliefs and the label should reflect this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never forget, a real Christian would not be blind in his or her faith: to do so would be out of fear and ignorance.  Our individual beliefs must be tempered in the fires of doubt and skepticism, with love and respect.  It must be able to wither the questions - otherwise how can it be the truth?

       Close, but it's not Christianity I'm concerned about (since Conway isn't, I don't think, specifically Christian). Rather, I'm conserned about what his calling himself a "religious scholar" might do to Reddit's already dim view of religious scholars, who are actually real academics with logical, peer-reviewed methodologies. Christianity only enters into it insomuch that having a needlessly dismal view of religious scholarship makes interacting with Christianity on the credible, logical basis, accepted by the accademy, even more of a hopeless prospect for most Redditors. The same could be said of its impact on the other religions Conway considers too, its just that, Reddit being a mostly
       <em>
        Occidental
       </em>
       phenomenon, most of the atheist Redditors are post-Christian, not post-Mayan or post-Muslim.

       Again, this is what I was talking about-most people assume a 1-1 correlation between being a scholar who studies a certain religion and having rabid devotion to that religion. This simply isn't the case. Is an oncologist necessarily a cancer victim or survivor, or a friend or relative of someone who is? I assume some may have become interested in that field for that reason, but the thing in no way follows logically. Also, while actually devoted Christian scholars have their biases, when they're publishing for the academy, they're required to conform to rigorous, secular rules too, such as:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dating based on the assumption that prophesy is impossible. If Jesus mentions the destruction of the temple in a book, it was written after the destruction of the temple. Jesus is not using his godhood to foretell the future. The commentary will not attempt to prove Jesus' godhood in any way.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No belief in the supernatural. You talk about other similar miracle stories in ancient culture, or about the source of this particular miracle story. You don't talk about  how Jesus must have gotten his power from God, or how blessed Paul was.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No tradition-as fact. Traditions are clearly labeled as traditions. We don't know who wrote Luke. We don't know how Thomas died.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In short, shocking though this may be, a secular historian writing about Jesus could cite a scholarly (i.e., works in Greek and Hebrew), non-devotional biblical commentary written by a Christian, like James Dunn, in a paper written for a secular historical society, and nobody would bat an eyelash, because the commentary treats the Greek text, treats the history, treats the tradition, and treats it all using the same objective, scholarly standards any historian or literary scholar uses to dissect any piece of history or literature that they do not have a religious devotion to, or as close as someone can reasonably be expected to get (bias always can, I guess, be detected at some level, somehow).

       Wow, this has turned into my own AMA, and I didn't want to, or mean to threadjack or bring this OT subject into this sub. I just wanted to make it known that OP, at least at the time of the first post, was not accurately representing the concerns of myself and the others from r/Christianity who were puzzling over this AMA title. We were concerned, because it poses the risk that everything I just posted might be obscured.

       He's right the classic 20th century theologian Garth Brooks stated that he would be as "high as that ivory tower your living in" yet he had many "friends in low places". There is truth in what this rabbit is stating!!!

       I should  have been a little more articulate and asked what could be more preposterous than; slaying 1,000 men with a chunk of donkey skull, causing dead fish to multiply, building a magic box for stone tablets because a talking bush and cloud told you to, or screwing your daughters while drunk in a cave after your wife has been turned into salt.

       Someday, most people will regard that as equally preposterous as so many of the stories of the bible. Right now, even the majority of the most "sophisticated" take it at face value, and sneer at those who suggest otherwise the way bible skeptics used to be sneered at.

       Remember when saying the earth was round could get you killed? I'm not saying i agree with the guy, but your reasoning is flawed and ignorant. You can't dismiss anything a person says just because it "sounds insane". If someone in 1950 said "in 60 years you'll have computers with touch screens you can carry in your pocket" you would say "that sounds insane! this guy must be wrong!". Keep an open mind, listen to what people say and make a judgement yourself...DO NOT silence a person because you don't agree.

       I absolutely agree with you, but let's take that idea you shared further and examine today's empire. In today's society, things within the realm of the occult, the metaphysical, and the mysterious are all very, "woo woo" and carry a large social stigma. I doubt that will matter much to anyone here, but how about the cultivation/manufacturing of mind-altering substances, specifically psychedelics? They REALLY don't want you to have that shit, even though it is (scientifically proven!) harmless. Have things really changed?

       I never said that politicians have changed. Or that those drugs should not be tested. In fact I gladly support the empicical testing of any subsatance that could be used to benifit mandkind. Hell, do this with religion and the spiritual stuff. Just don't expect to be let into the sciences until you can have empirical evidence to support your theory.

       The church holds the same positions on prohibition that the majority of the ruleing class holds.

       I'm sure you're going to have a few giggles by the time I'm done, but really "Empirical testing of spiritual stuff?" As an occultist, I find this statement incredibly baffling. Of course, those who practice workings typically record what works and what doesn't in an empirical sense, but what you are asking is absurd. The spiritual cannot be measured, it is infinite and words, theorems, or what have you will never be able to encapsulate it. In other words, it's an experiential phenomenon that can't be explained by science, and thus is so quickly and easily dismissed by many who will never care to experience it for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But think about the world we would live in if more people DID care to experience it themselves. Even in a completely atheist sense, (as in you don't subscribe to a theology) you can feel that incredible state if you just approach it with an open mind and stow your doubts for a moment. Science and spirituality (read:
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       religion*) BELONG with one another! It is the whole perspective. Science is casual understanding, spirituality is the oceans-deep knowing. And besides, don't we owe it to this miraculous Earth, our host organism, to treat our environment with sanctity and respect? To see it as it is -- truly divine? Science paints the world in such a materialistic, detached, colorless way. It's pretty sad stuff, man!

       This is the problem I've had with science since I was in like 3rd grade. I agree it has its place, and it's very useful, but it by no means grasps everything there is to know, and no empirical study ever will. I am not myself a practitioner of occult or mystic stuff, but I am well aware (based on experiences with LSD) that there is more out there than we trick ourselves into believing every day.

       See, you seem to have the same view that I do, but a huge block. When I say that it is not science, I mean because it is ridiculous to try and force the strict definitions that science requires on somthing as personal as spiritual health. Although I would call it mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I personally belive its more of how different ppeople think. Religion as a whole seems to be filled with people who focus on why we are different. Usually by saying how man is better, or worse, than some idea. Were as science seems to look more deeply at how we are the same. How everything works togeather, in a very broad, yet exact, way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religious people that I have talked to fail to see the wonder in the way I see the interconnection of everything, from the largest systems to the smallest. Science is truly the most hopeful way of interpreting the world.

       Let me reiterate by stating that I am not in favor of organized religions, as they seem very clearly to be geared towards controlling the populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that science is not exact, and it can never hope to be. There is chaos amongst everything. Science can help us to understand, but it leaves a gaping void in how we interact with the subtlety of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I further disagree with your point on how science looks deeply at how we are all the same. Sure, a lot has been established to debunk the theories revolving around race, but there is a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       dangerous idea lurking out there surrounding genetics. You hear it all the time, "Oh, it's in my genes, there's nothing I can do about it," and other such phrases of resignation. I am not a fan of slippery slopes, but ideas such as these are a fast track to some really horrible outcomes. I do not see science as a philosophy of unity. It is cold, calculating and intolerant. Plenty of comments that float around on this website are a testament to that.

       I know exactly what science is, thanks. It is how people interpret science, and the colloquial ideas that science impregnates into the subconscious of the populace that are dangerous. I am confident that genetics are real, but I am also confident that people have far more control over them psychologically/spiritually than they realize. Anyway, I'll let you take your ball and go home. Have a good evening :)

       To what extent?  You can't magically change your race for example, and is it pure coincidence that every faith healer thats willing to put their money where their mouth is proves to be a fraud or conjurer?

       That makes sense since it isn't a philosophy and isn't trying to be one, its just a method of understanding our reality in regards to observable phenomenon.

       When discerning between what is real and what is made up nonsense these are good qualities to have.  I'm not sure why you would feel the need to anthropromorphize science, though.

       This is just not true. After the initial spread ot Christianity(aka the fall ofhe Roman empire and the start of the holy Roman empire) the bible was written in Latin. Almost no one in empire, other than the wealthy (aka the church and royalty) no one could read or talk in Latin. It wasn't until Martin Luther(not king Jr) came around and translated the bible to the comon tounge that anyone could even attempt to read the bible. It was required to be read out loud in Latin as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the preacher then did was tell people what he had read, and what that meant. Even to the point where the church was selling the forgivness of sins, for both the living and the dead, when the bible explicitly states it is free.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I didn't have the time to go over a complete history of the middle ages with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The not reading part is true, however they would not have been able to read it even if they could read and write in their own laungage. People were not allowed to translate "the word of god" by law.

       No, but I was around in the 80's when multiple generations of evolution were observed, recorded, published and studies.

       I'm not saying I know everything, but there is irrefutable factual evidence that evolution happens, ignoring that under 'scientific dogma' is being as ignorant as saying 'the government wouldn't lie cause they wouldn't get re-elected'.

       Make no mistake, I appreciate both science and the resulting discovery of evolution, and I am not trying to argue against it. I'm not saying I know everything either, but I'm merely making the case that crawling out of primordial ooze or even directly descending from primates is/are NOT fact(s). Evolution occurs, yes, and humanity has certainly been shaped by it, but the origin of humanity is still unclear in my eyes.

       I agree, it will be. Yet I'm sure he will just talk it out the window with a couple of generic over encompassing phrases. I look forward to this iama and I give the guy credit. He's got balls. He's walking into a place full of scientists and intelligent people with theories about end times based on religion and claiming evolution is somehow wrong.

       Uhuh. So an old retired guy set in his ways is going to enter into a debate where if his opponents make good arguments he'll just casually admit "Oh wow, you're right, I never looked at it that way before, I've been totally wrong on my entire thesis for the last 40 years and my whole life is a lie, I'm so glad I had this debate before I die next year!"

       No kidding. Professors should be ashamed of themselves. The majority of classes these days require you to purchase the current edition of texts, which professors usually profit from (and all they often do is shuffle the chapters and questions since last years edition).

       Right.. one of the reasons I bailed on college was the day I noticed that my comp prof's name was listed as a co-author on half the books I was required to buy for his class. They were ridiculous books too. Then the day came when this motherfucker decided to go on a rant about the difference between the semi-colon and the comma. After about half of hour of that shit I went out for a cigarette. I didn't hurry back either and was probably gone about 20 minutes. When I came back he as still on that subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't even sit down. I just packed up my books and left. I could never bring myself to go back.

       I don't endorse Patrick Conway, but I'd like to point out that bigoted comments like these are what really irks me about people who have a hard-on for science. To be clear I don't have an issue with the scientific method, but really, science can't explain everything. Some people think we've got it all figured out, but if you think we've done anything besides breathe on the surface, you're kidding yourself.

       In Eastern Philosophy there are three types of knowledge:
1. That which is known by reason
2. That which is knowable with reason
3. And That which cannot be known 
Scientific method works well for the first two, but a different paradigm is required to pursue the third.

       It is hard to get pure sensory data even from science in this day and age unless you are the one with your hands in the dirt.Most scientific knowledge that we "think" we know is actually knowledge based on faith(yes i said it) in the scientist and his conclusions. This doesn't mean that you aren't coming to your own conclusions. It simply means that your knowledge isn't pure sensory data because most likely it came to you from text on the computer or even a video which is a secondary source that can only be believed or hoped for without actually physically touching- seeing- smelling. Not to mention that much of science today is based on beings of reason causing the "true knowledge" to be even further from your senses. The fact is science is the study of nature and there are many ways to perceive and view objective reality. Anyone who experiences objective reality no matter how they choose to perceive it is a scientist..

       Except the point of the scientific method is that everything is well documented and deterministic, so if you ever question the validity of something, you can repeat the experiment to see if you get the same outcome.

       While I appreciate your faith for the doctrine of science, I find this statement incredibly incorrect. Perhaps I would agree if purely from a linguistic standpoint if you just meant science in a broad sense of 'knowledge,' but science as a systematized way of applying general causal principles to everything, is quite frankly, bullshit.

       Knowledge is knowledge, and science is but one method to attain it. The phrase that comes to mind would be "The map is not the territory."

       Can you describe a few kinds of knowledge that man can/could acquire, that can't be understood, described, or even categorized by science? And if so, how

       Maybe. But if science can't obtain "complete understanding" of a thing, how can it ever be known by non-scientific means?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't deny that there may be some things science never gets, and maybe even that there are some things science never
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       get. But I take issue with those who make said claim, and then insert their own special knowledge, as if their non-scientific belief somehow takes precedence over "we don't know." Unless they can demonstrate how to reliably obtain this knowledge by non-scientific means, I have to assume that it's simply an argument from ignorance: "we don't know, therefore my claim can't be denied with certainty, and therefore my claim must be true." It's an unbelievably short-sighted fallacy, but it gets used

       You made the claim that qualia is something that cannot be scientifically quantified. I have shown you exactly the opposite - rudimentary quantification and reconstruction of so-called 'qualia.'
      </p>
      <p>
       You're obviously a philosophy student so I should not have expected you to make the extrapolation that with time increased understanding of perception and the reconstruction thereof will approach perfection. Once we have near-perfect models of cognition and perception there is no 'problem of qualia,' as we will have complete understanding of the nature of conscious subjective experience.

       Exactly.  Your problem, and one of the bigger problems with modern science, is since you cannot
       <em>
        currently
       </em>
       quantify them, they do not exist.  It is entirely possible that angels exist as some form of collected electromagnetic energy, and we simply haven't found the way to detect, interact, or quantify them yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you interpret what you, yourself, said (whether you like it or not) implies that atoms didn't exist until we could manipulate them.  X-rays were not a part of the electromagnetic spectrum until we detected them.  Et cetra.  You do realize that humanity currently has no way to quantify gravity.  We cannot manipulate it, and we've never detected a graviton.  Other then measuring the externally applied force in observed objects, we literally have no idea what gravity is.  That does not stop it from being a truth of reality.

      <p>
       The default position, without evidence, is to hold no belief on the matter. Until we detect these EM-angels (or the millions of other things that
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       hide in that same little pocket of scientific ignorance,) there's no basis for asserting that we know anything about them. More directly, if science can't know that those angels exist,

        how does man

       ?

      <p>
       I never said things don't exist until we can detect them scientifically. I spoke against the existence of things which (somehow) can never be detected by science. However, if there does exist an object which can
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be detected
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       , by
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       form of science we might develop, then I would postulate that this object has so little quantifiable effect on the universe that it is almost certainly not very important.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I would never stop looking.

       Don't compare Science to religion, they aren't the same thing. Religion is based on faith and the supernatural. Science is based on
       <strong>
        FACT
       </strong>
       , and if it isn't fact then it isn't worth paying attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're more than entitled to you're beliefs, but don't insult Scientific method and research by referring it as just another doctrine.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Science can explain why we do, and act, and live the way we do. Religion can only tell us how to act, how to do, and how to live.

       Exactly.
Its like saying science is one way of discovering the way the universe works i.e collecting evidence based upon observable facts, but the other way is.....what exactly??
Reading a book and taking it for granted? Looking at the clouds and assuming they are cotton wool becuase they look like it? 
For instance it is possible Angels exist but have not yet been doscovered by the scientific method but i do not see any other way that they can be discovered, it seems some people think to just say yes they exist because I know someone who has seen one or I have this feeling, or a read it in the bible is enough. It is not.

       science is just like every religion.  Everyone tends to follow some belief system rooted in some sort of basis.  Though you feel confident that science can answer anything the fact of the matter is we are still just scraping the surface of science.  The deeper we go the more difficult and intricate systems become and the only FACT is no body knows shit about anything yet.  I believe heavily in science but you can't just spout out statements like science can answer everything because we dont know that yet.

       I understand we know more than "shit", but the fact is the deeper we dwell the more questions with more complex answers we find.  simply put "we don't know, what we don't know" is really the point I was trying to get across.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes science will always be answering questions and advancing/evolving but simply put the rabbit hole could go down forever and we may not be able to answer all the questions with science.  No we haven't gotten there yet but considering "we don't know, what we don't know" I think its incorrect to say science can answer everything.  Just because we just haven't ran into something we couldn't answer yet doesn't mean we won't."

       Haven't read that particular title, but am generally familiar with Sagan's outlook on the dangers of superstition. I certainly enjoy Sagan and much of his contributions, but just as he claims superstitions are dangerous, don't you think that holding one method, reliable as it may seem, to obtaining the truth above all others is just as dangerous?

       You would be remiss to forget that occultism (the investigation of the mystery) is a root cause to modern science. Even more laughably so, the arguable founder of modern science, Rene Decartes, received the words which have resounded and echoed through the centuries, "The conquest of nature is achieved through measure and number," from an
       <em>
        ANGEL
       </em>
       in a dream that he had. YES.
       <strong>
        A fucking angel.
       </strong>
       I wonder what Carl Sagan would have had to say about that.

       People see and hear angels all the time. Usually giving them Lithium and a phenothiazine in measured doses solves this problem (schizophrenia). A solid basis in psychobiology would have told you that 50 years ago. The subconscious is still being actively studied, but we have yet to see evidence of dreams imparting any kind of knowledge the individual didn't already have.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Descartes' case, the angel anecdote may have even been put down on paper to convince a powerful church that he was doing work for them, rather than against them. You have accepted, unquestioningly, both that Descartes believed his own anecdote, and that the dream actually happened the way it is told. Descartes was also quite fond of trying to use words alone to will God into existence. His ontological argument has been torn apart time and time again, and yet people still think that
       <em>
        a priori
       </em>
       knowledge, especially of some deity, exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       On your other point, certainly occult practices such as alchemy were considered sciences at one point, but the beauty of science is its ability to change its outcomes to match the observations, instead of the other way around. This isn't the black mark on the history of science that you seem to think it is, rather it is the celebration of overcoming our own superstitions, and a cautionary tale regarding
       <em>
        wanting
       </em>
       something to work. Newton's theory of gravity holds true because there has
       <em>
        never been an experiment that proved it false
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You have yet to actually provide an example of how knowledge can be obtained through some other method than science. When you say the map is not the territory, you are correct. The map describes the territory, often in ways that our individual senses cannot. The scientific method has allowed advances in every single field of knowledge, with the possible exception of philosophy (which is primarily word games these days anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect you to bring up something like insight, or intuition. Both of these would actually be subject to the scientific method; insight, when you make a connection between two disparate things, causes you to react in accordance with your understanding, which then provokes a reaction that either confirms or denies your insight; intuition, when your brain recognizes an advanced pattern without being able to pinpoint the source of the recognition, just means that you can't name or pinpoint the source, not that there isn't one - at any rate you move forward with actions assuming your intuition is correct, and are either confirmed in your hypothesis on the pattern, or denied.
      </p>
      <p>
       In both of the above cases there is a well studied tendency to remember the times your insight and intuition were right, and trivialize, forget, or otherwise discount the times when it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       **Edit: clarity and spelling. Also, an excellent groundwork in logic, philosophy, and science, with a healthy dose of curiousity, can work wonders on the human mind.

       Solid, well-thought out post. Thanks for that.

       I really have no desire to further discuss Descartes' experience, as I have had a round with plenty of others and it has left a somewhat bad taste in my mouth, but I would like to approach some of the other topics you've mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alchemy is a very misunderstood occult study to most. In truth, it was a means of concealing the act of working toward spiritual impeccability. The soul (characterized by the alembic) would undergo various processes to purify it, and the end result was the metaphor of turning lead into gold. Perhaps this explanation was unwarranted, but I thought you may find it interesting. Insofar as the occult's contribution to science, John Dee is probably one of the more influential individuals within this subject -- there's a wealth of information on him out there if you care to explore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intuition is a very interesting subject, and there was a fantastic book written on it titled "Limitless Mind" which admittedly takes a scientific approach. I certainly applaud it, as it is an effort in entwining something many would call "woo woo" with hard science. But beyond that, there is an incredible amount of experiential phenomena that people undergo that is very difficult to explain, such as out-of-body experiences, the effects Qi Gong masters have on their own bodies, and even the psychedelic experience is a tricky subject to pin down. Will science be able to explain these things in time? Probably, but it seems likely from where I am standing now that it will take a big shift in how we perceive reality for these things to be able to be explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not against science, nor am I for superstition. But I definitely feel as humans playing around in our short lives, a playful attitude towards the mystery that confronts us is important. I'm just saying, I don't think it's all cut-and-dry as many would like it to be.

       I've read a book called
       <em>
        The Eight
       </em>
       , by Katherine Neville, which was an interesting fictional pursuit into a lot of the perceived forces of alchemy, including the alchemical numerology and chess references. It was a fun read, and it definitely made me think differently about the subject. Newton also studied alchemy extensively, and tried to treat it as a science, but really didn't get any results.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problems we have had in the past (and to a degree, currently) with trying to pin down how to quantify human experience is that we are, collectively and as a species, pretty arrogant. We assume our own superiority and special-ness as compared with other parts of nature. It's the same argument about whether or not we'll truly create AI, or if we'll even create real intelligence; people just aren't sure it can be done. There's been some interesting things done with
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">
        neural networks
       </a>
       in the last few years. The wikipedia article doesn't do the recent research justice, but it gets the generally idea across. Recently they've gotten a
       <a href="http://wireframe.iyogi.com/geekosphere/ai-that-can-estimate-number-of-objects-without-counting.html">
        neural network to be able to estimate the number of objects in front of it
       </a>
       in Italy. Ignoring the sensationalist writing of the article, it's a step towards understanding how our own brain processes images and comes to generalized conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       **edit: A great line that I read somewhere but can't remember the source for right now is "The mind is what the brain does" which I agree with. The mind is the emergent property of an extremely complicated and chaotic neural network of infinitely interconnected cells that can even create new connections as needed.

       This really stuck out to me as something I contest and agree with at the same time. Or perhaps I should say I agree, with conditions. The mystery of the universe, and even of our own minds and human experience, can be a wonderful and interesting thing, but I agree with
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ulkX-DA9BM">
        Neil deGrasse Tyson's opinion
       </a>
       that when you stop asking questions because you're content with the mystery, you're not advancing science but holding it back.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there's an attitude from a lot of scientists that there's nothing to be learned from any source but a peer-reviewed one, which I also disagree with. You have to have some flexibility in your understanding of the world (except at the most extreme top of a scientific field where specialization is necessary). We don't understand our own minds because we're not very introspective as a Western society. I did martial arts for 10 years, and with the physical training came mental training too - meditation is something that is still important to my life, and I understand that there can be epiphanies that don't seem to stem from any outside source. I'm willing to accept that I can't pinpoint a source, but not that one doesn't exist. If we never figure it out I won't be surprised, but that's only because we're not particularly smart as a species.

       well..descarte lived quite a while ago. times and views on reality were quite different then. 
I don't honestly find it dangerous to hold to one method toward obtaining truth. What I do find dangerous is when you hold to one truth being the correct truth. science doesn't do that however superstition and religion do.  science is a method...superstition and religion are not methods. they are answers without the ability to be tested.

       You're still relying upon key people to disseminate authoritative information. You really think it's any different than having priest classes thousands of years ago? 90% of people have no idea how a lot of the technology that run our very lives work. Scientists may claim to be unbiased, but I'm willing to bet that a frightening percentage of them AREN'T. It takes money to do research, you know.

       I'm not a scientist but I'm curious enough to devote a fair amount of time educating myself on a number of things. As for the things that I don't personally have a basic grasp of you can at least see their practical applications in the real world.  Quantum physics is a great example...the average schmuck has absolutely no grasp of it. Hell..even the scientists who study it only kindof get it. But looking at things like quantum entanglement and its application in quantum computers that are being developed now at least puts some light on the subject and the fact that they are at least on to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being unbiased isn't a requirement to be a scientist either.  If anything a biased scientist may give a perspective of looking at something that others may not have and they may come up with new ideas.  From there any theories or ideas they come up with would get submitted for peer review by any number of scientists who may or (most likely) may not share the same bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to religion or superstition or anything along those lines...if you try to dissect their views like they do in science then the people promoting those views tend to go on the defensive.  That's the key difference between the two mediums. The whole point of science is to dissect and rip apart another persons theory in order to prove it correct or incorrect - or even to prove your own theory correct when someone rebuttals it. The whole point of religion/superstition is to accept what you feel or are told without questioning it.  That and the practical applications associated with superstition/religion are questionable at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Superstition/religion did, however, do a great job of keeping humanity in the dark for a over thousand years.  While the ancient world was ripe with superstitious belief - the people of ancient greece, alexandria, ionia, etc formed the basis of modern science as we have it today. After the library of alexandria burned it's been said that set humanity back technologically by a thousand years.  If you don't believe it do some research on what they had for technology around that time - the amazing clockwork applications like the antikythera mechanism just to name one.  Once we were plunged into the dark ages, lead by religion and superstition, europe became stagnant for a millenium.  It wasn't till the renaissance, when science began to emerge in its modern form, and people realizing what religion and superstition had done over the last thousand years ending up with the inquisition that we began to pulled ourselves out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't ultimately bash religious or superstitious belief on an individual level. People will believe what they will believe and I've met many religious people are are really good people. However, those who had studied their history realize just how much damage it's done and how much it has held us back as a race as a whole.

       I'm not supporting either religion or superstition. Religion is a means of controlling the populace, history has proven that quite well and I agree with you on all counts regarding the damage it has, and is still inflicting on the world. I don't really have an opinion on superstition, but my point is not in support of it. What I am supporting is spirituality, personal phenomenology, or even occultism. By this, I mean approaching the unknown,
       <em>
        personally
       </em>
       and not giving a fuck what anyone else thinks. The truth is inside ourselves, it's not something external to be found. This is what is so sorely missing in our society, this is why capitalism has run rampant and is destroying our planet, this is why science is not being used to its fullest potential. We live in a society that epitomizes the ego and the material which keeps drawing us away from our true selves. Quiet your mind and think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not suggesting that science in and of itself is a bad thing that doesn't benefit humanity. What I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       suggesting is that science tends to lean towards understanding the physical aspects of the world around us, and that a spiritual
       <em>
        knowing
       </em>
       is a missing component to understanding key underlying aspects of our world. Science with its foundation of understanding will never be able to crack those mysteries, because it is closed-minded to the possibility of such things, and it lacks the means to measure them. Think about it, if people spent as much time in meditation exploring their consciousness and dissolving their ego as they watch TV, we would live in a completely different society. If psychedelics were a rite of passage in the process of coming of age, I guarantee you, the world would be a friendlier, safer and more benevolent place.

       Oh man, so much hostility. Cool your jets, man. It could have been a talking angel or a burning bush, or any other entity falling under that meme -- The glaring point is that he received some sort of supernatural inspiration. Many people have called it different things over the years, Socrates called his 'daemon' (as the Greeks referred to the inner voice) as 'Genius.'

       I am hostile because you insulted my raging science-erection, and you put the words "angel" in italics and "fucking angel" in bold as if they proved any sort of point while, in the same goddamn sentence, noting that this all occurred in A DREAM.

       If the difference between claiming a supernatural entity spoke to you in a DREAM and in REALITY is not glaringly apparent to you then you, good sir, are a fucking dolt.

       The delineation between dreams and consensual reality really isn't all that important in this context, IMO. The fact of the matter is that modern science was founded on the words of a supernatural entity, which he met of course, within the supernatural realm of dreams.

       A claim of being spoken to by a supernatural entity in a DREAMSCAPE, a realm of infinite possibility,
       <strong>
        IMPLIES NOTHING ABOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL ENTITY IN REALITY
       </strong>
       . It does, however, reveal that whatever was said to him originated within his own mind, as he is the constructor of his dream-world. A claim of being spoken to by a supernatural entity in REALITY, however,
       <strong>
        IMPLIES THAT THE SUPERNATURAL ENTITY EXISTS IN THE IMMANENT REALITY

       , and originates from somewhere other than the mind of the claimant.

       Does anything exist outside of your mind? I mean, we call this reality 'consensual' (sensing together) but really what it comes down to is we see shit, taste shit, hear shit, smell shit and feel shit, and that's as far as 'consensual reality' takes us. So maybe you're the constructor of your dream-world and maybe entities that speak to you within it are just figments of your own mind and its imagination... But hey, what if I'm just a figment of your imagination and vice versa? I hope you're having as much fun as I am :)

       Public education fails in that it teaches you what to think, and not how to think in general. Critical thinking is some great stuff, but really I prefer to approach life as a mystical adventure and not the cut-and-dry routine that many seem to prefer.

       That's one way to look at it. Although, doesn't this sound like putting all your eggs in one unproven basket? I mean, if you're going to apply a scientific methodology to your statement, how can it be more than a hypothesis? You're just as bad as my fundie baptist neighbor. Maybe logic, my friend. It keeps the mind supple. Remember: Nothing is true, everything is permissible, 5 tons of flax.

       And you, sir, seem to have misunderstood the topic at hand. I don't deny that there are facts in the world that science adequately explains. I'm saying only a fool would put all of their faith into science. To say that absolutely everything can be understood and quantified through science is to look at the world through a narrow spyglass. Not to mention that it is the kind of unsupported blind belief that science is supposed to free us from.

       Before anything else please don't call me a fool. While waxing philosophically about human nature is cool and all when the time is available it does nothing to affect the world around you. There are many ways to describe the universe around us and that includes that which is inside us as well. We as human beings see the world through a small myopic lens. It's one organ in our bodies using other organs to receive electrical signal that it can interpret into what ever electro-chemical process is being engaged at the time. The use of adverbs, nouns, verbs to describe our world can be looked at as a short hand to allow more of these electrical signal to reach the brain in an increased fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is not an absolute way because it is once again a short hand for interpreting the world around. Same with math and literature. Math is a big one thought and should have its own merit of importance. Beyond all others it has the ability to describe things in which we can not understand the complete picture but extrapolate that it's there anyways. 
That's a big deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all fun but until we can clone and create something sentient it's nothing new to talk about the mysteries of the universe and how some thing even science can not fully understand. Always from the people not doing the science of coarse. People like mystery. Science and math are the ultimate spoilers of the human condition. For some.

       Sorry, you're not a fool as you said so yourself that science isn't absolute and has its own limits. So why is it that you disagree with me that it can't explain everything? It would seem you agree with me? Yes, it is the ultimate spoiler and I don't take any issue with that. I like knowing how stars are formed and die, I like knowing how things evolve, and I thoroughly enjoy all sorts of major advancements in my everyday life due to science. That being said, can it answer every question? No. I think not. I think there are some questions that can't be answered in the English language nor the language of mathematics. I also think there are some questions that can't be answered at all. For every logical system there are the axioms, the hidden assumptions of the universe from which everything is extrapolated (tell me if I'm sounding too much like a rationalist). Does any of that detract from what science has done? No. But I think its important to be realistic about our expectations and the limits of the scientific method.

       It's the reality. You want to believe that there are things that are inexplicable and will unconsciously work to maintain that. I have no problem with you living your life and all but stay away from the sciences if that's how you feel.

       And that sounds good. Just saying that there seems to be biases present and either be aware of them or stay out of the way, you know? Skepticism is healthy but to say that we can't know everything...from what perspective? From the cumulative perspective? From the perspective that we're mortal beings who will die with questions unanswered in our own times? A lot of people seem to confuse the latter (our limited lives) and the former (the information outliving us in the cumulative and contributing more and more). The cumulative isn't given enough credit with enough people.

       I'm skeptical of everything that anyone has ever told me. I go with what resonates with me, personally, and leave the rest out. People put so much faith into science and yet they rarely know how it works -- and this is where I primarily agree with Carl Sagan. You put your trust into what you think is an authoritative source of information, but oftentimes you have to ask the question, who is funding these scientists? Do they truly lack bias? I'm sure most do, but there are plenty out there that don't. Science creates a ton of problems, and then uses more science to fix them down the road when the problems become evident. It's the same old story, "They know not what they do." Our heads are so far the fuck up our asses, it's laughable. Give me a simpler time without all this technocratic bullshit, pharmaceuticals that induce illness and food that was actually nourishing. I'd take that and a healthy dose of woo woo any day over this post-industrial garbage we have now.

       No, I'm asking what (other that which chemicals reactions go off in the brain including "distortion of sensory perception, and other psychic and somatic effects") science is able to say about what we perceive, psychology is a very unexplored field if you look at the potential of the human brain and I believe there is more than just the "you are on drugs, that is why you see stuff that is not there" answer. I found

       The study of consciousness has made a lot of advancements of late. It is very hard for me to accept that science will
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       be able to explain it in detail. Many people have said similar things before about subjects that laypeople understand comprehensively today. Now, will we ever get to the point that we can capture consciousness and play it ala Strange Days? Perhaps when that level of technology is reached humanity will have an understanding of the effects of psychedelics that satisfies your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;dr It seems reasonable that at some point humanity's understanding of consciousness will answer that question to your satisfaction.

       To explain the mechanism-of-action of drugs (interaction with serotonin receptors, cannabinoid receptors, what have you) IS to explain what you see and why you see it. If you're looking for a 'reason why you saw a totally cool eagle, man!' on your last acid binge there is no "reason" other than the effect that the chemical had on the workings of your brain.

       Have you ever taken a strong hallucinogen? I saw more than just "a totally cool eagle, man!" So you argue that what I perceived was simply the result of "the mechanism-of-action of drugs", I'm looking for more... Let's say for arguments sake that you invented a device that let you switch "yourself" with another persons body. Now let's say that this person you switched with had a inferior brain, would that make you lose intelligence; or would you be able to retain you're intelligence?

       Ah yes, the old "I tripped harder than you so there must be something mystical about what happened" argument.. It never fails to amuse me. And yes, son, I do have the fucking credentials, thanks for asking.

       There is no 'argument' that what you perceived was "simply the result of the mechanism-of-action of drugs" and the altered state of your brain that they induced. That is an immutable fact. Your subjective perceptions, drug-induced or otherwise, are
       <strong>
        inextricably
       </strong>
       linked to their root causes in the physical workings of your brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your thought-experiment is poorly worded, not related to the discussion-at-hand, and continues to reveal your misunderstanding of how the mind works. What do you mean by "[switching] yourself?" To me, this would mean some sort of brain transplant, in which case the answer to the root question is exceedingly obvious. However, you go on to say "what if the person you switched with had a (sic) inferior brain," which shows that you believe there is some 'self' NOT linked to the brain. This is categorically untrue and nullifies the experimental question.

       "son" o_o Let's keep this civil please, I did not mean to tarnish your "credentials". I was simply asking a question. Maybe you did not understand my "experiment" because of my poor wording sorry, its not a brain transplant but yes I do believe that there is a soul in each of us and no I cannot scientifically prove it; but for me that is the beauty of it. How do you explain Deja-vu or the opposite(excuse me I forgot the word I believe it starts with a j maybe jamnevu??) or that sense you get when someone is looking at you, there are many things that science cannot prove yet. Unless you are some all knowing being you cannot say that there is no such thing as a "self" separate but linked to you're physical body in this stage in life. Maybe this is a topic for another subreddit but for argument's sake...

       Thank you for that link, I can't wait until the human race can move past all these distractions that keep us from using our full potential. I'm a   sci-fi addict so things like this get me excited. There is so much we don't know about ourselves because we(most of the human race) focus on "who has the bigger stick" instead of solving problems and focusing our efforts on "the pursuit of knowledge". Since this is r/conspiracy, what is your theory on extraterrestrials, and do you think we are even ready for contact?

       I believe we have already made contact, though the extent of actual communication with ETs is unknown to me. Nuclear weapons have been mysteriously shut down, often in conjunction with UFO sightings, in multiple instances in locations all over the globe. See

       I already own them, but I need to read The Diamond age, I liked that cyberpunk feel Neal Stephenson puts into his works, have you read Anathem? He created his own language! I totally agree with what you said, there are so many possibilities, they have to be more intelligent than us for one, and would that make them want to meet you, come down and say hi to everyone and shake our hands haha. For two they could just be monitoring us playing a hand when necessary, but I'm wondering if they would really want to have anything to do with us at all really. I see this way, pretend you are walking through the jungle and you spot a gorilla...do you walk up and ask for some help or do you just take some pictures and gtf away from the uncivilized beast? Who knows? Also if you havnt already, try the Ender's saga by Orson Scott Card.

       A non-human entity doesn't instantly mean that it is a god. All it (non-human entities) would need to become a "god" would be to have that title applied to it by demonstrating some kind of understanding of the universe that we (human entities) have yet to comprehend.

       if we met any non-human entities, it would be b/c they came here, which would demonstrate that they have more understanding of the universe than we have yet to comprehend (as you've said),
       <em>
        simply be being able to travel here.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       by your definition, that would make any alien that shows up on earth automatically  a "god", which just isn't true....just as the "gods" who are purported to have ruled this planet ages ago, weren't really gods, we just thought they were b/c they had
       <em>
        better technology

       .

       the Aztecs thought Cortes was a god, just because he had metal armor and huge ass ships, and his skin was white-ish (like their god Quetzlcoatl--I probably spelled that wrong). Cortes wasn't a fucking god, he just had better technology than the Aztecs.

       Sorry, I guess I was a little vague. I wasn't implying that they were actually "gods". I meant it in the context of brownestrabbit's comment and moogle516's question, "How did they get to be a god?"
      </p>
      <p>
       These non-human entities wouldn't actually be "gods", but then that comes down to what the definition of "god" would be. Dictionary.com's
       <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/god">
        third definition
       </a>
       from the World English Dictionary defines "god" as "Any person or thing to which excessive attention is given." Then following their example given, and assuming Patrick J.Conway is actually speaking to some non-human entitiy, this being that he is communicating with is very well a "god".

       Man, this is completely unrelated, but isn't thinking really so much fun? And I don't mean that sarcastically.

        we are almost certainly not alone in this universe, and

       I personally think that most people discount that unless of yours. Humans have only been around for a blink of an eye. Add sentient life just 1 million years earlier than ours and the possibilities are quite interesting and not improbable.

       That part kind of depends on the occurrence of sapient life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying you're wrong (particularly since one of Drake's variables is unknown: how long a sapient species survives before destroying itself.) It's just that there's a pretty wide range of possibilities. Earth is the only life-bearing planet we know of thus far, so it may be that it's a supremely rare occurrence. Or it may be that life is common, but sapience is not (since evolution has no direction.) Or it could be that the universe is brimming with lifeforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in the case of the latter, I still think the distances between stars are so vast that--short of FTL travel or von Neumann probes--we're pretty damned unlikely to encounter extraplanetary lifeforms anytime in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       But damn, it would be cool.

       A few of my physics professors (obviously with me being in college) direct these questions to the LHC in Switzerland, with us attempting to use hadron colliders to peel back the fabric of dark matter and use as an energy source (Higgs boson, ect.)...also while trying to find rips in time fabrics (worms holes and so on) that the range or probability for random error (in time or contact attempt) isn't as persistent as some would think...I suppose what I'm getting at is that a lot of scientists that I know personally do believe that sapient life is out there...but that they are not in fact that interested in us.

       What I don't get is why people have to go into such detail about this stuff. Say it actually is all 100% true. Without any evidence other than stories they are just making themselves out to sound like crazy people with blind faith in some alien beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think these people understand that you don't need to give all this information to the masses. All you need to do is prove that extraterrestrial life exists period. It doesn't matter who they are, or where they are from, or what their motives for being here are. You just need to say they exist, and here's proof. Everything else you know can come after the fact that you prove there is anything there at all. Going into such great detail just makes me believe your story even less. Because I can't understand why these beings would impart an encyclopedia of knowledge about themselves to a dozen new age hippies, and not to a single highly esteemed member of the planet.

       People are already downvoting you for not having made up your mind before you hear what he has to say.  It's a pretty pathetic statement overall, on the level of online discourse, when you are downvoted for saying you have an open mind.

       now not that i disagree, but how much research have you personally read or been involved in? Or is it the case that you have been told this is fact? in much the same way as the religious types swallow the indoctrination without much thought. question everything, even that which lines up with your beliefs. Of course by this i don't mean believe everything you read/hear but at least be open minded enough to hear people out if you are going to be involved in r/conspiracy

       In the 1800s, the French Academy of Sciences offered prize money to any scientist who could conclusively prove that life was either
spontaneous or random—and Louis Pasteur won the contest. When you see a carton of milk that says it is pasteurized, this means it was cooked
to kill all the bacteria—and this process was named after Louis Pasteur. The problem is that Pasteur’s competitors did get life-forms to grow out of
nonliving environments—such as by using preparations of hay that had been totally sterilized in water. Pasteur simply refused to repeat these
experiments. It’s even more disappointing that Pasteur found life that spontaneously appeared in a small percentage of his own experiments, but he
never even wrote about them—because he felt they had to be mistakes, and were not worth mentioning..

       there is very little evidence that humans 'evolved' from some sort of 'ape like' animal. Science has been looking for the "missing link" archaeological evidence - which actually pans out to be a series of missing links  -since the concept of Evolution was defined by Darwin.

        tl;dr
       </strong>
       there's a cold war between academia, atheism and religion. He's against all three because academia is crap at solving worlds problems (technology is doing that role) atheists are ignorant - not evil and religion is a load of crap because we have never actually have been able to speak to God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Collectively these have caused all the wars in the world because they can't agree on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible is a history book and all the predictions in it  - Armageddon, end of the world, floods, famine etc were jewish/Israel centric only and have already happened 1000 years ago.  These were the so called 'ancients' were the Egyptians, romans etc, who suddenly disappeared and this led to the so called "dark ages" because all the knowledge of the solar system, engineering, philosophy, and advanced technology etc all died with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ancient cultures were all satanic in nature because if satan offered Jesus all the kingdoms in the world if he would bow down before him then satan would have had to have owned it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       nothing will happen in 2012

       When he starts talking about the pyramids or something about how "fascinating" they were or how "science cannot explain how they were built," I just shake my head and say that is ignorant. The pyramids or whatever he was talking about was NOT created by aliens or deities but by HUMANS. Just because our technology now is so vast and advanced does not necessarily make us any more innovative than ancient Egyptians or whatever ancient civilization there was in building or constructing.

       No, although it is interesting the SS (abbreviation likeness intended) named him Petrus.  I'm referring to the prophecy of the popes, which deals with the last Pope of the catholic church.

       Well, whatever his name was that's not what I was referencing.  I was referencing the prophecy of the popes.  Santorum will barely be a footnote a year from now.

       Christianity is a nob-biblical religion
The peace spoken of after Armageddon applies to the next life.
Humans 9 the meek) nherit the earth.
The earth is God's incubater of souls for the next life.
In fact as specified in the Bible those on earth are in death.
Death = separation from God.
The Preterists only make one mistake; they try tyo pretend that the God of Abraham continued to interact with humanity after the fall of Jerusalem.

       I'm not a religious person, but I am very interested in this. Thank you for posting.  I think to completely dismiss something as horse shit is a little extreme and close minded. This community is all about exploring the possibilities of BOTH and ALL sides. Then we sit down like adults and speculate and form opinions based on each others "knowledge". We've all been heckled and personally attacked for having an interest in these subjects, so why attack people within your area of interest. Why does one feel such anger or threat? That doesn't make sense to me.

       First off,  I'd like to point out that Conway is a complete lunatic with few to no answers other than "look it's there!" leaving the rest of us wondering what the hell he's talking about.   The AMA failed for good reason.

       Second,  and I can't stress this enough.   YOU are an idiot for promoting this, as well as saying you were going to solve a 2082 mystery and it ends up being about the fall of Jerusalem, which took place in 70 AD (CE), meaning NOT BC.  If I add 2082 to 70 (Quick now, 2082+70) you end up with the year 2152.  The last time I checked my TARDIS is still in the shop, and it's 2012 which would make the 70 AD event 1942 years ago.

       it makes me sad that some can't hear out another's views/theories, whether they agree or not, without resorting to slinging shit and acting like children. If you disagree and think you have a point to make, construct an argument. If not SHOOSH! for shame r/conspiracy, for shame.

       I want to illuminate this: that I am a historian by nature. I wanted to know the history of astronomy. I ended up at religious texts. We were taught that we modeled the US after Rome, we named the planets after the god's, like a tip of the hat (catholic school upbringing), when in fact the gods are the story of the planets. They are one in the same. Allegorical retelling of observations told in a way that would include symbolism because symbols are efficient.

       You should read Fomenko with an open mind.  I do not agree with probably half of what he says, but the other half is irrefutable.

       All you need to know about him is that he has been discarded by mainstream, academic historians, but not refuted by them.

       Nor did they ever; tribal instincts are not always the best method of decision making. In fact, they rarely are. Unless of course you are being chased by a large animal; then Tribal Instinct away.

       This is untrue, type 1 civilizations only became such because they were ruled by military dictatorships and needed to consolidate the technology and power needed to expand beyond the home world.

       It's obvious that the current world economy only serves the most powerful nations and the controlling factors, business and government. It is only natural to trade resources if it is a mutually beneficial relation. As such, the peoples that are less advanced or have little to offer in trade will not earn as much power as the nations that are more advanced and has more to trade. One could consider cost-time factors of countries with unsuitable infrastructure for trade. There is also the case that a country possesses rich natural resources, but the native people are ill-equipped to trade it. Such problems leave only a few options:
1. Call it a day and try somewhere else.
2. Take over the civilization and its resources (AKA kill everyone and plunder).
3. Educate the native people, provide suitable infrastructure in return for their resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what if people can be considered resources? The typical answer has been slavery of various nature. e.g. manual labor slaves, intellectual slaves, prostitution. All viable sources of revenue. However, it has also been the case that slavery, at some point, incites rebellious nature in people and societies. As a result the master(s) must impose either a more direct version of slavery, a more indirect one, or remove slavery. I cannot see any other cases beyond those three.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Slavery defined:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.the condition of being subject to some influence or habit
      </p>
      <p>
       2.the state or condition of being a slave; a civil relationship whereby one person has absolute power over another and controls his life
      </p>
      <p>
       3.the subjection of a person to another person, esp in being forced into work
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       First case: Impose a more direct version of slavery. This can be realized through various punishments for uncooperative nature or complete control of function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second case: Impose a more indirect version of slavery. This can be realized through illusions, propaganda, misinformation, withholdment of information, unfair reward, hidden wealth, etc. Essentially convincing the slaves to work docilely and without a fair and reasonable proportion of the profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third case: Remove slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without suitable technology or the consent of controlling forces, cases 1 and 2 are basically impossible to maintain forever. There is also a cost of maintaining control that inevitably turns up through implementation of systems and sometimes errors. However, this cost may be negligible on the long term.

       Total world energy supply i.e. primary energy (2008) was 143,851 TWh and the end use of energy (2008) was 98,022 TWh. This is equivalent to 1.1174508e13 Watts in a year.

       As it may appear, the world (let alone a single civilization) has yet to become a Type 1 civilization. Given that a type 1 civilization should have technological levels similar to those found in 1964, a major flaw in our civilization design is evident. So what is a more effective design? How can humans use resources more effectively?
      </p>
      <p>
       Educate and care for all people on a global scale. There is a potentially slow and costly start-up as developing countries catch up, but the increased worldwide trade infrastructure, energy consumption, and creative potential add up. I think that in less than 3 years the human race can help each other develop into a type 1 civilization.

       I ran out of time last night when I was writing. I'll try to expand on my thoughts more, but I'm more retarded the more I think about it. You're probably right given that the military dictatorships can secure their power long enough to reach Type 1. Hell, war usually catalyzes technological discoveries.

       Somehow, given that he's talking about the bible I doubt we're going to hear anything worth listening to.  I mean fucksakes, it's like trying to teach quantum mechanics to a dead dog in terms of usefulness.

       The Battle of Armageddon caused the Collapse of the Ancient World. 
In conjunction with the destruction of the temple and fall of Jerusalem, the historians Josephus and Tacitus recorded eyewitness accounts of supernatural beings engaged in battle above the city, and a thunderous voice in the temple announced that God was departing. Shortly after, the temple and Jerusalem were destroyed to the foundation stones, which ended the Kingdom of Judah, and the tribe of people called the Jews. That cataclysm was the epicenter of the battle of Armageddon. It destroyed the powerful forces who ruled the advanced civilizations of the ancient world, and humans "inherited the earth."

       This is the problem I've had with science since I was in like 3rd grade. I agree it has its place, and it's very useful, but it by no means grasps everything there is to know, and no empirical study ever will. I am not myself a practitioner of occult or mystic stuff, but I am well aware (based on experiences with LSD) that there is more out there than we trick ourselves into believing every day.

       See, you seem to have the same view that I do, but a huge block. When I say that it is not science, I mean because it is ridiculous to try and force the strict definitions that science requires on somthing as personal as spiritual health. Although I would call it mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I personally belive its more of how different ppeople think. Religion as a whole seems to be filled with people who focus on why we are different. Usually by saying how man is better, or worse, than some idea. Were as science seems to look more deeply at how we are the same. How everything works togeather, in a very broad, yet exact, way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Religious people that I have talked to fail to see the wonder in the way I see the interconnection of everything, from the largest systems to the smallest. Science is truly the most hopeful way of interpreting the world.

      <p>
       Close, but it's not Christianity I'm concerned about (since Conway isn't, I don't think, specifically Christian). Rather, I'm conserned about what his calling himself a "religious scholar" might do to Reddit's already dim view of religious scholars, who are actually real academics with logical, peer-reviewed methodologies. Christianity only enters into it insomuch that having a needlessly dismal view of religious scholarship makes interacting with Christianity on the credible, logical basis, accepted by the accademy, even more of a hopeless prospect for most Redditors. The same could be said of its impact on the other religions Conway considers too, its just that, Reddit being a mostly
       <em>
        Occidental
       </em>
       phenomenon, most of the atheist Redditors are post-Christian, not post-Mayan or post-Muslim.

       I know exactly what science is, thanks. It is how people interpret science, and the colloquial ideas that science impregnates into the subconscious of the populace that are dangerous. I am confident that genetics are real, but I am also confident that people have far more control over them psychologically/spiritually than they realize. Anyway, I'll let you take your ball and go home. Have a good evening :)

       there is very little evidence that humans 'evolved' from some sort of 'ape like' animal. Science has been looking for the "missing link" archaeological evidence - which actually pans out to be a series of missing links  -since the concept of Evolution was defined by Darwin.

       In the 1800s, the French Academy of Sciences offered prize money to any scientist who could conclusively prove that life was either
spontaneous or random—and Louis Pasteur won the contest. When you see a carton of milk that says it is pasteurized, this means it was cooked
to kill all the bacteria—and this process was named after Louis Pasteur. The problem is that Pasteur’s competitors did get life-forms to grow out of
nonliving environments—such as by using preparations of hay that had been totally sterilized in water. Pasteur simply refused to repeat these
experiments. It’s even more disappointing that Pasteur found life that spontaneously appeared in a small percentage of his own experiments, but he
never even wrote about them—because he felt they had to be mistakes, and were not worth mentioning..

       It's the reality. You want to believe that there are things that are inexplicable and will unconsciously work to maintain that. I have no problem with you living your life and all but stay away from the sciences if that's how you feel.

       And that sounds good. Just saying that there seems to be biases present and either be aware of them or stay out of the way, you know? Skepticism is healthy but to say that we can't know everything...from what perspective? From the cumulative perspective? From the perspective that we're mortal beings who will die with questions unanswered in our own times? A lot of people seem to confuse the latter (our limited lives) and the former (the information outliving us in the cumulative and contributing more and more). The cumulative isn't given enough credit with enough people.

       You make a great point.  It's the universities who allow this to happen who should be fixing their policies.  Professors should not profit from their captive student audience.
