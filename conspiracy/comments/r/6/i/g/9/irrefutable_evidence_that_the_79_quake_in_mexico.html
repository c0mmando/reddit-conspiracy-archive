       The evidence is shown here on this Youtube video, but you can also go the the second link below to see the article that shows the evidence in the form of a March 20, 7.9 simulated emergency... also Obama's kid was there. Far too coincidental for nature. Nature doesn't do that; people do that. They've been playing with this tech for a long time now - if you guys at reddit can't even see the truth when it's placed right in your face, you can see why those in power don't feel the need to tell the truth...

       You might want to look into a mirror to see the real insane asylum.  This tech has been around for decades, and you think it doesn't exist... that could qualify as insane... possibly.  But perhaps it just says that you're really gullible and ignorant.

       You are able to string words together, but nothing you say is accurate.  This technology is real... how is that a "world out to get me?"  Secrets are not directed at me, they are just secrets; covert technology.  Oh... you think covert technology doesn't exist.  I see the problem... You think you're important enough to have been fully informed about every bit of covert science on this Earth, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your responses to this point are scripted... you don't really think for yourself.  You are just saying things that make you feel good, and those things have been scripted throughout society to provide you with this arsenal of words to utter in order to prevent the truth from spreading.  Good job.  You're a policeman for the ignorant - helping to make sure they remain that way.

       It's just part of the probability evidence (coincidence).  The science of probability doesn't lie.  There is a huge amount of evidence out there, probability evidence, proving that quake and weather tech have been used for decades.  These things are not graphed for you to clearly see - they just blame global warming and climate change and the media tells you a limited amount of info to corral you along.  Climate change provides them with a perfect plausible deniability for covert use of this technology.  They promote fossil fuels and give alternative energy half hearted effort at best... the use of fossil fuels allows the climate change plausible deniability because fossil fuels are a plausible cause of climate change.  This is the biggest news story of this and last century, but it is still being well suppressed.

       In fact, if you continue talking with me.  You'll have no choice, at all, but to eventually learn the truth.  You will walk away from the conversation; this I guarantee.  Mainstream people have a tendency to avoid clear, complete communication, but it's not your fault, because this is how society is designed.  I'm ready now.  Let's see what you do next.  I'll even start a new thread discussing just with you as an example for everyone else to see.

       I can tell you the truth, but it's not my job to convince you; you have to see it for yourself... but it's right in front of your face, you just prefer not to look closely at all the evidence.  You want somebody else to do that for you, apparently.  You have to develop an intellect that can really discern what is happening around the world with covert knowledge and technology.  Think for yourself - actually use the brain you have.  Make real connections rather that just scripted connections media, politics, and academia have laid out for you.

       What do you think the earthquake has to do with the president's daughter being in mexico?

       First, you must realize that I have been shown this technology - so I look at events from the perspective of knowing this technology can be used by people as they choose.  The people that decided to do this had to decide when and where to do it.  They knew that the president's daughter was there... most likely.  I'm not saying that it's absolutely true that the people doing the quake knew about her being there, but there is a very strong likelihood that they knew it given that Obama is the president.  The people that have this technology are relatively few:  Covert factions within the US military, Russia, and likely a few others.  I'm just naming the two I know about.  They knew that this emergency preparedness excercise with a 7.9 earthquake was scheduled for March 20, obviously, so they chose this location and time because of that.  They also, as I've said, very likely knew that Obama's daughter was there.  This, coupled with the excercise, may have been the reason they chose this location/time.  If you knew of the covert, asymmetric type warfare that is happening all the time around the world, you would see the possibility that this was a warning to Obama that they can get to his kids, so... fill in the blank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, please note, I merely bare in mind the possibilities.  I do not know if that was the actual intent of doing this quake in that location at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the other issue, of the quake happening when the excercise was scheduled, nature does not do that.  You really need to get a firm, hardcore grip on probability and nature.  Humans do things like this.  Humans plan "coincidences" like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two fundamental global factions right now.  One faction would like to transition the world to have a basis in honesty, and the other wants to maintain the world with a basis in deception.  Obama, and most leaders in the US and Europe are on the side of deception.

       You imply a causal link and then say they
       <em>
        might

       have been aware of her presence. :(

       Yes.  No big deal.  Their may be a causal link, and I never stated that there was, absolutely, a link.  I'm discussing the possibilities. It is a possibility that the Obama connection is as I've stated, but I don't have the actual details of the op.  I do have the probability evidence, just as you do, and I do know that this technology exists (perhaps different than your knowledge level).

        it's certainly not irrefutable.

        the simulation was probably intended to be an informational exercise, not a physical one, as dutchsinse claims.
       </li>
       <li>
        the video doesn't demonstrate any tie in with HAARP activity, or another man made mechanism was implemented.
       </li>
       <li>
        yes, I think HAARP could be used to encourage energetic sympathetic vibrations and cause an intentional earthquake.

       <li>
        it is quite an uncanny coincidence.

        calling something coincidence is not an excuse to stop looking into it.

       The simulation was in a neighboring state to the epicenter of the quake (from what I've read), but as we all know quakes are felt across a large area of land.  I've posted the answer to the rest in another response.

       You need to reflect upon yourself and ask yourself why do you want the answer you are looking for?  Clear, complete communication is all that's required.  I'm answering exactly as well as I am able given what I know, and yet your brain doesn't think that's enough, yet that's all that is.  So the problem is within your brain.  I'm just pointing this out.
