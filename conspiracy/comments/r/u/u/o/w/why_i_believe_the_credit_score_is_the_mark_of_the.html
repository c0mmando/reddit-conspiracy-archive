        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">31</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2012-04-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../user/SoupCanNort.html">SoupCanNort</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, lets start with the verse from Revelations:</p>

<p>“He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” Revelation 13:16,17</p>

<p>With that said, please understand that I am no religious zealot, though I do believe in spirituality, I cannot consider myself a follower of any real doctrine.  I do believe in God, and have read the Bible, but have difficulty considering myself &quot;Christian&quot;. 
Now on to the meat and potatoes of my statement, this is a brief example of what I&#39;ve experienced:
I am 32 years of age, have been consistently employed since the age of 14, for nearly 2 decades I&#39;ve put away no less than 10% of my income, and often up to 50% of my income in a savings account.  I am not here to boast, just sharing my experience.  I have no debt in life, when purchasing a vehicle, I bought my truck in cash on the spot (it&#39;s a great bargaining tool).  I have no credit cards, I have no student loans, I have no medical bills, I owe no taxes, yet I cannot purchase a home.  This just does not make sense.   </p>

<p>When finally in a position in life that I would rather own a home instead of renting, I went to my bank whom I&#39;ve been dealing with for nearly 20 years and inquired on receiving a home loan.  I had been shopping around for houses, and had found a few that I liked enough to place a bid. With regret, my bank (and a local Credit Union I had been using for about 5 years) informed me that because I do not have a credit score, they are unable to provide me with a loan, even though I was more than willing to offer a 50% down payment on the property (is 50% not enough to show good faith and willingness to pay?).  All who I&#39;ve asked for advice have told me to simply take out a few small credit cards, and build up your credit...so I tried.  I can not even obtain a credit card unless it is &quot;pre-paid&quot; (I also reject the notion).  So, to have self &quot;worth&quot; I must enslave myself to debt.  In order to purchase a home, I must first have debt...I must have debt...to receive debt.  WTF?</p>

<p>Although the credit score is not a literal mark on the forehead or the hand, it still keeps one from obtaining a job (in some cases), obtaining property, starting a business, or living a debt free life.</p>

<p>This experience I&#39;ve had has bolstered the opinion in me, that many of you have.  That there is an &quot;Elite Force&quot; if Satanic minded individuals who are bent on enslaving nations in debt.  These criminals will not allow true freedom within the social norms of society, and to achieve freedom from their perpetual debt system, you sacrifice the right to property, education, and (in some cases) your livelihood.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s fascinating about the &quot;number of the beast&quot; in order to buy and sell is how accurate a prediction it proves to be for our current times. The writers of Revelation had no means to explain credit cards at the time and their fable/mythology is the perfect metaphor and imagery (of their time) to express the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember watching an episode of Larry King on CNN once and he was talking about this. I forget who the guest was but they were talking about how the banks can charge up to 25% interest on credit cards. Then Larry asked how much the mafia charges for a loan. The guest responded, they charge a flat 10%. It&#39;s pretty telling when the mafia charges less than the banks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reality is black and white. Facts are facts. There is no such thing as &quot;shades of gray&quot;; there is such a thing as <em>context</em> which must be considered when evaluating facts.</p>

<p>We are not discussing a complex issue, this one is actually pretty simple. If you look through my comment history, you&#39;ll see me discussing plenty of complex political and philosophical issues, with facts and reason.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever not had a place to live for 7 years? I&#39;m thinking not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an appeal to emotion argument; it&#39;s a logical fallacy, and has no place in this discussion.</p>

<p>But for the record, no, I have not been homeless for 7 years, not just because I am responsible and successful, but also because people in this country do not magically become homeless for 7 years. I&#39;d like to see some facts where banks magically make scores of people unable to find a place to live for close to a decade.</p>

<p>If you mean home ownership, that&#39;s a different story, but that&#39;s much less of a sob story than you make it out to be. Let&#39;s stick to the facts and not spin things, K?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try some other credit unions there may be one near you that will do it. In NC, the State Employees Credit Union will finance a home with no credit history and a sizable down payment so those loans are out there. Getting a mortgage is still possible, don&#39;t get discouraged.</p>

<p>Also try local and regional banks, they have more flexibility than national organizations. USDA loans should be available if you are outside of a major city, might be able to get one of those approved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ran into the exact same problem.  Took me about a year of playing the &quot;credit card game&quot; of buying, and paying it back, etc. before I could get a loan for a house.  Once I did though, I have kept up my good habits.  When I went to apply for a 2nd mortgage (major garage addition/renovation) I applied for a 10K line.  I was told at the time I applied that it usually took 7-10 days for approval.  My credit was so good at that point, they called me back in less than 48h and approved me for 20K.  It&#39;s all a game.  Once you know the rules, you can play it in your favor.  I have access to over 40K in credit now, should I need it, and my only debt is less than $500 on plastic (which I could pay off instantly if needed from other funds) and my mortgage.  I rolled the 2nd mortgage debt into the 1st mortgage when I refinanced the home at a lower interest rate than either of the previous notes, but left the 2nd mortgage open for emergency purposes.</p>

<p>The main thing that you have to remember when using any line of credit.  NEVER finance toys or consumables.  If you can&#39;t afford them out of your &quot;fun money&quot; fund, you can&#39;t afford them period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe credit score is the mark. However the evils of men in the world does happen.</p>

<p>If you have 50% for a down payment. I suggest you put it back in the savings and take out a prepaid debt /credit card through your bank, or I would suggest that if you have 50% don&#39;t get into debt with these guys. Invest your money wisely in short term, continue busting your ass, sock more into savings, then when you have enough. Pay outright for a home or build your own. Then you will not piss interest away on a douche bag corporation.</p>

<p>The example you give is just tip of the horror stories in dealing with homes. Several years ago they were jumping through hoops to give you a loan. I live on the Big Island. 12 years ago I purchased a home in a subdivision in Nanawale in Puna. It was not a problem to the banks even though my debts were to high due to loans on my start up business, and my credit score was in the poor range. It was also located in a lava zone#2 which is supposed to be difficult to insure a home. However for the right interest percentage at a whopping 8.5%. The bank was wholeheartedly happy to agree to terms.</p>

<p>Now they won&#39;t touch you even if you have a good credit score, and is in lava zone 2. Eventually I paid off my business loan, and then the house. I&#39;m free and clear. However I wanted to live in another area, and so I had enough saved to build my own in an area that is desired real estate. I paid cash though and not through a bank.</p>

<p>My Nanawale house I rent to my daughter for a low price because they are family. Just enough to pay utilities and taxes. However it was on the market for sale for 2 years. I took it off. I had 17 offers, and not one, and I mean not one even with a USDA backed loan could not get financing. Due to credit rating even with one offering 50% down like you did.</p>

<p>It&#39;s fracking stupid. The banks sit on these homes as a tax write off. All the while collecting insurance money from the taxpayer bailout on an asset they foreclosed on some other poor bastard. Who paid tax money to the government. Who in turn bailed out the banks. Then they use the home as an asset in fractional banking to loan on their friends enterprises. It&#39;s a rigged system to use homes as an asset for banks. They sit with no value as they are not generating income except through the taxpayer. It needs a major overhaul.</p>

<p>I had one supposed expert economist actually have the gaul to tell me the USA was wealthy due to these assets and not worry about the 15 trillion national debt.. As a successful business man that&#39;s bull. I know the importance of having capability to access cash quickly for your business. Your assets are what you can liquidate at a very fast pace and turn into hard currency. Homes are not such. Evident by the amount of turn downs by the banks themselves.</p>

I was fueled by greed, a subtle form of greed which I justified with the illegitimacy of our current financial system. Long story short, I&#39;m a 23 years old and I have over $10,000 in student loan debt, over $8,000 in credit card debt and I can&#39;t see myself paying it off anytime soon. But i have learned some very important spiritual lessons in the process, so I just look at it all as an expensive lesson.</p>

It sounds like you&#39;ve taken the steps to make it right, and like you said, you learned something from the situation.  As far as lessons learned, it could have been far worse.

Don&#39;t buy a house until - like your vehicle - you can simply afford it cash.  Don&#39;t relegate yourself to being a debt slave now that you&#39;ve lived such a good life of being able to NOT be one.  Don&#39;t get yourself into being one just so you can have a house.</p>

<p>So what.  Just rent a small place and just save up until you can get a house.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fucked up world.  Seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Believe it or not I&#39;ve seen worse.  Someone close to me ran a successful business and stayed away from credit as well.  The time came when they wanted to buy an investment property.  In order to build credit they wanted a line of credit but the bank refused even when it was 100% secured.  That&#39;s right, giving the bank the cash up front for the credit line.</p>

<p>That is right. The entrance ticket to society is a bank account. You cannot live as the &#39;common man&#39; without going into debt. A bond for life in many cases. It happens before you know it, and then you are a small stone in the pyramid, paying upward, not forward.</p>

<p>And yes, you are correct.  I am not looking to purchase land with what I have, and build my own home (because I cannot secure a loan, this will take more time than I had hoped.). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great suggestion.  I may be too picky, in many cases, the homes I&#39;ve looked into that are under the foreclosure umbrella are in terrible disrepair.  </p>

<p>Late last summer I did find one though, perfect for what I was looking for.  On 5 acres, had a 3/4 acre pond, and although the house was in rough shape (uninhabited for over a year), it was exactly what I wanted.  I contacted the reality company, but there had already been an offer placed on the property.  I looked into it a littler deeper...the Reality Company itself had purchased the property and placed it back on the market for $60,000 more than the original price.  Bastards.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still looking though.</p>

Fact/ fiction it held relevance in its time and for some it still does. The &quot;mark&quot; can be seen as a mark of slavery through out time. Today it could be credit. Is it really hard to believe that there is a supreme good and supreme evil? Now i have turned it into a religious debate. Damnit.</p>
