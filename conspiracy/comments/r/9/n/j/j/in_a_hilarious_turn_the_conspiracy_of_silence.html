       This is funny because... He's been the subject of books, documentaries, has many websites, is the subject of many websites, has hundreds of thousands of google hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       But since wikipedia is able to say "unless one of these specific organizations talks about you, it doesn't count" he'll never satisfy their notability guidlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       This effectively means that it will always remain impossible for anything denied by the mainstream media but supported by any number of other sources to be on wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       How clever.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, google the phrase(including quotes):  '"Michael Aquino" temple'
      </p>
      <p>
       451 hits? Try 120,000....

       "Throughout much of the 1980s, Aquino was at the center of a controversy involving the Pentagon's acquiescence to outright Satanic practices inside the military services. Aquino was also a prime suspect in a series of pedophile scandals involving the sexual abuse of hundreds of children, including the children of military personnel serving at the Presidio U.S. Army station in the San Francisco Bay Area. Furthermore, even as Aquino was being investigated by Army Criminal Investigation Division officers for involvement in the pedophile cases, he was retaining highest-level security clearances, and was involved in pioneering work in military psychological operations ("psy-ops").
      </p>
      <p>
       On August 14, 1987, San Francisco police raided Aquino's Russian Hill home, which he shared with his wife Lilith. The raid was in response to allegations that the house had been the scene of a brutal rape of a four-year-old girl. The principal suspect in the rape, a Baptist minister named Gary Hambright, was indicted in September 1987 on charges that he committed "lewd and lascivious acts" with six boys and four girls, ranging in age from three to seven years, during September-October 1986. At the time of the alleged sex crimes, Hambright was employed at a child care center on the U.S. Army base at Presidio. At the time of Hambright's indictment, the San Francisco police charged that he was involved in at least 58 separate incidents of child sexual abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to an article in the October 30, 1987 San Francisco Examiner, one of the victims had identified Aquino and his wife as participants in the child rape. According to the victim, the Aquinos had filmed scenes of the child being fondled by Hambright in a bathtub. The child's description of the house, which was also the headquarters of Aquino's Satanic Temple of Set, was so detailed, that police were able to obtain a search warrant. During the raid, they confiscated 38 videotapes, photo negatives, and other evidence that the home had been the hub of a pedophile ring, operating in and around U.S. military bases."

       I can't vouch for anything in "Conspiracy of Silence" - but the MASSIVE efforts that CONTINUE to occur to keep it hidden definitely intrigue me.

       Isn't the self-defense definition in Florida pretty open-ended though? Like, if you're in an uncomfortable position, you have the right to protect yourself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe George Z. had terrifying dreams of clowns molesting him with Skittles as a kid. Or maybe this racist prick decided that because there was a black kid on the street, he was in danger and needed to "defend himself".

       I've been highly interested in psychopathy lately. I would be curious to know if Zimerman is a psychopath. It's unlikely, but it would be an interesting thing to investigate. You never know what might come up. In the sense that it's useful to know what's going on so that you can make better decisions I like to know as much as possible. If Zimmerman is a psychopath this would, no kidding, be of tremendous relevance relative to how one should deal with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       However this whole black/white racial thing really confuses the issue. Even his own family says this. They only want Zimmerman brought to justice on the grounds that he's a murderer. Which is the most logical thing in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I digress.

       I'm not dismissing knowledge or analysis. It's what makes us human.

       For me, what bothers me is my complete inability to understand how a "normal" person could bring himself to do something like that. As a person with an anxiety disorder, I can get pretty irrational at times for no apparent reason. But even at the height of that, the idea of hurting a kid is unthinkable, even one who would be pissing me off at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take that as a good sign, though. If I could understand, it might mean that I'm easily capable of the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I'm not racist against black people, and I haven't been brought up in an area where that's perfectly acceptable (though racism against Natives/First Nations/Aboriginals/whatever the PC term is these days in Canada is probably close to the same thing). So you're right, that confuses it even further.

       Anxiety, love, remorse and so on are alien to these people. If you look at a brain scan of them you'll see that their pre-frontal cortex is inactive. The only activity is in the base [or reptile] part of the brain. Aggression, territoriality, punishment / reward. These are the markers of a psychopath.

       And I clicked on the link. To my surprise the link works. Which is strange given that the link in my "history" was banned and this one is not. I suddenly want to delete this thread. However, it is interesting that my history has a deleted video and the link is not deleted. Frankly I'm baffled as to how this could happen. I'm also tired. So I'm going to leave this here and go to sleep and leave the wondering to tomorrow.

       I'm not sure what the exact policy is, but there has to be an automatic trigger when enough reports are registered for the same infraction on youtube. I'm thinking of the TSA video that showed how to place things to one side to defeat the back scatter machines. That video was flagged as age inappropriate fairly quickly, but returned to an unblocked state after enough complaints were registered to force a human to look into it. I can't imagine youtube has some poor bastard just going through flags and making off-the-cuff decisions. Not that it should have been removed, but perhaps a certain group of useless people thought it might be a fun game. Not naming any names here, but I doubt it's any group of importance.

       i think they do have humans looking at the flagged videos,i remember reading an article from a guy who worked at youtube and he said that a human actually views every video that gets uploaded to make sure there is no porn or gore and things like that.so i would have to assume that a human would also go and look at a flagged video.

       would you want that job? i would kind of like that gig, for a few months anyway. i cant believe a person views every video that is uploaded. there has to be some sort of software to at least seperate video of people from something where no porn could be present, ahhh but then the gore. weird job.

       The Franklin school pedophilia scandal and cover-up is only one of the biggest of numerous well-documented instances of organized pedophilia by political/intelligence elites in which numerous, sometimes dozens, of children have testified. Another is the McMartin scandal in southern California, in which children were brought from an elementary school through tunnels to a military base and ritualistically raped.
I'm on a chat board that deals with these topics a lot. We have a whole sub-forum about the Franklin scandal:

       "Hate speech" refers to content that promotes hatred against members of a protected group. For instance, racist or sexist content may be considered hate speech. Sometimes there is a fine line between what is and what is not considered hate speech. For instance, it is generally okay to criticize a nation, but not okay to make insulting generalizations about people of a particular nationality.
      </p>
      <p>
       As per the YouTube policy on hate speech. (

       I wish there was a clause somewhere legally binding that forced them to reveal the exact, word for word, offense to the public.

       This is blatant censorship. Great thing about youtube is there's thousands of vigilant people who record streams for repost. Youtube is flooded with conspiracy videos every minute, of every hour, of every day...

       The world is going through an incredible transformation of information awareness. Brzezinski's feared global awakening is taking place. It's quite possibly (the internet) the only reason we are losing so many of our freedoms.

       For me, what bothers me is my complete inability to understand how a "normal" person could bring himself to do something like that. As a person with an anxiety disorder, I can get pretty irrational at times for no apparent reason. But even at the height of that, the idea of hurting a kid is unthinkable, even one who would be pissing me off at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I take that as a good sign, though. If I could understand, it might mean that I'm easily capable of the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, I'm not racist against black people, and I haven't been brought up in an area where that's perfectly acceptable (though racism against Natives/First Nations/Aboriginals/whatever the PC term is these days in Canada is probably close to the same thing). So you're right, that confuses it even further.
