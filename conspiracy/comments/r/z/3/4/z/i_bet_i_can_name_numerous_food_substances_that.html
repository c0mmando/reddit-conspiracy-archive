    <div class="md"><p>Yes in it&#39;s pure form.  This arguement is becoming a circlejerk.  Everyone knows this shit kills you. If it&#39;s pure.  I&#39;d like to see you die trying eat that much aspartame in real food vs taking those sorts of quantities of hard drugs.  I bet you&#39;d die of the food thru exploded stomach rather than aspartame poisoning.  Namely because they use so little of it compared to what it takes to kill you it&#39;s like trying to OD on weed.  You&#39;ll die of smoke inhalation long before then.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course I was referring to the long term effects from the onset, and never was referring to an overdose, or highly irresponsible use...</p>

<p>I&#39;m still quite certain aspartame, and many other food additives, are more toxic than heroin and cocaine...</p>

<p>Heroin is virtually harmless when used properly. The cuts they use are in fact more harmful than the drug it&#39;s self. </p>

<p>I&#39;m completely convinced that with responsible use anyone could use heroin until their dying day without many adverse side effects. I would still exercise, eat regularly, and take a plethora a vitamins to make up for the deficiencies heroin can create...</p>

<p>People suffer adverse side effects because they don&#39;t know how to care for themselves...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah but as a former user I can safely say you&#39;re very very wrong.  As anyone who&#39;s smoked knows, the addiction is a very real symptom.  Your body demands it, it needs it, but each time it&#39;s never enough, each time is never as good as the last time, so you always need more.  Unlike weed or alcohol, heroin isn&#39;t a drug that encourages its own disuse, it promotes overdosing because of the need to get that feeling of your veins being like a jacuzzi again.  </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the addiction.  The physical effects are just as bad...insomnia (did you know you will die without sleep? I didn&#39;t till I ended up in a hospital), diaherria (easy to dehydrate yourself with that stuff) muscle stiffness, headaches, irritability.  All symptoms of using, and they only get worse the longer you go without a fix.  Whereas things like aspartame (which is used only in very small quantities in our food) while addictive and toxic, are not present in amounts which would directly kill us.  Rather they do so indirectly, which is why America is so stereotypically obese.  Aspartame blocks the chemical in your brain that says you&#39;re full, so you keep eating and eating.  Like heroin then, it also encourages overdose, because in this case you don&#39;t know to stop, and it&#39;s easy to eat until you cause serious internal damage.  However that&#39;s not because of the aspartame itself (the chemical makes it possible but) rather it&#39;s because of the food that causes your stomach to expand and your insides to burst</p>

<p>In that case, yes aspartame causes adverse side effects because people don&#39;t know how to take care of themselves...</p>

<p>in the case of heroin however, it will physically destroy your body when you&#39;re using it, and when you don&#39;t use you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;re dying...it&#39;s almost as bad as methamphetamines in that regard.  So hardcore drugs like that way more deadly than what the fcc has decided we can consume.  Heroin and coke are two drugs I can rationalize being illegal, mostly because (unlike someone high on weed or jonesing for some aspartame laden twinkies) I would not trust my well being around someone dosing on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re are speaking of highly irresponsible use. Of course it&#39;s physically addictive, and harmful if you take too much. All chemicals are harmful if you take too much. I used it for years, and the only detrimental effects from it I got were prison and fines...</p>

<p>Insomnia only occurs if you use before bed. Uhm, diarrhea? I was ALWAYS constipated (small price to pay). People only become dehydrated because they sit around neglecting to drink liquids. Muscle stiffness is something I never experienced, as a matter of fact it relaxed my muscles, that&#39;s literally why people die from and OD, it relaxes their breathing to such a degree they don&#39;t take in oxygen.</p>

<p>It will not &quot;physically destroy your body&quot; if used properly and responsibly. I bet I could show you numerous famous people who used heroin their entire lives in the later 1800&#39;s, and died of natural causes.</p>

<p>FACT - Stress is worse for you than heroin. Heroin relieves stress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>heroin does...until it runs out.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s so bad.  It&#39;s a drug that encourages irresponsible use.  Most chemicals that have an addiction make you want more, but few give you such detrimental concequences for disuse...my skin would constantly itch, I would always be wanting another score...and I would always want more than the last time, more more more.  That encourages irresponsible use.  and the arguement that &quot;of course everything&#39;s bad if you use it enough&quot; is rediculous, because in this case heroin has a substantially smaller margin of error, that narrows considerably as your body builds up a tolerence.  I deny anyone to OD on any of the chemicals that are toxic in our food...yet how many times do you hear about people who OD on heroin or blow? it&#39;s because of how it affects your mind, it alters your perceptions, makes you want to take more than you should.  And unless you&#39;ve got someone else keeping you in check every time you use it just brings you one step closer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a perfectly regulated system, MAYBE.  I doubt it though, because of the way heroin reacts with your body it encourages misuse.  It used to be used as a painkiller after all, but the reasn it was outlawed was because of the dependency causeing effects as well as the long term detrimental damage to the body.  This is the sort of thing that Aspartame doesnt as reliably cause, and part of why it&#39;s legal</p>

<p>I would like to prove to the world that a person can use responsibly, heroin, cocaine, etc, for the rest of their lives, and die of natural causes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible?  Sure.</p>

<p>Is it probable?  No.  People don&#39;t have very good self-control and with the mental and physical changes that come with addiction (or even just use) or cocaine and in particular, opiates (see: heroin), it would be very difficult for someone to use over a long period of time without having a negative effect on their life.  </p>

<p>In short, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, and I think it is ignorant and irresponsible to advocate it.</p>

<p>Of course, all this comes with the caveat that I believe that all drugs should be legal and the responsibility for self-preservation lies with the individual.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but you certainly are. Bayer (the inventor of heroin) used it until his dying day, and died of motherfucking natural causes you fuck wad. It&#39;s lack of responsible use that kills people, and adulterants...</p>

<p>You obviously aren&#39;t very philosophical, as YOU DO NOT KNOW THE POINT OF LIFE. I&#39;m not claiming I do either, but until humanity figures out why we exist, there is no FUCKING POINT, and therefore no set way in which we are supposed to live. It&#39;s all just theory.</p>

<p>My problems with heroin were financial, legal, and maybe even spiritual. Make it legal and the first two problems magically fucking disappear. The laws themselves are far more harmful than the drugs.</p>

<p>I seriously can&#39;t stand people like you. You literally think not using drugs somehow makes you a better person, and that&#39;s just so far off base. The things that make us good people have nothing to do with drugs, and anyone can still retain, integrity, honesty, and all that other happy horseshit while using anything under the sun. As a matter of fact, lots of drugs are capable of making people BETTER. My use of LSD, DMT, mushrooms, and other sacred substances has made me a far better person than had I never taken anything. </p>

<p>Any illegal drug on the planet can be used responsibly, and that fact that you think otherwise is just a reflection of the programming you&#39;ve been subjected to throughout your sorry ass life. Get this through your thick skull bitch-- we are chemical beings, we have numerous chemical receptors in our brains DESIGNED to take in such chemicals. Abstinence is nothing more than denial of our chemical make-up...</p>

<p>Besides, it&#39;s not like I have any fucking kids, or serious responsibilities. It&#39;s my life, my body, my money, my freedom, my existence, and I&#39;ll do whatever the fuck I please with it. Know why? Because I fully believe in reincarnation, and if I fuck this life up, I have countless more. Has your puny little brain even pondered such things?</p>

<p>The fact remains, you have no idea why we exist, and therefore have no idea what we are supposed to do with our lives. Who the hell are you to say I&#39;m wrong without having a godly like awareness of why we are here? AFAIC, we are here to learn, and chemistry can speed that along much faster than without.</p>

<p>If one has virtually no responsibilities, why shouldn&#39;t they be able to do what ever the fuck they like? As long as they aren&#39;t harming someone else?</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t uncommon for people to use cocaine and heroin throughout their entire lives in the 1800&#39;s with virtually NO adverse side effects. You simply do not know what you&#39;re talking about, and have been brainwashed by after school specials, and DARE programs...</p>

<p>I bet you didn&#39;t know that it wasn&#39;t uncommon for people to use heroin and cocaine throughout their whole lives in the 1800&#39;s? And... die of natural causes...</p>

<p>Heroin is bad for people because it&#39;s illegal,a nd because people are too stupid to know how to use responsibly. My brother and I were addicts for years, we had the best heroin in town, and we never once OD&#39;ed. The cut, and the adulterants are far worse for you than the drug it&#39;s self.

    <div class="md"><p>diesel I agree with you..Most don&#39;t know but heroin was used in a liquid form as medicine for A LONG FUCKING TIME with no adverse effects. Same goes for marijuana and LSD. Hell shroom&#39;s are said to be one of the most potent forms of antidepressants on the planet with little to no side effects. I don&#39;t understand why your being crucified for being up front and honest about your life. Its kind of sad but people are fucking stupid so what are you going to do you know?</p>

<p>That being said I don&#39;t advocate doing heroin. However I do advocate critical thinking skills which lead me to believe after hours of research that the ingredients you listed are yes in fact FAR WORSE then normal drugs that aren&#39;t cut with impurities of ungodly proportion. Besides this is r/conspiracy...we all know that the drug war is b.s. and the reason for crack was to suppress the black population. I thought it was obvious at this point that our government is just an extremely hypocritical racist with an addiction to money and power over everything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re are speaking of highly irresponsible use. Of course it&#39;s physically addictive, and harmful if you take too much. All chemicals are harmful if you take too much. I used it for years, and the only detrimental effects from it I got were prison and fines...</p>

<p>Insomnia only occurs if you use before bed. Uhm, diarrhea? I was ALWAYS constipated (small price to pay). People only become dehydrated because they sit around neglecting to drink liquids. Muscle stiffness is something I never experienced, as a matter of fact it relaxed my muscles, that&#39;s literally why people die from and OD, it relaxes their breathing to such a degree they don&#39;t take in oxygen.</p>

<p>It will not &quot;physically destroy your body&quot; if used properly and responsibly. I bet I could show you numerous famous people who used heroin their entire lives in the later 1800&#39;s, and died of natural causes.</p>

<p>FACT - Stress is worse for you than heroin. Heroin relieves stress.</p>
