I also want to look in to how Iran has used the Holocaust in it&#39;s positions toward Israel. I want factual based sources and nothing that is overtly anti-semetic.

However, you should be aware that if you deviate from the Holocaust dogma that has been established by the media and academia, and later in life you seek a teaching career or a career in journalism, your paper may be used against you by Zionist fanatics, who have no shame and no decency when it comes to persecuting those who speak or write the truth about the Holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>(Sorry I was looking through old <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> posts and came across this)</p>

<p>Actually, antisemite is a mark of pride. The origins came from the 19th century &quot;German Society of Anti-Semites&quot; a group dedicated to the idea that Jews had an undue amount of influence on society so they must be blocked from membership in to the high-society. Up until the 60s, people were proud to be known as antisemites. It was a label, no different than &quot;Conservative&quot; or &quot;Libertarian&quot;. They firmly believed that putting &quot;The Jew&quot; in his place was the best course of action for society. The term, as it was used in the 19th century, is still applicable today, as one applied to a person who believes that there is a mass conspiracy of Jews to undermine society and that Jews are inherently bad. </p>

<p>If there is any derogatory meaning to it, it&#39;s only because modern society applies derogatory terms to people who want to make ethnic discrimination&#39;s.</p>

<p>The Jews for the most part were simple laborers and how they would declare war on anyone is just an ignorant thing to say altogether.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, a lot of them were Communists, which is why they were executed. As warmongering &quot;Red Rabbi&quot; Stephen Weiss, advisor to  Presidents Wilson and FDR put it in 1942, <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/m/index.php?title=Stephen_Wise&amp;amp;diff=157233&amp;amp;oldid=prev">&quot;Some call it communism, I call it Judaism.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Communism started out as a crypto-Zionist, Jewish-supremacist movement, which is why it was initially largely funded by <a href="http://www.judeofascism.com/2011/12/socialists-admit-there-was-conspiracy.html">Western Jewish bankers,</a> and why <a href="http://www.judeofascism.com/2009/10/stalins-jews-stalins-willing.html">so many Jews implemented its state organized mass murder</a> along with Leninists and Stalinists.</p>

<p>In fact, the Holocaust(TM) as far as Jews were concerned should be correctly viewed as a kind of blowback for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism#Soviet_repressions">the original holocausts</a> perpetrated by these crypto-Zionist Communist Jews against those in the Soviet sphere, such as the Holodomor (egineered famine in Ukraine) and other acts of genocide.</p>

<p>Similarly, the &quot;Palestinian terror&quot; and &quot;Islamic terror&quot; claimed by Zionist Israelis is actually blowback against fascist Zionist aggression that Zionist Jews and their partisans have for decades portrayed as offensives out the clear blue against &quot;innocent&quot; Jews.</p>

<p>Zionist Jews lie through their teeth regularly. It&#39;s part of their culture and racket. Thanks to the Internet, the world can increasingly see the massive lie that is the entire Zionist narrative, painstakingly constructed by the Jewish racket and its left-right partners in crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll help by summing it up for you.</p>

<p>*The Nazis didn&#39;t like the Jews because the Jews worked against Germany between World War I and II to keep Germany in poverty.</p>

<p>*When the Nazis came to power, the Jews declared war on them.</p>

<p>*The Nazis built concentration camps to hold the enemies of Germany during war time, and some of those enemies were Jews.</p>

<p>*The Jews enjoyed very good treatment for a few years, but toward the end of the war conditions in the camps became very bad due to overcrowding and lack of supplies (the Allies bombed the supply lines).</p>

<p>*Typhus and starvation killed several hundred thousand of Jews in the camps.</p>

<p>*After the War ended, Jews decided there was money to be made by playing on German and Allied guilt.</p>

<p>*They invented the Holocaust by gathering together a bunch of separate events that happened to Jews during the War years, and calling them all by the simple name Holocaust, which had mythic and religious associations for Jews.</p>

<p>*They arbitrarily declared that six million Jews had died, because six million is a magic number in Talmudic lore.</p>

<p>*They spent the next 60-plus years screwing money out of Germany and Austria and any other place they could screw for all it was worth.</p>

<p>*They turned this semi-mythical Holocaust that they had invented for profit into a new Zionist religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I actually study in Israel right now and recently got back from Poland to tour the concentration camps from this &quot;non-existent&quot; holocaust. I can find a few flaws from your summary of this extremely exaggerated event of which you speak.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SOME Jews, as in the Rothschild family and other wealthy banking families, the same ones that have screwed over billions over the years, worked against Germany between World War I and II. However Jews fought for Germany during World War I, the assimilated ones.</p></li>
<li><p>The Jews for the most part were simple laborers and how they would declare war on anyone is just an ignorant thing to say altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>The Germans had an order to their Reich, and the Jews were on the bottom rung. If you weren&#39;t Aryan, chances are you were going to die. A majority of the &quot;enemies&quot; on these camps were Jews. Simple, honest, Jews. </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;d consider being forcibly removed from your home and shoved into a ghetto as &quot;very good treatment&quot;. Then being taken by cattle car into a camp (those ones that I guess I didn&#39;t see with my own two eyes), and either sent to a gas chamber or work until death. Also there are stories of torture, forced starvation, and countless other terrible atrocities, but all those must be lies by the people with fake tattoos on their arms.</p></li>
<li><p>Typhus and starvation killed several hundred thousand of Jews in the camps, as well as Zyklon B gas.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Holocaust was not made up, people living lives independent of Germany for hundreds if not a thousand years were completely wiped out. The simple farmhand, or dairy man, or butcher from a town in northern Poland did not declare war on the Jews. Also it was the Germans that kept such great records of their great Nazi enterprise. How do you explain the ranks of Nazi officials stating that they sought to wipe out the Jewish religion.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for you </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a reason Hitler hated the Jews. He hated them because, in his opinion (and he was not a stupid man) they were largely responsible for the defeat of Germany in WW1 and the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Verseilles, and indeed for the hyper-inflation that brought the entire nation of Germany to the brink of starvation. And yes, poor Jews starved too, but it was the Jews with wealth and power who caused the disaster and who refused to take measures to moderate it. At any rate, Hitler thought so, and a great many Germans agreed with him.</p>

<p>When international Jewery declared war on Germany, after the Nazis took power, it only confirmed this antagonism. Now I ask you, how could the Nazis simply allow Jews to function throughout Germany in the usual way, during wartime, when international Jewery had explicitly published a declaration of war against Germany? They had to put the Jews into camps, just as in North America Japanese were put into camps. Sure, today we can say how terrible that was ... but we are looking back with 20/20 hindsight, and at the time it seemed, not only a good idea, but absolutely necessary for the security of the state. You can&#39;t let enemies wander around your country in time of war, subverting your war effort.</p>

<p>You say you didn&#39;t see people being taken by cattle cars to camps. I don&#39;t imagine you saw them put into gas chambers, either. It&#39;s a funny thing, how few eye-witness accounts there are, and those that exist are so heavily laden with emotion and drama, they almost sound like folklore or fantasy. Many of the eye-witness acounts of the killings of Jews have been <em>proven</em> to be straight-out lies. You do know this, don&#39;t you? As for those not proven to be lies, I can only say that eye-witness testimony is not reliable if the witness is lying, or if, because of trauma, he is unable to distinguish between fiction and truth. Many <em>rumors</em> circulated around the camps. Lamps made of human skin. Large scale factories to transform human fat into soap. No doubt many inmates of the camps believed them, but they were untrue.</p>

<p>Of course, Jews died in the War. So did a great many non-Jews. It was a war. And not all accounts of their deaths are lies ... but not all are true, either.</p>

<p>In my own experience, I&#39;ve observed that the more horrible a story is, the more likely people are to accept it as true. The stories about the executions of Jews in the concentration camps are quite horrible. I would suggest that no one automatically accept them without questioning whether they violate simple common sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there were no gas chambers. I don&#39;t know if there were or not. I do know that fewer Jews died in the camps than the Holocaust dogma claims to have died. I do know that many of the eye-witness testimonies were outright lies or fantasies. I know that there is no written evidence of a plan by Hitler and his generals to exterminate the Jews, and that the crematoria at Auschwitz were inadequate to burn the bodies that they are claimed to have burned by supporters of the Holocaust dogma.</p>

<p>I also know that most people are incapable of even having a coherent discussion about the Holocaust, it is so charged in their minds with emotion. It has become a new religion, and anyone who questions it is automatically excommunicated as a heretic. However, truth doesn&#39;t give a fuck about fanatical religious beliefs. It is what it is. There is good reason to question many of the details of the Holocaust dogma. The supposed numbers of Jews killed have been gradually coming down over the decades, although for religious reasons the Six Million number is never challenged. This results in comic inconsistencies which, however, the true believers in the Holocaust religion close their eyes to.</p>

<p>Maybe when enough years have passed, people will be able to look at the Holocaust dogma with less emotion, and they may then be able to form a less crazed narrative of what really happened, and what caused it. I&#39;m wasting my time talking to you, as I well know. But I am not really speaking to you, through this text, but to someone who is reading this, who may just possess enough independence of thought to ask some questions about the Holocaust. That would make this post worth the effort.</p>

<p>If the popular consensus said there were 1,000,000 Jews in Germany, but this document said there were 600,000 then that would be something worthy of underlining. However, the popular consensus agrees that there were ~600,000-500,000 Jews in Germany.

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, if you want a demonstration of the vast critical thinking skills of ImJulianAssange, look no further. There is no need to take this man seriously from here on in.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> </p>

<p>He, like the publisher of that document, believe that since there were 600,000 Jews in Germany in the pre-WWII years, that this is <em>evidence</em> that six million Jews couldn&#39;t have died in the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Displaying a complete ignorance of history, lacking all critical thinking skills, immersed in propaganda, ImJulianAssange fails to realize that... wait for it... <em>there were Jews outside of Germany that died in the Holocaust.</em></p>

<p>ImJulianAssange does not know of the three million Polish Jews who vanished. Nor does he know of the 450,000 Hungarian Jews, 900,000 Ukranian Jews, 300,000 Romanian Jews and so forth. You are a <em>denier of genocide</em>.</p>

<p><strong>ImJulianAssange</strong>, if you lack the mental capacity to understand my original post for the subtle jab it was, then you are never to be taken seriously again.</p>

<p>It is. All I wanted to point out was that it was an unusual fact to highlight. The obvious implication of that is that they intended to show that 6 mil Jews couldn&#39;t have died in the Holocaust... but I cannot see how they drew that conclusion from that.

<p>You&#39;re mistaken. I don&#39;t know what seventy times seven means. However, the six million figure is composed of exact figures of destroyed Jewish lives from all of the European nations. It is not a signifier for any arbitrarily large number, such as the word &quot;myriad&quot; (ten thousand). </p>

<p>The Russians weren&#39;t targeted for systematic extermination. 90% of the Russian population wasn&#39;t destroyed. Did you know 90% of the three-million-strong Polish Jewish population simply ceased to exist? They were deliberately destroyed by Nazi policy.</p>

<p>I repeat: </p>

<p>The 500,000 and 600,000 difference is not relevant to my post. It was to show that the figure is more or less historically accurate, therefore uncontroversial and unworthy of highlighting. I was simply saying that the fact that they underlined the 600,000 Jews in Germany like it meant something shows basic illiteracy. They were interpreting it to mean all the Jews in Europe, whereas the article distinctly states Jews of Germany. Therefore that they attempt to allude to any conclusion is laughable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes! These moments are what keep me going. I didn&#39;t even think you were this bad. </p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, if you want a demonstration of the vast critical thinking skills of ImJulianAssange, look no further. There is no need to take this man seriously from here on in.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em> </p>

<p>He, like the publisher of that document, believe that since there were 600,000 Jews in Germany in the pre-WWII years, that this is <em>evidence</em> that six million Jews couldn&#39;t have died in the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Displaying a complete ignorance of history, lacking all critical thinking skills, immersed in propaganda, ImJulianAssange fails to realize that... wait for it... <em>there were Jews outside of Germany that died in the Holocaust.</em></p>

<p>ImJulianAssange does not know of the three million Polish Jews who vanished. Nor does he know of the 450,000 Hungarian Jews, 900,000 Ukranian Jews, 300,000 Romanian Jews and so forth. You are a <em>denier of genocide</em>.</p>

<p><strong>ImJulianAssange</strong>, if you lack the mental capacity to understand my original post for the subtle jab it was, then you are never to be taken seriously again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not fooling anyone and only outing yourself with the Hasbara tactics: pejoratives (&quot;the revisionists&quot;, &quot;childish misunderstanding of history&quot;); red herring (changing the subject -from one of total and complete exaggeration to one of negligible significance).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you sir are a hypocrite, using pejoratives in your posts yourself. (&quot;YUSTUPID?&quot;) Bringing the word Hasbara into this exchange is also an example of a <em>red herring</em>. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I&#39;m preserving his post in case he decides to change it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>YUSTUPID?</p>

<p>The hasbara do exactly what you are trying to do: make a big deal out of nothing and derail the investigation with an irrelevant topic in order to divert attention from the vital issues.</p>

<p>*<em>The popular consensus DOES NOT agree that there were only 600,000-500,000 Jews in Germany. The popular consensus is &quot;the six million&quot;. *</em>*</p>

<p>You are not fooling anyone and only outing yourself with the Hasbara tactics: pejoratives (&quot;the revisionists&quot;, &quot;childish misunderstanding of history&quot;); red herring (changing the subject -from one of total and complete exaggeration to one of negligible significance).</p>

<p>You also throw in your 6,000,000 as just a simple mistake: &quot;You thought we meant 6 million jews? Don&#39;t be silly we meant 6 million people&quot;.</p>
