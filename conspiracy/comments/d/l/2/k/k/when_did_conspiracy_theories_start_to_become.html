        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please don&#39;t get me wrong.  This is not an attack on any individual, or any group of people, but rather an attack on a mindset that is damaging to everyone.</p>

<p>In my life I&#39;ve read a lot about conspiracy theories.  You name it, I&#39;ve read about it.  A good theory, to me, is one that has a consistent train of evidence from the very foundation of the theory up to the highest incarnation; every step of the way is linked, demonstrably &amp; verifiably, to the following step.  A bowl of logical spaghetti with a creamy scary topping, if you will.  It was, in essence, investigative journalism.  People who hold conspiratorial beliefs, when asked about famous conspiracy theories that were proved beyond a shadow of a doubt to be true, will often mention Watergate as a great example, along with Iran-Contra, etc.  The connection between these conspiracy theories isn&#39;t as cosmetic as the perpetrators of the deeds, but the method by which they were discovered and brought to light.  That method was accurate investigation.  After all, if the people holding these suspicions couldn&#39;t convince anyone <em>else</em> of their suspicions, they&#39;d have no hope in hell in bringing these nefarious plots to the public&#39;s eye and effecting change.</p>

<p>Which, sadly, brings me to today.  It seems, thanks to the internet, that lots of rather scattered conspiracy theories get all sorts of publicity, finding vocal believers with a less-than-stellar grasp of critical thinking.  It&#39;s sad, because each and every one of the theories has a chance to be true, but we never get to find out, as the people holding the theories (with the information and/or observations), don&#39;t bother to get a coherent line of evidence from their observations to the perpetrators; the shadowy schemes are never properly investigated.  It&#39;s almost as if a hunch constitutes evidence.  The worst part is, many believers simply won&#39;t listen to reason.</p>

<p>It&#39;s scary, as this disorganisation among the people with the mindset to investigate, is the perfect way for the conspiratorial perpetrators to remain hidden.  It&#39;s almost playing right into the hands of the very people this group of people want&#39;s to protect themselves (and others) from.  It seems to be the best example of counter-productivity I can think of.</p>

<p>Again, please don&#39;t consider this an attack on conspiracy theories in general, or the holders thereof.  It&#39;s a warning against lazy reasoning, and a &quot;meh, it&#39;ll do&quot; attitude towards a lack of evidence.  Without evidence, there is no theory.  There is only a gut feeling, and it will always remain a gut feeling, until evidence is found to elevate it.  We should not expect to find the evidence we are looking for, and when we don&#39;t, we must admit we <em>might</em> be wrong.  Without doing that, we can not distinguish the wheat from the chaff, the signal from the noise.</p>

<p>Does anyone else share this opinion?  Do you think the level of critical thinking demonstrated among the various online communities dedicated to conspiratorial investigation is adequate, or even too much?</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Are the online conspiracy theorist communities doing more harm than good by frequently not requiring stringent evidence before claiming something is true, rather than claiming something <em>might</em> be true, but has yet to be determined?</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, focusing solely on 9/11 (not specifically building 7, not any thing specifically - just the general event, itself). There is actually more evidence to <em>contradict</em> the 9/11 commission report than there is to support it (sorry to dredge this up, but it&#39;s like the &quot;magic bullet&quot; theory - maybe someday Arlen Specter will die and we can do a real investigation of that, too). So, this brings us to a dilemma: If the 9/11 commission&#39;s report is so flawed, who do we trust to tell us the truth? People who are being ridiculed by those same &quot;powers that be&quot;? It&#39;s a catch 22, being played very effectively by the power elite. Anyone who defies them doesn&#39;t ever see the light of MSM, thus they become Internet underground... and, thus, the clickclickclick until 2am crowd (trying to find out what the MSM isn&#39;t telling them, and why).</p>

<p>And, on a tongue-in-cheek note,...</p>

<p>And, Dubya said, on national TV, 9/12/01, with great <em>emphasis</em> &quot;Don&#39;t believe the conspiracy theorists!&quot; Uh... and why is that so important on that day? Because &quot;they&quot; (illuminati or whatever) knew it was coming, and Dubya was assigned with the task of rallying the stupid against them (conspiracy theorists).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is yet another catch 22, though (or, just an extension of the one I already desribed). The power vacuum is being created by those same powerful world figures via the elimination of the middle class (in conspiracy theory speak, this is &quot;the Zionist agenda&quot;) and it&#39;s quite famously depicted in &#39;The Aristocrats&#39; joke (tired of finding that link, it should be familiar by now - if not, just google for it and click the wikipedia link; good explanation there).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A power vacuum occurs when there is suddenly no one in power, so the &#39;Zionists&#39; taking out the middle class would still not create one - secondly, blaming the Jews is fucked up - and I said I&#39;d rather seem the elites use their power for GOOD (not turning the middle class into paupers) than see an actual power vacuum.

    <div class="md"><p>Allow me to rephrase. Obama, who started out from a platform of &quot;transparency&quot;, has turned into yet another &quot;status quo&quot; president. This happens with <em>every</em> presidency at some point. They get cornered into deal-making while pushing one agenda, completely compromising everything else. So, we gained a health care bill in exchange for increased emphasis on the power of the presidency (ala, not terminating the PATRIOT Act, but rather extending it and expanding the power of the presidency). This creates a situation in which the office of the President is, itself, a power vacuum controlled by non-elected influences. Obama <em>attempted</em> to limit lobbyist influence, but in the end just diverted those forces elsewhere, where they seem to actually have <em>more</em> influence (boy, the pharmaceutical industry sure made out like bandits on that health care bill). The power vacuum <strong>is</strong> the current government. NO ONE is in charge, really. They&#39;re all marionettes.</p>

<p>Just because I referenced &quot;the Zionist agenda&quot; does not mean I&#39;m blaming &quot;the Jews&quot;. I&#39;m simply pointing to the obvious influences. I could have listed all of the groups from Bilderberg to Freemasons to Zionists, but that&#39;s a lot to list. I was just making the easily recognizable point that non-governmental influences are &quot;in charge&quot;, no matter how you slice it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you quite understand why conspiracy theory come up in the first place.  It used to be that the conspiracy theory community would be the first to debunk anything that did not make sense.  They would require hard evidence and oftentimes caused real news articles to print retractions.  Once all the bogus evidence and &quot;official&quot; reports were debunked, this left a void that was filled with a plausible scenario from the facts that remained.</p>

<p>Today, there are mis-information conspiracy theories because if someone is hiding the truth, then plausible conspiracy theories must be ridiculed or discredited.</p>

<p>Not only that, but much of REAL science is done by ridicule.  Take a look at climate change agendas.  You can believe in it all you want, but anyone that says they don&#39;t believe in AGW will be ridiculed.  The physics community is notorious for this kind of thing.  And good luck if you&#39;re in a field where you need to use really expensive equipment in order to publish your paper. </p>

<p>So does a &quot;hunch&quot; constitute evidence?  Unfortunately, that ends up happening when so little evidence remains.  The real issue is the coverups.  In today&#39;s world, asking for evidence such as Obama&#39;s birth certificate gets you a one way ticket to the insane asylum.  Just the idea of researching evidence is ridiculed.  So no, it&#39;s not the conspiracy theorist communities that are doing more harm than good.  It&#39;s that mainstream news of today is conspiracy theories of four years ago.  That had to be put to a stop lest conspiracy theories become credible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I&#39;m talking about.  Has anyone seen evidence that Obama wasn&#39;t born in the US?  No?  Then why do people demand evidence of his birth certificate (which was released, anyway).  That&#39;s still a rather hot topic in some conspiracy circles.</p>

<p>No one has seen evidence that Obama WAS born in the US either.  And no, the BC was never released.  What you&#39;re doing is supporting the ridiculing of people who want evidence.  That&#39;s a really despicable attitude to have regardless what the topic is.  If people want evidence, then LET THEM.  No matter how ridiculous you think the topic is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is impossible to ridicule the facts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you on?  You should take a look at the physics community.  They do it all the time.  It&#39;s a professional survival requirement to be able to ridicule the facts.  And the whole AGW scene is ridiculing anyone that brings forth any facts contradicting their preconceived notions.  Ridicule is always used to shut down facts.  There are still people defending the hockey stick graph even though it&#39;s been debunked countless times.  No amount of facts will convince AGW proponents that believe in Mann and his graph.  They will ridicule anyone and everyone that tries to show them the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh for fuck&#39;s sake.  This is my entire fucking point.  Rational thought is something you are obviously not familiar with.  Thanks for giving everyone a great view into the workings of a broken mind.  Critical thinking isn&#39;t just a good idea, it&#39;s necessary to know anything.  May I suggest you try?</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s birth in Hawaii has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.  People who criticise AGW <em>are</em> idiots, because there is overwhelming evidence to suggest it&#39;s happening, and it&#39;s a fallacy to think for a second that the immense pollution human kind has spewed into the world isn&#39;t going to change anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you answered your own question.  You believe in things that aren&#39;t true, so you see alternate explanation and because they contradict your notion of reality, you think they are nuts and that it&#39;s casting a bad image over the conspiracy theory communities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People who criticise AGW are idiots</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scientists will tell you that there is too much uncertainty in their data.  So are you oppose bringing facts forward that shows this uncertainty?  Evidence that the scientists themselves have to deal with?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>because there is overwhelming evidence to suggest it&#39;s happening</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No there isn&#39;t.  The CO2 feedback mechanism required for runaway global warming has never been found.  The upper limit for this feedback mechanism has already been reduced drastically.  It never made the local or national news, but it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>I believe humanity does affect the climate.  I believe we should use cleaner energy.  But I also want to know exactly how much we are affecting the climate before we make radical changes.  No one has yet been able to state what percentage is due to human activity and how much is due to natural variations.</p>

<p>Do you know how they know that AGW is real?  Because they can&#39;t explain it with anything else.  I shit you not.  That&#39;s their proof.  That&#39;s why they fought so long to eliminate the MWP where it was warmer than it is today.</p>

<p>And about Obama&#39;s birth, why is Obama spending millions to keep it secret if it&#39;s already been proven?  You&#39;re missing the bigger picture.  It&#39;s not the birth certificate.  It&#39;s the fact that Obama has restricted access to everything about him.  His college records have been sealed.  His medical records are sealed.  His papers are all sealed.  Access to evidence is restricted.  So if you believe it&#39;s ok to call people crazy just because they want evidence, then you have nothing to stand on.  Your argument falls flat.  You have nothing to bring to the table.  You cannot ask anyone for proof of their argument since that&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Creationism is a fable, dating back to a time before science had anything to offer. The creation story in the Bible is, ironically, shorter than the whole length of the comments on this page, but is given more attention by &quot;science&quot; than any other aspect of religion, spiritualism, or philosophy. I&#39;m not defending church dogma, mind you. But, let&#39;s not get too out of hand in our slinging of terms. Creationism is <em>not</em> a &quot;theory&quot;. It&#39;s a story, a fable, a life-lesson handed down through generations which eventually got put into writing and handed down further; it is an explanation for what was unexplainable at the time. For thousands of years, there was nothing better to supercede it. But, it is most definitely <em>not</em> a &quot;theory&quot;... nor is it a &quot;guess&quot;.</p>

The theory part is the theory of natural selection, we also have a theory that the earth used to be just a dust cloud, and that there used to be dinosaurs, but without a time machine we need to use the evidence that science finds.

    <div class="md"><p>But people aren&#39;t losing credibility.  Look at Alex Jones and David Icke.  They both exhibit signs of serious mental illness, and don&#39;t provide any evidence for their nonsensical ramblings.  They are gaining credibility if anything.  It&#39;s far worse now.  Now all someone has to do is claim that something is because of some evil government cabal, refuse to produce any evidence supporting their claim, and then <strong>demand</strong> to be believed.  Loads of people then see their guesswork, agree that it sounds like the truth (not exercising any critical thinking in the process), and jump on the bandwagon.  Go to any conspiracy website and you will see a few decent, critically-minded people drowning in a sea of retards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is yet another catch 22, though (or, just an extension of the one I already desribed). The power vacuum is being created by those same powerful world figures via the elimination of the middle class (in conspiracy theory speak, this is &quot;the Zionist agenda&quot;) and it&#39;s quite famously depicted in &#39;The Aristocrats&#39; joke (tired of finding that link, it should be familiar by now - if not, just google for it and click the wikipedia link; good explanation there).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evolution is a fact. Saying that it is not is like saying that mutations are not real. The theory part is the theory of natural selection, we also have a theory that the earth used to be just a dust cloud, and that there used to be dinosaurs, but without a time machine we need to use the evidence that science finds. The debate lies in the fact that there is no specific amount of evidence required for something to be &quot;proven&quot;, and there is not an appointed judge of what is evidence and what is proven in the realm of science. </p>

<p>There are theories, theories that scientists accept as facts, and then there is math. </p>

<p>Therefore, half the population is of above average intelligence</p>

<p>As someone who is above average, let me state that the MAJORITY of you are pretty fucking dumb, and you seem to like it that way.</p>
