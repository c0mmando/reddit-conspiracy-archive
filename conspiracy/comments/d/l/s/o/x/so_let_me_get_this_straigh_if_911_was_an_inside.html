       Some people say that 9/11 CANNOT be an inside job cause somebody wh'd have blown the whistle, I use this human testing of deadly disease as evidence that indeed a government can keep a secret when doing some fucked up shit.
So in summary that arguement doesnt fly.

       People will already have an intuitive understanding of the situation or not.  Someone that is throwing up retarded ideas such as "I didn't hear no conspiracy whistle" at this point in 2010 are too far woven into their world view to be able to accept new ideas without having serious life dilemma.  If they wanted to know then they would ask then next ten people what they felt about the issue and one of them would provide the necessary information.

       I'll talk someones ears off if they want to hear about the shit that I know.  I've learned to not get anywhere near the conversation with people that don't care much.  It does everyone a great disservice because it wastes your energy  and then they resent you because of it.

       Testing shit on down trodden people is a hell of a lot more simple then pulling off a 9/11 act that is being broad casted live from a hundred different angles.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as testing, they have done it so many times that we can't possible know about every time that it happens.  I do however know about some of the tests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important thing to know is that governments are capable of doing any of this shit again as soon as tomorrow.

       Maybe the perps look at the populace of the US as a down trodden people, a second class people, people to be exploited and used for their own first class uses.

       why don't you conspiracy cunts argue this guy instead of downvoting him.  this is why conspiracy is the worst subreddit here, they claim to be all intellectual and above everyone else because 'they know the truth' then when someone actually wants to discuss it, they get downvoted and are never responded to.

       Oh I get it now.  I didn't say that the Jews did it.  Now while I definitely wasn't ruling out Jews, I didn't implicate Jews in my abstraction there so that angers some people.  I said that governments do stuff and many people here are on a mission that no organization will be targeted but the Jews.  I'm fairly sure that is what is going on.

       Its not always redditors doing the downvoting.  It would be a mistake to automatically assume that I was downvoted because of a slight disagreement in style.  On at least one other occasion I have seen an outsiders come in and obliterate someone down to -40.  It was obvious.  And -1 is not exactly bad here so as long as people can read it then its ok.

       I have more then enough good karma from my monthly fart joke on the main channel to make up for the conspiracy wrapped in an enigma that is the outside downvote.

       The US govt did radiation experiments on civilians without their knowledge including at UCSF - there was a big article in the SF Weekly about it after the news broke.
