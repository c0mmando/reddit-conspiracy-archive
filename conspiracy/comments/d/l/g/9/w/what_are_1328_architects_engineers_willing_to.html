       Take several moments at least to consider the evidence being put forward by them.  The focal points are arguments about causes and effects in the physical world about the 3 towers that fell that day.  This is physics and science being discussed through the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next day 67 press conferences were held across the US about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former U.S. Senator from Alaska Mike Gravel noted (starts at 25:00) in this Press Conference "critically important evidence has come forward after the original government building reports were completed." He states that a new commission should be granted subpoena power and full access to all governmental files and personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is that so difficult?

       Bill, thanks for sharing. 
It makes a lot of sense for me the danger to ones well-being due to being being branded as a nut, unprofessional, and unfit to give a professional opinion once one goes on the record with not agreeing with the official story.  That is why I have respect for these people who are staking their reps on it. BTW, I also respect the folks who don't go public.

       What is interesting, i mean like 'grab-the-popcorn-this-is-gonna-be-interesting' to me is that there are now media campaigns making headlines that are revisiting this topic.  Check out

       I didn't know about the large oil supply in the basement.  Can you source that? 
The building collapsed
       <strong>
        in to itself
       </strong>
       .  Just thinking about the physics, it seems that building would
       <strong>
        tip
       </strong>
       over.  Or if it collapses in to itself, it seems to fail in segments at a time.  But to fully come down that quickly, under 15 seconds...something doesn't add up for me.

       "A cleanup is underway to remove tens of thousands of gallons of oil that spilled from 7 World Trade Center when the 47-story office tower collapsed on Sept. 11, according to a published report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Citing an environmental impact report made public by the Empire State Development Corp., Newsday reported Thursday that 130,000 gallons of oil leaked from the Con Edison substation contained within the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional oil leaked from two 6,000-gallon storage tanks owned by Salomon Smith Barney, and conduits beneath the building may have contained asbestos and feeder lines wrapped in a material containing toxins, the report said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two 11,690-gallon diesel fuel tanks operated by Silverstein Properties were also inside the building, but were removed in March and April and showed no evidence of spillage, Newsday said. "

       That does not mean it did not burn, just that it did not all burn. 10,000 gallons could have burned and still have had a major leak.

       You're gonna have muscle aches from a stretch like that. For a building with  so much fire that it collapsed from burning even though it was mostly granite, concrete and steel, a huge amount of diesel was left intact.  add up the spillage and explain  why that much  diesel didn't catch fire.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Absolutely not. That is cartoon physics, that is lego physics. The forces on a building are straight down. It would tip over if either the bottom were blown out on one side or it were pushed over. Buildings do not fall sideways, they fall down.

      <p>
       Once a collapse starts it goes pretty quickly. The collapsing piece hit lower already weakened pieces and they collapse from the blow and the shock wave continues down.

       Many of the engineers are in fields other than structural engineering, such as electrical engineering. Many of the architects are residential or landscape architects. That hardly qualifies them to analyze the structural collapse of the WTC towers. As citizens, they have the right to make their views heard. But it's disingenuous at best to tout the number 1328 Architects and Engineers as meaningful of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not impressed that Joe the retired landscape architect is willing to stake his reputation. His reputation adds no value. Indeed, argument by imminent authority is a pretty weak argument. Show me the peer-reviewed science, not press conferences.

       @PipeArrow thanks for your response.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point you bring up is true: "Many of the engineers are in fields other than structural engineering"  but I don't think it is disingenuous or misleading to say that they don't stake their reputations as professionals (putting themselves out there as 'conspiracy theorists' which could damage their reputation for getting more jobs or if already retired; questioning the integrity of their previous work) and their social identity/well-being (subjecting themselves to being pre-judged, misrepresented, and easily dismissed).  I disagree with you and am  impressed that these folks are exposing themselves and their beliefs in a new independent investigation of the 3 towers, publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though they are not all structural engineers they have studied physics more than your average joe.  The idea here is to look at the physics.  The idea is to understand the methodology of how the events were measured and explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings up a short tangent, if you will,  a high-school physics teacher, David Chandler who participates in
       <a href="http://www.journalof911studies.com/">
        Journal for 911 Studies
       </a>
       peer-reviewed journal was part of the reason why NIST revised their report as seen here:
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDvNS9iMjzA#t=1m00s">
        see 1:00
       </a>
       . I mention this because one doesn't have to be an engineer but just oriented with the laws of physics to revise a document that top structural engineers in the US have written about the events that day.  A not just a small typo type of revision.  A huge pink elephant in the room revision. And it seems as if they don't really address it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be happy to show you peer-reviewed science if I could find it,
       <a href="http://911blogger.com/node/19761">
        well I actually have
       </a>
       but I feel skeptical that any respectable journal would touch this with a 10 foot pole because of the incendiary (pun intended) controversy.

       Why is it difficult?  Because no one has seen that sort of event before, and there will be hitherto-unknown phenomena, which some people will attribute to some sort of conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the scientific method?  Hardly.  The guy starts out making all sorts of logical fallacies, and then goes on from there.  Don't kid yourself.

       To be honest, I don't know how I feel about the 9/11 conspiracy but I'll play devil's advocate for a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you're right and some hitherto-unknown phenomena caused all three towers to collapse, why wouldn't we want to learn more about it so we can prevent it from happening again in the future? These architects &amp; engineers raise some excellent questions and
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       to have poked holes in several 'official' arguments and are trying to solve issues (like the WTC7 collapse) that
       <em>
        weren't even brought up in the official investigation.
       </em>
       I think the main argument you
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       hear from 9/11 'truthers' is, if the government is telling the truth about the events that took place on 9/11, and there is seemingly good evidence to support a conspiracy theory, why won't they release key pieces of evidence to disprove them? (ie: the video tapes of the plane hitting the Pentagon, reasons for chemical traces of thermite in the rubble, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, just playing devil's advocate.

       @Dalix
I appreciate you bringing some neutrality to the thread.  I really enjoy neutrality but tend to get a little worked up when I try to express myself.  I feel triggered when I don't get heard or if someone just dismisses something I say without even thinking about it. I might tend to sound defensive, but to be honest that is just my own process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your point is valid, I don't understand why there is no transparency.

       I am in agreement with you that because of the novelty of the phenomena some people would knee-jerk the conspiracy card.  But on closer analysis, the phenomena of 1 steel frame skyscraper (WTC 7) completely 'failing' due to fire which has never happened in history except 2 more precedents
       <strong>
        on the same day
       </strong>
       WTC 1 and 2. Sir,  that would raise eyebrows of anyone studying statistical analysis.

      <p>
       I'm not kidding myself, I am convinced enough to see the validity of an independent investigation of the physics of that day to happen.  What logical fallacies are you pointing to, btw?
