    <div class="md"><p>A claim that a bomb went off does not constitute a witness to a bomb going off.</p>

<p>A loud noise may be from an explosion, and an explosion may be from a deliberate bomb. If (??) there are plausible non-bomb explanations of these perceptions then the bomb idea deserves no greater importance than the others.</p>

<p>Besides, hundreds of witnesses and cameras saw the goddamn bulilding collapsing from the strike point downwards, not starting from ground level. Either there was no bomb in the basement, or any such bomb failed to compromise the foundations. Just because we may have difficulty <em>imagining</em> how noises in a basement can be caused from an event that occurred 97 stories above it does not change the fact that the collapse was <em>not</em> caused by a bomb in the <em>basement</em>.</p>

<p>Finding creative explanations is great when they work, but cutting the crap is a fulltime responsibility.</p>

<p>Video of the collapses, broadcast live and worldwide, show massive high speed projectiles, weighing many tons, that explode in air, and then the smaller pieces explode into even smaller pieces.  It&#39;s not the walls-come-tumbling-down; it&#39;s massive pieces of wall projected vertically at a high rate of speed, then exploding in the air into a star shaped burst, streaking into all directions, and then those smaller pieces exploding again.</p>

<p>This is not conspiracy theory; this is a fact.  This was not caused by fire and gravity; this was caused by incendiaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I agree.<br/>
Because the OP didn&#39;t post a proper link, I kinda assumed he was talking about <em>the noises heard at ground level</em>, which at one point were claimed to be explosions in the basement but which are unlikely to have been from incendiaries going off 97 floors above them because at that distance it could not be loud enough, and certainly not linkable to bombs <em>during</em> the collapse due to surrounding normal collapse noise.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to be very specific about what I disagreed with.</p>

<p>In general I believe there is too much other evidence (not the ground level noises) that points to incendiaries in the mid level of the building rather than simple gravity pancaking. It&#39;s just that, if you let one falsehood or non seqitur through, where can one draw the line? I hope you see what I mean, even if you disagree about the noises.</p>

<p>The only verified conspiracy going on here is the 9/11 Commission.
We will never know what happened that day.</p>

<p>You can only accept or reject a theory based on direct evidence supporting or discrediting that theory, not because it&#39;s the only one you cannot reject. There might be an explanation you had not thought of. </p>
