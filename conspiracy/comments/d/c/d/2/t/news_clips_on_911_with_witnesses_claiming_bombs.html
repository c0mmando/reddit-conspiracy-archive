       They heard loud noises that they interpreted as explosions. Do you know what an explosion sounds like up close? Or do you just think you do from TV and movies?
      </p>
      <p>
       The building would have been making a LOT of noise after an impact like it took. Those sounds would have traveled down the elevator shafts and other openings and sounded like they were happening right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Civilians with no personal experience in these sorts of situations do not constitute proof of anything.

       I learned all I need to know about explosives from youtube videos and hollywood action films. That shit was definitely an explosion. Bombs go bang. That went bang. What more is there to say? Even some guy who was there said that "[WTC] 7 is exploding [due to a bomb]", is that not proof? He was RIGHT THERE.

       Right, they still only heard a noise.  It's not "proof" of a bomb.  Only "proof" of an explosion.  Explosions can be caused by other things, a gas line maybe or simply supports giving way under high stress of a damaged building

       It's not proof of an explosion. Loud rumbly noises can be caused by other things, e.g. bits of buildings falling over, lightning, things breaking. But you are right when you say explosion doesn't imply a bomb.

       A claim that a bomb went off does not constitute a witness to a bomb going off.
      </p>
      <p>
       A loud noise may be from an explosion, and an explosion may be from a deliberate bomb. If (??) there are plausible non-bomb explanations of these perceptions then the bomb idea deserves no greater importance than the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, hundreds of witnesses and cameras saw the goddamn bulilding collapsing from the strike point downwards, not starting from ground level. Either there was no bomb in the basement, or any such bomb failed to compromise the foundations. Just because we may have difficulty
       <em>
        imagining
       </em>
       how noises in a basement can be caused from an event that occurred 97 stories above it does not change the fact that the collapse was
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       caused by a bomb in the
       <em>
        basement
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding creative explanations is great when they work, but cutting the crap is a fulltime responsibility.

       Video of the collapses, broadcast live and worldwide, show massive high speed projectiles, weighing many tons, that explode in air, and then the smaller pieces explode into even smaller pieces.  It's not the walls-come-tumbling-down; it's massive pieces of wall projected vertically at a high rate of speed, then exploding in the air into a star shaped burst, streaking into all directions, and then those smaller pieces exploding again.

       This is not conspiracy theory; this is a fact.  This was not caused by fire and gravity; this was caused by incendiaries.

       I agree.
       <br/>
       Because the OP didn't post a proper link, I kinda assumed he was talking about
       <em>
        the noises heard at ground level
       </em>
       , which at one point were claimed to be explosions in the basement but which are unlikely to have been from incendiaries going off 97 floors above them because at that distance it could not be loud enough, and certainly not linkable to bombs
       <em>
        during
       </em>
       the collapse due to surrounding normal collapse noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to be very specific about what I disagreed with.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general I believe there is too much other evidence (not the ground level noises) that points to incendiaries in the mid level of the building rather than simple gravity pancaking. It's just that, if you let one falsehood or non seqitur through, where can one draw the line? I hope you see what I mean, even if you disagree about the noises.

      <p>
       The only verified conspiracy going on here is the 9/11 Commission.
We will never know what happened that day.

       I used to live in the rockies, and trust me. when a giant chunk of rock (or building i assume) breaks off and falls 300ft, it sounds like an explosion. when a rockslide happens, it sounds like a large series of explosions.

       There were reports from people claiming they heard a bomb go off outside the tunnel where lady Di crashed, which led to all sorts of crazy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is usually, how can you be sure that what you're hearing is a bomb going off? I mean, I've never heard an actual bomb going off, how would I differentiate it from, say, a gas-explosion?

       I'm just saying that when people hear an explosion they sometimes assume it's a bomb, even though in most cases it's quite impossible to tell the cause of an explosion just by the sound of the explosion alone.

       You can only accept or reject a theory based on direct evidence supporting or discrediting that theory, not because it's the only one you cannot reject. There might be an explanation you had not thought of.

       Yeah because your average New York desk worker knows what a bomb going off sounds like, right?

       Edit: I forgot to mention the undeniable fact that
       <em>
        nothing else on the planet sounds like a bomb going off in any way at all.

       No, they would have no idea would they, I mean its a pretty rare theing a bomb going off, there's never been clips of that or anything like a bomb TV. Those dickheads who make movies with explosions use fake bomb noises too - they don't sound anything like they do in the movies.

       It probably sounds a lot like other things, You know like a Saxophone or something.

       Like the two that happened over an hour before the explosion claims? Maybe it was the sloooooooowest aftershock ever that they heard. Or a saxaphone. Hear for yourself
