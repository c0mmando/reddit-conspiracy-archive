       Yeah man, those planes were just holograms and the government somehow hijacked those flights and are still hiding those passengers from their families. Not too mention all the people I know who were in NY at the time and saw it for themselves.  They're in on it too.

       I spend my time on this website trying to address problems in theoretical science. That you insist on monopolizing my time with this petty bullshit makes you the child, demanding your own social boasting takes precedence over scientific discourse. You have wasted a tremendous amount of my time. You are a devil, a snake, a liar, a selfish pig. You are uninterested in behaving like an adult, discussing problems rationally, and instead choose to name-call and pester. Your mind is small. Your heart is even smaller. You have no place on this website, but insist that all attention be diverted to you. Your 'ideas' are backed up only by hearsay, because you are incapable of exercising rational thought on your own. The damage caused by people like you in this world is tremendous.

       Never contact me again. It brings a great burden to my heart to see that snakes like you have any power in this world.

       You dedicate your valuable time on this fine website to telling AIDS patients to suffer a painful death, telling parents to make their children vulnerable to disease, telling scientists to ignore all the climate change data they gather, and telling other nutters how the Twin Towers were holograms all along (or some shit).

       You're full of shit. Where did the plane parts came from then? Hundreds of pictures and videos shows exactly the same thing, same plane, same time, same explosions, and you dare saying there were no planes? Well, unless fucking ninjas manipulated ALL OF THEM. Oh, and they secretly planted the plane parts inside WTC, so it would look like plane crash. Ignorant, dumb ass. And if you really think it was, as you're saying,

       I encourage you to watch the video I keep linking to in this thread, which addresses most of your questions.  But, hey, let's see....

      <blockquote>

        Where did the plane parts came from then?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "Plane parts?"  The evidence against this is mostly strongly shown in the alleged Shanksville and Pentagon crashes (most strongly in the Shanksville one).  The plane parts are absolutely nowhere to be found - there are a couple pieces of scrap metal, but nothing supporting the idea that an airplane crashed there.  Look at the pictures yourself.  In spite of this, the passport of one of the "terrorists" emerges almost completely unscathed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hundreds of pictures and videos shows exactly the same thing, same plane, same time, same explosions, and you dare saying there were no planes?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The planes are the piece of evidence in question, and there are only a small handful of videos purported to depict its descent into the second tower.  Fascinatingly, one video shows the descent coming in at a sharp downwards angle, while another one shows it coming in with no vertical element to its velocity whatsoever.  This is impossible to reconcile.

       I was in the Cub Scouts, a long, long time ago, when I was 8 or 9.  The troop leader took us to some sort of print shop, where an employee showed us all how to use Photoshop, and when my turn came, he expressed his surprise that I was the only one there who understood how to use it - how to make selections, apply filters, and so on.  I am an expert in graphic design, now.

       Ok well, i agree with the pentagon part, obviously there was no plane, but were talking here about the towers
    one video shows the descent coming in at a sharp downwards angle, 
    while another one shows it coming in with no 
    vertical element to its velocity whatsoever. 
Just looked at several different videos, and again, I have to disagree. Look closer and you'll see you're wrong.

I am too, but apparently you're not as good as you think you are mate

       Don't get your hopes down. 6-7 years ago you could have been shot for saying some of the things that show up on this subreddit. Today, more and more people are waking up. The mask of deception will be lifted soon enough.

       Let me just say in advance that this "debunking" of the September Clues movie:

       is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever seen.  He disregards the major points of evidence by omission, and hand-waves over the rest with ridiculous explanations.  Take a look.
