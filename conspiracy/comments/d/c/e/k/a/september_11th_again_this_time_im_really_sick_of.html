    <div class="md"><p>I encourage you to watch the video I keep linking to in this thread, which addresses most of your questions.  But, hey, let&#39;s see....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did the plane parts came from then? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Plane parts?&quot;  The evidence against this is mostly strongly shown in the alleged Shanksville and Pentagon crashes (most strongly in the Shanksville one).  The plane parts are absolutely nowhere to be found - there are a couple pieces of scrap metal, but nothing supporting the idea that an airplane crashed there.  Look at the pictures yourself.  In spite of this, the passport of one of the &quot;terrorists&quot; emerges almost completely unscathed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of pictures and videos shows exactly the same thing, same plane, same time, same explosions, and you dare saying there were no planes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The planes are the piece of evidence in question, and there are only a small handful of videos purported to depict its descent into the second tower.  Fascinatingly, one video shows the descent coming in at a sharp downwards angle, while another one shows it coming in with no vertical element to its velocity whatsoever.  This is impossible to reconcile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>doubt you even know what photoshop is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was in the Cub Scouts, a long, long time ago, when I was 8 or 9.  The troop leader took us to some sort of print shop, where an employee showed us all how to use Photoshop, and when my turn came, he expressed his surprise that I was the only one there who understood how to use it - how to make selections, apply filters, and so on.  I am an expert in graphic design, now.  </p>

    one video shows the descent coming in at a sharp downwards angle,

Just looked at several different videos, and again, I have to disagree. Look closer and you&#39;ll see you&#39;re wrong.
