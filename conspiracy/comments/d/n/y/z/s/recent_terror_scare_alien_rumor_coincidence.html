       Has anybody who is anybody made the connection between the last couple of weeks of terror levels in Europe rising and the media pumping out that the terror threat is real with some astronomers and UFOlogists predictions that aliens are going to hover over major cities around the world in about a week?

       Seriously though, it would be foolish to dismiss out of hand the long held assertion that a fake "alien invasion" would be part of the NWO end game.

       I think it's silly, but I don't dismiss it. I view all news and propaganda with a skeptical eye...and not just the part about "aliens".

       Is it such a leap of the imagination to entertain the notion of a world government coalescing out of memetic evolution? One that will avoid the negative impacts of technically being an abstract
       <em>
        water monopoly empire
       </em>
       by creating a scapegoat, or imaginary influence to steer public attitude into a desired direction?
      </p>
      <p>
       Change "world," and "water mon. empire" and you've got a great deal of what's called history. I'm sure you already know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though of course, if you want to believe in little green men over technologically secretive governments, then power to you. Just do us all a favor and don't jump on the alien bobblehead bandwagon just yet. The simplest explanation must be the most likely, and somehow this doesn't seem like a very complex concept. We must just disagree in its application.

       Oh no, I agree with you. Maybe I was unclear or maybe it is easy to jump to conclusions a bit too fast when on the web. I am aware of how information is used, and by whom. And I have some sense of politics and the financial system. But I like to hear the wacky theories too. Because it isn't always as apparent who is to gain, or who is behind some of them though I have had enough of the "guy raving on his red-text-on-black-background website."

       Basically what I'm saying is that when putting all rhetoric aside, a government, corporation, or society will behave similarly to an organism.
      </p>
      <p>
       These abstract organisms exist in different environments than conventional forms of life. So their specific needs are different, but generally speaking all life tends to refine and build upon itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       A water monopoly empire (WME) is an example of a government or quasi-organism manipulating a resource that people within it rely on as a fundamental necessity. Such a body can gain near absolute control in providing that resource, ensuring its survival. A government operating under these tactics can exist almost indefinitely if there are no external threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of money in place of water, and a world empire in place of a limited geography. There doesn't need to be a real threat, just a believable one, for a government to achieve such a stable and secured existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there's a drawback in that centralization. A WME can whittle its existence down to a corrupt, inefficient, and redundant shell because it managed to maintain control over such a crucial resource. The only likely cause for collapse of a WME is an external influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this didn't further clutter my original point.

       I just woke up. Thought about it after reading that Britain is confident an attack is going to happen there. ..Now I feel like a 12 year old inbred deliverance-nerd for asking about it, because I am a pretty sane guy at all other times than post-waking up. Anyway.. with all the other weird conspiracies in here, I was surprised not to have read about this connection. There are a lot of normal people wishing the alien rumor to be true, just wanted to get the ball rolling because it is a fun and enjoyable subject.. Not terrorism, but, the other parts..

       imo, and particularly due to the above, never feel "bad," ashamed, or low for asking questions on subjects which you have a sincere desire to know the answers, and aren't afraid to dig them up...you'll soon enough learn, too, that that digging up the Truth is pretty much what it'll most often seem like...

       --quoted, 5th bullet down:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The world is like a ride in an amusement park, and when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. The ride goes up and down, around and around, it has thrills and chills, and it's very brightly colored, and it's very loud, and it's fun for a while. Many people have been on the ride a long time, and they begin to wonder, "Hey, is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and say, "Hey, don't worry; don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." And we...kill those people. "Shut him up! I've got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry, look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real."
        <strong>
         It's just a ride.
        </strong>
        But we always kill the good guys who try and tell us that, you ever notice that? And let the demons run amok... But it doesn't matter, because it's just a ride. And we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort, no work, no job, no savings of money.
        <strong>
         Just a simple choice, right now, between fear and love.
        </strong>
        The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your doors, buy guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love instead see all of us as one. Here's what we can do to change the world, right now, to a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defenses each year and instead spend it feeding and clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would pay for many times over, not one human being excluded, and we could explore space, together, both inner and outer, forever, in--"

       Whenever I play backgammon and the millisecond before I roll I say, lets say, "double six!" I get double sixes! Am I on the right track here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes when I think about this I get the feeling my mother is feeling good about herself for showing me "The Secret". I subsequently wish I never got those double sixes.

       Anyway. People who advocate the human-love-interconnection often get me terrified by telling stories of the human-tyranny-interconnection, which is kind of ironic if you think about it.

       Are you talking about me? That would be the worst thing I've been called in my life I guess. But then I believe real important conspiracy theories like "The War on Terror" and 9/11 should be posted in
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       because it'd be contra productive for anything worthy of being looked into by a large amount of people to be posted anywhere else. And it's not like I expect the next Watergate to come through the flimsy Gene Hackman/Woody Harrelson-esque setting that is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .. At least that is the who I have always imagined are responsible for this subreddit. I enjoy it, can't help it but feeling a bit fulfilled when people are talking about things that are not apparent in our very normal lives, as long as we can sit in front of a computer screen and chat about it. I get to fantasize about Anti-Gravity, Nazis in Space, Hollow Earths, Time Travel, Reptilians, NWO and so on. It's all here somewhere, and it beats whatever is on TV.

       Yes. Exactly! But you will probably continue calling people names for not being emptied of healthy imagination. I on the other hand, will still have the utmost respect for, and interest in science, knowing though, that some scientists are socially inept and have their heads up their asses as far as any religious quack!

       Also, there was a news story a week or two ago (at least in major Finnish newspapers; I don't know about other countries) that the UN had appointed a "contact person" in case of the arrival of aliens. It turns out that the story was false, and that the Malaysian person who supposedly was the appointee knew nothing of the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the UFO sighting in China.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Stephen Hawking, among other notable persons, making statements in the media about alien intelligences (in S.H.'s case, he said that aliens should be left alone, if I'm not mistaken). In truth the exact content of these statements doesn't seem that important; it sounds like they're trying to get us used to the idea, and that UFO sighting hoaxes might be used to justify further reductions of rights and freedoms, etc.

       be hovering over any major or minor cities in October. Any takers?

       No!  You're missing the point entirely.  If you look at Europe over the past few weeks, you'll realize that there has been massive protests and strikes run by laborers.  The goal of the terrorist warnings is to keep those people scared and at home, rather than protesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       But honestly, if the terrorists threats were actually real, would the terrorists want to fuck over the people protesting the companies and governments that are invading and developing the middle east?

       Any October surprise, whether the source is terrestrial or other, that scares the US populace is sure to benefit the GOP come election day. But if something does happen I think the "terrorists" are much more likely to be human.

       And yes, I do know about Blossom Goodchilds 2008 prediction, and I am not one that wants to believe so much as to believe in utter crap. But I have read it in quite a few posts and articles the last couple of weeks and found it interesting. Maybe it has too much to do with mass media nowadays doing the job that obscure wacky magazines did before 2000. (Man, I miss those)

       because, for the most part, those aren't "end of the world" predictions--they're "the world's about to change

       Well dramatic change does occur, and some change is constant, but I don't recall anyone predicting 9/11, the fall of USSR, walking on the moon, or japan being bombed so badly shadows were burned into walls, and those were dramatic changes to the world.   All other predictions about mass change(AFAIK) have not come to fruition(Y2K as mentioned by eyewoo).

       John Kennedy gave the order for nasa to send people to the moon...  so his prediction has to be taken with a moon sized grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Igor Panarin is not credited with predicting the fall of USSR(According to his wiki page anyway), and predicted that the USA would be divided into 6 parts in 2010. (hasn't happened)
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Cooper "predicted" 9/11 in that he reviewed the terrorist report given out in June that had Bin Laden and planes on the cover of the report, then labeled as a "test exercise".   I don't buy that as a prediction of the actual date of the event at all, he just got wind of the report and said it on a radio broadcast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than the thousands involved in the Manhattan project, and assuming it would eventually be used, not one person predicted a date of a bomb being used on foreign soil.

Too many people have seen/read the Watchmen.

       Same exact plot. Conspiracy to fake an alien invasion so that all of humanity would unite together to fight the evil alienz.
Pretty much the same plot as Independence Day now that I think about it.

       do you guys remember SETI? well they've been publicly admitting to be in contact with E.T.s for years, albeit in altered states of consciousness. So long story short, they realised they had no chances through technology but rather went into meditative research. Their executives are openly talking about it, and they're organizing camps and retreat pretty much like newage people.
Check out iSETI.

       whoever's watching from space can't be dumb enough to actually make first contact with our retarded governments.
There won't be any Independence Day scenarii.

       Do you mean Interstellar Space Exploration Technology Initiative?   what does that have to do with anything you've mentioned. (meditative research?  wtf?)  What about OSETI?  Why wouldn't you mention that they have shifted focus from radio contact to optical/laser contact?

       SETI is not into transhumanistic ways of establishing contact.  You're detracting from their main mission statement and undermining their credibility.

       dudes Im not trying to undermine anything. If you're interested do your homeworks, if not leave it alone. I'm not going to spend days looking for a link or two that will get shot down by the same people lol
been there done that in many a topic on many a forum.
This said, SETI using electronics will never find intelligent feedback, whether you come to the same conclusion or not ain't my problem.

       oh, also you might be interested in the fact that many modern quantum physicists and military projects are working on expanded awareness program because they now understand Mind influences subatomic levels, and it's a scientific conscensus that we live in a multiverse with many realities probably accessible through consciousness shifts.

       Basically what I'm saying is that when putting all rhetoric aside, a government, corporation, or society will behave similarly to an organism.
      </p>
      <p>
       These abstract organisms exist in different environments than conventional forms of life. So their specific needs are different, but generally speaking all life tends to refine and build upon itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       A water monopoly empire (WME) is an example of a government or quasi-organism manipulating a resource that people within it rely on as a fundamental necessity. Such a body can gain near absolute control in providing that resource, ensuring its survival. A government operating under these tactics can exist almost indefinitely if there are no external threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of money in place of water, and a world empire in place of a limited geography. There doesn't need to be a real threat, just a believable one, for a government to achieve such a stable and secured existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there's a drawback in that centralization. A WME can whittle its existence down to a corrupt, inefficient, and redundant shell because it managed to maintain control over such a crucial resource. The only likely cause for collapse of a WME is an external influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this didn't further clutter my original point.
