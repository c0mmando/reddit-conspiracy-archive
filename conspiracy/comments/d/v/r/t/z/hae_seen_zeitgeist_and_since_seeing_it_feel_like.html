<blockquote>
<p>Politics in this country (and all around the world for that matter) are an impossible tangle of bullshit and corruption. When I start paying attention to it and forming opinions I almost get mad at myself for following the projected storyline. The truth is always far more complex and twisted than what&#39;s being broadcast through the media, and behind it all is a wave of special interest money and propaganda. It almost seems impossible to fix.
If I ever had to go on a political talk show I think it would be very hard to take the whole proposition seriously, and I would almost certainly just start ranting about how ridiculous it is that we&#39;re even discussing it instead of unveiling the true motivation behind all world events; people with fuck loads of money want to make more of it, and they don&#39;t give a fuck who has to die to make that happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said I&#39;m swaying towards anarcho-capitalism. During the course of a regular day, we&#39;re all anarchists in a way. You choose what to wear, what route to take to work, how your relationships progress and whatnot. The government impacts so little of my day-to-day life, and how I want to live it. It&#39;s very seldom that the government jumps in and makes its presence felt. Only really tax time, and whenever it creates another stupid useless law that protects the 1% of people who need the government to protect itself, while the rest of us are scratching our heads over whether or not the government&#39;s further intervention was &quot;really necessary?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ready to say I&#39;m a full-blown anarchist, but for starters, I know for sure I ain&#39;t voting anymore. Totally fucking pointless. Next, I ain&#39;t joining any military service, or working for the government anymore. Again, unnecessary. Each problem that the government has told us it was going to alleviate or outright eliminate has either gotten worse or stuck around for decades and decades and decades. Drug war? War on terr-uh? Call me when you spend my tax dollars on something I would&#39;ve spent them on had I made that economic decision myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, because roads are never privately funded. Perhaps we wouldn&#39;t need so many roads, if the auto industry didn&#39;t have so many of our &quot;leaders&quot; in their back pocket, literally designing our cities for full-blown dependancy. Our highway systems were designed to move the army about the country easily. The trains died a figurative death shortly thereafter. The mail was never delivered without the aid of the government (unless you look at UPS, FedEx etc), and running water can&#39;t possibly be delivered without the government doing it for me. As for garbage collection, I live in an apartment with a dumpster that&#39;s picked up by a private company.</p>

<p>Yes, of course they would get filled, by some shitty corporation that will squeeze every penny they can out of you.  Garbage pickup, $1 per can, large items extra.  I&#39;m sure if that happened every freeway in the country would turn into a fuckin&#39; toll road.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, what&#39;s wrong with toll roads? They stay better maintained than public roads by a long shot. Try driving around in a major city during the summer time without getting crammed in by construction. When you drive past, how many shovels are being leaned on? Public infrastructure projects bring on so much waste, because they are gauranteed to the companies that win the contracts. The current system is perfect for &quot;shitty corporations&quot; because they are the ones who gain political favour to get those contracts and waste your money in the first place. And if you calculated how much of your tax dollars goes towards garbage pickup, I can assure you it&#39;s pretty damn near $1 per can already, if not more. And they don&#39;t even pick up the large items... those are your problem, not the city&#39;s.</p>

<p>Why must everyone think that shitty corporations are the only ones that would fill the void? You as a consumer would be able to pick the service that works best for you. For instance, in my city garbage pickup changes every time there&#39;s a long weekend, because the garbage crew shifts the days one up for their days off. Garbage pickup is unionized. Now, let&#39;s say that the best day for me to get my garbage picked up is always on a Wednesday... my work schedule makes this the ideal day for me to take my garbage out. In theory, I could hire a company that can assure me that this is the best day for pickup. What if I want to pay more for the service to also sort my recyclables for me? That&#39;s my option. Right now, there aren&#39;t options under the current system. Unless you have a private company picking up the bin behind my apartment. If we don&#39;t like the work they&#39;re doing, we can go with another company.</p>

<p>But back to the first point... Toll roads are awesome, because they can hire construction crews that can work through the night so that my morning commute is more convenient. Talk about more efficient! The company that owns the toll road is going to want to please its fare paying public, so it&#39;ll do its best to keep you happy. Ever notice how toll roads are the ones that are the most convenient and usually shave your travel time? That&#39;s not a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re speaking with this assumption that without government control corporations will be nice and competitive and we will have so many great choices.  That&#39;s not the way it would happen at all.  One corporation, the Walmart of construction companies, would buy out all the other ones and then charge everyone out the ass to use their roads.  Why even bother fixing them, if someone else tries to compete with us we can just destroy them with shady business techniques, teams of lawyers, or just buy them out.</p>

<p>The same reason why the mainstream media sucks, everything is owned by a couple corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under government control, the corporations have more power to abuse you. The reason why mainstream media sucks is because the FCC (or in my country the CRTC) puts heavy restrictions upon entry into the broadcast spectrum. Upstart channels are few and far between because of the costs of licensing. It&#39;s naive to think that the government didn&#39;t have a hand in this...</p>

<p>Take for example the political debates. The two parties in the US get to put their leaders up on the MSM&#39;s debates unchallenged by other parties. Why? Because the two major parties control the debates, and won&#39;t participate in any others.</p>

<p>Walmart does own its own roads. They&#39;re called parking lots. How well maintained are they? Any different than your city&#39;s? If they charge everyone out the ass to drive on MegaCorp St, then no one will drive on MegaCorp St, and the business will fail. You have choices you know. Don&#39;t pretend that we need a nanny state to protect us from being overcharged all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that people are just flawed by nature (kind of alluded to in the whole &quot;original sin&quot; metaphor) and, rather than face their flaws, most people tend to believe that ideologies are perfect in some way. Since the main political parties in the US seem to think that you&#39;re only either pro-Business or pro-Government, only the opposing ideology is flawed. We need to realize that neither we, nor our ideologies, are perfect. Everything leaves room for growth and improvement.

I&#39;ve tried working with the electoral reform movements to get rid of the first-past-the-post system, and to no avail. The system is rigged, and there ain&#39;t much we can actually do to change it. I&#39;ve seen petitions signed by thousands of people get completely ignored. My country is run by a party that got 35% of the vote from the less than 50% who actually voted. A revolution may be necessary, and have happened in the past... but it might have to be a quiet one, because the loud ones get quashed mighty quickly these days.</p>

All that place would need is about ten chilled out and together people to make it a top end spiritual destination for the Americas.  Between wind and solar you could have completely free energy.  I figure that it would only require $100k to build a community with energy and utilities.  There is good seasonal potential for making money off of tourism.  Feel free to use my idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s all fine and well.  It still stands that Religion is a tool to control the masses.  It started hundreds if not thousands of years ago and in our &quot;enlightened&quot; age, we are still being manipulated by it.</p>

<p>Not to debate the whole process here, but back in the day when these astrological things were watched like the gods would demand, most peoples lived around the equator.  The human species never really migrated far north or south until they had a good grasp of fire/clothing to keep them warm.  The human body (nearly naked) cannot live in a climate more than a few degree&#39;s beyond zero without help.  ANYWAY, again....its not a big thing.  </p>

<p>Here we are with people controlling and running our world who simply have enough digits in their bank accounts to say they should be allowed to.  These are fucking human beings either way, and have no special right over any other person.  </p>

<p>So the few control the many, and the many seem to be satisfied by this.....that is until they learn the truth.  That is why we see assholes on here downvoting you and I.  That&#39;s why you see a huge lack of REAL education in the world.  That&#39;s why you see the military industrial complex such a huge force.  The money system the way it is.....the list goes on.  </p>

<p>They need us ignorant.  That is why they can be beaten.  We outnumber and and just as capable.  Look at the lengths they&#39;ve gone to!  They know they have to go this far in order to get what they want.  It shows their weakness.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why we cannot give up.  I hate to see the comments here that say, &quot;oh its just not worth it&quot;, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to do...&quot; etc etc.  </p>

<p>That is the effect they&#39;re working for.  This is what they&#39;re hoping for.</p>

<p>We cannot give up.  You only get one chance at this and if you think you&#39;re not worth it, you&#39;re missing the point.  </p>

<p>If you think your life or any life you intend to bring into this world is worth it, then you have a right and duty to fight.</p>

<p>Who cares about the mockery, fuck those people.  They&#39;re ignorant or they&#39;re in on it!  Either way we&#39;re going to win by informing and then trouncing the fuckers that think we should servants to the &quot;rich&quot;.</p>

<p>Fuck those people.  Fight because you&#39;re worth it.  If you&#39;re intelligent enough to figure this out, then you&#39;re intelligent enough to win this fight.  They&#39;re on the losing end, its a sure thing.  We can have it all back if we&#39;re willing to take some steps.  That&#39;s all she wrote.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the best way is simply to educate people that are ready for it.  As we begin to experience more pain more and more people will be ready to hear different ideas.  I notice a huge difference in willingness to listen after many people were at risks of losing their houses.  I believe that the tipping point of understanding of the control structure will only occur at our darkest hour.</p>

<p>Recently someone that I&#39;ve been working on finally said &quot;They really did all of this&quot; in a way that was less of a question then was seeking of confirmation.</p>

<p>At this point I figure that the heavily medicated and the obese are probably just not going to make it when shit hits the fan.  They will basically die an ego death and they will internally suicide or eat themselves to death trying to cope.</p>

<p>The upside to people being unemployed is that it gives them a moment to think.  However, at this time the government wants to promote a feeling of helplessness and laziness and that is why marijuana is suddenly becoming much more common.  When they want us to be functionally dependent they promote alcohol, now they want us to be stoners and they want the price to be low enough so that anyone who wants to smoke it can have access to it.  This is why here in California people are being allowed to save their homes while growing marijuana (with license or without).  That magic pill will not work forever as more and more people begin to grow it.  The only people that I know that are doing well are people who are growing marijuana or selling alcohol.  The pharmaceutical business is also very lucrative now.</p>

<p>There are many sober and healthy people that will do just fine but the others will be purged out.  If you have a weakness now is the time that it will destroy you.</p>

I think I just read that they intend to continue arresting even IF Prop 19 passes.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to revise my statement.  Basically the government wants us to be on drugs.  It doesn&#39;t matter what but they prefer to be able to tax it.</p>

<p>The Federal government is against marijuana because they know that it gives them power to fuck with us but at the same time they know that they can&#39;t come even close to stopping it.  I&#39;m in Northern California and the only people that I know that are doing well are those that are growing marijuana, selling alcohol or working for the military as a sub-sub-sub-sub-contractor.  Not a good sign and also <em>many</em> people are working the unemployment angle right now as they work under the table so that they can maintain a quality of life they are used to.  It feels serious to me like the start of a sort of communism or great depression.</p>

<p>btw I&#39;ve smoked plenty of marijuana in my earlier life so I&#39;m not down on it in itself but I see it as a larger push towards massive drug usage.  Also the weed in Nicaragua is very unrefined.  People call it bad but basically it is the weed that people were smoking a hundred years ago.  Sort of the difference between some strong cocoa leaves and cocaine.  The weed that is grown around here is very strong and not at all <em>natural</em> weed man for medicine.  Its increasingly grown under lights and its selectively bred to extreme now and likely at some point derived from government genetically modified varieties (although I don&#39;t know this for a fact).</p>

<p>My point is that people that who were about to lose their homes are now content to grow marijuana when they wouldn&#39;t have considered it before.  How long is that going to last?  It is going to be a few years and it will be saturated.  Marijuana is the only thing keeping California from disintegrating now.  I don&#39;t think that is very positive.</p>

<p>Also I know people who are taking anti-depressants and go to work and they do not consider themselves to be abnormal.  Whats normal at this point.  All I know is that we are doing a shit ton of drugs right now, medicine or otherwise.</p>

For example they will talk about how this paper gets printed here and then exchanged with another group and then prime dealers (J.P. Morgan etc) do this and that until you are throughly confused.  Additionally some opponents of the Fed do this but in a more informative way.  Once you can internalize and feel out the the fundamental nature and purpose of it as being inherently corrupt then the internals at that moment become irrelevant.  They can tweak the internal structure of it but the way that it fits into society cannot be changed.  The entire organization needs to be dismantled and the money power transfered completely to the state controlled collectively by us.  There is no moderating it.  If it was moderated and audited it would be found to be too corrupt for decent taste and it would fold in a wave of suicides, convictions and riots.</p>

<p>In 1911 when they took a try at the first attempt it was found to be too corrupt.  So they softened the language and spent quite a bit of time abstracting out the inherently corrupt internals to be more obfuscating on its purpose.  Then they were able to pass the second draft so to speak.  Many insiders were upset because they thought that it didn&#39;t do what the first version did but they were reassured that it still served its purpose.  In hindsight we probably would have been better off passing the first version because it was cruder and its tyranny was more transparent.</p>

<p>Once you understand the Federal Reserve and fractional reserve banking then you can take a step back and see how it fits into the larger world structure.  At that moment the popular economists are revealed to be nothing more than propagandists of money value.  I have read both of John Perkins his books and if you will notice he basically describes his past work as an economist as being purposefully deceitful.  At that moment you can realize that the statistical models of value that they produce are complete garbage unless the intention is to steal wealth from anyone that would defer to or accept their fraudulent economic reports.  It means that Krugman and everyone that is a celebrated economist are complete tools of the money powers.  Simple as that.  Now you can move on and search for the voices that actually know what is going on and how it fits into the context of empire, world government and personal liberty.</p>

<p>As far as a simple broad filter for economists if they were not very worried by 2003 and yelling doom by 2005 then they are completely worthless.  &quot;No one could have known&quot;, does not cut it and explain it all away.  Being either corrupt or incompetent in the subject of interest simply does not impress me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These types of documentaries have opened my eyes to a lot of information, but I must take it with a grain of salt. It&#39;s just unfortunate that their approach always seems more like fear-mongering to me. It&#39;s annoying to check sources and find that they have frankensteined bits together to get the reaction they wanted and this is no different than any other Fox news report or general government propaganda we see DAILY. I have come to the conclusion that picking a side is what makes &quot;the man&quot; happy. If the government really didn&#39;t want these &quot;conspiracies&quot; out there, they wouldn&#39;t be available. It&#39;s propaganda either way- one way to give in and do what the news says, or be considered a crackpot conspiracy theorist. So pick your side and fight for the cosmetic issues, just know they&#39;ll always have the upper hand.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not as if it&#39;s impossible to change. As far as I know, all the previous revolutions, the groups that wanted revolution has always been in the minority. It was an unpopular idea.

Once you&#39;ve satisfied yourself that the info in TMM is essentially true, a dark realization settles in. You immediately become aware of how this information has been cleverly swept under the rug and the rewritten history taught in the school system to keep the average person completely in the dark about it.  After seeing TMM, so much more of US history makes sense.  </p>

<p>What is more disturbing than the current system of financial and political hegemony being deeply entrenched, is the iron grip they have on the propaganda machine and public opinion.  The puppet show that is the US political system is so institutionalized that most of the players believe it as do the talking heads in the media - puppets unaware that they are puppets.   So few people own all the media in the US that they have no problem keeping everyone focused on squabbling about insignificant things and the big important issues from reaching a tipping point of public awareness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most definitely. But I feel that Zeitgeist is kinda like the discovery channel&#39;s BS where they hook you with something true and interesting, then fill in the rest with baseless and likely false speculation, then finally tell you there is nothing at all more to learn on this topic so you should just believe what we say. Something like that.</p>

<p>Zeitgeist is great though regardless because it makes people question their belief structures. But things go way deeper than Zeitgeist, and if the only non-mainstream info I was ever exposed to was Zeitgeist, I would be one very scared little sheepie. If I hear somebody talking about Zeitgeist I make sure to mention that it is a good place to start a much, much deeper investigation into the society and its controllers, consciousness, the self, and the universe - but it shouldn&#39;t be the end of that investigation! </p>

<p>edit for more on your original question: After Zeitgeist, I read more and more and came to the conclusion that there is a puppet in both parties and politics in general has devolved into a ball and chain instead of protectorate of our liberties (and that&#39;s assuming that at some point in the past, it WAS the maintainer of freedoms!).</p>

<p>That said, I took most of the film&#39;s claims with a grain of salt. It turned me on to a bunch of other books, some &quot;conspiracy&quot; texts and others that are more well known. It seems to me now that Zeitgeist&#39;s narrative has a least the shadow of truth. The points about christianity, the US government, and banking are roughly on target. </p>

<p>The lasting impression is one of personal empowerment. At the very least, the film successfully challenged my conventional world view. It made me curious about the world and gave me the confidence to investigate on my own, whereas my university education had the opposite effect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a simple question....wouldn&#39;t the world be a much better place if it was actually controlled by an Illuminati or whatever?  I mean, it wouldn&#39;t really change your personal sphere, and maybe &quot;waking up&quot; and &quot;knowing the truth&quot; actually makes things worse.  Take the movie The Matrix as an example.  In The Matrix, people are living happily, have their own homes, and have a sense of freedom and such ( remember, they are under the influence of the matrix, so they aren&#39;t aware that they aren&#39;t truly free ).  However, in the real world, people seem to live in poverty, they are constantly hunted by machines, and seem to live miserably..think post-apocalyptic misery.    Now figure the character Cypher - he realises that the &quot;real world&quot; sucks and he would rather live in The Matrix, because there, he can live comfortably, even if he knows everything is an illusion.</p>

<p>So, why does it have to be a bad thing if the conspiracy theories are true, and the world is actually controlled by an elite few?</p>

I don&#39;t think humanity will ever get away from this pyramid construct where the few rule the many, but I think we could have a much &quot;flatter&quot; pyramid (for lack of a better way to think about it.) The folks at the top could be seen more like figureheads and the masses could have some measure of respect. The means to achieve that? I don&#39;t know.

    <div class="md"><p>I said I&#39;m swaying towards anarcho-capitalism. During the course of a regular day, we&#39;re all anarchists in a way. You choose what to wear, what route to take to work, how your relationships progress and whatnot. The government impacts so little of my day-to-day life, and how I want to live it. It&#39;s very seldom that the government jumps in and makes its presence felt. Only really tax time, and whenever it creates another stupid useless law that protects the 1% of people who need the government to protect itself, while the rest of us are scratching our heads over whether or not the government&#39;s further intervention was &quot;really necessary?&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ready to say I&#39;m a full-blown anarchist, but for starters, I know for sure I ain&#39;t voting anymore. Totally fucking pointless. Next, I ain&#39;t joining any military service, or working for the government anymore. Again, unnecessary. Each problem that the government has told us it was going to alleviate or outright eliminate has either gotten worse or stuck around for decades and decades and decades. Drug war? War on terr-uh? Call me when you spend my tax dollars on something I would&#39;ve spent them on had I made that economic decision myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to think about that. I don&#39;t think humanity will ever get away from this pyramid construct where the few rule the many, but I think we could have a much &quot;flatter&quot; pyramid (for lack of a better way to think about it.) The folks at the top could be seen more like figureheads and the masses could have some measure of respect. The means to achieve that? I don&#39;t know. What we have now arises from natural human desires like greed and self-preservation. I doubt any humane ideal could compete with forces like that. I hope that makes sense.</p>
