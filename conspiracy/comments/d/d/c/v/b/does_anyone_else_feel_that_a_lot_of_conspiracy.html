    <div class="md"><p>This group is really infested with disinformation though. I remember a time when it was very difficult for anything to become a conspiracy theory because the skeptics network would investigate and debunk everything they could.  Take a look at the UFO community.  They will be the first in line to debunk a bogus UFO claim.  If a theory got past the skeptic community, it only meant that there wasn&#39;t enough information to debunk it and that pretty much everything else was debunked.</p>

<p>Today, even the government itself spreads crazy conspiracy theories to pollute the waters.  But general trolling has become commonplace and it sure is evident here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true of the general population, but whta I think OP was referring to was the people who tend to believe in the conspiracy theories in the first place.

Because <em>they</em> are hiding the <em>real</em> figures obviously.</p>

<p>As people who support alternate views of reality we should all support everyone&#39;s right to entertain any view of reality that doesn&#39;t directly harm others.  We should support everyone&#39;s right to believe in the ridiculous because we need to support diversity in the perception of reality.  Once you start dictating what theories are &quot;irrational&quot; then you&#39;re dictating what people are allowed to think.  In the battle of ideas we should always err on the side of freedom of thought, and not try to define the one &quot;true&quot; theory.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Because I believe that the full truth of what happened on 9/11 has yet to be revealed doesn&#39;t mean I &quot;believe&quot; that George W. Bush is personally responsible for it.

<p>One could argue that believing something when all the (known?) facts say otherwise is, in its own way, harmful.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with being open about things.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with questioning the official story about stuff.  But when you tell me Bush was a lizard person who was put in office to ready the globe for the coming Culling, well, that&#39;s a little wacky, and I don&#39;t think anyone is doing a disservice for calling you on it.  Even the more mundane stuff, it&#39;s good be to challenged on.  Yes, it&#39;s great that you&#39;re questioning the Lone Gunman theory, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should just shut your eyes and scream when someone tries to present arguments for it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Conspiracies are lumped together by the mainstream, so plausible 9/11 theories are overlooked because they are lumped in with stuff that is far more fringe, like Nibiru/reptilian invasion theories. ATS has this problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always liked the lizard man conspiracies.  They add a bit more of a mythological aspect to our fight for freedom.  It&#39;s also a way to de-humanize the entrenched establishment.  These things do help get things moving.  We need the crazies, they&#39;re inspired.  David Icke does a lot of good.  Most people who follow him don&#39;t actually belief in the lizards, and I strongly suspect neither does he.  Its a metaphor, and something more then that, but it&#39;s not actual shape-shifting lizard people.  Its a 2-dimensional representation of a 5-dimensional reality.  It&#39;s not correct, just a shadow of a shadow of the truth.  A map of a map to how things really work.  It&#39;s one man&#39;s perception.  Something to be considered, debated, researched, understood, and possibly rejected, but don&#39;t dictate what people are allowed to believe.  Too many people buy into belief systems that are so threatened by people of differing opinions.  No one is truly objective enough to say what is crazy and what is not.  If we start being more accepting of the crazy ideas, then we&#39;ll start finding out that reality can be much stranger then we ever imagined.  </p>

<p>Yeah, I doubt it.  I don&#39;t think anyone besides the folks who hang out here care about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  </p>

<p>If there is a big conspiracy, then they don&#39;t have to push it.  The status quo sells itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I think that there are crazy people who believe in things like lizard men.  Maybe the word &quot;crazy&#39; isn&#39;t fair, and the &quot;lizard men&quot; thing is hyperbole, but there are plenty of people here who actively look for conspiracies where there is no reason to believe there is one.  They are simply paranoid and are misinterpreting random events.  And I think sometimes people refuse to believe the &quot;official story&quot; surrounding an event just because it is an official story, not because there is any reason to disbelieve it.</p>

As far as white power stuff I don&#39;t really see that anywhere that I get around on the Internet or in real life and all of the jews that I know are very white indeed and not at all semitic.</p>

<p>I just get super tired of the jewish name being anything that it wants to be including religion, ethnicity and culture.  Then they call anyone that opposes them anti-semitic.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s where many theorists go wrong:  They often accept &quot;first reports&quot;, as golden.  The theory being that people not &quot;in-on-it&quot; make honest reports before they are silenced and the &quot;official&quot; story becomes gospel.</p>

<p>An example given is 9/11 first responder radio reports of bombs in the towers, etc.</p>

<p>Here is a perfect counter example.  A few days ago a very large natural gas pipeline exploded burning out an entire neighborhood in San Bruno California.  A CHP (California Highway Patrol) friend told my wife that a 747 had crashed (he got this information from his chain of command).  The firefighters radio chatter mentioned a plane crash multiple times.</p>

<p>Here is the recorded fire-fighter radio chatter.  It makes multiple references to a plane crash.  They accept as a fact that a plane must have crashed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2pdNZpyqZE&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2pdNZpyqZE&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded#</a>!</p>

<p>The only problem is that this was a natural gas pipeline that failed.  No plane was missing, no plane wreckage.  Just a big hole in the ground spewing fire for several hours.  When I was listening to callers on our local news radio, several people claimed it was a plane crash because they had heard the &quot;roar&quot; of engines as it went down.  In hind sight that was most probably the roar of gas escaping the ruptured pipe before it ignited.</p>

<p>This is very much the same as the &quot;fog of war&quot;.  Reports are fragmentary.  People accept speculation as fact.  Reports &quot;grow&quot; as they are repeated.  </p>

<p>Afterwards facts become clearer, but some people become enamored with those first reports and build entire mythologies out of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever thought of the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is probably a PR genius. No other term keeps people from investigating or hearing about incidents of government corruption, like the term &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.  Its an automatic way of discrediting anyone who challenges the official story. </p>

<p>Take 9-11. Quite controversial, no doubt. But there really is a lot of evidence (not made up stuff, but things that were reported briefly by the press) that doesn&#39;t get looked at. No one every seems to want to investigate this evidence or listen to those who have.  Not too many will even want to listen to the questions.  Its like the whole discussion gets a pass.  </p>

<p>If we were all scientists, then we would suspend our beliefs about how it all happened, and look at the evidence objectively.  Instead people often seek out evidence that supports their view, and pay no attention to the evidence that doesn&#39;t support their view, rather than really investigating the validity of each piece of information they find.  </p>

<p>Those that do investigate the facts and report them are drowned out, and disbelieved. They are called &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, when they are actually investigators.  Who wins from this situation?  The criminals win, if there are criminals.    </p>

<p>If you actually investigate facts, and re-investigate them, and you don&#39;t jump to conclusions until all the data is in, then you are not a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, you are a &quot;conspiracy investigator.&quot; </p>

But seriously &quot;crazy&quot; conspiracies keep the community underground, and I try to stay open to as many as I can because sometimes you dismiss something only turn around and find a way that maybe it fits or whatever. Some of it is definitely agent provocateurs who are hijacking a good theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well there are many conspiracies, this battle has many fronts and it is good to be aware... it&#39;s not their problem if people aren&#39;t mature enough to do their own research and it&#39;s not their responsibility to spoon feed you. Their job is to uncover the truth and report on their discoveries. I don&#39;t think they care what the mainstream media think of them because they expect bs from it... they know that big media are complicit and will always try to cover up the truth and manipulate public opinion. The way the mainstream reacts to truth is VERY suspicious and very telling. During the last presidential election, the media&#39;s treatment of Ron Paul was all the proof one needed to see the complicity of the big media with the New World Order agenda against the public and the last G20 event in Toronto provided lots of prof to support the conspiracy theorists claims. You people need to start educating yourselves because the truth won&#39;t be told to you. As Morpheus says in the Matrix... &quot;No one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The off-the-deep-end conspiracy theories that theorists will fall for, thereby squandering factual conspiracy theories that are associated with them:</p>

<p>1) Aliens - Not that they don&#39;t exist, I&#39;m not 100% either way, but I have a friend that went too far with this one.  Far too speculative and unprovable.</p>

<p>2) Reptilian agenda - no explanation necessary.</p>

<p>3) 2012 - What about 2001 with 9/11? or 2008 with the global crash?  Something terrible happens every year, but when 2012 comes, every disaster will be explained as an arrival of an event foreseen by the Mayans.</p>

<p>4) Illuminati controls EVERYTHING - No one really does, and typically the Illuminati is thrown into speech when someone stupid cannot be more specific or really doesn&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. I&#39;m not saying there are not a multiplicity of secret societies.  But atrocities are committed by governments, military, Intelligence, corporations, and banks with or without the help of secret societies.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about Reptilians is that, if you&#39;re on the fence about alien life in general, then you kind of have to be on the fence about Reptilians too.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s to say that life doesn&#39;t evolve in much the same way all over the galaxy?  And that the lizard is, like it was on Earth, a successful design.  They lost ascendency here only because of the comet, after all... no comet, and aren&#39;t we looking at reptiles acquiring intelligence millions and millions of years before humans did?</p>

<p>If they achieved intelligence on another world, and they did that millions and millions of years ago, and they&#39;re still around... then they have considerable technology.  Technology that might let them notice us, and visit.</p>

<p>Or maybe they&#39;re dimension-shifting from an alternate present based on a past where the comet didn&#39;t strike.  Again, possessed with technology millions of years ahead of our own.  Who knows what&#39;s possible?</p>

<p>So, I don&#39;t hold the idea that these guys exist with the perfect uncertainty I hold for alien life, or even that alien life has visited Earth, but it isn&#39;t batshit insane to entertain at least the possibility.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like how I think about the moon landings.  I believe 100% that man landed on the moon.  I haven&#39;t seen a rocket lift off with my own eyes, but I saw it all the time as a kid on the TV, and there&#39;s no way they could have faked images like that then (or even today I&#39;d wager).  I&#39;ve seen with my naked eye satellites streak across the sky... I know they&#39;re satellites because I can get independent confirmation of their position and look up at that spot in the sky and see a dim but moving light in the sky.  So orbiting works.</p>

<p>Not too much of a leap from orbiting Earth to doing a burn that lets you trade Earth orbit for lunar orbit.  Nor doing another burn that lets you descend to the lunar surface.</p>

<p>And I look at the design of everything, especially the LEM, and I just marvel at how wonderful it all is and how this is easily half the battle in pulling off this amazing feat.</p>

<p>So yes, man walked on the moon.  I firmly believe this.</p>

<p>And yet... we&#39;re talking about what is perhaps the only engineering project that was ever completed on time!  Not only that, it was a <em>government-run</em> engineering project!  Completed.  On.  Time.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a part of my brain that wants to scream out NO FUCKING WAY at this.  Because it runs contrary to every experience I&#39;ve had, both with engineering projects, and with government.</p>

<p>So I can have some sympathy for people who are afflicted with even the more offbeat beliefs.</p>

<p>Which is not to say that the government doesn&#39;t have whole cubicle farms of GS-11&#39;s who are paid to do disinformation and come on to forums like this and poison the fountain, as it were.</p>

<p>Ultimately, whether any of these theories see the light of day will depend on achieving critical mass.  9/11 will achieve critical mass, not only because more and more people are willing to ask questions as the event becomes more distant, but because it is absolutely vital to the security of the nation and the general welfare of the world: we cannot allow the false-flag attack to remain a viable tactic for monsters who profit from throwing the world into war.</p>

<p>Basically, if you give a shit about the future of the world, and you made the mistake of opening your eyes, then you&#39;re either a conspiracy theorist, or (literally perhaps) too stupid to live.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that crazy conspiracy theories are disinformation tactics, but instead the fruits of paranoid minds.  I don&#39;t mean to sound disrespectful and I certainly don&#39;t take every explanation from the media at face value, but there are a lot of people who are mentally disturbed who just see conspiracies everywhere.  The more intelligent they are, the more they are likely to see little pieces of &quot;evidence&quot; that corroborate their story.  I think most conspiracy theories, and I know people hate this word on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, are coincidences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Restraint is definitely needed.  For example, was there a controlled demolition of the twin towers? Possibly.  But were the planes devoid of passengers, and somehow radio controlled to fly into the twin towers, and then the passengers that were supposed to be on the planes somehow disposed of, and their phone calls faked with advanced voice replication devices?  Um, unlikely.  And yet I have heard that idea floating around the 911 truth movement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You lumped a lot of diverse things into that statement. I think I get your point, but you also provide an example why you have to be careful judging what is unlikely. Remote controlled planes are not unlikely at all, it&#39;s a mature technology. I don&#39;t claim this is what happened, but if you wanted to fly a plane into a building it would be an efficient solution. A remote kill switch for radio communication and then a pilot in someplace like Nevada takes control. It would explain how some of the more difficult manuevers could have been accomplished, if there was a military specialist flying the plane instead of an incompetent terrorist.</p>

<p>What I am getting at is there is a balance both ways, too gullible is counter productive. However too close minded and we could end up missing pertinent information.</p>

<p>&quot;Ultimately this sort of blogging is an exercise in futility. There is no evidence, no matter how convincing, that will ever be accepted by the 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; Movement&#39;s hardcore evangelists. The irony is that the people who claim to be searching for the truth are so willing to ignore evidence and react angrily to those with conflicting evidence and testimony.</p>

<p>A bigger irony is that if there is a conspiracy, truthers with their deluge of disinformation are doing more than anyone else to help cover it up.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, especially when the conspiracy theories are mutually exclusive.   </p>

<p>A conspiracy theorist I worked with told me 3 different, mutually exclusive theories about the JFK assassination, and each one was &#39;true&#39; when he told it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We call that a &quot;smoke screen&quot; to give an air of being bat-shit crazy, whilst spreading, <em>amongst all the crazy</em>, challenging ideas and intriguing &quot;but what if...&quot; scenarios, to people who believe every word they read in their newspapers and see on the state sponsored TV news channels.</p>

<p>A good example is David Icke.  He delivers very relevant satire and observation on the way the world and its people are governed... and then goes bat-shit crazy at the end of every lecture talking about lizards.  Thus the message and ideas get out, but wrapped up in some nice funny entertainment.</p>

<p>Once one accepts that there are conspiratorial forces out there it makes it much easier to accept more.  I know that there is a good chance some of the conspiracy theories I vehemently believe in aren&#39;t true.

    <div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem is that when people break through that mental wall that says, &quot;conspiracies don&#39;t happen,&quot; and they realize that they actually have happened and continue to, then they start to look for a conspiracy in everything and forgo critical thinking.  I&#39;ll never discard critical thinking because its what actually got me to the point where I accepted 9/11 was an inside job, the international bank conspiracy, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might get downvoted hardcore...but hear me out!</p>

<p>I agree with the OP. As someone who has been researching various conspiracy theories for years, I feel as though there is blind following on both sides. For instance, to label yourself as a, &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; is really quite ambiguous. What does this mean exactly? Does this mean you are against what is going on in the gov&#39;t? That you&#39;re taking a stand (if so, in what way?)? Does it mean that you will never follow the &quot;conventional standards&quot; (however you define them)? </p>

<p>Moreover, the problem is that many times, these theories are not presented in the best light. An example is when I will sometimes watch videos online and they will play scary, eery music in the background - are we trying to scare people, or enlighten them? Music is a fantastic tool, but we need to choose it carefully if we&#39;re trying to send a certain message. The same goes with websites...too much graphics and funky layouts can be a turnoff. And often times, I find that many sites or people being spoken to about the issue will hound people with tons of information at once. Sometimes, an information overload (though it may be the &#39;right&#39; information) is not what people want to see. This is ESPECIALLY true for when people are talking about conspiracies out loud. We need to be extremely open to both sides - if you are someone who frequently reads upon conspiracies and DOES believe that many of it is possible, then I think the best thing you can do is:</p>

<ol>
<li>(to the best of your ability) KNOW WHAT YOU&#39;RE TALKING ABOUT - Be  specific!</li>
<li>Educate yourself as much as possible ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE</li>
<li>Be open to argument (i.e. a fair-play discussion) but allow yourselves to believe that there can be errors and evidence on BOTH sides.</li>
</ol>

<p>Last summer, I spent a crazy amount of time really trying to put together pieces of the 9/11 story. What I concluded was that ultimately, I didn&#39;t know what to believe. Why? Because there are too many conflicting theories. These include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>the planes were actually missiles</li>
<li>there were no planes at all</li>
<li>the planes that we &quot;saw&quot; were actually holograms</li>
<li>Jews were behind it</li>
<li>Reptilians were behind it</li>
</ul>

<p>...and the list goes on.</p>

<p>What I have concluded for myself is that ultimately, I don&#39;t know what to believe any more. I do my best everyday to read both mainstream and alternative media. I definitely do believe that 9/11 was government sponsored, but at the same time, I just don&#39;t know which theory is &quot;correct&quot;. I am much more wary of mainstream media, but also know there are disinformation agents out there, so ultimately, I just try to be as aware as I can on both sides - something we can obviously never fully achieve, but at least be open to. I feel also that if anyone truly wants to people&#39;s attention, they need to actually do their own, independent research. This means reading up the history and science of things on your own, going to meetings/rallies in person, and, if possible, actually meeting people in person that were involved with the issue. Obviously, easier said then done. Regardless, the internet is wonderful, but an easy tool for manipulation and exaggeration. My ex attended a meeting once for the Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth and I can tell you it was something I realized we should all do, if we have the means. It&#39;s the only way we can really start understanding how things happened.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re interested in being serious (i.e. getting media attention or working with specific organizations) and feel that you can convey a message, be creative! One of the worst things I&#39;ve seen is 9/11 Truth kids talking in the ferry (I live in NYC) about &quot;the gov&#39;t doing it all&quot; without giving specific reasons. It made me so disappointed. For me, am going to try to continue reading, researching, and constantly allowing doubt to both sides. I am also involved in theatre and hope to use it some day to find more creative outlets to bring up the message. I know it&#39;s not the best, but I do hope others will find their outlet too :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that once you believe one conspiracy, there becomes an underlying logic or narrative that indicates others to be true as well.</p>

<p>For example, if you believe that Pearl Harbor was an attack that the US Gov allowed to occur for strategic reasons, why would you not believe a similar motive for 9/11, or the Bay of Tonkin, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to look at it like this. In the movie the mummy, when the one guy is about to get killed he starts praying to every god. It is a blanket prayer, making sure to cover all of his bases. If a conspiracy theorist believes in a lot of different ones and one happens to be right, they will be reassured that the rest of them are correct as well. Shoot in the dark once not going to hit to much, shoot in the dark with an Uzi bound to hit something.</p>

Once you start thinking that some evidence is faked and some evidence is masterfully hidden then you can believe anything like moon landings for instance.
