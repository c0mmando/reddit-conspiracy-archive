<p>Everyone knows the Trade Towers were demolished.  (All three of them.)  Setting aside the fact that he has committed one of the biggest insurance scam in history - and murder, he obviously had pre-knowledge of the attacks on America that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s also not forget that Silverstein is recorded on <em>video</em> saying they made the decision to &quot;pull&quot; WTC7.  I&#39;ve actually heard people on the internet speculate that this means he was ordering them to pull the building down, as in, with cables.  It suffices to say that&#39;s the stupidest thing ever.  It is obvious, from this statement and the clear demolition of the building, that explosives were planted.</p>

<p>In the context of our legal system, this would normally be sufficient to invoke investigation for insurance fraud.  Instead, he is simply marred with shame in the minds of those who understand what happened, as those who initiated the attack run our legal system.</p>

If what you&#39;re saying is true and they were demolished, why would Larry Silverstein come clean to the worlds biggest insurance scam, ever? Why bother focusing on someone who will never come clean? I do however agree, that if he were to come clean (again hypothetically speaking), that would be the turning point for the &quot;truth&quot; to come out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m usually pretty good about having a decent back and forth it people are up for it.  I don&#39;t take to kindly to just being dismissed as a shill.

    <div class="md"><p>I have to say right off due to your response. I may have misjudged your current intent based on a misunderstanding in our discourse.</p>

<p>What I was trying to say is that one of the reasons that many people are assumed to be shills it is that it is hard to see what benefit &quot;debunkers&quot; derive from disrupting discussion in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Though there are those who agree with the official account and who are interested in polite discussion, they are few in number compared to the truther-baiters. </p>

<p>Two obvious motivations come to mind. The first is that some people are seriously unhappy and feel powerless and impotent, so they take the opportunity that anonymity offers to pour their frustrations and rage out on others. It&#39;s no longer acceptable to target gays and (insert ethnic minority here), so truthers get targeted. The second motivation would be money, astroturfing  is a common activity and it would explain why some seem so dedicated to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when they obviously do not believe in conspiracies.</p>

<p>You personally are not as offensive as some, but you do tend to side with that type. You also tend to be derogatory and dismissive, if you had more respect for the topic or truthers in general a long term interest based on other motivations would be more believable. </p>

<p>So that is why you are assumed by some to be a shill, in a way it is a compliment.</p>

<p>Why does anyone disagree?  isn&#39;t it because they don&#39;t share the same viewpoint?

<p>What is your definition of a truther-baiter?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first is that some people are seriously unhappy and feel powerless and impotent, so they take the opportunity that anonymity offers to pour their frustrations and rage out on others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>maybe.  Before I got active as being a skeptic of 9/11 conspiracy theories I hung out in creationist forums.  I grew up in a very conservative town so the creationists were often my nemesis.  Both groups tend to use the same arguments so maybe it&#39;s the argument i&#39;m drawn to.   Hard to say.  i&#39;d like to think I&#39;m ok with myself, but maybe arguing with 9/11 conspiracy people is a sign that I&#39;m unstable.  Not sure.  I really enjoy other conspiracy theories.  Like the ufo nuke theory, that&#39;s awesome!. </p>

<p>as do you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re probably right.  I try hard not to be dismissive or derogatory, but honestly it gets hard.  I tend to get stuck thinking there is this other &quot;one&quot; and so arguing the same poing twice or remembering being called names tends to come back.  i&#39;m working on it.  </p>

<p>hehe, maybe, but it still gets under my skin. </p>

<p>Thanks for the chat!  I really do appreciate it. I often think that maybe i&#39;m crazy for even caring.  i probably am crazy anyway. </p>
