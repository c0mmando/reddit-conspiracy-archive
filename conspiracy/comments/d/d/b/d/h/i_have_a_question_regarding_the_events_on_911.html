I do not believe the government planned it although I might believe a handful of people knew it would happen. I think building 7 fell down by itself (why would taking out building 7 matter at that point its not like building 7 was the last straw for war).</p>

<p>My question is this, if we used 9/11 loosely to go into Iraq for WMD and them being a sanctuary for terrorist (which I believe). Why couldn&#39;t this same government that planned all these events down to every detail get some type of WMD in Iraq for us to &quot;find&quot;? If they can pull off 9/11 planting WMD in Iraq would be a cake walk.</p>

<p>I would like to hear out your theories or ideas. Please let&#39;s keep this mature and respect each others opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WTC7 was a command centre for the mayor. He wasn&#39;t in it. There was also rumours of investigations being done through that building. Destroy the buildings, easy to hide old crimes.</p>

<p>Iraq had nothing to do with 911. There was no connection even slightly and the attacks were used by Bush to justify invading.</p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t just &#39;plant&#39; false WMD&#39;s because they didn&#39;t control the inspectors. They were UN inspectors. Bush was supposed to wait for their assessment. He didn&#39;t wait, and he went and attacked. The UN was like &#39;wtf man, we didn&#39;t find nothing&#39;, and Bush was like &#39;so what?&#39;.</p>

<p>Then the UN had an untimely PR event. The food for oil scandal got leaked and it discredited the UN. Of course the US knew about it beforehand but they needed to ruin their credibility since the UN inspectors didn&#39;t find WMD&#39;s and Bush would have been up on war crime charges.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a theory, it&#39;s history. Go look it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read it. I just don&#39;t agree with his suggestion that Iraq had anything to do with 911. Iraq had nothing to do with the attacks and there was a previous decision to fix the evidence to go in there regardless if they found proof or not. Google the Downing Street Memos where Bush and Blair colluded to push for war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t get that at all; for one, it seems that he is perfectly willing to accept the notion that Iraq had something to do with 9/11 in the sense of using it as justification for war.</p>

<p>My point was that the OP is asking for commentary on why no WMD were planted, not for commentary on events surrounding 9/11 itself; you may have simply meant your other comments to be taken as an addendum, but then why place them at the start?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This answers why the mayor wasn&#39;t at building 7, although it brings up another point to the conspiracy:  </p>

<p>&quot;On September 12, 2001, there was due to take place the second part of an exercise known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_operations_and_exercises_on_September_11,_2001">Operation Tripod</a>, set up to &quot;test the plan to distribute antibiotics to the entire city population during a bioterrorism attack&quot; Richard Sheirer, director of the New York City mayor&#39;s Office of Emergency Management (OEM), had hired &quot;over 1,000 Police Academy cadets and Fire Department trainees to play terrified civilians afflicted with various medical conditions, allergies, and panic attacks.&quot; Various individuals were invited to watch, including Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the police and fire commissioners, and representatives of the FBI and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Pier 92 was set up as a model distribution station where the &quot;victims&quot; of the mock attack who needed to receive antibiotics would be treated. The exercise was a follow-up to a previous training exercise in New York, called RED Ex, which took place on May 21, 2001. According to the MTI Report Saving City Lifelines: Lessons Learned in the 9-11 Terrorist Attacks, &quot;September 11 was going to be a busy day at the OEM. Staff members arrived early to prepare for Operation Tripod.&quot;</p>

<p>When the September 11, 2001 attacks began, Operation Tripod was immediately canceled as attentions turned to the real ongoing emergency. Because Pier 92 had been set up ready for the exercise, OEM staff were able to move there and quickly convert it into a large emergency operations center when their original command center (in WTC Building 7) was evacuated and later destroyed. Thus, within 31 hours of the attacks, OEM had a functional facility able to manage the search and rescue effort, just four miles north-northwest of the WTC site. The exercise was later rescheduled and took place on May 22, 2002.&quot;  </p>

<p>Also, besides the other drills that were run that day, let&#39;s not for get about the drills ran on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jInH6VS13YY">7/7</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of those drills you speak of, such as the one where Pentagon employees drilled to evac in case a plane hit were nothing more than a few people in a room with a pad of paper making plans. </p>

<p>What about the drills? Operation Able Archer anyone? Drills are run all the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 wasn&#39;t just about the war. It was about a lot of things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Making rich people richer (such as the man who owned the buildings who had a 99 year lease invoked a few months prior). The war companies got trillions of dollars off 2 fake wars. </p></li>
<li><p>The billions of dollars in gold were stolen from the WTC basements</p></li>
<li><p>National patriotism skyrocketed</p></li>
<li><p>Calling it an arab attack gave the military basic &#39;rights&#39; to attack/ villify any arab in any country the US is affiliated with. </p></li>
<li><p>It enabled the patriot act</p></li>
<li><p>Allowed the drug smuggling growning/ operations in Afghanistan to continue unabated</p></li>
<li><p>The war itself increased the number of military families (removing the need for conscription and the need to pay new recruits higher salaries if it were not engaged). </p></li>
<li><p>Racial profiling increased </p></li>
<li><p>FEAR of terrorism kept everyones mouth shut. </p></li>
<li><p>Politicians linked to the plot made their name and became enlisted as high ranking officials</p></li>
<li><p>Countries were forced to choose: &#39;either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists&#39;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on. All these things led to more control by fewer people. The more you think about it, the more you realize, that when the plan was presented, and a judgement was to be made, the ONLY thing that would have been a &#39;negative&#39; to those in charge was the killing of innocents. But as long as they get paid, there seems to be no reflection on the ethics involved...</p>

<p>I upvoted your post, in the hopes that you look into anything I mentioned. Please read deeper into these events. We are all on the same side.</p>

<p>Take what you read online with a grain of salt its the best I could find that would not require you to sign up (Times). I know the figures PROBABLY won&#39;t match but bare in mind the figures stated what they held may not have even been accurate, since when do banks tell you exactly what they have. Anyways I hope this is something. </p>

<p>I also think the logistics of stealing gold during a rescue effort would be tough to pull off</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thank you for your long post and did read all of the first link so far, I have not started on the videos yet. It is very very interesting. Can you admit however, that the human mind and designed to find patterns and a belief in something will re-enforce what you see? For example the owner the the WTC did not eat breakfast on it that day..sounds kinda fishy. But no one mentions that the creator of Family Guy also missed his doomed flight that day. Maybe he was in on it. I will continue to read your links I find a lot of it interesting, although the whole Jews are behind it think does kinda go overboard for me but ill try and have an open mind. If most of the worlds intelligence agencies knew about it why would they not say something? What would Canada or France or Germany have to loose?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>VIDEO of actual Mossad guys on Israeli talk show</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is extracted from <a href="http://quicksilverscreen.com/watch?video=44189">&quot;Protocols Of Zion&quot;, a film by Marc Levin that appeared on HBO in 2004</a></p>

<p>The part about the &quot;... actual Mossad guys ...&quot; (also known as &quot;The Five Dancing Jews&quot; appears at about 23:00 into the film (total length is one hour, 32 minutes).  They underwent several rounds of questioning and were detained for 10 weeks before being deported on immigration violations after the FBI cleared them of any involvement in 9/11.</p>

<p>(The part about Matisyahu appears at about 1:04:30 into the film.)</p>

<p>(The film also deals with: The National Alliance, &#39;The Eternal Jew&#39;, the JewWatch website, Who Killed Christ? [Mel Gibson, James Carroll], Holocaust denial, The Jews in Hollywood, The Blood Libel, Hamas / Islamic-fundamentalism, Daniel Pearl and Anti-semitism [Elie Wiesel])</p>

<p>after Chertoff ordered FBI to release them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you saying that Michael Chertoff ordered the FBI to release these suspects, and they just did so?  At the time, Chertoff was the head of the <em>criminal division</em> of the Department of Justice.  The Director of the FBI didn&#39;t report to him.  At the time, the Director reported to, and took orders from, the Attorney General, who, during the time in question, was John Ashcroft.  (Now, after the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, the director reports to the Director of National Intelligence, who, in turn, reports to the President.)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can you explain <em>why</em> the Director of the FBI would release them, when he was ordered to do so by someone that he did not answer to?  </p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t you think that the Director would check with his boss, the Attorney General, before just releasing them on the say-so of someone to whom he didn&#39;t report?</p></li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I think fabricating evidence of an active WMD program in Iraq would have been more difficult than it would be to execute something like 9/11. One thing to remember is that all throughout the run-up to the 2003 invasion, the IAEA complained that their inspections showed no credible Iraqi WMD program.</p>

<p>So if, let&#39;s say, Paul Bremer happened to just trip over a nuclear warhead in Baghdad after the invasion, suddenly proving that Saddam really was redeveloping his biological/chemical/nuclear programs, the logical inconsistencies and the sheer duplicity of it all would be much more difficult to neutralize or ignore than that which is associated with 9/11.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some points for and against:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not convinced that they would have had a hard time selling it, even if they did claim to have found a warhead. You simply claim that you&#39;ve got more boots on the ground, whose movements aren&#39;t being restricted - of course you were better able to find a WMD than a small team of UN inspectors. In addition to that, it&#39;s not as though the UN is a cherished institution among the Americans. Who are they going to believe?</p>

<p>What about related materials? You don&#39;t have to come up with an actual warhead; something like a prototype missile, for example. Heck, don&#39;t even go that far. Just make a photo op out of some modern troops in front of a soviet-era SCUD, and claim that you&#39;ve found them. Considering the kinds of evidence they were using as a basis for war, just about anything would have been better in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>On the other hand, keep in mind when using the lack of one set of events as a criticism against another set of events not to assume that they necessarily have the same set of causes behind them. If you&#39;re assuming that some element within the US government carries responsibility for carrying out the 9/11 attacks, then it would make more sense to use the lack of found WMD as a basis for criticizing this theory. However, it&#39;s not useful as a criticism against theories which argue that 9/11 carried out by a foreign power with small elements of US assistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree there are no WMD in Iraq, i mean i do not doubt a cache of gas buried somewhere in the desert where it will never be found, I mean iraq DID have WMD and had used them. Didn&#39;t they get the gas from France? Anyways hiding gas is easy but I doubt they even had a delivery system anymore for it making it useless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You remember the Enron scandal, well the SEC was &quot;looking&quot; into all of that.....but guess which building had all their offices and documents? </p>

<p>Building 7.  </p>

<p>The FBI, CIA and the SEC all had offices in #7.  What else do you think got blown up when it went down?  </p>

<p>One other question for you OP, when you&#39;re in a building and the fire alarm is pulled.....are they getting everyone out of the building because they&#39;re worried you&#39;ll burn up in the fire or because they&#39;re worried the building will just suddenly come down on itself just like a C.D.?</p>

<p>What is the point in having a Company called Controlled Demolition Inc., which goes around the country and probably the world spending hundreds of thousands of dollars and months of preparation time to demolish a building EXACTLY like building 7?</p>

<p>All you need is fire?  A random, few floor fire and a building comes down symmetrically at FREE FALL speeds?  Really?  Controlled Demolition Inc&#39;s business is based on this and they were just made inconsequential by FIRE.</p>

<p>Ask yourself if that makes any sense.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnmbUDeHus">WATCH</a></p>

<p>You think fire is that selective?  Fire can be that precise?  </p>

<p>This resulted in 3000 civie deaths, 1mil Iraqi civie deaths, who knows how many Afghani deaths, and another 5000 US soldiers and a few hundred of my buddies from Canada.  Not to mention all the other countries who pitched in.</p>

<p>We should know for sure if we have all been fooled.  Don&#39;t you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the damage that everyone focuses on is not at all a factor.</p>

<p>IF the building had to be taken down via explosives.....a couple of girders through the side of the building would and could not disrupt the WHOLE structure enough to cause such a symmetric drop of the building.</p>

<p>What you&#39;re talking about, if it was a factor, would not cause that kind of symmetry.  Randomness demands that the building would fall to the side or something like that.  Its like everyone imagines the whole building giving up all at once.  It just decided to jump in the air and fall on its ass.  </p>

<p>Besides that, NIST says that FIRE was the cause.  Not even they called that damage a factor.  I don&#39;t know why others consider it to be an issue.</p>

<p>Watch the vid I linked to.  You can HEAR the explosion.  Turn up the volume and listen for it.  Does fire go &quot;boom&quot; just before a sudden collapse?</p>

<p>I think building 7 fell down by itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply not possible that it fell down.  It didn&#39;t fall down.  It collapsed through the path of most resistance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(why would taking out building 7 matter at that point its not like building 7 was the last straw for war).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Building 7 was a federal building.  It contained evidence of finical crimes.</p>

<p>In fact, 9/11 was nothing more than large scale finical terrorism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if we used 9/11 loosely to go into Iraq</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We did use it for this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why couldn&#39;t this same government that planned all these events down to every detail get some type of WMD in Iraq for us to &quot;find&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It simply wasn&#39;t the same government.  The government did not do 9/11.  The WMD story was a well known lie, and it&#39;s a war crime.  They could have made it worse.</p>

<p>The 9/11 story had holes in it; that&#39;s to say, they didn&#39;t pull it off as planed.  WTC7 was imploded when the plane that was to hit it was shot down.  There are many witnesses and whistle blowers.</p>

<p>Your question shows some large misunderstandings of what happened.</p>

The stocks thing is odd..I mean humans are programmed to recognize patterns even when they do not exist and the stock market changes all the time and we can compare any two events easily..but still the timing of it was nice. but I think that just makes it much less unlikely because cashing in all your stocks at once makes them loose vaule.

<p>That&#39;s why we use statistics for objective analysis. The options in question were trading at volume within a stable range. There was a very large, statistically unusual, block of options on these stocks traded immediately before 9/11.

<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/Pentagon_taxi_hit_by_lightpole.jpg">This guy</a>.</p>

<p>The story is that Flight 77 hit a series of light poles.  Most of the light poles were in the grass, but this one went through this guys windshield.  He was driving about 55 mph, and the official story says this airplane was going 550 mph in the opposite direction.  So, that drove the light pole through his cab without scratching the hood of it, or harming the driver.  BS was called, and the cab driver admitted the story was staged.</p>

<p>The guy who took many of these close up photos, had them in his personal collection.  They did not become public until shortly after.  Once they became public, the guy that took the photos committed suicide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They say the plane vaporized, but they can still find bodies and DNA.  Strange no?</p>

<p>Lloyd is part of it, and it&#39;s critical to be aware of because....the plane was no where near the location his car was hit.  The whole &quot;damage path&quot; was on the South side of a Gas station located close by.  The plane was witnessed by 13 people, including 2 Pentagon Police officers.  William Lagasse and Chadwick Brooks.  They saw the plane fly by them on the NORTH side of the gas station.</p>

<p>What does that mean?  The poles and the &quot;damage path&quot; could not have been caused by the plane.  That means they staged the event.  They staged the cab.  They needed solid evidence, and knowing people would not believe the plane crashed with only a bit of debris on the ground.  </p>

<p><a href="http://citizeninvestigationteam.com/nsa.html">Please watch their Interviews.</a></p>

<p>All the witnesses say the same thing.  They all saw it on the North side of the gas station.  So, detractors will say nothing about them.  They cannot deny what they all say.  How they all say the same thing.  What does that mean?  They can&#39;t all be wrong.  They can&#39;t all be hallucinating.  They can&#39;t all be lying in the same way.  Its just not possible.  </p>

<p>The two cops saw the plane North of them.....the 4 witnesses, William Middleton Sr., Darrel Stratford, Darius Prather, Donald Carter.....saw the plane fly by SOUTH of them, but still North of the gas station.  It flew in between the two groups.  Lastly, Sean Boger was in the Heliport tower, he was the guy in there....and saw it flying right at him.  It is a triangulated view.  The plane was no where else.</p>

<p>Flyover.  The damage path was constructed but they couldn&#39;t get the plane to fly in the exact position they wanted.  They made their bed, and now they have to sleep in it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s OK, you can count on these witnesses because they all say the same thing.  </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t have a gun to their heads.  They just saw the plane and ran.  That detail can&#39;t be missed.  </p>

<p>Tell me how you think they&#39;re all lying together.  Tell me how you believe they&#39;re all hallucinating?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter HOW they did it....you can saw, blow up the poles....make it sound all dramatic, but it can easily be done.  In fact....It WAS done.  The poles were downed.  Simple as that.</p>

<p>Guess all you like, but that doesn&#39;t make it not true.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they DID fail.  That&#39;s why we have these witnesses.  They PROVE the plane was on the NORTH SIDE.  It can&#39;t have hit those poles on the SOUTH side.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to delve into your imagination.  The fact is, they all saw the plane in one spot.  That spot could not have caused the damage path.  Plain and simple.</p>

<p>Again, those witnesses are not hallucinating.  They gave  their testimony soon after and later again to the CMH, Center for Military history.  Their story never changed.</p>

<p>You may have been the worst witness to that crime, but the detail that YOU and 12 other witnesses (hypothetical) saw that you had a gun to your head, it would be pretty hard to prove that you DIDN&#39;T have a gun to your head.</p>

<p>That is the critical detail.  It doesn&#39;t matter HOW it got their, it was three.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The witnesses saw no missile, heard no missile.....there is no REAL evidence of a missile.  That came about because the only footage provided shows a &quot;streak&quot; and it bloomed from there.</p>

<p>Again, they took away 86 or so tapes showing what happened.  Don&#39;t you think if those videos SHOWED a plane hitting the building, we would be watching them and this case would be closed?  What have they to hide man??</p>

<p>The damage path was their best effort to stage the area and make it MORE plausible.  They probably knew they wouldn&#39;t get it perfect.  Either way, those poles were down, the damage path through the building itself is different than one which a NORTH side plane would have cut through the building.</p>

<p>When it goes click for you......consider why Rosevelt Roberts, another Pentagon Police officer would run out of the loading docks right after the explosion to see a &quot;Commercial Jet&quot; flying over the parking lot low and away.</p>

<p>He thinks there were two planes.  They were all fooled that day man.  It was a heavy event.  Heavy on the mind.  It worked.</p>

<p>But, it cannot happen any other way.  That plane flew over the building.  They blew up the one side of the Pentagon that just HAPPENED to be renovated a month earlier to protect against bomb blasts.  Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s odd?  Just that one side??</p>

<p>The day before, Rumsfeld said the US cannot account for 2.3 TRILLION bucks.  All the info pertaining to that, was blown up in that one section of the Pentagon.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, yes, the building &#39;falling down by itself&#39; because of debris impact is possible. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s anywhere near as likely as an internal explosion, however, in explaining the structural failure that we see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t confuse physics with motives! You cannot argue that building 7 collapsed by itself, because it would not make sense to demolish it! Look at the evidence, and ask: what is the most plausible mechanism of collapse? Could relatively small fires throughout a building like that cause it to collapse at free fall speed? </p>

<p>It&#39;s exactly the same flawed reasoning that makes people think that the laws physics were suspended on 9/11 because it would&#39;ve taken an &quot;unthinkable&quot; conspiracy to place all the explosives etc. </p>

<p>Sure, motive matters and who could have done it and why is important as hell, but do not confuse that what the physical evidence tells us about HOW the collapse actually happened and what that evidence tells us about what caused the collapse. </p>

<p>As a guy with a pipe once said:</p>

<p>&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. It is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognize danger when it is close upon you.&quot;

It&#39;d be funny if this wasn&#39;t important).</p>

<p>Why do some people think that questioning one aspect of the massive body of evidence casting serious doubts on the official account of the events of 9/11 and it&#39;s perpetrators makes the official story plausible? </p>

<p>Come on, there&#39;s more than enough unanswered questions to merit a new, independent investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did the building collapse at free fall speed?</p>

<p>As opposed to slow motion?</p>

<p>Why did it happen twice in under two hours, when steel-framed skyscrapers have never collapsed due to fire before or after 9/11?</p>

<p>Jet fuel burns hotter then printer paper and wooden desks</p>

<p>Why did Bush lie about seeing the first tower collapse?</p>

<p>Maybe he was mistaken? A lot of people claim they saw the first plane hit when only the people in NY could have. No news coverage was on the building on 9/11 and I do not think there were any recordings from the webcams they had throughout the buildings.</p>

<p>How were the hijackers named the day after?</p>

<p>Airport videos, their bags, the hotel, the car, um a passport?</p>

<p>Why did tower 7 collapse (again at free fall speed)?</p>

<p>Did you even read any of my links about WTC7?</p>

<p>How was a 767 flown at 410 knots at ground level?</p>

<p>Very badly it crashed</p>

<p>Why were none of the planes shot down?</p>

<p>Jets do not fly at the speed of light, by the time they were alerted the first plane already hit.</p>

<p>How do you fit a passenger plane in the hole in the pentagon?</p>

<p>You dont it blows up

Plane hitting a cement wall</p>

<p>Why were the evidence moved?</p>

<p>Evidence is always moved and cataloged from a crime scene</p>

<p>Why do 60% of the 9/11 commissioners say the investigation was flawed?</p>

<p>It may have been. flawed does not mean inaccurate or conspiracy</p>

<p>Why did Osama bin Laden deny involvement?</p>

<p>The same reason why everyone in jail is innocent, also he admitted to it on Dec 11 IIRC</p>

<p>Why were they Saudis flown out of the US?</p>

<p>Lynching? You know they were flown out after air travel was already restored right?</p>

<p>Why did the towers fall through the path of most resistance?</p>

<p>Read the links</p>

<p>Why have building codes not been revised as two unexpected collapses took place in buildings that were over-designed?</p>

<p>They have been, staircases are wider among other things, the guy that designed the WTC said they fell like they should have</p>

<p>Why have there been no subsequent attacks when a 2003 experiment by the FAA showed that mock-bombs could easily be brought onto passenger airlines.</p>

<p>Why should there be?</p>

<p>Why has no-one blown up an airliner using that 80% Stroh rum or Lithium Ion battery you can take bring with you into the cabin?</p>

<p>That would not bring down an airliner. Shit a hand gernade would probably not bring one down if it went off in the right spot, depressurization does not make a plane crash.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;ve read them. Apparently you didn&#39;t read the article on how to reason and how NOT to reason. Your post above places you just a hairs breadth above the normal troll, still somewhat below the regular, paid propagandist. </p>

<p>Anyway, let me just comment on a few things:</p>

<p>Double standards: I argue, that because there are questions that are unanswered, a new investigation is mandated, then you argue that we cannot be sure that these unanswered questions mean that foul play was involved. Exactly, we need A REAL INVESTIGATION because we&#39;re still in the dark! </p>

<p>It does not follow that because a flawed investigation does not necessarily mean a grand conspiracy, then such a flawed investigation is satisfactory or anywhere close to conclusive. Maybe you can point to the trial in absentia of Bin Ladin or to any conviction? (Of course the admissions of guilt by people tortured for years and years at Guantanamo Bay cannot be considered valid or trustworthy).</p>

<p>False dichotomy and 4th grade reasoning: No, the opposite of free fall speed is not slow motion in this case. In fact, it doesn&#39;t really make sense to say that the opposite of fast is slow, except in semantic terms. In physics the opposite of 10 mph would be -10 mph, right? That&#39;s another discussion.</p>

<p>In this case, in order to show that a building collapsed due to progressive, self-sustaining structural failure, one would have to account for the forces involved. It takes a giant leap of idiocy to believe that anything could fall through steel and concrete, exerting enough force on something that was constructed to withstand massive loads, that it would crumble not only fast but at a speed as if it was magically pulverized. </p>

<p>Why should there be subsequent attacks? Again you&#39;re losing yourself in semantics. What does &quot;should&quot; even mean in this context? I&#39;m not the one saying we have crazy Muslim terrorists that want to blow shit up in the US, you are, and no one is talking about certainties, because there are none in this world. However, would it not seem highly probable, that if it&#39;s possible to do and bombs could easily be brought onto airliners, then those crazy Afghan suicide bombers would want to do something in retaliation of the destruction of their country?</p>

<p>Jet fuel is kerosene btw, and no, it doesn&#39;t burn very hot. Nowhere near hot enough to weaken steel significantly, apart from that most of the fuel can be seen exploding on impact, as would be expected. </p>

<p>And no, the planes were not flown poorly, they were flown expertly and hit their targets with superhuman accuracy. A 767 is not able to fly at almost 500 mph 500 feet off the ground. </p>

<p>And the jet you have hitting that wall, is a tiny F4 Phantom hitting a containment dome, no way that can be used to show what would happen when a 767 hits a high rise. Obviously. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m wasting my time with this. Go study and try doing so with an open mind if you&#39;re actually interested in the truth. If you&#39;re already decided, you&#39;ll be suffering from cognitive and confirmation bias and you&#39;ll have to work through that. It&#39;s not my responsibility that you choose to stay in the ranks of those who defend the indefensible out of ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The planes were not flown with &quot;super human&quot; accuracy, the second one almost hit and had to roll at the last second just to get more coverage.</p>

<p>You are not wasting your time but at no point have I called anyone in this thread a troll, a 4th grader or any other term as has been said to me several times.</p>

<p>The F4 was shown how strong a concrete block can be, the Pentagon not the steel WTC</p>

<p>Why bother trying to blow up an airplane with bombs snuck on board? I mean really a bomb from a battery blowing up will not bring down an airliner. Airliners have landed safely after having a whole chunk of the cabin fall off (1 flight attendant got blown out and died). </p>

<p>Bomb a plane and MAYBE kill what? 100 or so people? Your better off throwing molotav cocktails in a crowded theater eaiser to do and probably more death</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me quote a good friend:</p>

<p>&quot;You know what gets me about 9/11? What is the FINAL truther thesis? It&#39;s not that 9/11 was an inside job. The final truther thesis is that the official story is entirely bunk, there&#39;s mountains of evidence that suggest something entirely different happened, consequently, WE NEED ANOTHER INTERNATIONALLY-MONITORED UNPOLITICIZED INVESTIGATION. Yet, despite MOUNTAINs of grossly-tangible evidence, &#39;debunkers&#39; choose to gloss over it all and effectively respond: WE DON&#39;T NEED TO ASK MORE QUESTIONS OR INVESTIGATE FURTHER. To me, that position is almost indefensible. We spent more money on investigating the Monica Lewinski trial than 9/11, and yet we&#39;re the cuckoos for having the audacity to want serious answers to very serious questions? Fuck that bull shit.&quot;</p>

<p>All I&#39;m asking is that the law is applied. As long as there is no universality in the application of law and those with power and money are exempt, we do not live under the rule of law, we live in a dictatorship.</p>

<p>You know what&#39;s a waste? </p>

<ul>
<li>Millions of dead Iraqis. </li>
<li>Hundreds of thousands dead Afghans. </li>
<li>Hundreds of thousands of wounded and dead American soldiers.</li>
<li>The middle east covered in depleted uranium (much like the US soaked Vietnam in dioxin)</li>
<li>45 million Americans in poverty</li>
<li>40% of the wealth in the hands of 1% of the population, when people are starving to death or dying from lack of health care.</li>
<li>A smoldering world about to cave in on itself because a tiny wealthy elite is too dumb to use our limited resources to solve real world problems, like &quot;how the hell do we live together without bombing everything all the time?&quot;, for the sake of the perpetuation of humanity.</li>
</ul>

<p>One should make damn sure that he&#39;s informed and looks at events from all sides using multiple sources and always staying weary of how those sources may have been influenced lest we get angry with the wrong people: Immigrants, Muslims, those poorer than you, truthers, tea-partiers, gypsies etc. </p>

<p>The real criminals are the psychopaths who believe they&#39;re in their good right hoard the earths resources so much beyond their needs that the only possible motive can be power. We tried that shit before, hell, the US was founded to escape serfdom and oppression.</p>

<p>Now take your head out of the sand and turn off the fucking television.</p>

<p>And another thing. You&#39;re admitting no proper investigation was done and now maybe we cannot find out the truth. Wow. That&#39;s criminal incompetence at best, high treason at worst. Apart from that there&#39;s plenty of evidence, including the testimony of 9/11 commissioners, that the Bush administration obstructed their investigation. There&#39;s another high-crime for you. So ok, let&#39;s forget the new 9/11 investigation and bring Bush, Cheney, Rice and Rumsfeld up on charges of obstruction of justice or worse.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not calling you a troll, I&#39;m saying your reasoning is slightly better than the regular troll and I&#39;m calling it 4th grade reasoning when you explain away the collapses (three of them) at free fall speed by using a false dichotomy: &quot;as opposed to slow motion&quot; - No, ffs, as opposed to the time it would have to take for the falling top of the building to crush the building below. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had it up to above both ears with apologists like you, no go do your own research and let it take you where reason and necessity must. </p>

<p>Jesus fucking Christ.</p>

<p>That is the notion of the &quot;single conspiratorial group&quot;. </p>

<p>Your question has it the implicit notion that the same set of planners behind 911 is the same set that was profiting from the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Look at it this way, if you were planning a bank heist -- would you care if the mayor then decided to make that crime part of his stump speech to raise taxes to hire more cops?</p>

<p>Secondly, the answer to your question (why didn&#39;t they fake the WMD&#39;s) is answered by simple empirical evidence: Because they didn&#39;t have to. Those that profited from the war(s) were able to do so <em>without</em> any evidence of WMD&#39;s ever being present -- and they still do to this day. Why go through the trouble of faking something when its not needed?</p>

<p>My question is this, if we used 9/11 loosely to go into Iraq for WMD and them being a sanctuary for terrorist (which I believe). Why couldn&#39;t this same government that planned all these events down to every detail get some type of WMD in Iraq for us to &quot;find&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Bush Administration and the CIA had a plan to plant WMDs in Iraq and sent in a team to do so but they were taken out by friendly fire. At least that is the story that has been around for 7 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So UA 93 was aiming for WT7? Really that building would seem like a bitch to hit, I mean one of the planes almost hit the second tower. The thing about people saying it got shot down that I do not get is do they understand how many people it takes to launch an aircraft? The people who fuel it are not the same ones who arm it. They are not the same ones that help taxi it out, they are not the ones in ATC giving the greenlight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finding one or some WMDs in Iraq would bring on <em>immediate</em> and <em>multinational</em> investigations.  Furthermore, with just about any military-grade weapon, it&#39;s possible to trace its origins to various weapons facilities and laboratories... chemical compounds from lab X, casing fabricated in plant Y, computer chip from corporation Z... <em>who made this and how did Iraq get it?</em>  And if Iraq made it, then let&#39;s start uprooting those secret underground chemical labs!</p>

<p>Actually finding something would have saved face for the Bush administration politically... but <em>planting</em> something would have been a logistical nightmare.</p>

<p>9/11 wasn&#39;t that complex, really.  Take out the &quot;attack&quot; part, or take out the &quot;conspiracy&quot; part (whichever you might believe)... planes took off, buildings came down.  A puppeteer and an unscrupulous and well-compensated paramilitary unit could have pulled it off <em>maybe</em> even more easily than 19 box-cutter-weilding Egyptians.</p>

<p>9/11 was an event.  Not something prolonged to any degree.  It was contained.  It was internal.  The powers that be were gonna take care of it and <em>get the bad guy whodunit</em>.  And that&#39;s all that mattered to people at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...are you talking about Iraq or Afghanistan, now?  When we provided weapons to Afghanistan, that was 20-25 years ago.  Any &quot;leftover WMDs&quot; would have been sold and sold again since then.  They&#39;re worth more <em>not detonated</em> to a governmental military effort.  These ragtag militias aren&#39;t fighting with much more than AKs, some hand grenades, some anti-aircraft, and their homemade pipe bombs.  If they had something more damaging, we&#39;d have seen it.</p>

<p><em>He who wishes to fight must first count the cost. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming, then men&#39;s weapons will grow dull and their ardor will be dampened. If you lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State will not be equal to the strain... in war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns.</em>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously its impossible to say &quot;the government&quot; planned it.  That broad of a term encompasses all government workers, and that&#39;s just ridiculous.  From here there are a few options you could say it was entirely planned by islamic extremists, and truly succeeded with no assistance.  Option 2 would be the same, however include some kind of collusion among the security companies of the airliners, norad employees and things of that nature, select few highups. The third option is the whole thing was a false flag by somebody for the traditional profit motive of either defense, defense contracts, insurance fraud or some combination thereof.  </p>

<p>How can you believe that? Pre war Iraq was a very unfriendly place for terrorists, or anyone not following Sadams rule. Post war, well that is a different story, and guess who you can blame for that. </p>

<p>France supplying WMD? Sure, but guess what, the U.S.A was Iraq&#39;s biggest ally and arms supplier during the conflict with Iran, strange bedfellows wouldn&#39;t you say? And guess who was was the spark that lit the Iran/Iraq fire, a little company called BP Oil ( back when it was called the Anglo Iranian Oil Company.)</p>

<p>They did not have to plant anything except fear into the minds of the western world via mass media and political force ( maybe they got the idea from terrorist black book? that is a reference if you know it..). Anyone with a legitimate concern was squished, silenced or killed, like David Kelly or Sibel Edmonds.</p>

<p>Your going to get downvotes because your question is not very good, go read some books.</p>
