       It's one of the only things that bothers me about Randi, Shermer, Penn and Teller, etc. The government is no more a reliable authority on UFOs than Monsanto is a reliable authority on feeding the poor. There is a unique culture and an overt or covert agenda in any large organization. It seems this is a huge blind spot for professional skeptics. Do they really not see this flaw in their reasoning?

       The difference between someone who is sceptical and someone who is into conspiracies is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The sceptical person will take statistics as being accurate until it can be proved that the method of data collection or its reporting is flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The conspiracy theory person will cast doubt upon all statistics because he/she cannot believe the government has any interest in reporting things accurately.

       The problem with being in camp 1) is that the government can shove an enormous amount of numbers and ideas right up your ass and they can pack it right in there tight so if you need to wait for incontrovertible proof to invalidate the sources that the government likely shredded then you are going to be a moron lead around by your nose with a big fuck yourself package right in the backside as they implement their plans.  Then the following year when it is revealed how full of shit they are it is all just water under the bridge.

       Which is why we should be able to actually talk to the people responsible for collating and reporting statistics and ask them what they do and how they do it.

       If you believe that the government has been hijacked by the military industrial complex, and that 911 was an inside job, then yes you will question nearly everything the government tells you, you would be a fool not to.

       Far too many people define reality by what they enjoy believing. Personally, I take an agnostic approach toward UFOs visiting earth. However, I am very skeptical about the "life only exists on earth" idea.

       I think that many people rely on some crutches to keep themselves sane, and a benevolent government is one such crutch.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you begin to believe that the government does not have your best interests at heart, then a whole lot of hurt will open up for you in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I began to be interested in conspiracy theories when some genuine conspiracies showed that the government really was not acting in the interests of good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Iraq war was a clear example of a government action with no moral centre.  Depending upon which statistics you believe, between 100,000 and 1,000,000 people have died on the basis of intelligence which was known to be faulty before the war was declared.
      </p>
      <p>
       With such heinous actions beyond question, many conspiracies begin to seem more likely.

       I guess we should trust professional conspiracy theorists, since they couldn't possibly have their own agendas.

       Because the term "skeptic" doesn't mean the same thing as "skeptical."
      </p>
      <p>
       Professional skeptics like Randi don't trust the govt any more than they trust Monsanto, they trust only evidence that can be independently verified. That's why CSICOP was formed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now CSICOP had many flaws in and of itself, but it was completely separate from the government and did a pretty darn good job of "debunking" (I hate that word) UFO stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please please please, don't take my word for it... Go out and read Carl Sagan's book "The Demon Haunted World", and look at the literally hundreds of references that he sources when talking about UFO encounters.
      </p>
      <p>
       That book is really the bread and butter for any skeptic, and contains Sagan's famous "Baloney Detection Toolkit". HIGHLY recommended.
