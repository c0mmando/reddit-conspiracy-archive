       If the US was capable of plotting 9/11 why didn't they just lie and say they did find WMD's? If they can fake a moon landing I'm sure they can fake some WMD's on our own planet?

       The entire world was watching everything coming in and out of Iraq just then, it would have been easier to actually create a "false flag" on our own shores than to do anything on their soil at that time. That, and, as I said the inspectors were not  our people, they were actually honest. ;)

       Because any WMD's that Sadaam might have one had, came directly from 'legitimate' arms deals with the US and the UK. And each of those trades had a paper trail that identified the specific weapons. The UN weapons inspectors would quickly identify individual warheads that had been smuggled into Iraq.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that was not how Iraq's WMD program worked. They developed their own weapons with western aid, like the nerve gas they used on the Kurds. This type of WMD needs a large research and manufacturing infrastructure. Not something that can be 'planted'.

       There's no need to find WMD, the whole idea behind 9/11 was to spark off and get the population behind a sustained conflict in the middle east, among other things(hello, patriot act,) and to justify the creation of a massive internal army(the anti-terrorism bureaucracies, homeland security.)
      </p>
      <p>
       the whole "WMD" claim was just one more small justification and carrot for the idiot masses, they probably didn't fake a find because it would have been a whole lot harder to fool the international community on, as the intelligence agencies of the other major nations of the world would have already known that Iraq didn't have them, and that they weren't developing them in the first place. There was just no need to do it, the masses are just too stupid/naive to notice or care, the idea was to get the war started, that's it, no need to make the lies believable for an absurdly brainwashed mob back home.

       I thought I should let you know that in this case, you don't come across as very smart. Maybe you are, but you don't seem it here. If you are going to spark a controversy, and someone takes the effort to make a point, the least you could do is rebuttal.

       It's about creating a phoney war on terror. It worked. It's called propaganda. Governments lie. I don't think the WMD really mattered. Sort of like not finding Osama Bin Ladin. Once you have the people whipped up into fear based frenzy you can go ahead an invade then occuppy nations at will.

       How do you think it should have collapsed? Use logic and physics to develop a hypothesis.  If you're going to have an opinion, at least think a moment before you choose to defend it. Then come back here and start talking.

       They can't fake a moon landing, moon rocks are hard to manufacture.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also cannot manufacture a WMD FROM Iraq.  The thing would have to be scrutinized pretty closely.  They would be able to tell if the thing was "US" made, ie faked or actually made with Iraqi technology.....which would appear "real".
      </p>
      <p>
       It don't think it would be that easy.  It would be impossible to show that it came from anywhere except the US.  If they did stand up and cry to the heavens they found them, people would want to look and confirm.  The US would have to pull it back like a little child not wanting others to play with his toy.

       Being a truther is like being a creationist - you don't have to present evidence FOR creation by having theories that fit together and make sense together and are harmonious with the evidence. All you have to do is question evolution. And the dumber and angrier you are, the better, because the more your idiot questions will flabbergast the reasonable.

       Being a denier is exactly like being a 5 year old and being informed by a friend that Santa isn't real. The 5 year old turns on the friend, to the point of being violent in some cases, or running, crying to an authority figure in protest.  Eventually, the 5 year old acquiesces unless they're an idiot or a salaried Santa promotor.

       There is a lot more evidence pointing to a conspiracy than pointing to their official story. Use your fucking brain.
