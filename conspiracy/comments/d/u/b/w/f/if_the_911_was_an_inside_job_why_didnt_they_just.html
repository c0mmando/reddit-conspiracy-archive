    <div class="md"><p>Because any WMD&#39;s that Sadaam might have one had, came directly from &#39;legitimate&#39; arms deals with the US and the UK. And each of those trades had a paper trail that identified the specific weapons. The UN weapons inspectors would quickly identify individual warheads that had been smuggled into Iraq.                    </p>

<p>But that was not how Iraq&#39;s WMD program worked. They developed their own weapons with western aid, like the nerve gas they used on the Kurds. This type of WMD needs a large research and manufacturing infrastructure. Not something that can be &#39;planted&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no need to find WMD, the whole idea behind 9/11 was to spark off and get the population behind a sustained conflict in the middle east, among other things(hello, patriot act,) and to justify the creation of a massive internal army(the anti-terrorism bureaucracies, homeland security.)</p>

<p>the whole &quot;WMD&quot; claim was just one more small justification and carrot for the idiot masses, they probably didn&#39;t fake a find because it would have been a whole lot harder to fool the international community on, as the intelligence agencies of the other major nations of the world would have already known that Iraq didn&#39;t have them, and that they weren&#39;t developing them in the first place. There was just no need to do it, the masses are just too stupid/naive to notice or care, the idea was to get the war started, that&#39;s it, no need to make the lies believable for an absurdly brainwashed mob back home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re fucking retarded.</p>

<p>Why do you pretend that everyone not buying the official 9/11 story also denies the moon landing? Is it because you know you don&#39;t have a leg to stand on without resorting to bullshit like this?</p>

<p>Seriously, why the fuck are you even here? Just GTFO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can&#39;t fake a moon landing, moon rocks are hard to manufacture.</p>

<p>They also cannot manufacture a WMD FROM Iraq.  The thing would have to be scrutinized pretty closely.  They would be able to tell if the thing was &quot;US&quot; made, ie faked or actually made with Iraqi technology.....which would appear &quot;real&quot;.  </p>

<p>It don&#39;t think it would be that easy.  It would be impossible to show that it came from anywhere except the US.  If they did stand up and cry to the heavens they found them, people would want to look and confirm.  The US would have to pull it back like a little child not wanting others to play with his toy.</p>
