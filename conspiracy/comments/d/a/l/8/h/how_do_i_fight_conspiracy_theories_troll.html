       Broadly speaking, I'm asking an advice how to conduct a discussion with a weird person. While I see that he is all wrong others might think that he might be right at least in something, so I'm not going to leave it as is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's say, I want to convey my point so clear that even weirdo won't be able to say anything.

      <p>
       Your thoughts on this?

      <p>
       It can be seen as an experiment in
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric">
        rhetoric
       </a>
       . What people calling trolling now has its roots in Ancient Greece's art. There are different kinds of trolling, some people do not realize this.

       A problem here is that person I'm debating with can reject pretty much any fact and reference claiming that it is jewish. And as arguments have to rely on facts it's a bit hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wonder what to do in this case -- is there some kind of undeniable facts, can I build my arguments on them?

       It's the same advice for everyone, I just kinda figured you wouldn't "get it", since (from your detailed post) you were already hell-bent on settling for nothing less than trollolliousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite your appeal to longevity, and your claim that you've
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        never engaged in trolling
        <em>
         here
        </em>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       you betray your lack of insightful wisdom by asking "how do I troll?" and then again by asking for clarification of the only sane response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, you validated my implied point that you wouldn't "get it" even if I had posted it as a direct response to you, rather than as a message to subsequent passers-by.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all of the pre-existing justifications as well as this specific instance of real-time illustration, I stand by my post: Don't feed the trolls.

      <p>
       Seems to me as though you have all the skills you need. What you lack is specific arsenals of canned comments. Usually these come in the form of facts (sometimes, but sometimes not, found on wikipedia). If your troll-adversary is characterizing facts in an anti-semitic flavour, your only recourse is to re-characterize those same facts.... or, to resort to trolling (which is the same thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       When you become wise, though, you'll see that I was right (and I'm going to take my own advice now, because of the self-evident futility of this discussion).

       No, it means that at least one of his names is not in fact a practicing Jew. It's misleading to include people from Jewish backgrounds if they aren't practicing the faith which is the assumption at the core of the list.

       Clearly you are young and a little self righteous - with some time &amp; humbling you may realize that your efforts are misdirected.  You may think you are 'solving' a problem when in fact, you 'are' part the problem.  The world is a mirror - it reflects whatever attitude you present to it.

       So, let's say, some person is speaking about pseudo-science in a newsgroup. And I'm a huge fan of real science. Do you think it is wrong and immature to confront a person which spreads bad ideas?

       You are infringing upon his/her right to have ideas (that you have concluded to be wrong).  This is the sort of intellectual marauding that inhibits free flowing ideas.  Debating is one thing, what you are doing is hitting below the belt.
       <br/>
       You will encounter an infinite amount of pseudo-science on the internet, so why even bother trying to control it?  Let people discover the truth on their own time, not yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, did you ever stop to think that maybe your responses are conditioned?

       You see, I don't want to ban him, just to convince -- just as he tries to convince me. These "ideas" are conflicting, so they cannot be correct at same time. Either he convinces me or I convince him. (Or...)

       How exactly? He is using manipulative rhetoric as well. Do you seriously thing that nazi pseudo-science lover is not familiar with enhanced discussion techniques?

       Because I was enjoing discussions in that newsgroup for something like eight years. We have some trolls in there but they are of funny kind. Now some dude comes and spews tons of crap and pisses off pretty much everybody. Now as heated discussions is my hobby I'd like confront him.

       Yes, because discussions are known to be bad for ones who participate in them.

       I see it as a form of rhetoric. To begin with, there are different kinds of trolling: some is for cheap lulz, another brings important questions into discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding a little comedy into the debate would not hurt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if it is not bad then being interesting is sufficient reason to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting for following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        in heated debates I can formulate my point better, more vividly
       </li>
       <li>
        I can learn new stuff in process
       </li>
       <li>
        it is like a game when you fight with an oponent, so it is definitely entertaining
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       P.S.: Why downvotes? I thought my arguments are reasonable.
