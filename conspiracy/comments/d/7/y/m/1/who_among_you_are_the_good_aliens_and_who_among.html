They jump INTO our consciousnesses and coerce us one way or the other. They&#39;re slick bastards, too.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the ones who are readily playing games with you, offering you a place on their ship, offering you a place in the leadership, etc., then taking it away and acting extremely disappointed about some of your thought processes and suggesting you do things I won&#39;t mention here . . . they&#39;re just a bunch of jokesters who play you like a video game via suggestion, incentive and disincentive. But THEN there are the Programmers, who manifest as silent, probing recorders of your soul. They&#39;re like the tweezers and pipettes of some vast intelligence somewhere in another dimension, and they just record things of interest. One stuck his consciousness into me and I cut it off at the elbow since it wasn&#39;t welcome. Suddenly, the jokesters started yelling at me, nay, SCREAMING at me that I fought a Programmer and that he was their friend and they were shocked. They kept emphasizing that Programmers are a TOTALLY different species that doesn&#39;t understand hostility and that I actually BROKE this particular one. I felt great shame until later when the jokester playing my friend told me that I had done the right thing and that I was so well programmed. He said my soul would go into the library of heroes. Then I listened to the one thing I couldn&#39;t contradict and checked myself into a hospital. Within ten minutes of taking a Zyprexa, it was 90% quieter in my head. Most incredible adventure of my life.</p>

We are simultaneously evaluating your conditions... how peaceful you are, how peaceful you are not, how you treat your planet, how and why you treat others of your species and etc. We have been visiting your planet for a few, what you call, thousands of years as we were the first visitors to discover it.  Within the last, what you call, century, we have visited much more often as our goal has switched from one of simple observation to a much more defined observation of your capabilities. This is due in large part to your sudden increase in technology with emphasis on your ability to release energy in such an explosive manner. </p>

<p>There has been talk amongst my people of protection from those that would wish to you harm. There has been no communication as to whether you are worth saving or not. This does not mean that you need saving, you are very capable. But a time may come when you are seized upon and not ready for it.</p>
