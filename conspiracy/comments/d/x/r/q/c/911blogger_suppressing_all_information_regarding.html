        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>Barrie Zwicker is an award-winning journalist, lecturer, author and documentary producer. He was astute enough to question the official 9/11 story from day one, as it was happening. He produced one of the first 9/11 Truth documentaries, “The Great Conspiracy”, in 2003. His most recent book, Towers of Deception, explores the media’s role in covering up the truth about 9/11. Based in Toronto, Canada, Zwicker is an expert on the subject of infiltration of social movements. When Zwicker speaks, people listen.</em></p>

<p>The full post of the article can be found <a href="http://pilotsfor911truth.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=20721">HERE</a> or you can view the entire <a href="http://www.rockcreekfreepress.com/CreekV4No11-Web.pdf">PDF Newspaper</a> there.  The article is on the last page of the PDF.</p>

<p>In short, CIT&#39;s work has shown for itself that a plane could not have impacted the Pentagon as the &quot;official theory&quot; states.  No wreckage, pristine lawn, impossible damage path leading to the building and the damage to the building itself.  The confiscation of 86 video tapes surrounding the area that would prove such an impact happened have never been released.</p>

<p>To top it all off, 17 witnesses all show through their combined and consistent testimony that the plane was no where in a position to hit the building in the fashion described by your Gov&#39;t.  </p>

<p>If that article peaks your interest enough, please watch the full presentation produced by CIT on their site for free, <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/nsa.html">HERE</a>.  17 witnesses, three of which are Pentagon Police officers, all prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the plane could not have hit the building.  </p>

<p>Instead, the newly &quot;renovated&quot; facade of the Pentagon, was blown up and the plane flew over the building and away.  A sleight of hand maneuver that fooled everyone into believing that an impact had occurred.  Though those witnesses were fooled, their combined consistently corroborated testimony proves that false.</p>

<p>Please watch the full video and keep yourself informed.  Don&#39;t let sites like 911Blogger tell you what is important and what is not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the pilots for 9/11 truth post, they detail how 911Blogger posted Barrie Zwicker&#39;s endorsement for CIT&#39;s work at the Pentagon for about 30 minutes before taking it down.  </p>

<p>Then this:
<em>However, just ten days later, 911blogger published a 3100 word article
from an anonymous poster, titled “CIT is useless.” The amateurish writing and ad hominem attacks are evident from
the very first paragraph: “Some time ago I wrote an article
about not wasting time on CIT. Most of their followers are impossible to convince and consequently the endless debates with them are entirely fruitless, resulting in nothing more than distraction.</em></p>

<p>The moderators for 911blogger have also been found to ban people outright for posting articles related to CIT and doing their very best to censor any information that may be related to it.</p>

<p>I hate this TL;DR crap but...for those who have a short attention span......911Blogger is the embodiment of what Cass Sunstein wrote in his paper calling for Conspiracy Theories to be made <strong>ILLEGAL</strong>.  He also calls for conspiracy groups to be infiltrated and have mis-information and dis-information disseminated through them in order to discredit and disrupt.  </p>

<p>Why go to such lengths to muddy the waters and dissuade people from looking into 9/11 Conspiracies if they are all outright false??  If we&#39;re all dealing with fiction and bullshit, why would they need to make thinking about Conspiracy theories illegal?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a threat to them.  It means we have the information to crack this wide open.  They need to discredit in order to buy themselves time.  They must know it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said.  Two salient points...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>infiltrated and have mis-information and dis-information disseminated through them in order to discredit and disrupt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has been one of my main areas of research for the past year or so, as I knew in building new systems for information propagation I, and the systems, would be targets for disruption.  It&#39;s more subtle that many truthers/activists can comprehend, without understanding the conspiring parties.  W/o lecturing on philosophy, in short they will begin as friends, agreeing with your goals, but <em>it is impossible</em> to disrupt by agreement, and at some point the cracks <em>must</em> show.  Over time one can watch them feel out your psychology and those of other members, looking for ways to drive wedges and sow distrust.  They will offer to &quot;manage&quot; critical tasks so they can &quot;accidentally&quot; fail at critical times.  Especially in the American libertarian school, they will try to claim that you are &quot;censoring&quot; them if you don&#39;t embrace the UFO/alien/joos/jesuit/whatever theories.  And all the while they will try to hint to you that the other side is more powerful, better financed, and simply too advanced to fail.  But never forget that they are <em>scared</em>, and if so they must <em>doubt</em> their position, and they very much do.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to buy themselves time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the point.  If you&#39;ve really done your homework, it is easy to see two things.  First, their primary tactic is acquisition of technology and then hiding it from everyone else.  The &quot;scientific dictatorship&quot; doesn&#39;t work if your target underclass has the same science you do.  Most would be quite amazed what technologies they&#39;ve acquired.  Second, they are socio/psychopaths.  They <em>hate</em> - it&#39;s basically the only thing they feel anymore, and they believe that they will feel better if only they go through with the &quot;big plan&quot;, which is basically a two-tiered society of technological masters over ignorant slaves.  This, they believe, will make everything they&#39;re doing justified, and because what they have done already is wholly immoral, they can conceive no path other than going forward, deeper into the darkness, under the false theory that on the other side is a glorious and enlightened New Order, etc.</p>

<p>But, it&#39;s not here yet.  And they&#39;re not sure they&#39;ll get it.  So they are scared, and are trying to &quot;buy time&quot;, as you said.  One could argue that it&#39;ll never arrive, that they&#39;re just insane, and thus the buying of time is really just putting off the inevitable reckoning that they are due, but studiously ignore.</p>

<p>One last thing.  I&#39;ve rigorously tested this and it is undeniable, the symbolism is available all around you, and the technology is simple electromagnetics.  The communications vector that makes the secrecy possible is machine enhanced telepathy, and in practice it looks a bit <a href="http://eclipse.astronomie.info/1999-08-11/Bernd/eclipse-5exposures.jpg">like this</a>.  That is the &quot;black sun&quot;, for which the swastika is one of many symbols.  </p>

<p>And no, I am not kidding.</p>

<p>Electromagnetics</p>

<p>It is has survived through the millenia because it is basically impossible to prove w/o either personal experience or physics.  The thread would be not only wasted but downvoted, I am sorry to say.  But it&#39;s quite real - if you have the experience and know the physics it is not at all magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure there were a lot of people who saw the plane.  No question.  Beyond that, these people were not always in any position to actually see the impact spot.  </p>

<p>It is hard to imagine, but if you watch CIT&#39;s video and their supporting video, you will get an idea of the topography of the area.  It is very misleading, and its not just exact straight lines of view to the side of the Pentagon.  A lot of the views are obscured by trees as you come up VA27.  Anyone else who was closer to the Pentagon and in a position to see it were like many of the witnesses.  They ran scared for their lives in the other direction.  Not knowing where the plane was heading or if it would come down on top of them or what.....they just turned the other way and ran.  </p>

<p>William Lagasse jumped into his cruiser, Sean Boger who was in the heli-port control tower DUCKED!  The others weren&#39;t specific about what they did but its clear that they were all fooled into thinking it impacted the building.  </p>

<p>Again, it cannot be possible.  The north side makes it impossible to hit the light poles and the generator and therefor that angle of the damage path through the building.</p>

<p>Again keep in mind that that they had the FDR for years before producing a &quot;video&quot; showing what the plane did and how it &quot;crashed&quot;.  They also had all the evidence showing DNA and whatever else to prove their story.  The accused (Gov&#39;t) had access to all the evidence that supposedly shows it to be innocent.  Its&#39; like trying to dig up evidence against the mob and the mob is the only ones with access to the evidence.  It just doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Also, and besides the testimony of all these people, the fact that they could simply release ALL the videos that surely would show the plane impacting the building are locked up somewhere and will not be released.  How much sense does that make?  That solid evidence shown 86 times would prove their claim way beyond a reasonable doubt, but yet they hold onto it??</p>

<p>That is beyond ridiculous.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was and is no real evidence at all for an such missile theory.  It was or has just turned out to be more of what they want, Dis-information.  Again, they had just finished a renovation of that section of the Pentagon against &quot;bomb blasts&quot;.  That is the key bit of info showing they could have easily rigged the place to blow.  That is the only likely answer.  They outright blew the place up and the plane flew through the smoke in order to cover it as it flew away.</p>

<p>People would be fixated on the fire/smoke and the building.  Its not like the plane just pulled up and was in the sky.  Consider how it would look to people who are in the area, and already know and expect planes to be taking off from Reagan/Washington National Airport, which is right next door to the Pentagon!  They have planes taking off and landing every 4-5 minutes all day long.  They are so common, people likely just ignore them.  So the plane flew off level enough to get out of view before pulling up and going where ever it went.</p>

<p>I am not of the same opinion that all of this simply leads to an &quot;expanding conspiracy&quot;.  As in, more and more people would have to be in on it in order for this to all happen.</p>

<p>There are levels within the Gov&#39;t and especially the military that keep information on that all too well known &quot;need to know&quot; level.  How about this short video as a good example of how things can be kept close to small groups of people in order to maintain a flow of BS information to achieve the desired results.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nbak9KOINgo">Watch</a> this video regarding Dr. Zelikow and his role with the 9/11 Omission report.</p>

<p>It is not impossible because honestly, we are living it right now.  It happened.  Just as you say, there is no evidence showing that plane crashed, yet they were able to control the flow of information and push the theory that the plane crashed and all these innocent passengers died etc. etc. but....it just can&#39;t be that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they were grounded, but that doesn&#39;t have to include this plane.  Cheney was in control of the PEOC at the time as told by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDfdOwt2v3Y">Norman Mineta</a>.  I cannot account for everything, I don&#39;t have all the answers here.  These things are just the accumulation of all the data that fits and is relevant.  </p>

<p>The plane that we&#39;re talking about wasn&#39;t likely the same plane with all the passengers.  Hani Hanjour was an incompetent pilot.  He could not have pulled this maneuver, nor could he have flown a Cessna.  The plane was also described as white, all white by many of the observers of the plane.  So, I believe that it was something else, maybe a remote plane.  It&#39;s a guess, but either way it did a maneuver that few people could do.  </p>

<p>I also want to post this pic I found whilst doing my searching.  <a href="http://imgur.com/a0I2x">HERE</a> which was posted by someone who MAY have seen the event.  I honestly cannot be sure if this is all true or not, but it seems unlikely that it could be made up, especially when it damages the OT.  The average person is not going to make this up regarding this event.</p>

<p>Either way, take it for what its worth, with a grain of salt as usual but I think it shows that someone saw what happened.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to absolutely crush the Official Theory, then watch <a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/videos-htpio.html">Keith Wheelhouse</a>.  The sole person who pushed the story of the &quot;second plane&quot; shadowing the 757 as it flew into the Pentagon.  Which is total absolute bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you watch the Mineta testimony, you&#39;ll see that Cheney ignored the fact that the flyover plane was coming in on radar at 50 miles out all the way into its &quot;destination&quot;.  If he was in control, and let the plane get that far, what makes you think there would be any problem with letting it fly away after the fact?</p>

<p>As for DNA and the whole bit after the event, who knows how it happened.  I don&#39;t know how it happened, and I cannot and will not speculate.  All I can say is that the evidence points to this whole thing being bullshit.  It couldn&#39;t have ended with a crash soooo......the DNA and all evidence produced after is suspect as well.  However they did it, its all horseshit.  However they &quot;got rid&quot; of the passengers, however they got rid of the plane.....you know it had to be the worst case scenario.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Releasing this sort of evidence for public analysis would certainly be macabre. It might also be an invasion of the privacy of the victims. I am not aware whether there is any precedent for releasing this type of evidence. </p>

<p>Still, if we have little more than an announcement that this work was done, there is room for doubt that it really happened. I basically agree with poster Craig Ranke CIT in the discussion from your second link.
