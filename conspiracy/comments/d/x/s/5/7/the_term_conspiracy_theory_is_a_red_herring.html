       There are two competeing theories regarding "conspiracy theories"; the first being everything we are told by the government and media is the truth and that all "conspiracy theories" are wrong, the second being that maybe not everything we are told is the truth.  The people that believe the first theory say it's up to us "conspiracy theorists" to prove conspiracy theories correct.  What about the proof of their theory?  Why do the anti-conspiracy kooks think they don't have to prove anything?  Shouldn't they have to prove that everything we are told is the truth?

       People are naturally skeptical of a minority position - it's lazy and it's human nature (herd mentality - it most likely helped us from an evolutionary standpoint).  So if you are in a minority position you are subject to this uphill battle.  The elite understand and exploit this by controlling the flow of information; and yes you should question everything.

       Where's the evidence that our position is a minority?  Some views here are a minority, but I think the majority are starting to realize that things aren't the way they've been told.  The realization of how badly we are lied to should help create more skeptical people.  If we focus on what we've been lied to about instead of reptilians and shit we can start making a serious positive change to the collective human consciousness.

       Well for one, most developed nations are under the thumb of international bankers, government doesn't create money, private bankers do.  This is probably the most important issue across the board, all else is a distraction.  Watch this if you have some free time:

       Are you saying that since things aren't perfect yet there's no change going on?  Changes like this don't happen over night.  People are organizing and unifying, once we have enough people the change is inevitable.  I live in a very rural area but within less than a year we are already getting close to a hundred repeat attendees (we started with 3 people!).  There are new people at every meeting, so the word is spreading.

       The federal reserve was enacted in 1913, most people aren't even aware of it being private.  If they are disintegrated within my lifetime, I fear it will only be replaced by the IMF or a similar private bank.  I like your attitude; I only wish I saw more of it.

       If you don't have meeting in your area take the initiative and start them yourself, someone has to.  Print flyers and put them up at the grocery or put them on people's car windshields.  If you already have community meetings just start to attend them and share your perspective.  If you're already attending community meetings try to keep up the good work.
      </p>
      <p>
       You got to be the change you wish to see in the world if you really want change.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of instruction on the awakening as one site to help you get a community meeting going.  Now it's all up to you.

       Well that's one way to 'change' things, but it wouldn't be my approach.  You can't force people to open their eyes, some of them are dormant and want to remain that way.  It opens yourself up to a lot of attack and you draw in a fair amount of negativity, in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe another way is to
       <em>
        be the change
       </em>
       you want to see (in other words work on yourself).  From there you can go on to help others individually (when they ask for it - big difference).  It's a long road, but it's my belief that the real battle is internally, not externally - it's just a big distraction to keep you from your real duty.

       Given that every white collar crime that's ever been committed has been a conspiracy, and given that our economic crisis, the unjustified war, and every major illegal political and terrorist act that's occurred in the last 100 years has been the result of conspiracy, I'd say it might be time to drop the term...

       The scales fell from my eyes when it occurred to me that a "covert operation" and a "conspiracy" are the same thing.
       <em>
        Of course
       </em>
       covert operations occur -- there are well funded intelligence agencies around the world whose job is to do just that.

       That is not how rational thought works.  Let's use "chemtrails" as an example.  The "official" story is that the trails we see following commercial airliners are caused by engine exhaust, and that they are not spraying chemicals.  That is perfectly supported by
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       evidence regarding this topic.  All of it.  It's backed up by all kinds of scientific evidence explaining how condensation occurs, meteorological studies of the air temperature and humidity at various altitudes, etc.  For someone to then stand up and say "they actually contain chemicals, and their release is to poison/affect us somehow", they need to show evidence.  Hard, conclusive evidence, showing how the contrails are definitely
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       ordinary contrails (by taking direct samples from contrails and finding suspicious chemicals that can't be present from simple engine exhaust, and which are not present in the surrounding air), and that commercial airliners do actually have fitted spraying equipment.  The burden of proof is on them, as they are the ones making further claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has nothing to do with "the elite controlling the flow of information", but by irrational behaviour and thought-patterns.  When people stop thinking critically, even for a second, they will end up believing in all sorts of rubbish that has absolutely no evidence in support of it.  Faked moon landings?  No actual evidence
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .  9/11 attack inside job?  No actual evidence
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       .  Sure, there are sporadic claims of inconsistencies in the official story, but every single time these claims are unfounded, previously explained, and even possible.  But even then, when faced with an unknown, it is not rational to leap to a further conclusion without actually finding direct evidence.  To establish a fact requires evidence, and not just a collection of voices screaming an opinion without any substantiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A "conspiracy theory", in modern parlance, is a theory that has gaps of explanation, and which is lacking evidence for great swathes of its claims.  If people just kept with evidence, and when none was forthcoming simply kept waiting for more evidence, conspiracy theories would be called "investigative journalism", and we might end up learning something verifiable.

       That evidence is already out there.  The scientific fact of condensation is not up for debate - there are literally thousands of years of study on the subject.  As for 9/11, the official story stands up to scrutiny - the physics of the towers falling is relatively simple, just not well-known to people who haven't studied physics, maybe.  And the moon landings?  Again.  All the evidence points to it.  The rocket launch, the science behind it, the lack of evidence from Russia of the fakes, etc.  This evidence is all over the place.  It's not a secret.

       Well, there isn't any, beyond the claims of people like the oh so honorable George Bush in his 'we shall not tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories' speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       however, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence to the contrary, which in any other field, or any legal proceedings against a private citizen, would prove some degree of complicity on the part of the highest echelons of the Bush administration, far and beyond gross negligence/incompetence, beyond all reasonable doubt. There just isn't any argument here, if you've actually spent time using your own mind and your own intelligence studying this subject.

       Those facts have been demonstrated with a slew of evidence, from documentation (visas &amp; passports, flight school paperwork, ticket receipts) to CCTV footage.  That has been proven.  Now, for you to show something
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       than that, that somehow the government was complicit, you need to show your fucking evidence.  You can't just say "oh well where's your evidence?!?" when that evidence has been well established, and then balk at the idea that you have to have evidence for people to take you seriously.  You fail at critical thought.

       I agree that chemtrails and moon landing "conspiracy theories" are full of holes.  The official stories make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when it comes to 9/11, I have some concerns about it.  I'll admit, some of the things from the truthers can be explained with science.  The "squibs" on video that some point to as proof of explosives, seem to occur at windows several levels down from the collapsing floors.  I'm convinced that when the floors above were collapsing, the air is being forced down elevator shafts, staircases, vents, etc. and will follow the path of least resistance to the outside.  That's why it'll burst out windows, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are things that are not explained by the official story, however.  For one, people in the towers claim that they heard explosions before and after the planes hit.  Now I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt that floors collapsing after the impact may sound like explosives, but why would people be hearing these things before the planes hit?
      </p>
      <p>
       The official story says that the heat from the burning fires (from the jet fuel) was so intense that it weakened the steel to the point of it giving way.  That's certainly possible.  But there were people in the areas where the plane hit, above and below where the planes hit, waving for help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking a step back from technicalities, the political aspect troubles me too.  It was declassified that the joint chiefs of staff approved a plan to stage terror attacks on US soil to blame on an external threat in 1962.  That tells me that this type of operation is on the table.  You could also speculate that if something like Operation Northwoods is something that we are allowed to know, would it make sense that there are more sinister things that we aren't?  I try to stay away from speculation but that's something that deserves some consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also been reported that the Taliban was willing to hand Bin Laden over if we could provide sufficient proof of him being responsible for the attacks.  We never tried.  On top of that he's never been indicted for the attacks either.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have things like the Downing Street Memo which revealed how the Iraq intelligence was being fixed around a policy already in place.  We have real things that are public knowledge that show that the government is willing to lie to us to go to war.  We have conflicting evidence with 9/11.  Do you think that the same government that tortured its own people under MK-Ultra, lied to its people with the Downing Street Memos, had its CIA traffic cocaine into LA to raise money for the contras... couldn't possibly crash 4 planes and knock down 2 buildings in its own country?

      <p>
       If this were the case (that the windows were bursting out due to compressed air through air ducts/elevator, etc.), the windows would have all burst out simultaneously, rather than in a floor-by-floor fashion immediately preceeding that floor's collapse/demolition.

       No.  That's not how physics works.  The weakest window would have blown, reducing the pressure, and stopping other windows from breaking.  As pressure builds up when the floors collapse, and windows explode, that will result exactly what we saw - waves of broken windows before the collapse.  That is a far more likely explanation that anything else, as it doesn't require anything external, and is simply a well-understood physical interaction.

       So, basically, what you're saying, then is... there's no way to distinquish natural pressure releases from squibs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Natural pressure releases occur floor-by-floor, and so do squibs. So this is a moot issue and a red herring. Okay. Science comes to my rescue. I didn't want to have this conversation anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit (~1): Why didn't the core remain standing? Why was there just a pit of dust? I ask this because I really love hearing the lame explanations (I've heard about 50 different ones, none of which fit reality).

       Of course there is a way to distinguish between glass being broken by air pressure and frame contortion, and an explosive.  They are very different.  Any explosive that would be put in the towers that would have enough pressure to cause a window to shatter would cause more than one window to shatter, as explosives work through generating massive pressure waves in milliseconds (if that), and not just large pressure differentials building up over nearly a second.  There would also be a large flash.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, guess what!  As pressure building up as the floors collapsed would be expected, and squibs not, there needs to be evidence given as to why the normal, mundane explanation of pressure differentials is invalid.  That's how evidence works.  If there are two explanations, one being expected and one not ("he died because he lost control of his car on the road in the rain" and "he died because the Cubans used an undetectable mind-control agent on him and spoke to him through his radio, causing him to swerve into a tree", for example), the most simplest explanation is the one that has to be assumed to be correct in the absence of evidence.  This is a corner-stone of rational thought.  It's crap like your attitude that caused religion to be the millennia-old explanation of the universe - the first believers had two explanations: "the universe came to be by its initial state and the laws of physics, both of which we have no idea about" or "Some super-being did it", instead of opting for the logically-required position of "I don't know", they leapt to the super-being explanation.  That's what you're doing now.  You are substituting knowledge of phenomena with a belief of their cause, a grave logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact you are anticipating a "lame explanation" belies your lack of objectivity.  You have clearly forgone acceptance of any mundane explanation.  Thanks for letting me know that's the level you operate at.  Your school really failed you.  But anyway.  On with the fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the core remain standing?  Because it was attached to a building 110-storeys high, that some assholes flew jet liners in to, causing a
       <em>
        highly
       </em>
       -ventilated fire (you do know how fast the wind blows that high, right?), fuelled by kerosene and office furnishings &amp; supplies, that burned for nearly an hour, and that steel is not some magic indestructible substance?  There was no need to use explosives to bring the towers down.  Basic physics has explained this already, but apparently you are either too lazy to study, or to intellectually dishonest to study rationally.  Your choice, bub.  You can't pretend to be an objective investigator, and then act like science is some esoteric knowledge out of your reach.  A basic science education will explain all you need to know.

       Whole lot of ad hominems in there and no valid physics. Fuel was consumed in the initial explosion (massive fireball). As the towers collapsed, mountains of unburnt paper came fluttering down. Why wasn't the paper even singed? You're saying fires on the 50+th floors melted the core clear to the basement?
      </p>

       Bub indeed. I figured you'd resort to mockery, because that's all that's left when there isn't any physics. How can you live with yourself?

       Oh for fuck's sake.  Not all the fuel would have been ejected, and burned, as fuel will not burn when mixed incorrectly with air.  That's some basic physics for you.  Some unburned paper?  Was all of the towers on fire?  No, so obviously some paper could have escaped unburned.  There's some more basic physics for you.  The fires on the 50th floor would have turned the cores plastic (as that's what happens to very hot steel), which would have then caused the floors above to fall down (as the steel was plastic, and incapable of supporting their weight), still guided by the core (as it was still there, just weakened at one point but still attached to all the floors), and pancake the rest of the floors below.  Again, more fucking basic physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy theorists have to explain, using real physics (and not just "Nuh-uh!  I saw a youtube video that said it couldn't happen!"), how the most basic, expected outcome (the official story) does not stand up to scrutiny, and
       <strong>
        then
       </strong>
       find the evidence that shows what really happens.  And, you have to submit that evidence to the scientific community to make sure it's all correct, and then you'd have a case.  As it is all we have is a bunch of muppets running around making up facts and reasons to suit their delusional paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I resort to mockery to try to highlight how fucking retarded believing in vast webs of conspiracy
       <strong>
        when there is no evidence pointing to it
       </strong>
       .  That's something all of society should engage in, as substituting rational thought with paranoia is only going to end badly.  I don't know why you think it's OK to encourage delusional behaviour.  It's sad.

       No, that is not true.  It is, though, a handy excuse for you to protect your cognitive dissonance which you seem to love so much.  You completely ignored my point, and started banging on about some pet theory you have.  Your position is criminally stupid.  Seriously.  Go to a debate team and try to debate your point.  See how many times they bring up the logical fallacies you are basing your entire argument, and belief system, on.  It will be heart-breaking for you to have your every logical short-coming underlined and illustrated for everyone to see.  Of course, you won't, as you know deep down that this is the case, but your desire to believe trumps your desire to be correct, which is the mother of all logical fallacies.  You'd never make it through the door without being laughed to pieces, and rightfully so.  Human kind has only come as far as we have because intelligent people use intelligent methods of discerning the truth.  As soon as intelligent people start using baloney methods of discerning the truth, the only truth being discerned is their flagrant disregard for their intelligence.  That is a tragedy of massive proportions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's pointless arguing with you, as the very mechanism you use for determining reality is broken.  "Critical thought" is the name given to the logical process of determining fact from fiction, and you seem to be totally incapable of following it.  The issue here is not whether 9/11 was an inside job or whether aliens blew up the WTC for its creamy filling, but
       <strong>
        your lack of logical ability
       </strong>
       .  Until that is fixed, trying to get you to figure out what's real and what isn't will never work.  I used to be like you.  I used to believe in many conspiracy theories.  Then I realised that there simply isn't any evidence, and that it's embarrassing when people read the nonsense one has to intrinsically believe before they can embrace conspiracy theories.  From the outside, conspiracy theorists look like fucking stupid little kids, arguing about which Pokemon is the best, forgetting that they're not real.  It's still very sad.

       Why did they hear explosions before the planes hit?  Well, even if they did, that's not evidence in itself.  Eye-witness evidence is barely evidence at all, and considering the people claiming to have heard pre-collision explosions weren't outside to see the planes actually hit, then their credibility is clearly undermined.
      </p>
      <p>
       The steel was weakened at the point of the main fires.  The steel would be fine floors above and below, which were not affected by the fire.  It just takes some of the steel to weaken for the whole building to fall, as steel that is strong enough to hold a building up probably isn't strong enough to catch the same building when it's falling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of prior planning of false-flag operations does not instantly mean that 9/11 should be considered one, unless
       <em>
        there is evidence to that point
       </em>
       .  That is how evidence works - without it no one can act on anything.  Speculation is worthless when it comes to convincing rational people, and for good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the Taliban was willing to hand over Bin Laden, but to an international criminal court, and only when the US handed over a bunch of evidence they simply didn't yet have their hands on.  That was deemed unacceptable, and so they passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       By assuming Iraq has anything to do with 9/11 you have left the realms of reasoned thinking.  You must first find the evidence pointing to collusion, and then try to figure out why, not the other way round.

       I agree that eyewitness accounts shouldn't be the end-all be-all of evidence, but when a lot of people at the same place are describing the same thing, it's worth something, at least.  That's why the 9/11 Commission asked mny of the people who were there to testify to what they witnessed.

       Ok assuming that  there are extremely hot fires that we can't see, we have symmetrical collapse that follows asymmetrical damage.  It looks to me like the planes would sever alot of the support columns on 1 side, and the jet fuel was propelled around the inside of the building.  Weakened steel should put up more resistance than no steel, so I'd think that it should have fell to the side with the least resistance.  We have a ton of things that happen on 9/11 that while they aren't a smoking gun on their own, when you start to add things up it starts to look pretty shady.

       It doesn't prove anything about 9/11, you are correct... but it gives some historical context.  My first reaction when I started hearing these alternative theories is... "my government wouldn't do that to us.  That's crazy."  They're here to protect us, right? Then when I saw the declassified plans from the past, with the approval of the joint chiefs, to stage attacks on our own citizens to justify war, mind = blown.

       We still don't have sufficient evidence, not enough to indict him, anyway.  On the
       <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/wanted/topten/usama-bin-laden">
        FBI website
       </a>
       , he hasn't been indicted for the 9/11 attacks.  That's where a prosecutor takes the evidence and presents it to a grand jury.  Given how our country fears Muslims so much, I imagine it wouldn't take a whole lot of evidence.

       I never said Iraq had anything to do with 9/11 (other than perhaps the fear from 9/11 being exploited).  I mentioned the Downing Street memos to give some historical context, like I did with Operation Northwoods.  These are both public examples of the federal government being willing to lie itself into war.  Before this, I was never aware that the US would deliberately mislead its citizens and the world to justify a war.  I thought it was treated as a last resort.  The fact that lying our way into war was on the table in the 50s, went active in 1964 with the Gulf of Tonkin, and again in 2002 with the Iraq war... tells me that it's not as far-fetched as I originally thought, and happens more often than I originally thought.
