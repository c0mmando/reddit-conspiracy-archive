       It's just me here reminding you that all money is lent from PRIVATE CORPORATIONS, be it FED, IMF, ECB.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is a banking institution granted the exclusive privilege to lend a government its currency." - Wikipedia
      </p>
      <p>
       Q: So how is this regulated? A: IT ISN'T.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q: Is the value of the money bound by anything? A: NO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Q: So they just print paper and lend it? A: YES
      </p>
      <p>
       And heres the funny part... They lend it with INTEREST. So if nation wants money it has to be borrowed. But where comes the money to pay the DEBT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think how much money has influence in this world. The power to print money would be like the ultimate power. Well these people have it. Think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep arguing about... you know, Obamacare and... reptilians. Or whateverthefuck. Just keep in mind who has the power to print money. And why... WHY THE FUCK we accept it?

       I called a lawyer to see if my bank put up a lawful form of consideration for my mortgage. He told me yes. I asked how do banks make something of value from nothing? Banks make money from nothing and this is just what banks do. That banks
 have been doing this for years. Also mentioned that i needed to take a class on banking. Do i know more than lawyers?

       When money is printed, it is distributed out into the economy by way of buying back previously issued treasuries. They don't just ship sacks of money to various banks. What this does, in effect, is that because grandpa is having his treasury bought back by the government, he'll now have $150, and will take this $150 to the bank and deposit it. From there, the banks use this money to further lend out to people, like businesses or individuals.

       They actually are allowed to lend up to 10 times that which they possess. It's called fractional reserve banking or something (I forgot the actual name). Each subsequent borrower/lender is allowed to do likewise (if they're chartered and such), basically creating a huge bubble of imaginary cash... none of which is backed by anything other than the promise of the US Government to continue to tax its population in order to repay the interest on the original debt to the Federal Reserve (a privately held corporation). And, of course, the wealthy always push for legislation to defer this tax burden onto the poor, whom they believe are too stupid to know better, but who are in reality too powerless to fight against it.

       Yes, you got that right about fractional reserve banking. It's basically the proportion a bank is allowed to lend out without actually having that amount of physical cash on hand for people to withdraw. Each country/state has its own laws and regulations pertaining to this. Having the requirement too high restrains the economy and stifles growth, while having it too loose increases the risk of bank runs and distrust within the financial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bubble you're talking about, I think, would be the M1, or "imaginary wealth," as opposed to M0, or actual wealth within a given economy. Although M1 sounds scary since it is imaginary wealth, it is, in general, a very good system that keeps the economy growing. That's why every single modern economy functions in this way, because it is illogical to do otherwise. Essentially, it puts money into the economy that would otherwise just be sitting there and doing nothing. With fractional reserve banking, money is better spread around and invested into new businesses and attractive projects, etc., that will benefit the economy and society as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Federal Reserve, as far as I know, is not a privately held corporation. It's not entirely private, and it's not entirely public either. I've heard it referred to as a "quasi-public/private" entity; it is accountable to congress, but not necessarily run by the government. This is a good thing, because it allows the Fed to act in the interest of the private sector, but keeps it accountable to the country's democracy and government. It's an inbuilt system of checks and balances, I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for taxation, that's definitely the way things are backed. When treasury securities are issued, what backs them is not some asset, like a home, for example, but faith in the US government to be able to tax its citizens. As for taxation being deferred onto the lower classes, I do not believe the "rich" necessarily want the taxes to be moved the lower classes. The "rich" are generally not as evil as they're made out to be; they're regular people who tend to be very hard working, very valuable to society, and intelligent. Remember, when one says "the rich," you're talking about the nation's doctors and greatest innovators, too—not just that small group of soulless Wall Street suits. Either way, they [the rich] generally want taxes to be cut overall; that is, across the board. There is no logical reason to push all the taxes onto the lower classes, as the wealthier classes (often small business owners, employers, stockholders, or anyone who understands the importance of spending) are the ones who NEED the vast majority of the population (the middle and lower classes) to spend. If you tax them hard, then they will have less expendable income, so they would really only be hurting themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to what you said, unfortunately, the reality is that
       <em>
        yes
       </em>
       , most of the poor are
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       too stupid to know better. People have this absurd impression that the working class is so cute, cuddly and hardworking, and that their lower income stems from some mystical force of evil and oppression. Most of them are the kids you see during high school and laugh at, and wonder to yourself, "Where in the world are they going to be in 10 years?" Most of them neglect their education, get into drugs and are borderline useless; they contribute very little to human kind, aside from paying their measly taxes (the entire bottom 50% of the USA only pays ~2.9% of all the nation's income taxes). The fact that they are even able to live their lives relatively comfortably as lower tier blue collar workers (by the way, there is nothing inherently wrong with blue collar, either; I am actually oddly fascinated by it and value the work very much [Good Will Hunting has an amazing quotation on this]) should be respected; the fact that someone can earn a living without any education and simply through their unskilled manual labor needs should be recognized for what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, vis-a-vis "powerlessness," the point of a democracy is to empower the lower classes / masses. In the United States, at least, where I do not currently reside, the government is thankfully a republic: Persons are actually elected, by the people, to run the country. And because
       <em>
        each
       </em>
       citizen has the right to
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       vote, rich or poor, it allows the poor to have their say in the government (corruption is a completely different topic).
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, it's not like the lower classes are being utterly forced to be where they are. (Some of them simply make the free choice to not strive for a Lamborghini, etc., and that's a perfectly respectable life choice.) Capitalism and Classical Liberalism are systems specifically designed to maximize individual liberty and
       <em>
        socioeconomic
       </em>
       mobility. Because the government is, in theory, supposed to stay out of interfering with the economy and how people voluntarily interact and deal with each other, there is no clearly defined class structure enforced by the government (as it is in oligarchies, old monarchies and aristocracies, etc.). In essence, people are not coerced by the government to work a certain job (one that would be most beneficial to the interests of the state, for example), or to work somewhere based on the government's need. This way, people are free to pursue their own individual interests to best benefit their friends and families.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not baloney or some unrealistic ideal: I specifically know that the American Dream and social mobility do exist. The ignorant people who tend to deny it are generally average white Americans who, instead of working hard, expect everything to be handed to them. Instead of taking responsibility for their actions, they blame it on the "system" or "society." Tell that to that hard working Korean family you see in Southern California, who are already disadvantaged, yet have a daughter who excels in school and is winning scholarship after scholarship. Tell that to my father, a boat-person and exile of Communist Vietnam, who came to North America with absolutely no connections, language skills or money. And, had to deal with intense racial discrimination in the process. Because of the social mobility afforded to him and out of his own diligence, he went from absolutely nothing (and I seriously mean this; he's a war refugee and came from one of the poorest provinces of Vietnam), to a multimillionaire with a Ph.D. That's why, unless you have a physical or mental disability, I do not buy the whole "I can't go anywhere! The evil rich people and corporations oppress me" bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone raised under a strict, East Asian culture, I am simply amazed at the West and their culture of entitlement and irresponsibility. Honestly, take responsibility for your life, and stop blaming other things for your situation. I hear it from my friends, I hear it in school, and sometimes, I even hear it from me. I didn't get my 93% average or 4.0 GPA, I start deferring blame. Sure, sometimes it's truly unfair, but more often than not, I simply am not working hard or smart enough. Stop thinking that you have a right to a free lunch or other people's money. You don't.

       Well, After you said
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The "rich" are [...] regular people who tend to be harder working or intelligent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the reality is that yes, most of the poor are actually too stupid to know better.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You sorta lost my interest. I'm well below the national poverty level, I have two college degrees, and I qualified for Mensa. And this just, frankly, pissed me off to read.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I do not buy the whole "I can't go anywhere! The evil rich people and corporations oppress me" bullshit.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, my response to you in all of this is pretty basic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kudos to your multimillionaire father.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the rest of your "blame the victim" perspective of the working class and the poor is utter tripe and causes me to doubt that you learned anything about Confucianism. Maybe someday you'll have to actually fight YOUR way up from the bottom, like your dad did FOR YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       For someone who knows all that about the world of high finance, you seem to know very little about the reality of life. Not everyone wants to become a multimillionaire. This is the most sickening part of what I read in your comment - the implication that money is a sign of success (your whole essay reeked of that .. as being what you, who claim to be Confucian, seem to believe). This... this smug arrogance...
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the oppression. You are one of them. You beat down the lower financial classes by telling them they should be richer... and that they could be richer if they only worked harder ... and that if that doesn't work they must simply be too stupid ... and that money is the only true measure of a man's worth/success/happiness/well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming you're an average redditor age, your father probably came here in the late '50's or early 60's and found himself right at the beginning of one of the USA's greatest eras of prosperity (it ended after the last big oil boom of the mid 70's, by the way, and has gone steadily downhill, apart from a brief period of tech-boom in the early 90's, ever since).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been 5+ years since I had my once-in-a-lifetime encounter with "the man" and it's an experience I'll never forget. There is
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       about American society (as it currently stands) which appeals to me. There's nothing in it that I want to aspire toward. Everything has been raped, pillaged, and brought to submission to the global elite ruling class. Perhaps if you hang around here long enough, you'll see the truth about how stupid one can become by believing that money means anything.

      <p>
       I am precluded from your accusations that said I claimed money to be the measurement of happiness and success, given this is what I wrote in my initial comment to you:
       <em>
        "Some of them simply make the free choice to not strive for a Lamborghini, etc., and that's a perfectly respectable life choice."
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        "... people are free to pursue their own individual interests to best benefit their friends and families."
       </em>
       I clearly stated that not striving for riches or "Lamborghinis" is a perfectly respectable life choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       With regard to me not knowing about reality, barely knowing my parents because their lives are so entrenched in work and not having any recognizable childhood are
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       two things that have already proven to me—since an extremely early age—that money does
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       buy happiness. My family has a fiery chasm running through it because of our businesses. I know; don't suppose I'm naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I of course understand that the economy is in bad shape right now (what I was saying earlier mainly applied to a non-recessed/depressed economy), and that many people at this very instant in time are not where they should/could be because of the inordinate economic situation. It goes without saying that there will always be special cases, and people under special circumstances which disallow them from ascending above the national poverty line (especially today with unemployment, even for formerly high salaried, highly educated folks, in the USA at ~10%). Regardless, if it is true that you're as exceptional as you claim to be—which I am not refuting or doubting—then you should remember that you're on better footing than most people, and now is prime time to take the initiative to improve your situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for you being significantly lower than the poverty line, I am surprised that you have an internet connection and the time to post on Reddit. I mean, most people who are significantly below the poverty line are out on the streets and eating from soup kitchens. Are you like that? Or do you live in a suburban home? What type of job do you have, if you earn so much below the poverty line? Are you fully employed at minimum wage, for example? I am curious to know. If your current situation is really bothering you to the extent that you're all for the "oppressed working class" under people like me with "smug arrogance" (an unsubstantiated characterization, might I add), then what are you doing online composing long responses? I suggest you do some extra work on the side right now, or try to find an overnight job. This is called taking responsibility for your actions, or lack thereof. Absolutely
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       who is in such a dire, "well below the poverty line" situation, should be wasting their time typing to me. If what you say is all true, it simply goes to show that you're not doing all that you can and should be doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, as for what you said about working my way up from the bottom, I cannot help but have been born into the family I was. The reason why I put so much emphasis on my father's story is because it's close and intimate to me, so I can relate to it well. My dad specifically worked the way he worked for my mother, my siblings and me—the same way I would do everything in my power to feed my wife and children, and give them the smoothest life possible. That's simply my life goal—my pursuit—and to, by extension, denigrate my future wife and children for not being pro-Proletariat, simply because I worked extremely hard to provide for them, is nothing but unfair.

       I offer my gratitude for your clarifications and expansions on some of these matters which originally came through to me so offensively. I further acknowledge that the Korean culture has one of the most respectable and honorable work ethics (probably relevant to your father's success).
      </p>
      <p>
       That having been said, my economic/professional life is off the table for the present (meaning I do not wish to discuss that - let's just say: I work some... sometimes for monetary compensation, sometimes on a barter/exchange plan). Yes, I eat at soup kitchens. Yes, I get food from food banks. No, I do not partake in government aid of any sort. My life is complicated simplicity at present, which brings with it an ongoing stress of its own. I'm losing my teeth (thankfully I'm getting old and will die soon, so I don't actually need them anymore I guess).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I, personally, have never done so, I do know people at/near my economic status who get some of their food from dumpsters. I've even dined with them on occasion and consumed such victuals (inspecting the packages, of course, to ensure that it was uncontaminated - for example: sealed sleeves of crackers from a damaged box).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was, for a time (many years ago), much "higher up" in social/economic standings. Even mildly famous in a tiny niche of the internet gaming subculture for a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, now... I have a roof over my head (which leaks - the roof, that is; not my head) - a 40 year old mobile home, which I own, located in the slummiest part of town (verifiable - even the Landlord's Association has issues with my landlord), where I rent a lot for my trailer (me == trailer trash). And I have nine feline friends who love me, unconditionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my internet presence, I was given a 2 year subscription last fall as a holiday gift from my mother. My PC is a hand-me-down running a very old operating system and browser (crashes a LOT... especially on flash videos).

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't claim to be "exceptional" - unique perhaps, and likely eccentric in most peoples' eyes. As I mentioned (briefly), I had an encounter with "the man" which altered the course of my existence... as well as my perspective on life, politics, society, power, etc. I did an AMA about this several months ago under a different username, and it was very helpful to me to get this experience out... and discuss it... even with strangers on the net in an anonymous forum. It helped me on my path to being free from those circumstances (I'm not sure if I'm there yet, or if I ever will be for that matter, but I do believe it was a step in the right direction).
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting how this conversation about money (see the OP's headline) came around to this discussion of poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seek little more than truth and/or peace.

       You, sir, sound like a pit of doom.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, everyone who participates in the economic heirarchy of society is a worker/slave unit to those above them, except the one at the top who isn't. Currently, it appears that this one person is Evelyn Rothschild.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Evelyn is also a slave to his own circumstance. He will never know truth or peace. He is doomed to forever wallow in the sty of
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       own ignorance of these most precious of commodities.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are thousands... possibly a million or so... who do not participate in the financial/economic heirarchy, and who are capable of being enlightened... truly enlightened about what has meaning in life. Sure, they have jobs (or maybe they don't) and use money as a medium of exchange for goods and services (or maybe they don't); but, the one thing they do
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       do is: serve the money itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor Evelyn is doomed to be a servant to his own wealth until the day of his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Pun intended) I wouldn't want to be him for all the money in the world.

       Mr. Rothschild himself is still just a man. I'm sure he can appreciate the forward thinking men who step back, notice the game is rigged and proceed to stop taking their own participation as seriously. Men like George Carlin, Bill Hicks, Alan Watts and Robert Anton Wilson.

       This has nothing to do with... well, anything.  The fact of the matter is that you are pretending to be competent when you actually know very little.  You are turning personal anecdotes into broad, sweeping generalizations and drawing inaccurate conclusions.  That is the Dunning-Kruger Effect.  Your own incompetence is preventing you from seeing how incompetent you actually are.

       I agree with your post, you seem to have hit the nail on the head regarding the literal and societal value of intelligent exertion.

       You lost me with the point of democracy being to empower the lower classes (fair point when contrasted against other systems), which can be rebuked with the following trite aphorism: Democracy is a system in which 49% of the participants are not free.

       True, a pure democracy would mean that, theoretically, 49% of the population could not be "free." However, I should have been more explicit in saying that the United States is a republic that employs democratic institutions*.

       As for being a heir to a fortune, I am not entirely sure of that yet. I do not know what my family intends to do with the money when the generations change, so to speak. As of now, we donate thousands upon thousands to charity every single year, including gifting homes to the impoverished of Vietnam. Either way, my parents have raised me well in that they stress the importance of hard work. I still perform well in school, for example, because I do my work, not because we're paying anyone off. :)

       Plato's Republic being implemented, utopia for the elite, sophisticated slavery for the mob, in which every bit of their labor is stolen back from them by the high financiers who own the currency and banking system. Could be a conspiracy theory I guess, maybe we should just go to the G20 and ask them nicely to be better to us!
