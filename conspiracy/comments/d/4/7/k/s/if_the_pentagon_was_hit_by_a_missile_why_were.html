       I've got 50+ images of the pentagon from Sept 11, 2001.  This is probably before any intelligence agency got there with air plane parts or whatever.  Absolutely no pieces of plane parts in any of them.   Certainly no aircraft pieces at the impact site.  I'll see if I can post a few of them on imgur and edit them into this comment.

       I posted this in another portion of the thread but I will repeat it here if you'll indulge me.  I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       Dimitri Khalezov is the closest to hitting the truth about all this stuff.  He has a book out and a 3+ hour video interview on you tube.  The tl/dr version of his story (at least with regard to this hole in the pentagon) is that it was hit by a neutered (formerly nuclear-tipped) "Granite" type cruise missile which had been stolen from the Kursk (Russian submarine).  Anyhow these things are not made of aluminum or tin, they have tank-type armor and so what we're looking at is the hole left by one.  It's a message: we have 21 more of these with 150 megaton bombs on them and we can hit the Pentagon (anywhere) at will.  Pay us X amount in blackmail, etc.  If you look at countries that seem to have an inordinate amount of influence over the US and that we happen to support in pretty extreme ways (money, political influence, etc) this brings the short list to pretty much: Israel.  If you include stories of suspicious people (possibly Israeli) who were captured and then released on 9/11.  If you factor in that so many people are participating in this cover up... there sort of
       <em>
        has to be
       </em>
       a good reason for this spontaneous conspiracy.  If the situation is that the USA is being blackmailed by a foreign power with two dozen nuclear-tipped cruise missiles pointed at us... this is pretty much reason enough for any FBI agent, military leader or politician to join a spontaneous conspiracy in spite of its nonsensical aspects.

       With Cheney at the oversight of flying operations on 9/11, and the Neocons fully invested in the false flag event, your explanation can only work if there was a breach in the US government at the highest level by Israel.  It makes sense.  Put simply, US government officials bought into the Israeli planned event that would ensure US military deployment in the Middle East and the expansion of the 'Greater Israel.'  1. Afghanistan 2. Iraq (many reasons) 3. Pakistan 4. Iran.  The war on terror is a permanent war fought for Zionist (both Christian and Jewish) interest, and a lot of money will be made on the side.  If the US economy collapses at home, the oligarchs couldn't care less.

       This is plausible and basically my opinion on the matter, but only my/our speculations.  I would like to encourage others to watch Dimitri Khalezov's youtube interview videos.  The interview is grueling (could have been 1+ hours shorter) but he explains all of the facts of 911 much much better than any other theory I've seen.  To his credit he leaves political speculations out of it.  (Israel is my own speculation.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Khalezov also drops some other interesting "bombs" which check out.  For example, the 1983 Beruit Barracks (U.S. Marines) bombing in Lebanon he says was the work of a small portable nuclear device and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       a truck bomb.  Sounded like an odd claim to me so I did some searches of online news articles referring to the event.  I found that almost every story I found included the exact words "...largest non-nuclear explosion in history..." as though they were handed the text and told to write around it.  The oddest thing is that it was not even close to the largest non-nuclear explosion in history (there have been some BIG ammunition stockpiles go off in the US).  So the claim was false, found in almost every story, it's an odd angle to include in every story
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       since it isn't true.  It looks (to me) like someone really high up wanted to plant the idea
       <em>
        firmly
       </em>
       that this was NOT a nuclear attack.  Guess what happened the next day?  US invaded Grenada.  According to Khalezov this was to get the Beruit story out of the papers and off the TV.  If true it seems to have worked!  So anyhow Khalezov has interesting perspectives which he appears to have gained by being an independent thinker and somewhat outside of our smothering US internal media propaganda system.

       I believe the title of "largest non-nuclear explosion" would go to Chernobyl. Remember, it was technically a heat explosion, it just carried the nuclear material into the air.

       Chernobyl didn't really explode.  There is an obscure list somewhere with a coal mine fire on it and a ship that blew up in a Texas port.  Stuff like that.  Anyhow the weird thing IMO was the way these reports all included that identical phrase when it was clearly untrue.

       Wait, small and nuclear don't really go together.  In order to have a reaction, you need a critical mass; once you have a critical mass, the reaction is going to be very large.  There were survivors in the Beirut bombings.  That doesn't jive with a nuclear weapon.

       I don't really buy that somebody with only 21 warheads poses much of a threat to the US. Let's put this in perspective for a second: The US has about 10,500 nuclear warheads currently, and Russia has ~10,000. That's enough to cover every square inch of the earth's land mass many times over. If those crazies ever tried to fire nukes at the US, the entire middle east would be vaporized within the hour.

       However, you totally could be right.  Also, I really like this point you've brought up because I hadn't thought about it from that perspective.  Let's imaging that Israel did have these weapons.  Let's say they want to blackmail the US for money and for political favors.  We are on the brink of a nuclear exchange.  Can the US really nuke the middle east?  Imagine nuking Jerusalem: imagine how many Christians, Muslims and Jews will suddenly do anything to overthrow and destroy your government.  Maybe Israel feels they are effectively un-nukable.  Can you imagine a US President nuking the Holy Land (and losing the top 21 US cities) because they don't want to pay 30 B or 60 B per year in blackmail?

       Well of course, if they attack first they have forfeited any mercy on our part. I don't think people are gonna care what kinda holy land they are if they take out 21 of our cities. But who's to say they wouldn't violate the blackmail agreement anyways? Also, I believe it's already been established that Israel has nukes (ones they built themselves, not stolen from the Kursk)

       do you know what metals/alloys the engines for a modern-day passenger jet plane are made of?
      </p>
      <p>
       They will not disintegrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I ridiculed the post at the beginning, i am not going to obsess on technicalities. I am not a physicist, forensic investigator, nor do i pretend to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point that was laid out in the "loose change" video about plane crashes having debris (some kind, ANY kind of debris after crashes, two planes colliding, etc is something to think about.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a plane that is made of so many different metals/alloys, which these metals/alloys are made to withstand the rigors of fliying long distances (transcontinental/trasatlantic), metals/rivets/engines made to last years. All these items are made of extremely durable metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know what to say other than how about seat cushions that flew out at first impact?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can it be that if a passport from one of the hijackers (that crashed into the twin towers)  was found intact #wink# ,
      </p>
      <p>
       how can a frigging engine that is tons not be able to #partially# survive?, wings, rivets, seats, seat cushions,
      </p>
      <p>
       ...if not , then how about a passport? like the one that was found by the twin towers? anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention corpses, or bodies. Any type of crash there are always bodies, or body parts. In this there were none. Doesn't that just feel strange? That a building made a transcontinental airliner  completely vanish?

       Important:
      </p>
      <p>
       airplanes can't fly at full speed near to the ground, since the air is much, much denser at lower altitude than it is at 30.000 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       A passenger jet flying faster than 350 knots, will most likely disintegrate mid-air.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also important: since kinetic energy grows exponentially with speed, the speed difference is very important.

       It's amazing to me how difficult it is to get people to believe their own two eyes when it comes to 9/11.  There is NO evidence of any plane in the picture, none whatsoever, and yet people insist that since the officials say there was a plane, their own two eyes must be wrong.

       Hey dipshit. I believe my own two eyes that were there and saw the plane 50 yards in front of my car. Not only did I see it(impossible not to) but so did hundreds of others on the freeway coming into town. How you can be so fucking self righteous about something you did not experience tells me you have a very small penis and too much time on your hands. Get a job or something already.

       I've seen several dozen Pentagon pictures and the pieces you are talking about don't add up to anything close to a 757.  Even if the entire fuselage plus engines sank entirely into the Pentagon, the remaining wreckage comes up sorely lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I'd like to believe that you saw the plane, your personal attacks don't add anything to your credibility.  I have indeed examined the evidence, and I have already changed my mind because of it.  There is no plane in these pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I would also like to point out that seeing a plane near the Pentagon, and seeing an explosion as the plane drew near to the Pentagon, does nothing to invalidate my claim that no plane can be seen in the photographs.  There are also eyewitnesses on the other side of the Pentagon that claim they saw a plane flying low and away from the building.  My statement is that no plane hit the building, not that no plane was nearby the building or in your field of view.

       My personal attacks are born out of nine years of hearing this nonsense. It is getting very old. The plane I saw was 50 yards in front of my car on I-95 South. It came from my left, knocked down a light pole that smashed the car in front of me, and proceeded, probably .005 seconds later to impact the Pentagon directly to my left. Is that fucking close enough for you!! I find it curious that you completely disregard the most obvious evidence there is: eyewitness evidence. Again, hundreds of cars were driving North, stop and go in rush hour, on the other side of the freeway from me. Unless they were all blind, they saw it too.

       Why do you cling to the notion that the debris field is not what you, in all your infinite, plane crash site wisdom, think it should be? That is the basis of you entire belief. Ridiculous.

       I suppose my beliefs hinge on such precarious notions as (a), planes do not evaporate upon impact and (b), small office fires do not cause catastrophic structural failures that bring down a 47-story building in a manner visually consistent with controlled demolition.  I bring up this second point to refute your claim that my beliefs are formed solely on the basis of my ability to judge crash sites - they aren't.  My original post is about how NO plane is in the debris of the Pentagon crash site, which is "plain" to see, for those willing to believe their own two eyes, and I maintain this position.  If you are really getting so tired of stupid internet people like me pointing out the obvious, I have some bad news for you: truth can be remarkably tenacious.

       OK. I agree there may not be any huge airplane parts in the pictures you have. This, however, has absolutely nothing to do with what I and hundreds of others witnessed first hand and whether or not an airplane hit the Pentagon. Satisfied?

       Relative to where we started, I am satisfied, and I appreciate your post.   I want you to know that I don't question what you or others saw that day: I do believe that a large passenger craft flew very low, over the highway toward the Pentagon, where there was an explosion.  I believe we can agree upon this, even while disagreeing about what exactly hit the Pentagon.

      <p>
       Maybe but I've seen no evidence to suggest that they do.  I also assume that the pentagon wouldn't build a bunch of military planes and subs it doesn't need (I would be wrong).  It'd be nice to see some evidence that there is or was film that hasn't been released.  As it is, it makes sense that they don't have a high frame rate video of the entire pentagon 24/7.

      <p>
       What questions would it answer?  Wouldn't it just add more questions like why did they have a high frame rate camera trained on that section of the Pentagon if they didn't know it was going to happen?   Couldn't it be faked?   People don't trust the countless eye witnesses, the physical evidence, the 9/11 commission report, independent journalists reports, and international independent journalists reports, why would they trust a 15 second video released by the pentagon?

       Usually they have cameras trained on the entrances and the property.  they are also usually low frame rate.  Just like the camera that was at the pentagon checkpoint that got basically not much.  ditto the hotel and gas station cameras. What cameras are you expecting?

       Even if it's private property?  So we should be able to poor over all the evidence that's collected even if it's private video from a kinko's in florida?  I'd rather not allow the government to release private citizens property for the perusal of everyone without some good reasons.  You want a video tape released be specific about what tape you want released and why it should be released.   Seriously, what tape do you want to see that hasn't been released and why do you want to see it?  As it is it just sounds like a witch hunt to give the government more power that it deservers.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nah, it's cool.  I just have a hard time with the truth movement.  There has been a lot written about 911 and a lot of investigation of the events.  It's just makes me sad that there is still so much miss information out there.  This video issue is a good example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at this
       <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/FBI_hides_84_Pentagon_videos">
        http://www.911myths.com/index.php/FBI_hides_84_Pentagon_videos
       </a>
       It explains what tapes the FBI has and what they were.  Why isn't this information on truther sites?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask exactly what video tape you want to see because it's so easy to say general things like "the government isn't releasing video!"  But when you actually look into it what are they supposed to release?  If the pentagon had more cameras than just the security camera where is the evidence that they do?  None of the other security checkpoints look that direction.  Pictures of the pentagon don't show any perimeter cameras looking back on the pentagon.  All the cameras that they have look from the pentagon down on the grounds and who is entering and exiting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were more cameras you would expect there to be:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         leekers leaking the footage, like the security footage that was leaked
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         people that set up the cameras to let the press know
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         retired operators of the cameras to let the press know
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         DoD purchasing requests would have let even more people know
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Current operators of the security system and or cameras
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were more there should be evidence of there being more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to look at this is ask yourself what are you expecting to see and where would that camera have to be to catch what you want?  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the pentagon
       <a href="http://www.inewscatcher.com/timages/7ba332ee2261d0e9014939b9829e5b8b.jpg">
        http://www.inewscatcher.com/timages/7ba332ee2261d0e9014939b9829e5b8b.jpg
       </a>
       Where do you expect cameras to be that would get the view you think should exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, ideally they would have cameras by the road, looking back toward the pentagon.  But that doesn't make much sense, what would be the point of having those images?  It's too far away to see any detail, though it'd be perfect to see a plane hitting the pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I understand where you are coming from.  There is a ton of shit on the internet and it's hard to wade through it.   I certainly don't know everything but I do know that a lot of sites intentionally leave out information or fail to correct bad information.

       Here are some other questions I have for you.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         With all the investigative journalists around the world why do you think non of them are writing stories about this?  Do you think they are in on it?  Or do you think that they have looked into it and found it lacking any credibility?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With all the engineering departments all over the world why do you think none of them are producing published papers that show why the towers couldn't have fallen like they have?  Or do you think they have looked into it and found that the towers fell as they would be expected?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With all the people that would have had to be involved in an conspiracy operation like this why is it that there have been no whistle blowers?   They couldn't even keep the fact that phone calls were being tapped illegally under wraps and 9/11 would have involved far more people.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Just curious what your answers are for those.

      <p>
       Why can't over 1200 architects (around 200 US licensed) and engineers  get something peer reviewed and published?  What about the other 108,000 currently licensed US architects?  Have they not looked into it?  What about the other million and a half engineers?

       There millions of people in the US that believe the earth is 5000 years old.  There are thousands that believe the moonlanding was faked.  I want some actual evidence.

       It'd be more convinced of your point if the videos you liked to showed what would happen if a large plane crashed at high speeds into a concrete wall.

       As I've also said before: passenger jets can't really fly much faster than 350 KIAS at low altitude. Also, in that video, the plane absorbs the whole energy, and the concrete wall remains intact. Pentagon seem to have absorbed a lot of energy, which makes it quite different from your video.

       Another theory:
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a 911 truther but I still believe a passenger plane was probably what hit the pentagon. Why no pictures? Why such fine debris?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the pentagon is protected by automatic missiles. Perhaps something like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the U.S. Navy has developed the computerized, automatic AEGIS anti-aircraft/ anti-cruise-missile/ anti-ballistic missile naval defense system, which can simultaneously track, engage, and destroy massive, though finite, quantities of incoming missiles using agile long-range and short-range surface-to-air missiles.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile#Threat_posed">
         http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile#Threat_posed
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But such a system would have to be set so it would not activate until the target was about to hit the pentagon because the pentagon is in the middle of a city right next to the route taken by planes entering and leaving National Airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when the plane approached the pentagon, perhaps deliberately aimed at a specific section, a missile took it out, but given its trajectory, too late to stop the hit but still turned the plane into tinfoil. Thus there were no large parts of the plane left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why no pictures? If they gave out the pictures of exactly what happened then our enemies would know exactly what kind of defense the pentagon has.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think even Cheney would have had the power to turn off the pentagon's active defense systems.

       Former coworker, an aircraft engineer, said that the wheel that is shown in the wreckage of one of those pics doesnt match any type of boeing. He said they (group of aircraft engineers who analyse wreckage) thought it was from an experimental type of cruise missile/drone that took off from a regular runway. I think he even mentioned an X number. He knew exactly which one it was.

       The wheel pic is around - the wheel is dead center. It was originally proudly shown as evidence of a plane impacting until it was pointed out that it didnt match up at all with the wheel of a 757. mustcomment may have it.

       I don't find the question particularly relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this one. Since the  wings of whatever,  hit the building at something less than four feet from the ground, where did the 9 foot tall engines that were below the wings hit. They did not hit the building and they did not drag on the ground.

       Who removed them during the flight ? Or did they just act like nerf engines with no weight or substance , thereby making no mark on anything?
I understand you are trying to eliminate their validity as heavy weights.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am too . they didn't exist therefore they made no mark on anything as they crashed suddenly at 400 plus mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you see the picture? Flames like to become flame shaped right? This picture was made before they could even do that and there are already no plane parts visible. No tail section, engines ( weighing more than a few pounds as you would like to portray them) , no anything to indicate an airliner . It looks like a missile attack .Even if it was the airliner,  9/11 was absolutely and inside job for myriad other solid  reasons.

       You see, anything hitting the pentagon is BS. Since the 80's the Pentagon has had anti-air defense on its roof that can shoot down anything, even at 20 miles out, thanks to radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question should be; "how come early warning detection did not see the air-craft drop below radar and sound all kinds of alarms"?
      </p>
      <p>
       May be it has something to do with an order from Cheney?

       At this point I don't even care about 9/11 anymore. The economy is were my attention is. At some point in the not to distant future this country will be broke and our Federal Gov wont have the money for their sense of power, control and media presented lies.

       I think it is hard to identify and destroy an airplane that is flying low over built-up areas at 400 mph. Remember, in the 1990's a private pilot flew his airplane into the Whitehouse.
I think running out of oil is probably a more immediate threat than running out of money. I agree with you that the economy is interesting.

       I agree with the fact that there is not even a scrap piece of wing, engine, plane seats...ANYTHING.

       Given the footage of years worth of plane crash sites this looks nothing like one.

       It'd be more convinced of your point if the videos you liked to showed what would happen if a large plane crashed at high speeds into a concrete wall.

       That video is excellent. It doesn't get more damning than that. The plane was seen by quite a few reliable people who verify the flight path was different than we were told. Highly recommended viewing.

        Fair enough, but most 7-11s and Wal-Marts have security cameras covering virtually their entire property

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Usually they have cameras trained on the entrances and the property.  they are also usually low frame rate.  Just like the camera that was at the pentagon checkpoint that got basically not much.  ditto the hotel and gas station cameras. What cameras are you expecting?  Does that checkpoint camera make sense to you or do you think it was planted?

       All I'm asking is for some evidence that the Pentagon actually had these cameras and where recording the pentagon.  So far I'm just hearing "it's the pentagon, they should have..."

      <p>
       What videos do you want to see that haven't been released?  Please be specific.  I don't want a big long list.  Just pick out one that hasn't been released that would show the plane hitting the pentagon.

       Even if it's private property?  So we should be able to poor over all the evidence that's collected even if it's private video from a kinko's in florida?  I'd rather not allow the government to release private citizens property for the perusal of everyone without some good reasons.  You want a video tape released be specific about what tape you want released and why it should be released.   Seriously, what tape do you want to see that hasn't been released and why do you want to see it?  As it is it just sounds like a witch hunt to give the government more power that it deservers.

       Here are some other questions I have for you.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         With all the investigative journalists around the world why do you think non of them are writing stories about this?  Do you think they are in on it?  Or do you think that they have looked into it and found it lacking any credibility?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With all the engineering departments all over the world why do you think none of them are producing published papers that show why the towers couldn't have fallen like they have?  Or do you think they have looked into it and found that the towers fell as they would be expected?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         With all the people that would have had to be involved in an conspiracy operation like this why is it that there have been no whistle blowers?   They couldn't even keep the fact that phone calls were being tapped illegally under wraps and 9/11 would have involved far more people.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Just curious what your answers are for those.
