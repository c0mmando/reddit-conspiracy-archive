       A redditor sort of predicted this, said that over a period of time we shall see more and more stories on aliens, hollywood will make more films deconstructing alien culture, there will be discoveries of habitable worlds, which happened this week and was very uncanny, then religious heads will speak of god encompassing life across the universe, then biological signatures of life elsewhere will be discovered, all leading up to announcement of alien intelligent life. The time frame for this eventuality could be years or decades or longer, but it's all leading up to that.

       Unless these aliens can help us "advance" and "improve" ourselves, humanity will just turn into situation of mass corruption and deceit because there are no limits to morality and ethics. They are just in place because they are evolutionary functions in community settings.

       You will just end up in an Eve Online universe of the haves and have nots even more so than today. It is nothing to look forward to.

      <p>
       In other reddit news, it is apparent there are forces on reddit to devaluate jews by attempting to block relevant alien news articles to be replaced with israel/jewish conspiracy stuff. This real conspiracy is occurring right now on reddit. There is more likely aliens out there than us jews being whacky lizardmen or people who control the world.

       Personally, I think "aliens" is "codespeak" for something far more nefarious on the part of Zionazilluminatifascists. On the one hand, they love mocking David Icke, while on the other hand they love feeding the frenzied masses more fodder.

       It is amazing. For years, people have whined and complained to see so-called 'important' people stand up and talk about what is going on in regards to aerial phenomena and planet earth. When they do, no one believes.

       Prior to 9/11, conspiracy theorists all had their little insanity niche by which to protect themselves. Now, there
       <em>
        seem
       </em>
       to be those who don't hide behind that (ala Alex Jones); while some of them still do (ala Brother Nathaniel, who exposed Alex Jones). Near as I can tell, "shape-shifting reptilians" is Icke's "insanity front"; it gives those whom he's talking about a reason to dismiss him -- if you replace "reptilians" with "illuminati", he sounds just like any other conspiracy theorist. Don't be fooled by allegories - they're used all the time by both sides of the fence. Thus, my point in the comment (above): I think this is part of all that thing.

        the military sending a classified craft into space that we have no idea what its purpose is.

       IMHO They're setting us up for a new and much bigger scam using their ability to project images across the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard rumors to that effect for years. Looks like they're s getting ready to do it.
It was going to be God that appeared in the sky but they couldn't decide what he would look like.

       During the next few years, we're going to see a lot more UFO/ET activity reported in the mainstream media. There are going to be a lot more weird sightings on youtube. You may even witness one or more 'unexplainable' celestial phenomena in person.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are going to have to learn to hold on
       <strong>
        very tight
       </strong>
       to that part of you that can discern between true reality and man-made bullshit. You're going to have to be
       <em>
        extra
       </em>
       ,
       <strong>
        <em>
         super
        </em>
       </strong>
       critical of what you perceive through your primitive, animal senses. Stay sharp. Warned.

       I am pretty sure we'll see ALIENS!!!! within the next 2 years. We'll have to wait and see if they will be used for fear and control over people, I believe they will be for a little while as it seems that is the reason they have been hidden from the public for so long. On a side note I found this article years ago and found it rather interesting as it pertains to today
      </p>
      <p>
       article appeared in the Fall, 1991 issue of 'UFO JOURNAL:

       "I was also told that the calamities that are taking place are for the good of the planet and are causing people to think about alternatives to the present system... I was told that this collapse of the old order will include a collapse of the PRESENT MONETARY SYSTEM, the IMF &amp; the WORLD BANK.

       funny I just saw a local Los angele snightly new broadcast about a pretty realistic beam shot from a ufo to something. Just caught the teaser and missed the story but was amazed when I saw the teaser becuase it's pretty unuasl for big city local news to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       however I must say it is nothing like the UFO stories that appeared in the 70's which culminated in two huge movies which tapped that interest from the public:
Close Encounters of the Third Kind 
and 
 ET.

       Jordan Maxwell recently came out and acknowledged the existence of Aliens also. This includes the famous Reptilians that Icke likes so much.
