       Is there any proof crediting or dis-crediting the claims that there's alien life living on our planet? I have heard a lot about Reptilians but have no idea what to believe. It seems very surreal, yet not impossible.

       It's actually a metaphor for a ruling bloodline that has cultivated traits of psychopathy: violence, self interest, desire for power over others and a complete lack of empathy for fellow human beings. All of these traits are functions of the

        reptilian brain.

       They have refined these characteristics through centuries of inbreeding with other psychopathic "noble" bloodlines.

       Here's a very interesting document which I have compiled and put into PDF form. It's by a guy who posted on the internets saying he was a member of the ruling bloodline we know as the powers that be. The true establishment. He wrote very well and as far as I can reason, his words are entirely internally consistent. Regardless of whether you believe this guy or not, he makes many very profound and deep philosophical points which any investigator of truths would be well-served to consider.

       My personal opinion: Of all the philosophical/scientific/spiritual/metaphysical works/ideas/media/experiences I have dealt with, the Law of One (aka the Ra Material) is the most profound and beautiful by far. Until I read the Law of One, I would say that the Upanishads and Vedas and Bhagavad Gita and Tao Te Ching were the most significant ideologies in my life. But man... Whoever Ra is, he is one wise and compassionate... well... entity. &lt;3

       I used to think about the following: the order of how life theoretically evolved on this planet. First we had fish, insects, then amphibians, then reptiles, birds, then mammals (or something like that).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then imagine that some billions of years ago some insects evolved so much that they eventually left Earth. Then came the age of other beings down the evolutionary chain - amphibians, then reptiles (the ones people like David Icke talk about). Then we now have the "fairly unevolved" mammals - us - and eventually we should see some pretty strange birds within a few years!
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while we think we're dominant species and the pinnacle of evolution on this planet, in fact we could be just the late bloomers of a long series, barely out of the jungle!

It's physical , scientific comparison of human traits and genetics to his cousins in the planet. One thing becomes clear we are not an evolutionary design from nature.

       If man was genetically engineered, the engineer could have done a better job. Only 1.5% of the human genome codes for proteins and the Y chromosome can't isolate maladaptive alleles during meiosis. Not to mention that the Y chromosome will eventually degenerate over millions of years to the point that other chromosomes will have to take over its function for sex typing. The amount of replication errors and mutations that do occur also suggest a pretty shitty job of quality control.

       <p>
        n reality, the 10% myth most likely arose from a misunderstanding (or public misrepresentation) of neurological research undertaken in the late 19th century or early 20th century when researchers either discovered that only about 10% of the neurons in the brain are firing  at any given time or announced that they had only mapped the functions of 10% of the brain at that time (accounts differ on this point). Another possible origin of the 10% myth is that neurons only compose approximately 10% of the cells in the brain; the rest are glial cells that, despite being involved in learning, function differently from neurons

      <p>
       Jablonski 2004 from the Annual Review of Anthropology (behind a pay-wall last I checked) suggested that our nearly hairless skin aids significantly in thermoregulation in hot environments. Pigmentation is a strong adaptation as well because dark pigmentation doesn't differ much from light pigmentation in terms of heat load under high solar radiation. The distinction between the two types is that lighter pigmentation makes it easier to synthesize vitamin d3 from ultraviolet radiation so you have complementary pigmentation gradients from the equator to the poles and the poles to the equator.

       Chimpanzees have stronger, thicker muscle fibers and use a means of locomotion that engages their entire body. They also have less motor neurons compared to humans so they have comparatively less fine motor control. Thus, relatively more muscle force makes up for this.

       Ganymede is the largest satellite in the Solar System. I think Pye means relative to the planet it's orbiting. Then yes the moon is number one. However, that's probably because the original object that hit the Earth tossing the ejecta that became the Moon was the size of Mars.

       There were multiple and varied techniques involved to construct the Pyramids over many years.

       Has anyone thought that David Icke might just be a reptilian? How better to conceal their presence among us, than to present it as a crazy conspiracy theory?

       there was once a very famous television show called V and some washed up ex-goalkeeper and tv sports presenter watched it and thought 'y'know i bet i could convince paranoids that this is real, they probably won't be watching the television cause it keeps speaking to them. god damn i could make alot of money selling books full of this crap.' hey presto, instant new career for david icke.
