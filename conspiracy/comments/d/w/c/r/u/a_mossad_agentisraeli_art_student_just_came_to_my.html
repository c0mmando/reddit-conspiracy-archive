       No bullshit.  My wife answered and talked with him while I controlled our large and overly friendly dog.  I couldn't hear the conversation, but after she blew him off she told me what he wanted and where he was from.  I immediately went outside to check him out.  He started to turn around to continue the sale on me, I said, "No, I am just checking you out."  He got visibly nervous and went on his way.  I watched him until he walked out of sight.  Male, about 5'3", bleach blond hair, around 30.
      </p>
      <p>
       No bullshit.  Full disclosure, I am a Jew myself, but of the non-Zionist kind.  We do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       This happened outside of Houston, TX.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I admit I have no proof other than the dozens of reported incidents anyone can search for online, the creepy as fuck feeling I felt, and nervous behavior when I told him I was checking him out.  I called one of my good friends with an open mind and relayed the story to him while I was watching this bleach blond Israeli art student in his 30's.  I was worked up to the point that I stated, loudly enough for him to hear, that real Jews are about peace and honesty, not violence and deception.  After that he 1st decided on making a phone call, then decided against making a phone call, then afterward walked somewhat quickly off into the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did tell my police officer neighbor about it (a fine gentleman).  He was not lucky enough to receive a visit.

       I don't get it. A student came to your door selling art, you freaked him out King of the Hill style, then he left to avoid the extreme awkwardness? That's hilarious! I bet he went back to his dorm and told his roommate about the crazy paranoid redneck, then they had a good laugh.

       A caret makes the next set of letters (until a space) into superscript, but the caret cannot start a new line. So for example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how you do the superscript - only it fails here because it's the start of a line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three or more underscores, as a paragraph, creates the horizontal line, e.g. "___" is the content of the following line:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Then, I use asterisks on the footnote itself (which nicely causes the caret to cause the superscript, so I can start the line with asterisk-caret-one-space-[rest-of-line]-asterisk
      </p>
      <p>
       So in other words, substituting a percent sign for the caret:
      </p>
      <p>
       *%1 Because if I'd spelled it...*
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be my footnote line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before superscript was implemented, I used charmap to get the superscript-one character...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can have an entire line in superscript, although it's a bit more work:
      </p>

       [](http://)^
      </p>

       The technique is to flood the community with suspicious-but-harmless bodies to saturate American counter-intelligence efforts.   There may be several busloads of "art students" in a community,  but there may also be a handful of

       ,  they're supposed to act creepy and suspiciously to create a crowd of "outsiders" that the real operatives can get lost amongst.   A shell game,  if you will.   How does an FBI office with 19 agents track a dispersed group of 50 "art students"?   (Assuming that the FBI isn't itself compromised.)

       Yes,  that's what a Mossad officer said:   Any Jew,  anywhere in the world will commit treason against his country of birth if it means supporting the Global Jewish Nation.  Israel doesn't need spies or moles;  they're a global mafia.  And you can best believe that when any "American" Jew visits Israel on vacation to visit relatives that he is debriefed of classified information if his career involves such.   They all work together wherever they are --  on Wall Street,  or in the planning &amp; execution of 911  --  cuz wherever they are,  so is the Global Jewish Nation.

        On Oct. 1 of 2001, Texas newswoman Anna Werner, of KHOU-TV in Houston, told viewers about a "curious pattern of behavior" by people with "Middle Eastern looks" claiming to be Israeli art students. "Government guards have found those so-called students," reported Werner, "trying to get into [secure federal facilities in Houston] in ways they're not supposed to -- through back doors and parking garages." Federal agents, she said, were extremely "concerned." The "students" had showed up at the DEA's Houston headquarters, at the Leland Federal Building in Houston, and even the federal prosecutor's office; they had also appeared to be monitoring the buildings. Guards at the Earle Cabell Federal Building in Dallas found one "student" wandering the halls with a floor plan of the site. Sources told Werner that similar incidents had occurred at sites in New York, Florida, and six other states, "and even more worrisome, at 36 sensitive Department of Defense sites."

       Hypothetically, if you were soliciting door to door, you got turned away by a housewife, and when the husband popped his head out of the door, he informed you he wasn't interested in what you were selling, he was
       <em>
        just checking you out
       </em>
       , how would you react?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I would be nervous.  There aren't a lot of things you could hear beyond outright innuendo or threats that would be creepier.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I was actually a spy?  Well, presuming that I had not gone through the special ed version of spy school, I would avoid both revealing my country of origin and becoming visibly nervous when some guy told me he was "checking me out."
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, if he was a spy, you're already playing into his hands.  My guess?  Syrian intelligence services.  Could easily play off being Israeli, and probably doing some counter-intel work, trying to tip people off to possible Israeli activity in the area.  I hope you weren't planning any trips to Damascus, my friend.

       Hilarious!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, though - there's a semi-legit company that gets Israeli students to sell cheap chinese mass-produced oil paintings door-to-door, heavily marked-up. They operate all over the world, drawing complaints when people discover they've been duped, then closing down and starting back up with another (very similar) company name.
      </p>
      <p>
       No conspiracy, just a good old-fashioned shady business. I bought some paintings, but then decided to do some digging, and discovered a bunch of stuff about them (
       <a href="http://www.art4life.eu">
        Art4Life
       </a>
       was the website that was operational then - I'm not sure if they're still up). I went to the police, but they couldn't do anything because they operate out of Isle of Man, with a call centre in Israel. I'm in the Netherlands. I ended up not making the last couple of payments, so they threatened me with legal action - I just said "Seriously? I bet your sales guys don't even have a license, and I can show the paintings are Chinese and cost 2 euros. You've already made plenty of profit from my gullible ass, so stop calling me."  And I never heard from them again.

      <p>
       In WWII, the poles got lists of every Pole that married a French person and visited them in France ( near the D-day landings was a prime location) under the guise of being a sales person, (the sales were legit, set up for the purpose) then got chatting to find their leanings and if possible recruited them. Just cap badges and the like but more dangerous stuff once in the cell.

       too high. On the other hand, I wonder if he could've just been casing the neighbourhood for a good old fashioned B&amp;E. Apparently his cover story is just incongruent enough to completely obscure that possibility - it's like a triple-reverse-reverse-psychology-fake-out.

        On Oct. 1 of last year, Texas newswoman Anna Werner, of KHOU-TV in
        <strong>
         Houston
        </strong>
        , told viewers about a "curious pattern of behavior" by people with "Middle Eastern looks" claiming to be Israeli art students. "Government guards have found those so-called students," reported Werner, "trying to get into [
        <strong>
         secure federal facilities in Houston
        </strong>
        ] in ways they're not supposed to -- through back doors and parking garages." Federal agents, she said, were extremely "concerned." The "students" had showed up at the DEA's Houston headquarters, at the Leland Federal Building in
        <strong>
         Houston
        </strong>
        , and even the federal prosecutor's office; they had also appeared to be monitoring the buildings. Guards at the Earle Cabell Federal Building in Dallas found one "student" wandering the halls with a floor plan of the site. Sources told Werner that similar incidents had occurred at sites in New York, Florida, and six other states, "and even more worrisome, at 36 sensitive Department of Defense sites."

       Oh yeah, he must have been sent to spy on you.  Why else would someone get visibly nervous after being "checked out" by some paranoid redneck.  I bet Mossad is sending people after you because of such scathing posts as "Senator Conrad Burns is a Dick!!" and "Louis CK understands the Internet."
