      <p>
       I gladly payed up $50.00 a few months back to support Reddit in its time of need, and now have 1 year and 7 months of Reddit Gold membership remaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was quite happy with that situation until a few weeks ago, when I noticed that about half my submissions were not even reaching the New queue in some ordinary subreddits.  None of them were particularly contentious, and in some cases, moderators would help me out.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, in other cases, my article would not appear, and the moderators would completely ignore my protestations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just to be clear, this is not a case of moderators spiking my article: the spam filter acts independently of the moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such an opaque process can be abused easily, and in secrecy, by censoring anything that anyone wants censored.  The fact that Reddit's spam filter hits so many innocent bystanders means that if censorship is being applied systematically, it can be plausibly denied as an overactive spam filter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that every single Internet community has this kind of secret back door: PayPal can freeze your account on a whim, Wikipedia can disappear edits, and Reddit can ensure submitted links are never seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wish that Reddit was not in the same basket.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: To address some points made by commentors,
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I don't believe that anything I have submitted has been deliberately censored: I am just saying that Reddit's spam filter provides a means to implement censorship without appearing to do so.
       </li>
       <li>
        The articles which I have had killed by the spam filter have not been material that would be censored, but then again, these articles were from quite reputable, non-spammy sources, such as national newspapers.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

       Could it be the domain you're submitting or any key words you're using that are spammed heavily on Reddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       My submission on the
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/dz9rx/full_movie_end_of_liberty_2010/">
        End of Liberty
       </a>
       in
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       got caught in the spam filter, and I PM'd the mods to have a look.  They took care of it.  I'm thinking I triggered the spam filter because either:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The term "Full Movie" that I used in the title is probably overused by spammers posting those free movie sites.
       </li>
       <li>
        I submitted the link once, got the title wrong of the movie so I deleted it.  Resubmitted within 5 min.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I think Reddit is pretty fair though when it comes to submissions.  Granted, our material may not get front page'd for those not subscribing to
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       ... but Reddit seems to have an almost "anything goes" policy when it comes to subreddits.  I'm new here though, only been here a month.  Still seems MUCH more open than Digg, that's for sure.

       I like your style, but I have way too much faith in the reddit admins to ever think about utilizing it for that. Facebook on the other hand has unnashamesly done this very thing, without even arguing on the basis of spam

       Because a filter which appears negligent provides plausible deniability for a filter which is genuinely censoring some subjects.

      <p>
       Remember: on

       Okay this makes perfect sense, otherwise the entire conspiracy would be written off entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well there are plenty of links that make the front page all the time from those websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they could be banned for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The articles are being banned because of specific content that a person or group of people would like censored from the general reddit audience.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They could be fake false positives to cover up actual censorship elsewhere.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The articles could be banned because they are actual false positives, mistakenly removed by the spam filter.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       If number 1 is the case you should be able to find a pattern in the banned articles. If number 2 is the case there would be no way to distinguish between it and a malfunctioning spam filter, meaning any theory you can propose has equal weight as a simple error.

       Yes, the spam filter has a lot of issues, but really what's a good alternative to the current filter? Since it has to be commercially and productivity viable for plausibility's sake, it shouldn't take up more resources nor require more meddling to keep it working.
      </p>

       Edit - Downvotes for asking if cojoco had an alternative in mind to carry through with his feelings about the spam filter. Nice
