    <div class="md"><p>I like this analogy a lot.  With your permission, I&#39;m going to begin using it.  And if you don&#39;t give me your permission, I&#39;m, uh, like, <em>not</em> going to use it...</p>

<p>You captured my basic philosophy about the two parties very nicely.  One may be more appealing to you for one or more reasons but the two want essentially the same thing.  They want to control you and get what they need from you.  And, like a cop, I think that they often believe they&#39;re doing it for your own good and for the good of society.</p>

<p>Which, maybe they are...  But they still get their paychecks from the same people.  They still report to the same authorities.  And on the whole, they&#39;d cover each others&#39; asses WAY before they stuck their necks out for yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the professional wrestling analogy more. Both sides have a role to play, but they are buddy buddy backstage. We are the crowd.</p>

<p>The left v right paradigm is completely ridiculous. The transnational banking interests don&#39;t give a rat&#39;s ass about ideology. They have demonstrated their ability to shake down a socialist system (see Europe) and a capitalist system (here in the US). They just want our money, resources, land and rights.</p>

<p>What I like is this meme (is that what this is?) is a very simple way to describe the issue in a way that almost anyone can understand. It might actually change someone&#39;s thinking on the subject.</p>

<p>And the added twist of being able to exchange who the Good cop / Bad cops are makes it really powerful. I could see an SNL sketch on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its quite simple, each party supports a limited set of &quot;freedoms&quot; they push.</p>

<p>Generally, the Dems allow slightly more social freedom, whereas the Repubs allow more economic.</p>

<p>However, due to the constant use of Hegelian Dialectics there is always compromise offered as the solution....so the end result is the continual collapse of all freedoms.</p>

<p>The true PTB use this tool constantly and if done gradually enough, the public is helpless to respond. Their one recent miscalculation has come with using Obama, they pushed too hard too fast on that one and has a result have shattered the illusion. </p>

<p>Of course, there are still reams of delusional thinkers that because of social approval / disapproval theory still can&#39;t see Obama for what he is....I mean, just go look at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> sometimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you think Bush didn&#39;t shatter the illusion for many, you haven&#39;t been paying close attention. The difference with Obama is that the media is onboard with the public outcry against the Executive because the newscycle trendsetters that have the market share see it as good business. This is a marked 180 from the viewpoint of the MSM during the previous administration.</p>

<p>Yes, public outcry is at an all time high, but it didn&#39;t start in 2009.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I agree completely that Bush shattered the illusion...particularly among traditional conservatives.</p>

<p>However, that largely played out over an 8 year period. Moreover, 911 gave Bush a free 2 to 3 year &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card where he could do whatever he wanted unquestioned.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until 2005 that the average Repub started to sense something was seriously off.....</p>

<p>With Obama, we have had a quickening effect, it is barely 2 years in and its painfully obvious he isn&#39;t planning on living up to any of his campaign promises (because he works for the central bank).</p>

<p>Can you define that? I see this all the time on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> but rarely do i ever see any elaboration, sources, and well, facts. Why does he work for them? How is he getting paid? Until people understand these things it has no more credibility then say... the Tea Party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can tell via the actions....who is benefiting?</p>

<p>All actions BO has taken has ultimately benefited the banks.</p>

<p>Its not so much a case of politicians being &quot;paid&quot; for their service...most of them do so for the power trip. The are allowed to prance around, appearing important in the limelight, it just comes with certain strings attached....and when its time to read a script on the teleprompter about the &quot;need for more borrowing&quot; for this or that....the whore politicians deliver pitch-perfect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t start with Bush either. I think it&#39;s simply a matter of awareness. When one becomes politically aware it only takes a few short years of paying close attention to see what&#39;s really going on. Those that don&#39;t pay close attention and get wrapped up in the false left-right paradigm don&#39;t see it. I became aware in the &#39;70s and it was the same then as it is now. After learning a little political history I came to the conclusion it&#39;s been like that pretty much since the beginning. </p>
