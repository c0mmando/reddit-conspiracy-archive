       the only problem is that none of what they are accused of lying about shows any kind of conspiracy or malicious intent; rather the evidence points to the confused and incompetent response of the military and civilian leadership. this seems to indicate that a more comprehensive report of the Pentagon and NORAD's actions is required to understand why the response was so inept. this isn't really a "conspiracy" as much as it is an exercise in CYA (cover your ass) politicking.

       NORAD does not have to get the VP's approval to scramble jets, even over American soil. We got caught flat footed. Post-hoc this was all used to justify military action that was not required, but that is a separate issue.

       I was thinking of the changes made to AIRCRAFT PIRACY (HIJACKING) AND DESTRUCTION OF DERELICT AIRBORNE OBJECTS in June of 2001 (which seems extremely opportune, but that's my suspicious nature):
      </p>
      <p>
       When notified that military assistance is needed in conjunction
with an aircraft piracy (hijacking) emergency, the DDO, NMCC,
will:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Determine whether or not the assistance needed is reasonably
available from police or commercial sources. If not, the DDO,
NMCC, will notify the appropriate unified command or
       <strong>
        NORAD
       </strong>
       to determine if suitable assets are available and will forward the
request to the
       <strong>
        Secretary of Defense for approval
       </strong>
       in accordance
with DODD 3025.15, paragraph D.7 (reference d).
      </p>
      <p>
       Rumsfeld claimed he wasn't aware there was a plane "headed our way" until after the Pentagon was hit, so how could he give approval for anything?  I notice it doesn't say anything about the President, but he was, uh,
       <strong>
        <a href="http://imgur.com/iEPpW.jpg">
         otherwise engaged with pressing matters
        </a>
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So if nobody was lying, Rumsfeld was in the dark, Cheney was adamant that

       I didn't say no one lied. Many people did. The question is whether this was part of a coordinated conspiracy to attack or allow an attack on the US, or if this is part of an attempt by people to cover their incompetence during a crisis. I agree with most of what you posted, but I think it flows my way. These guys dropped the ball, on many levels. That makes them incompetent, not evil.

       It's interesting that those 'confused and incompetent' military and civilian leaders who were involved in allowing 9/11 to occur were rewarded with promotions instead of demotion/dismissal. Kind of strange, huh?

       Sometimes, accomplices can be a lot more useful, especially after one or two have been used to make an example of what might happen if you cease to be useful. This is particularly true in politics (and organised crime).

       Citation? If you are going to make that claim you need to provide some evidence; my mantra from policy debate is "every claim needs a warrant."
Also I'm arguing from negation: there is a derth of evidence that points to a conspiracy. You argue that a conspiracy exists, the burden is on you to provide positive evidence of a conspiracy. The best you can do is point to holes in the official account, but an incomplete story does not a conspiracy make. Just as problems or missing pieces of evidence in evolutionary theory do not provide positive evidence for creationism. I'm drawing a parallel between the arguments, not insulting your intelligence, my apologies if you thought that was an ad hominem attack.

       My mistake then, I didn't read your argument correctly. I am not advocating for the official line myself. My argument is that in a bloated and incompetent bureaucracy there are going to be holes and problems, as there are dozens of talking heads, none of which have access to all the evidence. I have a very high bar for believing that a conspiracy exists here, rather than a series of blunders and half-truths that people are attempting to conceal post-hoc. I'm not actually trying to troll you, and perhaps your belief that I am trying to is why this has been such a contentious back and forth. I don't believe we will ever get the full story, there is too much tied up in this story to ever get a strictly factual and accurate account. But that does not lend itself to being evidence for any kind of malicious intent. Was there malfeasance on the part of agents of the government? Yes, most certainly. But not to cover-up any kind of evil doing. More, at least in my view, this is part of a pattern of bureaucrats covering their asses to protect their jobs and their budgets. We are actually on the same page. I thought that your statement about there being problems with the story was an attempt to lay the groundwork for an argument for the existence of a conspiracy, not a more reasonable line, which I agree with, that the official account of events on 9/11 is riddled with holes. I honestly think we would find that we agree with each other if we were to have this discussion face to face, rather than across browsers.

       Ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be fair, I believe that there are some interesting events that point towards a conspiracy, although I also don't know enought details to believe one way or another. I'm also not sure of my memory of these ideas, but are enough to make me believe there is a prima facie case for conspiracy:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dick Cheney told the air force to "Stand down!" while the 9/11 planes were in the air
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some Israelis were filming the twin towers burning, and clapping and cheering, and they left in a white van.  They were captured by the FBI and released
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some Israeli arts students had a floor of one of the twin towers for mysterious arts projects
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The passport of one of the Saudi terrorists turned up within hours of the attacks, whereas none of the passenger's paperwork did
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is some concern about the provenance of the radio transmissions from the planes
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nato was conducting training the day before 9/11 which involved a very similar kind of attack
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because of their age and size, the twin towers were built in a very unusual way, with the structural supports on the outside of the building, whereas all skyscrapers these days are supported by a central core.  This is actually evidence against a conspiracy, as it explains why the twin towers have been targeted several times, why there were problems with fire regulations, and why the towers collapsed.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These are the most interesting, but there are many more tidbits that might have merit too.

       I don't disagree at all, but the question that always comes to my mind is "how much of this is coincidence?" New York is a huge place, with millions of people doing things at any given time, with this abundance of unconnected data it is very easy to see or construct patterns that seem connected. I've never heard the claims about Israeli art students before and the passport issue has always somewhat bothered me. There have been conflicting accounts about what the civilian leadership actually ordered, but there were jets scrambled out of Andrews, that is a fact, they were just scrambled much later than we were actually told. I'm also glad you point out the engineering problems with the buildings, as the Princeton simulations did. As I told someone else, I don't believe we will ever get a full account of that day's events. One of the main problems I have with 9/11 conspiracy theories is that they would require the collusion of hundreds, if not thousands, of US government and military personnel. I find it very hard to believe that not a single one of them would come out with a credible account that validates these theories. I would be amiss if I were to say that a conspiracy is absolutely impossible, but I do think that it is the more unlikely of the two explanations.

       The information really isn't all that hard to find, look into what company was running most of the air port security that day, look at Silversteins insurance policy, the fact that over half the bush admin. was duel citizen with Israel, that Chertoff sent Israelis back to the promised land after they were caught in a van with traces of explosives, on 9/11 they even admitted themselves that they were there to "video tape the event".

       Ok.  So people who post theories to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are not "conspiracy theorists."
      </p>

       Also, when they post those theories, and are asked for facts, they are not obligated to provide them under any circumstances.

       This alone would just indicate that they tried to cover up bad decisions in the response to the attacks, not that they had been involved in it in any way. I agree that such questions about such an important event should not be as open as they are, but it's far from a smoking gun for further conspiracy theories, especially those about an involvement of the US government or "ze Jews".

       No, not being able to do your job because of seemingly headless snakes that run the institutions. Most of the investigation couldn't be done properly because they couldn't get access to resources they needed.

       More over, non-conspiracy politics are in play. For example, I forgot the name of the guy, but a non-elected official went into the library of congress and got caught trying to steal things out of the archives. These things were documents linking him to not taking out Al-Queda leader, Bin-Laden pre-911.
      </p>
      <p>
       He thought if word got out he had the chance to kill him but didn't (afraid of collateral damage. The killing of him would have killed a bunch of kids. At the time, it was a good political move not to kill a cave dweller because having the collateral damage of those kids on his record, non-wartime would look awful.). So he goes into the library of congress to get rid of the info that shows he COULD have killed Osama, because that would make him bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Catch 22 for the guy. Now imagine all the cases were officials burned stuff that would politically making them look bad, even though what they did really wasnt bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't some big conspiracy to cover up an inside job, just a bunch of people trying to protect there ass for their fuck ups in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now idiots come in and go, "WTF?!?!?! Why doesnt all the information exist? Why cant the government do its job NOW even though it never has been able to? There must be a conspiracy! OIL! BRAWWWW RAGE!"

       I would like to believe what you say, but you have absolutely NO evidence that Osama is Tim Osmond other than speculation. I like knowing facts and believing in them. Not saying all conspiracy theories are junk, but this seems like a case where you come to your conclusion first, then look for evidence to support it.

       As you are probably being paid to push this silly the Iraqi Saudi Afghans powered those three buildings with those two planes routine, you probably know that the fakes pretending to be hijackers couldn't fly, being kicked out of flight school, not being able to speak the languages of the countries where they claimed to have been schooled (Germany and France), spending more time on strippers and pork that plane controls and books ( Zacarias Moussaoui - you guys should really dump him, he is an embarassement).... and I could go on

       A member of the inquiry team, a US Air Force officer who flew over 100 sorties during the Vietnam war, told the press conference: "Those birds (commercial airliners) either had a crack fighter pilot in the left seat, or they were being manoeuvred by remote control."
      </p>
      <p>
       In evidence given to the enquiry, Captain Kent Hill (retd.) of the US Air Force, and friend of Chic Burlingame, the pilot of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, stated that the US had on several occasions flown an unmanned aircraft, similar in size to a Boeing 737, across the Pacific from Edwards Air Force base in California to South Australia. According to Hill it had flown on a pre programmed flight path under the control of a pilot in an outside station

       You actually bring up a valid point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people believe they are fairly intelligent and assume that the level of organization required to pull off [insert some conspiracy] is beyond human reach.  This is a very warm &amp; safe state of mind (ignorance is bliss), but it's just not the case.  The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know.  That's the unfortunate truth.

       That's like saying you don't believe in water. Real conspiracies are everywhere, in every flavor imaginable. It simply means 2 people trying  or succeeding to do something illegal in secret. It happens constantly.

       I hardly think so. Citing Wikipedia and a blog as your first source is not only laughable, it makes for a terrible argument.

      <p>
       Also, sinister acts carried out throughout history hardly counts as proven conspiracy theories. I hardly see how "Nazi gold" or the Underground Railroad count as conspiracy. The first has no substance, the second has no sinister nature.

       "sinister acts" done by more than one person are "real conspiracies" you bafflingly  stupid twat. You don't even know the difference between a Conspiracy theory and a  conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you can list a "particularly" crazy THEORY *(like Christianity for example) , ... that someone somewhere believes in that  has nothing to do with what we the price of tea in China, or in anyway disproves the FaCT of many conspiracy "theories" actually turning out eventually to be true. You're really THIS STUPID?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to be a troll, because  no one is as clueless and idiotic as you are pretending to be. I invested exactly as much time in providing you a link as your intellect deserved in the exchange.  It's not my job to make you less stupid by doing your own research for you .
      </p>
      <p>
       You've made everyone in the vicinity dumber just being you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your claim is that no conspiracies have ever been true ever,  (exactly what you stating by saying "real conspiracies" are  oxy morons) .... and all of those on that list are LIES because they are from Wikipedia etc.

       We had to start from the ground up with you,  because you are having trouble  understanding what a conspiracy even is, as proved by your ignorant statements.

       Nobody gives a flying fuck what specific conspiracies you think you've are knowledgeable about and have an opinion about.

       What does "believe" mean here? I think that the government covered up that they ignored terrorism prior to 9/11. I think they covered up that they reacted badly after the fact. So that means I don't believe the official story. I also don't believe that the buildings were taken down by explosives, that the U.S. was behind the plot or knew about it. I don't believe a missile hit the Pentagon.

       oh dude, just fuck off. Every time I post anything in this fucking subreddit (which I happen to be subscribed to, "just in case someone is right") that is not
       <em>
        exactly

       preaching to the fucking choir, I hear this "YOU are the problem" line. Goddamnit, you people are worse than

       . The same exact fucking thing happened when I had questions about fluoridated water here a while back. Jesus Christ, God forbid I ask a question about the possible benefits of fluoridated water! HOLY CRAP did I get an assreaming for that. Literally, I asked ONE fucking honest question, and someone just flipped the fuck out on me. Do you realize how alienating that is to anyone on the fence who you might want to try to, oh I don't know,
       <em>
        convince
       </em>
       , instead of just fucking circle-jerk? Fuck any of you and your single-minded knee-jerk stereotyping whose immediate reaction to a differing opinion is "YOU are the PROBLEM!", you don't know a fucking thing about me except that my take on things is not quite aligned with yours. It could one day be, but you don't seem to give a fuck, you just want to pound the heel of your shoe on the table. At least I think independently and don't pander to karma. I understand you might be angry or have a hard-on for this or that thing that most people don't believe, but jesus, this is no reason to take it out on The Heathen Unbelievers™! Goddamn it, you sorry bastards.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not comfortable with talking to someone with a differing opinion/belief/worldview without immediately resorting to "YOU are the problem", you need to GTFO. The point is challenging communication. Not circlejerking and mutual worldview-scratching.

       You know what the fucking problem is? Intolerance for another person's point of view. That makes YOU the problem. And anyone else who fucking downvotes this comment. Which is going to happen, but I don't care. I'm happy enough to know that it's on your conscience that you downvoted me for speaking an uncomfortable truth.

       (I didnt' know you were going to post that last reply, and independently) I just logged in to back off from my original attack, actually, I didn't mean
       <em>
        you

       at all, I should have got my subject correct : the idea, not some person, container of that idea.

       It was just easy to say "you" instead of the correct "that idea is the problem", and one does - I did - incorrectly broaden one's attack to the container or the class rather than the specific instantation.

       Still, not to go to far, all I know of you is  your particular idea : 'I choose what I believe in based on my social environment's approval (and some silly pre-unapproved UFOs &gt;&gt; the WTC lie system, oh, meeeooow)', which is a cancer (that you are sick with), so I responded to that single aspect.

       Well, that's just the thing, I don't choose to believe based on what my society approves. I have a very good friend who experienced a very close UFO encounter that he would only tell me about because he knew I was open-minded and nonjudgmental. I think something is definitely up there. I also think something is definitely up with ghosts (I've heard one, with another person, and I later found out others have heard the same thing... and that's only because I asked around).

        /r/atheism
       </a>
       a lot, even though I'm not atheist, because I think they're often brilliant people. I'm not afraid to buck a trend.

       Honestly, I don't know what I think about WTC. I don't want to see any conspiracy evidence. And if I did, I would question its source intensely. It may be that I don't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to think there's some kind of conspiracy behind it. It's just too awful to consider. So I guess I electively choose to bury my head in the sand
       <em>
        on this one topic
       </em>
       and champion the UFO and ghost causes elsewhere. ;) I never said there might not be something behind it, it's just that I can only handle championing 1 or maybe 2 unpopular conspiracies before social ostracization prevents me from being able to convince anyone of anything (I'm all about communication and trying to align 2 worldviews, painful a process as it can be).
      </p>
      <p>
       My core interest is trying to get others to see what I see and also to get myself to see what they see. I think there is only 1 truth and it's the job of everyone to try to find it, relentlessly, even if it costs their own worldview. This demands rigorous open-mindedness and tolerance for people who see things entirely differently. We all have different pieces of the puzzle, you know?

If I choose not to believe her it doesnt mean I have to choose to believe that a secret goverment ninja used cutting edge darpa tech to walk through my bedroom walls and implanted a tracking chip into my spine without making a single cut into my skin.

       This simple question will debunk almost every conspiracy theory: If you really believe you are right then prove me wrong, by actually giving an honest and factual answer:
      </p>
      <p>
       "assuming the conspiracy was correct and the public has indeed been told a lie, how many people would have to be into it for it to stand? This list includes EVERYONE who had to be aware of it or could have figured it out later, including enemies who would want nothing more than to reveal the lie and international experts who should know the math doesn't add up."
      </p>
      <p>
       just think about it... the list goes into the millions of people, from CIA-agents to the bomb-squad, to the people who work there, to the fire department, the airlines...
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course they weren't all part of the planning, but many of them could have figured it out afterwards and none of them, not a single one talked? How corrupt do you have to be to not talk about thousands of deaths?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just face it: 9/11 was an attack by the taliban/ Al qaida. The only crime Bush comitted was sheer incompetence. there was never any malice or controlled demolition.

       it would take millions of people to fake it.

       The reason Osama Pulled it of with just a few people was because he just hijacked a plane and flew into the towers. There was never any need to bribe people or cover things up.

       I understand what you are saying, but it would seem to me that the CIA could pull it off easier than "the taliban". The CIA have all the money, people, infrastructure, etc., etc., etc. Logic and Occam's razor makes this obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are avoiding what the OP was saying: No less than 60% of the 9/11 commissioners have publicly stated that the government agreed not to tell the truth about 9/11 and that the Pentagon was engaged in deliberate deception about their response to the attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please explain to me why anyone who agrees that the 911 commission was compromised for whatever reason, would not support a new independent investigation of the biggest massacre in America since the federal government massacred the Indians?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you resist trying to find out things about what happened that might not yet be known?

       But that's not what "Occam's Razor" means.  The Razor says "Do not multiply entities beyond necessity."  E.g. do not create complicated theories when simpler ones also explain the evidence.

       How many people do you really think it would take to pull this off?

       Also, compartmentalized information. One group of people can build a radio controlled explosive. They don't need to know what it was actually used for. They could have been told it was an anti-IED bomb and been happy with that as justification for building it.
      </p>

       You could have a team of maybe 3 people installing "Vibration Detection Devices" onto each of the steel columns in the 3 towers.

       I think that's his point.  20 angry guys can stage an attack.  It would take millions to

       2 angry pilots could have flown planes into buildings (though there are professional pilots who say otherwise), but thin aluminium tubes, even at 650mph, do not cause that much over-engineered structural steel to vapourise. You may as well try to convince me that the earth is flat.

       No, you're right.  They can't.

       But then again, we didn't see the towers "vapourise," we saw them get hit by a couple of 767s, burn for an hour or so, and then collapse.

      <p>
       I'm also not sure I understand this thing you are talking about, "over-engineered structural steel."  What do you think this thing is, and how is it relevant to the discussion at hand?

       "over engineered structural steel" is what the Twin Towers were composed  of. Believe it or not, they didn't make them out of marshmallows. The bottom parts of the towers (that pulverised) were designed to hold up the upper parts. Catastrophic failure was not in the blueprint. Not even after those upper parts were warmed up a bit by burning jet fuel.

       So the upper parts were not in any way connected to the bottom parts, to the extent where an impact or damage to the top might damage the bottom?

       The steel matrix had been specifically designed to withstand aircraft impact of equivalent size and weight. Perhaps you should revise your knowledge of what you think is physics. Air yields less resistance than steel. Yet the path of collapse of ALL THREE TOWERS was directly through all the steel. The impact from two aircraft was not sufficient to cause the amount of damage to which you refer.

       By "your version" I mean the one with which you align your perception. I assume that is the "official story" of the 9/11 events which, from my position, has no credibility or proof of its own. It is the official story that is on the back foot. I don't claim to know exactly how things happened, just that the official story is unrealistic and unlikely.

       Not really.  I am pretty sure there is more going on there than meets the eye.  However I am skeptical of quite a few theories on the internet, mostly because people are unwilling to back them up with facts or because many of them cite the same sources, which are themselves not backed up.  Turtles all the way down.

       And, of course, attacking people who are not immediately convinced by some blog or internet forum post is not helping the cause, you know?

       If you'd ever learn some history you'd know the answer to this question.  It IS possible to have a big secret, and it has happened in the past. Google "The Manhattan Project" for one example.  Yes, there were some spies that found out about, but did the whole world know there was a huge bomb being developed that some scientists feared would burn the entire atmosphere?  (the answer is no by the way)

       I didn't read anything into your comment. I stated that you agree that the co-chairs of the 911 commission said that the 911 commission was "set up to fail". That's fact, not me reading anything into anything.

       Funny, I mostly hear accusations of "hive mind" from Creatards, who can't understand why atheists are so consistent. Hint: rational people are consistent because their beliefs are based on facts.

       No, not being able to do your job because of seemingly headless snakes that run the institutions. Most of the investigation couldn't be done properly because they couldn't get access to resources they needed.

       More over, non-conspiracy politics are in play. For example, I forgot the name of the guy, but a non-elected official went into the library of congress and got caught trying to steal things out of the archives. These things were documents linking him to not taking out Al-Queda leader, Bin-Laden pre-911.
      </p>
      <p>
       He thought if word got out he had the chance to kill him but didn't (afraid of collateral damage. The killing of him would have killed a bunch of kids. At the time, it was a good political move not to kill a cave dweller because having the collateral damage of those kids on his record, non-wartime would look awful.). So he goes into the library of congress to get rid of the info that shows he COULD have killed Osama, because that would make him bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Catch 22 for the guy. Now imagine all the cases were officials burned stuff that would politically making them look bad, even though what they did really wasnt bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       It isn't some big conspiracy to cover up an inside job, just a bunch of people trying to protect there ass for their fuck ups in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now idiots come in and go, "WTF?!?!?! Why doesnt all the information exist? Why cant the government do its job NOW even though it never has been able to? There must be a conspiracy! OIL! BRAWWWW RAGE!"

       The information really isn't all that hard to find, look into what company was running most of the air port security that day, look at Silversteins insurance policy, the fact that over half the bush admin. was duel citizen with Israel, that Chertoff sent Israelis back to the promised land after they were caught in a van with traces of explosives, on 9/11 they even admitted themselves that they were there to "video tape the event".

       Sometimes, accomplices can be a lot more useful, especially after one or two have been used to make an example of what might happen if you cease to be useful. This is particularly true in politics (and organised crime).

       So you're saying "all conspiracy theories are junk" while asking people to think that you think "Not saying all conspiracy theories are junk"

       I don't disagree at all, but the question that always comes to my mind is "how much of this is coincidence?" New York is a huge place, with millions of people doing things at any given time, with this abundance of unconnected data it is very easy to see or construct patterns that seem connected. I've never heard the claims about Israeli art students before and the passport issue has always somewhat bothered me. There have been conflicting accounts about what the civilian leadership actually ordered, but there were jets scrambled out of Andrews, that is a fact, they were just scrambled much later than we were actually told. I'm also glad you point out the engineering problems with the buildings, as the Princeton simulations did. As I told someone else, I don't believe we will ever get a full account of that day's events. One of the main problems I have with 9/11 conspiracy theories is that they would require the collusion of hundreds, if not thousands, of US government and military personnel. I find it very hard to believe that not a single one of them would come out with a credible account that validates these theories. I would be amiss if I were to say that a conspiracy is absolutely impossible, but I do think that it is the more unlikely of the two explanations.
