I&#39;ve been a redditor for over a year now, but I&#39;m new to the conspiracy reddit. I get the feeling that in every thread there&#39;s that one singular comment that just blows my mind with some theory I&#39;ve never heard before and can&#39;t find any other information on. I want more of that. In fact, I want all of it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m challenging you. </p>

<p>Not as a skeptic, but rather, as someone who would LOVE to see all this information centrally organized for other newcomers, and for my own selfish browsing. So please, create your temp accounts, log into your tor servers, do whatever you have to do to feel comfortable, and then post up your crazy here. Everything you&#39;ve got, don&#39;t hold back. Aliens, reptilians, moon bases, GMOs, fluoride, 9/11, bring it on. I don&#39;t want to look at the word the same way after reading what I hope you&#39;ll bring to the table. But please, provide links for more information, sources, whatever you can do that will allow me (and others) to dive deeper. Start with the basic stuff (assume I know nothing) and then build on it. Seriously, consider me your bright-eyed, open-minded pupil, and teach me whatever you believe, <strong>and why</strong>. I want to learn.</p>

<p>If possible - for organization - it&#39;d be great to see each thread as it&#39;s own broad topic, and all resulting conversations underneath it. </p>

<p>Thanks everyone. I&#39;m looking forward to this like you wouldn&#39;t believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The feminist movement was funded by the banking cartel as a cover story to hide the collapsing currencies. </p>

<p>Starting in the late 70&#39;s it became necessary to have 2 wage earners in the family because the purchasing power of the dollar had started to collapse so much that it took both salaries to just keep an average household going.</p>

<p>Hence why organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation gave so much to feminist causes and pushed stories through their controlled media selling the idea of a &quot;independent, strong working woman&quot;...making it a fashionable thing.</p>

<p>This served another goal as they knew it would also increase the divorce rate, hence create a greater demand for welfare services....banks love lending money to governments, so anything that increases the national debt (war, welfare, etc) the banks encourage. </p>

<p>Hence, in one neat package, they were able to (a) hide the fact that the currency had collapsed, (b) Increase the breakdown of the family, and (c) Increase their primary clients&#39; (US Gov) appetite for their product (debt).</p>

<p>From what I read &quot;(a) hide the fact that the currency had collapsed&quot; doesn&#39;t seem right. According to some articles, inflation was caused by the end of the war, more men returning home to work and the rise of women in the work place. IMO they didn&#39;t really hide anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you please NOT believe this &quot;snippet&quot; of information.  There is absolutely no evidence that this is correct.</p>

<p>There is no way that any other passengers wouldn&#39;t notice the driver shoot JFK and then continue to drive them all own the road and how many kilometers away from the scene?</p>

<p>It is just ridiculous.  Sorry, I&#39;m a target shooter.  I shoot pistols as well.  Its fucking loud and smoke and the smell of a pistol going off anywhere near you, especially in a car you would notice it.</p>

<p>Connolly never says anything about it, he forgot I guess, he didn&#39;t even notice the &quot;murder weapon&quot; in the drivers hand while they drove and before the final shot.</p>

<p>Its a simple thing.  Please rememeber that there are people on the net who are being paid to tell lies and confuse any matter they are able to with a simple sentence.  They type some words, which you can consider their &quot;opinion&quot; only and they try and muddy the waters.  To throw you off track.  Even if you&#39;re still interested, you&#39;ll have a nugget of BS info in the back of your head.  That&#39;s the goal, no certainty.  </p>

<p>THey have admitted here though, that JFK was shot from the front.  That is why the &quot;driver shot JFK&quot; thing has come up lately in the last few years.  They cannot deny he was shot from the front.  Anyone can understand that a bullet from Oswald cannot impact JFK and cause a motion that throws his head backwards.  </p>

<p>So they toss this old juicy one.  Its the simple answer.  A shooter ahead of the car behind the fence, basically up on the grassy knoll.  People did see smoke and people up there.  It wasn&#39;t the best vantage point to check out and yell &quot;Hey there Mr. Prez&quot;.  People were spotted there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;I know <em>exactly</em> what you mean. Let me tell you why you&#39;re here. You&#39;re here because you know something. What you know you can&#39;t explain, but you feel it. You&#39;ve felt it your entire life, that there&#39;s something wrong with the world. You don&#39;t know what it is, but it&#39;s there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I&#39;m talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>I think what I am trying to get at is the &quot;awakening&quot; so many refer to is just another part of the social engineering game. Planting certain themes or seeds in our collective mind in order to harvest the conspiracy culture, perhaps preparation for a future catalyzing event, while at the same time marginalizing it with other forms of media to continually confuse the fuck out of anyone who can&#39;t deal with all the bullshit being thrown around.</p>

<p>In order to get to the core of all that is hidden from us (the truth) you need to study ancient history about Egypt, Sumeria, and Africa. There&#39;s no need to vote cuz all the elected officials are chosen already by bloodlines. No need to pay income tax cuz the Federal Reserve is illegal. Don&#39;t get immunized or flu shots since they are DNA poisons. Fluoride is also poison, I only drink Aquafina since it has the least percentage. Do your best to grow your own veggies and herbs since the market brands are all covered in poisons. Try not to consume anything with Aspertem since that&#39;s another killer. Not only are these things poisonous they are also there to turn us into zombies or robots, numbing our senses to reality. This is why most people cant wake up to what is REALLY going on around them. Read David Icke, Acharya, and Zacharia Sitchin. They explain in GREAT detail the topics I brought up. </p>
