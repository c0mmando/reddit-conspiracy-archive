    <div class="md"><p>I see no mention of the engine they found not belonging to that plane, pictures of further in where there was no plane wreckage, no wings ever found which were &quot;sheered off&quot;, no damage shown to the lawn yet the plane hit low enough to where the bottom of the plane would have been 3-4 feet into the earth to hit so low, or why the wing that got hit was magically abandoned and &quot;under construction.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I believe they talked about it in &#39;Zeitgeist&#39;, actually (which is to be taken with a grain of salt, just like anything else, but still)... The closest match for the engine that they found was one belonging to a cruise missile, not an aircraft.</p>

<p>The video from the gas station across the way (which was very quickly confiscated after the event) seems to support that, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never seen Zeitgeist, however, the moment the &quot;official&quot; report came out from the towers stating that fire weakened/melted the steel beams that held the towers, I did research on my own. Those pesky facts seem to get in the way when you attempt to lie through your teeth, such as the fact that steel is very strong under heat and does not lose structural integrity until right before it melts, being the official story said that jet fuel weakened/melted it and the burning tempurature for jet fuel is VERY much under steel melting point you can easily surmise that the offical story is horse crap. Not mentioning that the towers bellowed black smoke which means the fires inside were oxygen starved which means they were not even burning at full temp. Then to add to all that, ANOTHER building falls right next to them that did NOT get hit by a plane and they say the same story? That building fell with only a small portion of the top on fire, what kind of morons are they pandering to?
So with that in mind suddenly I find out the pentagon states a huge plane flew into a hole only half the size of the plane, there is nearly zero debris from a plane (plane crashes scatter debris for MILES yet this one is disney magically different?) that was flown into a building by a pilot that the instructors said could not even hold a plane steady much less fly it failing his flight training, at about 200-600 mph a mere 1 1/2 ft off the ground without damaging the lawn in any way even though the plane would have to go 3-4 feet into the ground based off of the &quot;top hole&quot; diameter.
You do not need to be a conspiracy moron to put 2 + 2 together and realize that someone else telling you that equals 53 is wrong.</p>

<p>Picture makes a better argument for their not being even a missile there, since there is no fire damage to ANYTHING there - no scorched walls or anything.</p>

<p>Just because the fire didn&#39;t reach that specific spot doesn&#39;t mean a plane didn&#39;t hit there!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why this question is out there is because all the witnesses around the Pentagon who saw the plane saw it on the North side of the then Citgo gas station, now Navy Exchange.  </p>

<p>The plane on the north side does not cause the damage path as proposed but the Gov&#39;t.  What that means is the plane fly over the Pentagon.  A plane on the north side cannot cause the damage path of light poles and generator and path through the building.  </p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t get the plane to fly exactly where they needed it to.  It was close, but not close enough.  So that is why you&#39;ll have all the &quot;detractors&quot; saying the witnesses are lying or were mistaken. </p>

<p>They cannot deny the triangulated position of the plane.  Two Pentagon Police at the Citgo see it fly by north of them, thus north of the station.  The four Arlington National cemetery workers see it fly by south of their position and Sean Boger working in the Pentagon heli-port tower sees it fly right at him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple.  If the plane was not on the south side it cannot cause south side damage at all.  That means only one option is left over.  The plane flew over the building.</p>

<p>Ask me about Keith Wheelhouse.  He makes the story all the more juicy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He pushed a story that ran in some local news papers.  He described a plane that was able to &quot;shadow&quot; AA77 as if it was guiding it into the Pentagon only to turn away at the last moment and fly away.</p>

<p>Its meant to muddy the waters and manipulate two groups of people.  </p>

<p>The first group would be anyone who is skeptical about the event.  It would put a wrench into anyone thinking about how it happened.  Who would shadow AA77 into the building??  Who, what, where and why  Etc. etc.  Just another conspiracy theory.  This is how they undermine our process.  Toss up crazy shit and some people do jump on it and blow it out of proportion.  Hitler said, the greater the lie, the more people will believe it right?  Exactly like the missile theory.</p>

<p>The second group would be anyone who actually saw the plane flying over the building and away.  They needed to fuck with them, as well as ensure that the flyover theory sounds like BS because....the C-130 was in the air too right?  Those stupid people just saw the C-130 that O&#39;Brien flew!  Sheesh.....what a bunch of idiot conspiracy theorists!</p>

<p>Lt. Col. Steve O’Brien flying a C-130 was ordered into the air from Andrews AFB which is only a paltry 10 miles from the Pentagon.  They needed some cover for the Operation.  They needed something else.  O&#39;Brien flew north out of Andrews, turning west over the Washington mall.  Way north of the Pentagon. </p>

<p>The point is, O&#39;Brien was no where near the Pentagon until loooong after the explosion at the Pentagon.  There is video on youtube that shows this.  I&#39;ll try to link to a pic or video later if found.</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is the shadowing of AA77 could not have happened.</p>

<h1>1) O&#39;Brien&#39;s story is totally different than that of a shadowing event.  His flight path is documented and on radar.  Can&#39;t be denied.</h1>

<h1>2) The C-130 is a 4 engine turbo prop, no possible way it was able to keep up to a jet liner like a 757.</h1>

<p>So, long story short......the critical detail to think about and that just adds to the whole bullshit around 9/11 is, why would this story even exist?  Why and how could it happen?  It&#39;s definitely not possible.</p>

<p>It simply shows how far they have gone in order to confuse things and to put people off their tracks.  Besides WTC7, I think the Pentagon flyover is one of the most damning bits to the OT.  It is very simple, but it has been very hard to understand because or reoccurring BS about missiles impacts or that global hawk BS.  </p>

<p>Look how hard they work on your guys.  You have to realize how hard they are working to keep you ignorant.  They pour unknown amounts of money into the operation and then who knows how much to keep it confusing and just out of reach.  How can people see what is going on with those crazy conspiracy theorists and their crazy theories right?  We&#39;re the easy scapegoat right now.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s coming to an end though.  We have them, and they know it.  It is only a matter of time.  People need to push hard and talk to people.  It&#39;s only your life and your future.  They are breaking ALL the rules in order to control you.  They don&#39;t live by the rules you and I do in life.  They will do anything to control and manipulate.</p>

<p>The sooner we all realize this, the sooner we will all stand up and ensure it cannot happen again.  Remove them by any means, preferably non-violently.  We have to be better than they are.  They use caveman tactics, we have to be smarter.</p>

<p>OK, that turned out to be a long one.  Thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The overwhelming evidence supports the official story that a plane hit the pentagon.  The few left who still cling to a conspiracy regarding a missile or otherwise &quot;not a plane&quot; do so only due to ignorance.  They dismiss all <a href="http://www.rense.com/general32/phot.htm">photographic</a>, <a href="http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/911_pentagon_eyewitnesses.html">eyewitness</a>, and first responder testimony.  They want a video confirming their theory, but they would hate to actually see a video of a plane hitting the pentagon, because it unravels their entire theory surrounding the controlling party that pulled it off.  One would think that 9 years ought to be enough for anyone to come to a reasonable conclusion regarding those events due to the high amount of scrutiny the &quot;official story&quot; has been put under.  But no, after 9 years, still reaching for desperate straws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t release the videos because:</p>

<p>a) The majority of the population believe their story, so there is no point. </p>

<p>b) The videos are all &#39;classified&#39; since they depict the Pentagon, and so the order to release those videos would have to come from very high up and the bureaucracy would first of all have to review all the videos and de-classify  them, this would cost time and money.</p>

<p>c) The people high up don&#39;t care about a few loony conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>d) Even if they were released, those loony conspiracy theorists wouldn&#39;t believe them anyway and just claim they were &#39;shopped (like the NASA Moonlandings etc).</p>

<p>Hell, the 9/11 commission saw the failures themselves.  But you would rather believe the lies than the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see no mention of the engine they found not belonging to that plane, pictures of further in where there was no plane wreckage, no wings ever found which were &quot;sheered off&quot;, no damage shown to the lawn yet the plane hit low enough to where the bottom of the plane would have been 3-4 feet into the earth to hit so low, or why the wing that got hit was magically abandoned and &quot;under construction.&quot; 
If you are going to conspiracy theorize, you need to bring it much harder than just some structural pics ;P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so it&#39;s not from where the plane impacted and was on fire? Gee sounds exactly like what I just said. </p>

<p>Picture makes a better argument for their not being even a missile there, since there is no fire damage to ANYTHING there - no scorched walls or anything.</p>

<p>Just because the fire didn&#39;t reach that specific spot doesn&#39;t mean a plane didn&#39;t hit there!</p>
