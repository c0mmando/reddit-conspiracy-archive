       More and more we hear about government agencies using Facebook to track down criminal suspects, and using information submitted to Facebook as evidence against suspects in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it also seems like every day FB introduces more insidious "features" to its site to make the personal details of your life public for the sake of "convenience."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if our governments have
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       to do with the development of Facebook, does it worry you that your local law enforcement agency is using Facebook to track you?

       Idk. The twitter platform always seemed so over-the-top self centered. Fuck twitter. If I want to know what you're doing, I'll ask you. If I want you to know what I'm doing, I'll tell you. I don't understand the whole follower/followee mentality. Morons I say.

       It certainly has not started for that purpose, but that does not mean that it is not going in that direction now. Information constitutes power nowadays. Facebook is great at collecting this information and offering it in a format that is very usable for businesses/governments/other organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does bother me a bit but you need to remember that it is your right and should be your priority not to disclose the information on the web that you do not want ANYONE to have access to. It requires discipline but it is a simple internet rule to live by.

       While it is (currently) our responsibility to control what information gets put up on FB, it worries me that Facebook seems like it's exactly how a "New World Order" would chisel away our privacy one chunk at a time. I think the old cause for inspiring tinfoil-hat panic was subdermal microchips, but why bother with that when they can put such a friendly mask over its face to keep people from revolting in the streets?
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like those in our respective governments at the very minimum look at Facebook as a prototype for the new era without privacy or anonymity.

       always think about nature of the content you are about to post and whether you feel comfortable for anyone to view it. if not, then you should reconsider posting it.

       It wouldn't surprise me. I'm sure that government agencies would have a backdoor into Facebook so they can bypass privacy settings to view profiles.

       What people never seem to understand is that going through THAT MUCH data would require a massive amount of manpower.  So yes, a database like this would be useful if you fucked up and they needed info on you.  But they simply do not have the manpower to browse through accounts looking for infractions/generating a file on each of us.

       What do I think?  I think facebook is a 'cool idea' created by some college kids which really caught on.  Now it is a cash cow for them, and for everyone else it is a means in which to know every detail about their loved ones lives.

       As a deputy with the Marshal's Office in my home city, I use facebook to successfully locate 25% or more of the fugitives that I apprehend on a daily basis. I'm amazed at how many people have their entire (detailed) profile wide open for everyone to see, yet they seemed shocked when I show up to their P.O.E. and arrest them.

       I think it's much more likely the government cozy-ed up to the kids who started it, and they're happy to let them do whatever.

       I highly doubt its being used by the government for that purpose.  Census workers who attempted to use Facebook instead of going door-to-door were fired, and other workers were sent out to do re-do the information.  Maybe in the future, but not right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for other government agencies, I have known social workers to use Facebook to track their kids - its not policy by any means, but it has been allowed in my area.
