       A question for those who believe the official story. Did the terrorists expect the WTC towers to collapse by running planes into them, or did they just get really lucky? The towers were designed to withstand the impact of a large airplane, why would the terrorists think any differently? I would really like to hear a response to this.

       That's a great question!
These are supposedly the same people who figured they could bring a plane down by lighting their shoes on fire...  Oh yea and also the super villain that lit his underwear on fire.  Remember to thank him each time you're treated like cattle while waiting in a 40 minute line at the airport.  The population is waking up to the fact that the U.S. has slaughtered millions of innocent Iraqi men, women and children because of the biggest lie in the history of the world.  Tell a friend

       From what i remember, the towers were designed to take a lot.  Including "multiple airliner impacts" and hurricane force winds.

       If i were to slam a plane into a building i'd expect to kill a bunch of people and scare the shit out of the rest.

       I'm not really certain. Near as I can tell, that subreddit's headlines all sound like Jr. High School kids thinking they're cool using the word "derp" a lot. So, if I were a shill, I think I'd be ashamed to have inspired that subreddit -- kind of like an embarrassing side effect of all my evil deeds in this one coming back to haunt me in that one.

       You're mistaken. I am unaware of any Glenn Beck fans in my subreddit. Anti-Glenn Beck submisisons are quite popular there and don't attract trolls like the anti-Alex Jones, anti-Ron Paul, and anti-9/11 Truther submissions do. I have even created a
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/db6xr/glenn_beck/">
        Glenn Beck thread
       </a>
       collecting links about him. Its not as thorough as the 9/11 truth thread. This is about as thorough as I want it to be. I plan on eventually putting threads together for other conspiratard types including Lew Rockwell, Michael Savage, Cynthia McKinney, etc. Right now I'm just slowly piecing this stuff together.

       I think I got this one covered. See... since we can't explain it... and since the buildings are now LITERALLY dust... we can say, with reasonable certainty, that there
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       have been such a design flaw, even if we're unable to explain, specifically, what it was. I mean, afterall, that's the nature of a "hidden" flaw - no one knows what it was. This obvious fact is what would have been used to seal the 9/11 commission's report, if they had not come to an equally logical and factual conclusion without it.

       Right. All they had to do was crash a plane into the building, connect siphon hoses to the fuel tanks, flood all the remaining fuel down this shaft to the basement, then... after all that... it only takes one match to bring ... wait... those planes exploded on impact, didn't they?

       Yeah not so much a design flaw, as simply not being designed to withstand being hit by an airliner. Supposedly no skyscraper in existence could survive such an attack, but the Towers collapsed especially quickly because of a lack of fireproofing and use of a relatively light steel for much of the structure.

       Erm. I'm 47 years old and I'm pretty certain I heard (for about 30 of those years) that the WTC towers were designed to withstand MULTIPLE impacts from airliners (multiple 747 impacts to
       <em>
        each
       </em>
       tower).
      </p>
      <p>
       The counter argument to this (that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be reciting) is "yeah, but they weren't designed to withstand impacts from 767's, which is what hit them on 9/11".

       Yes, I did read what the original poster asked. In fact, I'm the one who suggested he post his question in r/conspiratard, where people such as you are purported to be lurking these days, so that he might reach a broader audience which isn't outnumbered (as in this subreddit).
      </p>
      <p>
       I was NOT, as you suggest, wondering how it was possible. In fact, I was one of the extreme minority who, upon G.W. Bush's winning in the
       <strong>
        primary
       </strong>
       of 2000, knew he was going to lead this nation to war against Iraq at any cost. And, when I watched the WTC towers crumble to dust on live television, I knew (unlike you) that Bush and his cronies (primarily Rove, Cheney, and Rumsfeld) were complicit in this event (although likely not the actual orchestrators - more like enablers). I do remember Kenya and the Cole, as well as a whole list of
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#As_pretexts_for_war">
        false flag operations as pretexts for war
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I following the trail of verifiable evidence? Yes. Do I believe the 9/11 commission report? No.

       And, for what it's worth, I've vowed to downvote any juvenile who uses "derp (or any of its variants)" as a means of inflamatory rhetorical interaction.

       Take it from a United Kingdom resident that terrorists, and terrorist attacks, are real. We suffered several decades of terrorist attacks in both Northern Ireland and England from Irish nationalists. Who were, by the way, funded at least in part by donations from American citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do those with an invested interest in engendering an attitude of fear consciously hype the danger and keep the paranoia levels artificially high? Yes, of course they do. However having the threat exploited does not mean the threat is not real.

       The very real terrorism wrought upon England by the likes of the IRA et.al. was a very real and tangible threat, unlike these political theatrics of the Americans. Since 9/11, we've been told to hate Muslims because they "hate our freedom" etc. This is what I refer to when I make light of the phony terrorist threat and the forebodingly-named War on Terror, which is nothing more than a way for these vultures to spend their money.

       If you would like to argue the facts you are welcome to try again. The scientific paper I linked to shows proof of a high tech thermite being found on site.

       That paper doesn't prove that there was thermite at the WTC you liar. That paper couldn't pass peer-review, which is why Jones had it published in a vanity journal. Stephen Jones found sulfur, a common component in dry wall. Please take your lies elsewhere.

       That paper came out years ago. I'm not reading it again. There is no debate. You are wrong and this "movement" that you are in is actually a cult. It would be for your own benefit if you realized just how wrong you are sooner than later.

       You posted a paper that was written by a scientist who couldn't get his paper through the rigors of peer review. I'm no scientist but it doesn't take a scientist to tell you just how stupid of a theory this is. Your boy Jones' theory would require teams to go into the WTC, and remove the drywall/fireproofing/etc to install TONS of thermite while going undetected. Don't you see just how preposterous this theory of yours is? And since I was mentioning dry wall, that's probably where your boy Jones got his "thermite" from. Read on for more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to get into specifics about this paper. I read it a long time ago, and don't have any interest in reading a discredited professor's paper again. Besides, I'm not a scientist so who am I to judge a scientific paper? That is something that is best left to the world's scientific community, and they have rejected the likes of Jones over and over again. I suppose that means that they're part of the conspiracy, too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Below is an excellent resource that deals with Stephen Jones and his thermite claims. Before you go and start knocking the credentials source I'm about to post, remember that I have peer-reviewed sources that explain the collapse of the WTC and you don't. Also keep in mind that Mark Roberts backs up all of his claims with sources.

       Give me a break. His paper was published in a
       <strong>
        Vanity Journal
       </strong>
       . There was no sufficient peer review, since it is not required for publication in the Bentham rag.

       That's only links to some forum post.

      <p>
       Do you have a link to an academic paper that responds to and contradicts the finding of large amounts of termite in the dust at the WTC site after the September 11, 2001 attacks?  Because, I don't believe such a paper exist.  And, if you can't find it, I'm going to have to continue to believe it doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a double standard when you piss on an academic journal that you have never read, but then link to blogs and forums that written by anonymous people to spite it.  The way science works is someone publishes the results of an experiment and others test the experiment and publish those results.  No results are published that contradict the finding of thermite.

       One of those other academic papers you link, "Single Point of Failure: How the Loss of One Column May Have Led to the Collapse of WTC 7," follows the formula of if A happened, the B may've happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The others have no evidence to support them.  The thermite paper has dust samples collected from NYC that were analyzed.  The other WTC papers build theories to modal the events, without presenting any evidence.

       Yawn.  The pseudo skeptic crowd suffer from the same problems that you would say that the conspiracy crowd does with your "conspiratard" subreddit.  You read the forums and it quickly degrades into nonsense.  Those blogs that you link to are just link after link of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the stuff on the conspiracy subreddit is nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, government corruption, propaganda, and disinformation are very real.  They also have the added benefit of being mildly interesting and even important.  But, I haven't found anything interesting on the JREF forum.  It's armchair skepticism minus the critical thinking, that always supports the official government point of view, regardless of how absurd it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the post on
       <a href="http://forums.randi.org/archive/index.php/t-1077.html">
        JREF about WMD in 2003
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I can show you posts from me on a usenet news groups from 2002 talking about Iraq and I deconstruct how the evidence at that time is BS.  I can send you a link to those.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if you look at my post and compare it to JREF at the same time, you will see that I was correct, and JREF is absurd groupthink.
      </p>
      <p>
       The something will prove true when the truth about the September 11 attacks is known and taken for granted.  You will be able to go back and look at the JREF forums, and they will look like morons.

       Well banned weapons HAVE been found, and all of the reports leading up to the war indicated that Saddam's stockpile was even worse! Anthrax, for example, is easily reproduced and Saddam was known to have a lot of it back in the 1990s. The weapons that the Bush Administration thought were there were never found, but other banned (mostly old and inert) weapons
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       found. What happened to the weapons? I think three possibilities.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        They really were destroyed, and the weapons program abandoned
       </li>
       <li>
        Saddam destroyed/hid them, or moved them out of the country in the days before the war
       </li>
       <li>
        They are well hidden and still somewhere in Iraq
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are some good things that sometimes get overlooked that came out of this. First and foremost is the oil for food corruption was exposed. Also we have seen a dictator removed from power and a potentially long-term democratic US ally in what is now a hotbed of irrational/extremist politics. Is it worth the cost? History will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways... You be right and be wrong at the same time.  Unfortunately for the truthers they are the types that are always wrong and almost never right! I'll just remind you that there are
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       credible experts on the side of the 9/11 truthers and the truthers have no evidence to support their assertions!

       Ha, if Iraq was a democracy they would have kicked the US out a long fucking time ago. It's called nation building, they remove politicians they don't agree with and replace them with ones that they do, regardless of what the population wants.

       Those all seem to link to JREF.  That means that you agree that there is no academic assessment of the dust from the September 11, 2001 attacks in NYC that contradicts the finding of thermite.  You're welcome.

       Supposedly Bin Laden himself was surprised at how successful the attacks were, so I doubt he thought the towers would collapse. I don't know what the actual planner, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, thought. But he was a mechanical engineering graduate, and very methodical and disciplined. Hard to say.

       For anyone that's still confused about this issue I recommend checking out the JREF forum. There is a wealth of material there for you to look at. Here is a link:

       My basic take on it is as follows. Many thousands of engineers and scientists watched those buildings collapse right along with the rest of the world. Many of them have done detailed analysis of the collapse mechanism, and written about it in detail. Only a very few, such as people like Richard Gage from AE for 911 Truth, claim that it was a govt conspiracy, and all of their claims have been shown to be unscientific and not backed up by any physical evidence. In fact, there is 0 physical evidence to support the controlled demolition theory. Even WTC 7 can be easily explained through conventional physics. If you still think the buildings were brought down by controlled demolition you either haven't looked at the evidence or have some other agenda.

       Buildings do not fall into themselves. It is the most basic of physics. You can burn it all you want, you can melt it all you want, chop it up all you want; a building WILL NOT COLLAPSE in that manner.

       You're mistaken. I am unaware of any Glenn Beck fans in my subreddit. Anti-Glenn Beck submisisons are quite popular there and don't attract trolls like the anti-Alex Jones, anti-Ron Paul, and anti-9/11 Truther submissions do. I have even created a
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/db6xr/glenn_beck/">
        Glenn Beck thread
       </a>
       collecting links about him. Its not as thorough as the 9/11 truth thread. This is about as thorough as I want it to be. I plan on eventually putting threads together for other conspiratard types including Lew Rockwell, Michael Savage, Cynthia McKinney, etc. Right now I'm just slowly piecing this stuff together.

       Indeed.

       The very real terrorism wrought upon England by the likes of the IRA et.al. was a very real and tangible threat, unlike these political theatrics of the Americans. Since 9/11, we've been told to hate Muslims because they "hate our freedom" etc. This is what I refer to when I make light of the phony terrorist threat and the forebodingly-named War on Terror, which is nothing more than a way for these vultures to spend their money.
