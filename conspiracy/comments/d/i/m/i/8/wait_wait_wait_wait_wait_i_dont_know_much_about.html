    <div class="md"><p>I was watching this thread and wondered how long it would take the anti semetic card to be played, its usually instantaneous. Anyway, its not off topic. The demonizing of Ahmadinejad and Iran comes directly from the Zionist controlled US govt and media. I dont see how anyone can come to any other conclusion. Iran is no threat to the United States in any way, do some research and see if you can find the last time they attacked anyone. Then compare that to the record of the US and Israel. But they are a (perceived) threat to Israel and Israels desire to dominate the middle east. </p>

<p>The domination of the US govt by the Israeli lobby is undeniable. And the total domination of upper management and ownership of media, both news and entertainment, is also undeniable. But pointing these things out along with any criticism of Israel is somehow anti semetic. Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two very broad reasons:
1:  He represents a particularly horrid regime.  With all the human rights abuses, treaty and international law violations and corruption.  Iran isn&#39;t even popular with other fundamentalist Islamic countries, I mean Saudi Arabia has agreed to stand down their air defenses to let Israel bomb them.</p>

<p>2:  He frequently makes speeches of much more inflammatory nature.  Calling for the destruction of Israel, denying the holocaust, calling for the destruction of the west in general, the US, UK and Israel in particular.</p>

<p>Long story short, he&#39;s got most of the world pissed off at both the regime he represents and him personally.  UN delegates would probably have left no mater what he said, they&#39;re just sick of his $@*%.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t believe that it is a bed of roses, there are dozens of far worse regimes out there.</p>

<p>It seems pretty obvious that Iran is getting a lot more stick than it deserves, and it is also pretty obvious the reasons why.</p>

<p>The whole situation is unfair, really, as Iran is not a warlike country, and I believe would be open to diplomacy and reasonableness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pity that neither Israel nor the USA has tried this approach with any seriousness: it seemed to pay dividends with the infinitely more crazy North Korea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of the reason they get so much stick is we don&#39;t have any carrots with them.  Iran is freaking rich compared to most of the world and reasonably self sufficient.</p>

<p>North Korea is starving, Iran exports food.
North Korea gets almost all of its fuel as aid from foreign governments, Iran has the world&#39;s second largest reserves of natural gas and third largest reserves of oil.</p>

<p>North Korea also has China backing them.  Iran sometimes has Russia being slightly more open to negotiation.</p>

<p>North Korea has such abyssmaly poor products that their own government uses products from Japan or the States rather than risk it.  Iran is able to export goods that compete favorably in several markets.</p>

<p>While both countries have nuclear ambitions and poor relations with the West, North Korea is dependant on aid and must negotiate or starve.  Iran is actualy in a position to just ride out the sanctions</p>
