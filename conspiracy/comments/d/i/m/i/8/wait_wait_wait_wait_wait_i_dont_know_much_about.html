       The important thing is WHY he is smeared. The demonizing of a country is often done to get people riled up in a prelude to war. I suspect the only reason Iran hasnt been attacked thus far is that the United States of Israel is at or near bankruptcy economically.

       I was watching this thread and wondered how long it would take the anti semetic card to be played, its usually instantaneous. Anyway, its not off topic. The demonizing of Ahmadinejad and Iran comes directly from the Zionist controlled US govt and media. I dont see how anyone can come to any other conclusion. Iran is no threat to the United States in any way, do some research and see if you can find the last time they attacked anyone. Then compare that to the record of the US and Israel. But they are a (perceived) threat to Israel and Israels desire to dominate the middle east.
      </p>
      <p>
       The domination of the US govt by the Israeli lobby is undeniable. And the total domination of upper management and ownership of media, both news and entertainment, is also undeniable. But pointing these things out along with any criticism of Israel is somehow anti semetic. Wake up.

       Two very broad reasons:
1:  He represents a particularly horrid regime.  With all the human rights abuses, treaty and international law violations and corruption.  Iran isn't even popular with other fundamentalist Islamic countries, I mean Saudi Arabia has agreed to stand down their air defenses to let Israel bomb them.
      </p>
      <p>
       2:  He frequently makes speeches of much more inflammatory nature.  Calling for the destruction of Israel, denying the holocaust, calling for the destruction of the west in general, the US, UK and Israel in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, he's got most of the world pissed off at both the regime he represents and him personally.  UN delegates would probably have left no mater what he said, they're just sick of his $@*%.

       Yeah, because he's so sane. Or maybe because he's continuing to try to con the world into leaving Iran alone until

       The protest looks pretty preplaned, but the US really can't be said to be in a controling position over most of the participants.  Couldn't even convince most of them to go to Iraq.

       Yeah, anyone who translates nuclear energy as nuclear weapon should lose their job as a translater, but poor translation only covers a small amount of the statements he has made over his career.

      <p>
       The countries that walked out did show disrespect to both the UN and Iran, and the protest would apear to be preplaned, independent of what Ahmadinejad actualy said.  At least none of them decided to bang their shoes on the tables.

       It seems pretty obvious that Iran is getting a lot more stick than it deserves, and it is also pretty obvious the reasons why.

       The whole situation is unfair, really, as Iran is not a warlike country, and I believe would be open to diplomacy and reasonableness.

       It's a pity that neither Israel nor the USA has tried this approach with any seriousness: it seemed to pay dividends with the infinitely more crazy North Korea.

       Part of the reason they get so much stick is we don't have any carrots with them.  Iran is freaking rich compared to most of the world and reasonably self sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea is starving, Iran exports food.
North Korea gets almost all of its fuel as aid from foreign governments, Iran has the world's second largest reserves of natural gas and third largest reserves of oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea also has China backing them.  Iran sometimes has Russia being slightly more open to negotiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea has such abyssmaly poor products that their own government uses products from Japan or the States rather than risk it.  Iran is able to export goods that compete favorably in several markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       While both countries have nuclear ambitions and poor relations with the West, North Korea is dependant on aid and must negotiate or starve.  Iran is actualy in a position to just ride out the sanctions

       They dont "worship a different kind of Islam". They all worship the One God, but have political differences.

       That's because Saudi's are Arabs and speak Arabic (ie: Semitic). The Iranians are Persians and speak Farsi (ie: Arian). Completely different history and culture./

       Since these "political differences" are completely inseparable from their different religious preferences then I think that it is safe for me to say "worship a different kind of Islam".  I suppose that this just goes on and on while we debate about what the difference between a religion and a culture is as these people agree that they don't really like each other that much.

       I'm not one that believes that the US is behind 9/11 but the reason is such a big deal is because he said it in the UN to the faces of the US delegation. If they say it in their country to their people in their country it's not news, but when it's here, it's news.

       Please, I don't think it's "Jew Hating".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more like "Hating those who disparage, dispossess and murder  civilians with impunity", which is not all Jews, nor all Israelis, nor even all Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a whole lot of them do seem to like that sort of thing.

       Wait wait wait wait wait... I don't know much about Kim Jong-Il, but is it taboo to like him? The whole 'speaking truth to power' idea has me rooting for him. Can someone please educate me?

       Kim Jong Il does things like starve large chunks of his population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran is probably a pretty nice place to live for most of its population.

       I really don't think that they are comparable.

       It means the link is new. The vote stats aren't revealed until the post has been up for 30 minutes. This is done to discourage voting up or down on something based solely on its popularity.

       Since these "political differences" are completely inseparable from their different religious preferences then I think that it is safe for me to say "worship a different kind of Islam".  I suppose that this just goes on and on while we debate about what the difference between a religion and a culture is as these people agree that they don't really like each other that much.

       You mean the whole Mossadegh/Shah thing? I suppose you're right. I wonder what happened with that popular uprising last year...

       Possibly Costa Rica, probably not any of the EU, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand.

       The protest looks pretty preplaned, but the US really can't be said to be in a controling position over most of the participants.  Couldn't even convince most of them to go to Iraq.
