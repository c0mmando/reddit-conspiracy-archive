       I showed this to my mom, who was 12 and living in Dallas at the time of the "intervention." She said it was a bit of a running joke that they were going to have a TV in class "in order to watch the President get assassinated." A 12 year old girl knew what was going on, how the hell come we don't.

       As for Judyth, I find her story extraordinary. It's easy to dismiss what she says, but there are a few things that are hard to dismiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       It stretches credulity to think it is coincidence that she made up the term "Big Event" by chance and then years later E Howard Hunt on his death bed reveals that the running code phrase for the Kennedy coup was the "Big Event". I have been unable to find any reference to the phrase "big event" as the code name for the Kennedy coup besides Judyth Baker and E. Howard Hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extra-ordinary claims require solid evidence. Although there is heated debate on the veracity of Judyth's story, even her discreditors admit that she can prove the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         She lived and worked in New Orleans in the spring and summer of 1963. Both she and Oswald arrived in New Orleans by bus in April and left New Orleans in September. Both she and Oswald moved into apartments the same week, within walking distance of each other. Both she and Oswald rode the same bus to and from the same workplace daily for eleven weeks, with only one bus stop between them.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She was indeed a promising student with a passion for cancer research, as is evidenced by numerous contemporary newspaper articles.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She worked in the same company as Lee Harvey Oswald, the Reily Coffee Company, and was hired on exactly the same date as Lee Harvey Oswald by the same small sub-company of Reily's, Standard Coffee Co. Both were subsequently transferred to Reily's one week later. An ad to replace her at Reily's was ordered the day Oswald was fired from Reily's, and she was terminated the same day Oswald was arrested (August 9, 1963) in New Orleans after he handed out pro-Cuban pamphlets. (Judyth asserts the jobs at Reily were a front for their covert activities, arranged by Dr. Ochsner and his allies. A probability study by statistics professor Dr. John Williams, published in The Dealey Plaza Echo in 2006, with a second supporting article published in 2007, concluded that statistically these events could not have occurred by chance.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         She moved back to Florida the same week that Oswald moved back to Dallas.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After the JFK assassination her promising career as a researcher abruptly ended. (Judyth's explanation is that she was told to keep a low profile and stay silent.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Contemporary witnesses corroborate that Judyth and Lee Oswald knew each other and were lovers.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In 2003 British TV producer Nigel Turner made 3 new episodes in his series "The men who killed Kennedy", which aired in England and the USA on the History Channel. One of the episodes, titled "The Love Affair" was dedicated to Judyth's story. Shortly thereafter protests were applied on The History Channel targeting one of the other two episodes, specifically "The Guilty Men" that focused on the alleged involvement of former president and JFK successor Lyndon Baines Johnson. The complaints were led by Johnson's widow, ex-presidents Ford and Carter, and former LBJ aides Jack Valenti and Bill Moyers. An anonymous party bought the rights from The History Channel, including the rights for "The Love Affair" (
       <strong>
        although it was not attacked
       </strong>
       ) and the programs were never aired again in America.
