       Just think about how you "demolish" a building for say.. A 'vegas' style free fall approach.
       <br/>
       You would need to go in and do it before hand.  (It would take probably a month or longer to get rigged properly. )
      </p>
      <p>
       It was done in front of everybody.  (You see somebody working on a building and your pretty much clueless aren't you? )
       <br/>
       Now, DOWNVOTE me because I am not using PERFECT grammar or something..
       <br/>
       Just look at it like this. ..  THERE IS NO WAY EVER! THAT A BUILDING CAN FALL THE WAY IT DID BY A FIRE!!  LET ALONE 3!  WHY DONT YOU EXPLAIN HOW A BUILDING CAN COLLAPSE UNDER ITS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE 'top' DOWN, at free fall speed!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I DONT GIVE A SHIT IF IM USING 'CAPITALS'  or that I DONT SOUND LIKE A NERD OR SOMETHING.. IM SO SICK OF PEOPLE THAT USE THE WORD ' CONSPIRACY THEORIST' ..... All that word is doing is putting the blinders over fact and reason.  The word in itself "ommits" fear and distrust..  Don't let THAT WORD shut you down as a thinker.

       Which one of the three buildings are you asking about? I'm not sure all conspiracy theorists are qualified to be building demolition experts so a little interested in your question, as it seems to be baiting.

       I always figured they were planted all around the buildings and were done in the days before 9/11 when a bunch of training excercises occurred where all the employees were made to leave the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       OK I can accept both towers had explosives in them, and both buildings were hit.. but then why does WTC7 fall? Was another plane SUPPOSED to hit it? WTC7 literally fell over on it's own..
      </p>
      <p>
       No video of plane hitting pentagon, no wreckage from plane that was supposedly taken back by the passengers...
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much stuff not investigated, it might not be a conspiracy but the governments resistance to look into 9/11 is strange. Wouldn't you assume the government would want to know EXACTLY what happened?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and has everyone forgotten that Cheney/Bush/Rumsfeld all got away with everything they did? No war crimes trials, no slap on the hand, no nothing. Our country is really a joke. You can tell the citizens whatever you want even if it completely goes against logic.

       Pssst The media does its job well, it is hard to believe people actually still pay for their "stories
" they call news.

      <p>
       Moving the ideology of the people since 1915, and still today nearly 100 years later the dopey ones go straight to the water cooler and regurgitate the disinformation. America is doomed because people just don't get it
      </p>
      <p>
       U.S. Congressional Record February 9, 1917, page 2947
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. CALLAWAY: “In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States".
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. CALLAWAY: “These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers".

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The CIA begins recruiting American news organisations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA's media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA's own admission, at least 25 organisations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The CIA ran it for 30 years in house, it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 companies, and the dissemination and disinformation continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever they say is taken to the water cooler and made gospel by many people who just don't get it.

      <p>
       .....And 75 Years later
      </p>
      <p>
       'We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practised in past centuries."

       Do the research yourself the evidence is out there. Noone should ever do research for you. It essentially comes down to the experts vs the naive when you look at it deductively. There are 200 al qaeda members left in Afghanistan, but why are we still there? A lot of things in this world doesn't make sense when you look at it logically. There is no reason to subscribe to stupidity and relish in ignorance. Science is absolute it is the pinnacle of our understanding and if scientific evidence points to an idea contrary to what a majority thinks take notice! If the idea is tested and peer reviewed for authenticity and turns out to be credible it is safe to say that they are wrong. And it's perfectly fine. Don't be afraid of reason. The physics is there. It's simple Newtonian mechanics and inorganic chemistry. Steel has a specific heat capacity that is greater than that of an average office fire even in hypoxic conditions. All object fall at specific speeds in free fall on earth complimentary to air resistance. (9.8m/s

       Good luck with this.  Expect several posts explaining how Zionists are to blame for everything, several long winded evasions about NIST not testing for a hypothetical explosive that hasn't been demonstrated, and how "its not our job to figure out how', just assassinate peoples characters...because we think they are crypto jews.

       I can appreciate, regardless of the fact that I wholeheartedly disagree with, conspiratorial opinions surrounding the non-physical events of 9/11. What I can't understand is anyone watching the video evidence of the collapses of the two WTC towers and believing that they were the result of some sort of controlled demolition. Hence, my specific question about only the physical aspect of what happened. But you're right, no rational answers will be forthcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, this is an issue I should just avoid. I just spent at least 20 minutes watching the towers fall all over again. Every time I see it my heart just sinks. But it's so frustrating reading idiots opine about unsupportable theories when the evidence is so plain. It makes me even sadder...

       Neil Bush (W's brother) ran the security company that worked for the WTC.  They had the access and reports state that there was work being done in the months leading up to 9/11.  I am not saying that is what happened I am just saying that is part of the justification people use.

       The explosives were likely placed on multiple floors spanning the bottom 1/4 of the building at least.  They were attatched diagonally across the central beams running the length of the WTC core, so as to cause a sheer effect that would ensure the rapid collapse.

       Demolition experts are professionals (who can be bought off or serve as consultants to other people with no compunctions) who are very knowledgeable as to techniques that will collapse a building from the top floors to the bottom sequentially.  They use explosive devices that are timed to be detonated in the appropriate sequence to do this.  When the planes struck the buildings-- whether or not steered to the target by remote pilot technology-- the first of the explosive devices located at the target level were triggered, and then the subsequent explosive devices were triggered one  by one moving down the height of the buildings.

       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WYdAJQV100&amp;amp;feature=related">
        video
       </a>
       in which Larry Silverstein, the leaseholder of the World Trade Center, is interviewed.  He speaks about his decision to "pull" Building 7, because he claims there was a thought to be a chance the fire in that building couldn't be contained.  If you watch any videos of these supposedly uncontrollable fires, you'll see this claim is ludicrous, because the fires were tiny.  There are numerous videos on YouTube and elsewhere that show that, in fact, that what was done-- Building 7 was "pulled".  The story, however was changed along the way, and those who are complicit in the attempt to fool the people of the US and the world now deny that Building 7 was brought down through the use of explosives.  One reason for the change in the story is pretty obvious.  Larry shot his mouth off when he said, "...You know, we've had such terrible loss of life.  Maybe the smartest thing to do is just pull it.  And they
       <em>
        (the fire department)
       </em>
       , made that decision to pull, uh, and then we watched the building collapse...."  What Larry didn't think of is that there wouldn't have been sufficient time between the planes flying into the two towers and the collapse of Building 7 for a demolition crew to come to the site, enter Building 7, put explosive charges in all the places necessary, wire them, and then detonate them to implode Building 7.  Once the question is raised as to the possibility Building 7 was wired before September 11 in order to "pull it", the idea might enter people's minds that the other two buildings were also prepared ahead of time to bring them down, as well.

       First of all, have YOU actually watched a video of these buildings collapsing?  Had they been due to the planes, unless they hit exactly, and I mean EXACTLY, dead in the center of the buildings, they would have started to collapse to one side rather than straight down.  Basically, the scenario that is offered by using the planes as a justification for the collapse is that (1) they sheered all of the supports upon impact, which would have started a collapse immediately, or (2) the intense heat from the burning jet fuel caused all of the supports to UNIFORMLY melt and deform SIMULTANEOUSLY as to cause a direct descent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither one of these suppositions is within the realm of possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is the fact that the buildings fell down at free fall acceleration.

       Also, I forgot to mention this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look very closely, and I mean VERY closely, when the building starts to collapse, you see the radio tower on the top dip down slightly before the rest of the building collapses.  This is evidence (as you can see from any controlled demolition), of the CORE supports giving out.  Not to any one particular side, but straight down the middle so the whole thing collapses down and in.

       lol... There were plenty of opportunities for the culpits to plant the devices needed to bring down the towers! They had crews working around the clock on upgrading the various alarm and security systems for months prior to 911! This require access to areas that would have allowed for the planting of devices, and with remote detonation, the need for conspicuous tell-tale wiring was all but eliminated! I don't have time nor can i link to the various news reports reporting on this due to where I work! Do the research for yourself, it's not hard to find!
