        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was watching MTV Jams this morning, and noticed something. I wondered if anyone here has noticed the narrowing &quot;theme&quot; of hip-hop in general. The first video that I saw &quot;Get Big&quot; by &quot;Dorrough&quot; had lyrics that said in a halting tone &quot;you ain&#39;t got. enough. money.&quot; which was the focus of the entire song. Half the video featured US Dollars on-screen. 
The next video was titled &quot;Money in the bank&quot; and featured a sexy woman dancing in front of glistening gold and US Dollars.
From the billboard top 100 for 2010 (or any year, really.) I challenge you to find 20 that do <strong>not</strong> mention money and/or <em>getting</em> money.
Hip-hop has always had a sort of &quot;bragging&quot; element to it, but this seems more focused than in the past. Everything that is broadcast is thought about. There is no such thing as entertainment with <strong>no</strong> message.
Maybe I&#39;m reading into it too much. What do you think? I&#39;m not sure what to call it, but something IS going on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats my favorite game but i have never got one because its pretty much impossible. And one thing they forget in monopoly is once you beat your competition new comers are in so its imposible to ever have a monopoly unless you use government.</p>

<p>The reason they talk about money so much isnt because they are all promting the illuminati, alot these fags do it because they have no artistic talent, and they follow what ever jay-z is doing.</p>

<p>Rappers today are controlled but many of them might not even know it. While top rappers like jay-z sign there souls away in blood then rap then puting up the eye of horus everwhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rap has always had a narrow focus. For a while it was about empowerment/overcoming &quot;the struggle&quot;.</p>

<p>Then in the 90s it was about killing robbing and being a gangsta.</p>

<p>Then the bling bling era of money cars and jewelry started to dominate.</p>

<p>Now there is actually a large focus on dancing/hoes dancing in the club and still the bling bling money/stuntin aspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its even more narrow when you get into the main stream Latino rap.  I can&#39;t tell you how many videos that I saw down in Nicaragua where there is some sort of cheesy lighted backdrop and some guys standing there.  The screen is moving around about every three quarters of a second with hot chicks quickly placed in there.  I know that US rap has an element of that but every damn video was like that.  Also I felt like I was going to have an epileptic fit when that shit came on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a conspiracy.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something you have to remember about the music industry, it&#39;s sales based. You know how football games have people like nsync and christina aguilara singing halftime shows - while you&#39;re thinking &#39;how many football fans are into this music?&#39;</p>

<p>Well, only specific groups of people are really still spending a lot of cash on albums. </p>

<p>The stuff you hear on the radio and on MTV is the stuff that they think they can make some money on. So, you see things more and more focused in their marketing, mostly toward people that for whatever reason, still shovel their money at the industry.</p>

<p>Hip hop, country, new rock, and r &amp; b are all that&#39;s left for them. A bunch of kids buy a few albums that focus on &#39;yo, make money, get yo papers son&#39; and that&#39;ll be all you&#39;ll hear until it dies back down.</p>

<p>There is no conspiracy here, just the effects of a dying market with an increasingly out of touch music industry.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m also saying that the people that listen to this music are stupid and easy to make money off of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve wondered for a long time whether the music industry was targeting and influencing uneducated children and young adults that listen to mainstream hip hop into getting jobs so they could make money and buy the items and commodities in hip hop videos.  </p>

<p>Hip hop really shows you how much Edward Bernay&#39;s mass consumerism and Freudian psychology are fundamental in advertising and pop culture now.  You have to buy a fat gold chain and wear these kind of clothes so you can get the bitches with the huge ass.</p>

<p>Side story: I went to a bar a couple of weeks ago.  This Asian girl of average looks started flirting with me.  I was pretty drunk and not that interested in her, but I wanted to have a decent conversation with her and her friends with no real intention beyond having a civilized discourse and meeting new people.  The girl was so mind fucked from our culture that she was openly rude to me because I refrained from immediately taking advantage of her.  I did nothing but talk politely with them, but evidently I was supposed to spit game with this beezy and immediately have sex with her, like the hip hop videos had instructed her.  </p>

<p>Moral of the story: the young adults have been mind fucked and psychology operated on by hip hop culture to the point where educated people cannot have a conversation with them.  I know it sounds elitist, but we know it&#39;s the damn truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reminds me of that verse from the Eagles, Hotel California (which is about the music/entertainment business):</p>

<p>Her mind is Tiffany twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends</p>

<p>She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends</p>

<p>How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat</p>

<p>Some dance to remember, some dance to forget</p>

<p>Rappers are like the courtyard dancers. They are just part of the spectacle of excess that attracts people to the industry. The more listeners buy into this world of material wealth, glamor, and status, the more enslaved they become.</p>

<p>The reason why this idea is so prevalent in popular music is because it promotes consumption. People who long for fancy things and a glamorous lifestyle end up will spend their income on cars, clothes, jewelry etc... and may even take on debt to acquire them. </p>

<p>The consequence of a society that values wealth and avarice is that it neglects other things. In our case, we neglect our civil tradition. Getting a job and an education becomes only the means by which we will increase our status and acquire bigger and better things. We spend less time contemplating our social condition and more time blindly following our ruling institutions. </p>

<p>Rap music is for an audience that can&#39;t stop chasing the carrot on the stick because they &quot;wanna be a millionaire so freakin&#39; bad.&quot; These people work harder, complain less, and are generally more obedient. They are &quot;prisoners of their own device&quot; held captivate by the ideas promoted by the music industry. </p>

<p>Rap music is for an audience that can&#39;t stop chasing the carrot on the stick</p>

<p>Popular rap music. But I completely agree, most mainstream music works the same way:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brag about the lifestyle</li>
<li>Show off your &quot;Bitches&quot; (actual women, cars, boats, houses)</li>
<li>???</li>
<li>Profit...</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>Most media is indoctrination. It can&#39;t NOT be indoctrination. As far back as media exists smart people have always used it to their benefit. Businessmen don&#39;t waste good resources.</p>

<p>The best crops come from regular, predictable, and fertile fields.</p>

<p>Everyone has something that attracts their attention, some innate goal or base desire. If you take a large group of people, it will look a lot like random noise with islands of similarity. Such a group of people is uncontrollable, because there are too many desires to cater to, and so is neither a predictable nor a fertile field. You need it to grow the crops you want.</p>

<p>So you reduce people to a common base desire, and then however you spin it, they will dance accordingly. You do this by grafting onto the psyche a purely abstract base value: money. Money is perfect, because it means nothing in and of itself, so anyone can identify with it and latch on to.</p>

<p>Then you use the principles of systematics.</p>

<p>A more chaotic system is more vulnerable to penetration by an outside agent. A more stable system is better protected and is harder to penetrate.</p>

<p>So you direct your message at the more chaotic sections of a society to penetrate it. That would be the minorities, and that would be the teens.</p>

<p>Direct your message at the unstable, and if you spin it the right way, they will soak it up like a sponge. The unstable minorities mutate the message, which arrives to the more stable masses in a more familiar form, much easier to absorb.</p>

<p>This is why all revolutionaries direct their message at the oppressed people. They are more a more chaotic part of the system, and thus more easily penetrable.</p>

<p>So the rappers preach the awesome value of money, and now instead of needing to pull many strings for many people, they pull just one string.</p>

<p>Notice how much time each of us spends talking about money. Bargains, deals, prices, bills, profits, insurance, etc. etc. Money makes us emote for literally NO REASON. Money is to values as BA in Communications is to college degrees: &quot;when in doubt&quot;. So it&#39;s one simple carrot for 7 billion people. Nice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it were a conspiracy it would be encouraging people to lust after the dead American dream or the idea that money makes you happy. this causes normal people, who are heavily influenced by these lyrics, work harder and harder at remedial jobs and focus less on things that can bring a more substantial form of happiness like family, careers, or knowledge. </p>

<p>but, even that is a bit of stretch. however, i wouldnt discredit it as a distraction for the generation below us to focus on money more than education or something along those lines.</p>
