    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Conspiracy. It will get to the front page if people think the content is worthy and will vote up. I chose this because of the meaning of the word.  </p>

<p>conspiracy <a href="http://definr.com/conspiracy">(http://definr.com/conspiracy)</a></p>

<pre><code> n 1: a secret agreement between two or more people to perform an
      unlawful act [syn: confederacy]
 2: a plot to carry out some harmful or illegal act (especially
    a political plot) [syn: cabal]

    <div class="md"><p>The article doesn&#39;t suggest the agent or the police had an agreement to perform an unlawful act (def 1). There&#39;s no particular evidence that there was a plot to do harm (def 2) or that they had conspired against the pastor (def 3).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what you consider is an unlawful act. I think detaining someone without PC is an unlawful act. I think the directive given to Border Patrol is wrong, and the charges/assumptions are thrown around like a cheap slut.<br/>
100 miles into the US, they can ask me if I am a citizen, but if they just did the damn job where it should be done, at the border, then I don&#39; think Conspiracy would be the right place to submit this.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I recall when this story broke. Everyone was up in arms about what happened to him, as they should be.. Then once his beliefs came out people stopped defending him. IMO he did the right thing in that situation, something a lot of us wouldn&#39;t have the balls (or patience) to go through. His beliefs fucking suck but to each his own and it should have had little to no bearing on this situation.</p>

What pissed me off the most, well not the most but still pissed me off where some of those jackasses on the youtube comments blaming him.
