<p>Bullshit. I was actually on the fence leaning towards the idea that some of the conspiratard theories are worth looking into just a few years ago. The FEMA Camp thing was one that I was interested in. Then I started following you people on digg and doing more research. It doesn&#39;t take long to figure out that this whole conspiracy movement is a religious one and not a scientific or fact-based one.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorists have no credible evidence to support pretty much anything. They just go on what other conspiracy theorists tell them. It&#39;s actually even worse than the Glen Beck/Sarah Palin cult. Your movement is a joke. I implore you to wake up and realize this before you waste another minute on this bullshit. Cut your losses!

<p>Ohhh that&#39;s it, I&#39;m from dig and this is all about my religion. In no way am I from dig and I&#39;ve never been religious.. I&#39;m not sure the FEMA Camp conspiracy you&#39;re talking about but that&#39;s really all I ask. Is to look, find out, and then make your opinion. Again, I&#39;VE SEEN PLENTY of credible evidence. But evidence can be disputed. Especially when you never look at it and assume that it&#39;s wrong because you don&#39;t like conspiracy theories. Look for my other comment for links on decent evidence, or don&#39;t, I don&#39;t care. I just think it&#39;s ridiculous you can all dismiss them. Did you see that post a while back about if someone forms an opinion that even when presented fact the chances are high that they&#39;re opinion will not change. It was talking about conspiracy theories or anything but I feel it applies here. And in case you&#39;re winding up to tell me that it works against me too I didn&#39;t believe in any theories I do now until less than six months ago. If you&#39;ve looked and don&#39;t want to that is honestly fine with me because at least you&#39;ve educated yourself.

<p>Why are you holding this back then? Not only would I like to see it but your truther friends would as well. They&#39;ve been going on for almost 9 years and to date have not been able to produce a single shred of credible, verifiable evidence to support their theories.</p>

<p>Your strawman reference was well placed, but it wasn&#39;t important. No need to dispute that &#39;fact&#39;. Don&#39;t cry over spilled milk. My point is perfectly notable here..</p>

<p>Actually I believe I referenced another comment I had posted. That&#39;s right here..</p>

<p>I had mistakenly thought I&#39;d posted it here but i was arguing with one of the ignorant jerkoffs you share beliefs with. Either way you could have looked in my history.

<p>Quoted it again for you.</p>

<p>Since you&#39;ll have no excuse left but sheer desire to be ignorant about some of this &quot;verifiable evidence&quot; I have that you&#39;ve asked for, I&#39;ve decided to link it in this comment. In order of relevance so you don&#39;t have to waste more time than you want to.</p>

<p>This video is what I feel a clean cut case looks like. Your argument to this will probably look something like this..</p>

<p>&quot;Look at the group of crazy, loser, conspiratards that made the video. LAWL You can&#39;t believe any of these number of verifiable facts they&#39;ve presented in this well put together peice of VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE.&quot;</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t want to give that the time than don&#39;t even bother with these and we can agree your in an ignorant cult just the same.</p>

<p>You were banned from conspiratard for the endless childish remarks you made in the Glenn Beck thread. The 9/11 truther movement one of the lowest movements you can join on the internet (not far above the flat earth society and stormfront), and we&#39;ve had our fair share of knuckle-dragging trolls coming in here looking to start shit, yet until you came along I never had to bother clicking on the &quot;ban users&quot; link. Coming from a movement made up of some of the biggest assholes on the planet you&#39;ve managed to stick out. Congratulations!

<p>kickrox -1 points 5 days ago[-]</p>

<p>Great argument lol. Again congratulations on all the evidence and supporting fact you&#39;ve put together here. I&#39;m pretty sure my comment describes what ignorance is and I&#39;m not sure you read or even will because had you, you&#39;d have at least come up with something more factual to say. The thing is no one just believes in conspiracy theories for no reason and without knowing anything about them. They have to be convinced through evidence. Which is something that I&#39;ve yet to have seen put on the table from the opposing viewpoint.. lol Good game though..

<p>All you come here to do is spread the lies of the 9/11 truth movement. You have absolutely no evidence on your site yet you have the gall to try and talk down to someone for simply calling your out on your bullshit and/or ignorance. Below are some links. If you review all of these links in full and still believe in the conspiracy theories I highly recommend seeing a psychiatrist.</p>

<p>kickrox is a very sick troll who needs to find another hobby. I was responding to him, but deleted my comments and removed his after I realized that I was better off not feeding this worthless troll. Check out the proof <a href="http://imgur.com/eAvEf.png">here</a>. </p>

<p>That wasn&#39;t the only thread he was crossing the line in. There were a few others where he made vile and often homophobic remarks. He was begging for the banhammer. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> By the way, I&#39;ve been slowly throwing evidence up into <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/dc9tk/about_911/">this</a> thread.

    <div class="md"><p>It was the other way around. I made childish remarks before presenting any evidence. Thats exactly why, to laugh at people that are wrong. But the first comment I put out wasn&#39;t even childish. It was my observation that everyone in that sub reddit wanted to talk about the &quot;conspiratards&quot; being wrong and ignorant, while not wanting to talk about why they&#39;re wrong and ignorant. That whole sub reddit is a giant childish remarks. Your name for believers is conspiratard. That had to have been made up by a fifth grader in hopes to demean any body who has an opposing view into being handicapped. All you want to do is preach your ignorance and hypocrisy without opposition. You try and spit things to avoid actual points being made. You actually said I didn&#39;t post a single shred of evidence to back my claim. Nothing about the credibility. Just because you disagree with it&#39;s implication doesn&#39;t mean that its not evidence. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t need to mention anything about your mother but it was in response to an extremely childish remark you had made to me. Again why do you always have to spin things? I&#39;m not homophobic I just happen to use current day slurs. Just the same as you do. It&#39;s only our choice of those slurs that differs. </p>

<p>I never ignored the ones you posted. In fact I posted mine originally to you in response to the ones you posted. </p>

<p>It was my fault for assuming that a journal that claims to encourage peer review would actually be peer reviewed. You and your people troll here equally as hard if not worse than me or anyone from this subreddit do yours. Don&#39;t pretend to be on some high horse for the fact that I actually made an attempt to contribute rather only sling attacks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9 upvotes actually. Learn numbers... Ok that&#39;s a personal insult. My bad. But the thing is that in no way am <strong>I</strong> the type of person that makes actual conversation impossible. I think that&#39;s more the people like you..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not interested in your evidence, or opinion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s funny how anyone opposing the viewpoint really cant really argue at all, and think that their close mindedness will actually work as a substitute. Had you read any of the comments you would understand that past the personal attacks there is loads of truth in what I said. You probably didn&#39;t. If that&#39;s the case I say again...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are from the &quot;Conspiratard&quot; subreddit right? Aka the Jewish supremacist subreddit devoted to demeaning, harassing and slandering people on r/conspiracy. The Nazis were defeated 65 years ago and I don&#39;t see Germans causing problems the world is experiencing today. The Nazis existed for what 12 years? Is this an attempt to deflect attention away from Jewish and Israeli involvement in 9/11 by labeling me a Nazi? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;re talking about &#39;by deception&#39; and not &#39;With clandestine terrorism&#39;, but that still is way off of reality.</p>

<p>&quot;by deception&quot; - is Victor Ostrovsky&#39;s mistranslation of &quot;wise counsel&quot; as &quot;deception&quot; from Proverbs 24:6</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at a few other translations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New International Version: &quot;for waging war you need guidance, and for victory many advisers.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>King James Version: &quot;For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>New American Standard Bible: &quot;For by wise guidance you will wage war, And in abundance of counselors there is victory.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>New Living Translation: &quot;So don’t go to war without wise guidance; victory depends on having many advisers.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>English Standard Version: &quot;for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>New King James Version: &quot;For by wise counsel you will wage your own war, And in a multitude of counselors there is safety.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Darby Translation: &quot;For with good advice shalt thou make thy war; and in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Young&#39;s Literal Translation: &quot;For by plans thou makest for thyself war, And deliverance [is] in a multitude of counsellors.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Holman Christian Standard Bible: &quot;for you should wage war with sound guidance—victory comes with many counselors.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Jewish Publication Society: &quot;For by stratagems you wage war, And victory comes with much planning.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>The Jerusalem Bible: &quot;For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of counsellors there is victory.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The Mossad&#39;s present motto is from Proverbs 11:14: &quot;Where there is no guidance, the people fall, but in a multitude of counselors, there is safety.&quot;</p>

<p>I am clarifying a <em>misquote</em> about of what some people think is the Mossad&#39;s motto.  I made no value judgment about the Mossad.  If you look up any of the translations to Provebs 24:6 that have been provided, you will see that everything I said is correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was the other way around. I made childish remarks before presenting any evidence. Thats exactly why, to laugh at people that are wrong. But the first comment I put out wasn&#39;t even childish. It was my observation that everyone in that sub reddit wanted to talk about the &quot;conspiratards&quot; being wrong and ignorant, while not wanting to talk about why they&#39;re wrong and ignorant. That whole sub reddit is a giant childish remarks. Your name for believers is conspiratard. That had to have been made up by a fifth grader in hopes to demean any body who has an opposing view into being handicapped. All you want to do is preach your ignorance and hypocrisy without opposition. You try and spit things to avoid actual points being made. You actually said I didn&#39;t post a single shred of evidence to back my claim. Nothing about the credibility. Just because you disagree with it&#39;s implication doesn&#39;t mean that its not evidence. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t need to mention anything about your mother but it was in response to an extremely childish remark you had made to me. Again why do you always have to spin things? I&#39;m not homophobic I just happen to use current day slurs. Just the same as you do. It&#39;s only our choice of those slurs that differs. </p>

<p>I never ignored the ones you posted. In fact I posted mine originally to you in response to the ones you posted. </p>

<p>It was my fault for assuming that a journal that claims to encourage peer review would actually be peer reviewed. You and your people troll here equally as hard if not worse than me or anyone from this subreddit do yours. Don&#39;t pretend to be on some high horse for the fact that I actually made an attempt to contribute rather only sling attacks. </p>
