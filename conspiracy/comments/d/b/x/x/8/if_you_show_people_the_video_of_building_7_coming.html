    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s because it was a controlled demolition
..and the reason that almost no one knows about it is because the media hasn&#39;t told them to think about it, so they don&#39;t, most people honestly believe that if there is anything important that they need to be aware of or think about then the media will tell them about it, otherwise they generally don&#39;t, because they&#39;re too stupid to do any research on their own. </p>

<p>the public is comprised of zombies, as it always has been, this is just the most current version of the stupid mob who would have been burning witches had they been born in another era - they are the dead, the animated dead, who are never really alive, as they accept reality as it is presented to them from birth and never question anything, they do not use their own minds, and that is the reason that the world is the way that the world is.</p>

To collapse at free fall for that long, about 30m, 100ft, or 8 stories of steel structure had to be removed in an instant. The alternative is the building moving through the path of most resistance, without resistance.</p>

<p>Buildings fall without any help at all sometimes. Debris or not, this one had some help.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>an apparent demolition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>two of the largest buildings in the world, hit by two of the largest planes in the world collapsing under an imaginable ammount of force yards away and you choose the phrase &quot;apparent demolition&quot;.</p>

<p>Thats like saying someone who died from an IED detonating across the street is an &quot;apparent suicide&quot;</p>

<p>Also, a planned demo colapses supports, the vulnerable points, in a particular pattern. Similar a suicide attacks specific human vulnerabilities, like the wrists for example. If a person was found in a car accident with a slit wrist it would be strange, but the fact remains that it may have been caused in the accident. Every slit wrist is not a suicide, and everytime a building falls with the tell-tale signs of a profesional demo it isnt always a profesional demo.</p>

<p>There are times when things that are random may appear planned... that&#39;s how random works. Think of a monkey at a typewriter, eventually he will spell a word. Think pieces of toast with deity&#39;s faces. Think of baby&#39;s and toddlers accidentally saying dirty words in their gibberish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, we could have at least kept some physical samples from the building to test, or at very minimum explored the possibility of the use of explosives.</p>

<p>The fact that it was ruled out without even looking into the possibility leaves a lot of questions open.</p>

<p>IMHO there is just as much evidence for the &quot;thermal expansion&quot; official theory as there is for controlled demolition.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>is this so hard to believe? wiki- building 7- &quot;On September 11, 2001, 7 WTC was damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower of the WTC collapsed. The debris also ignited fires, which continued to burn throughout the afternoon on lower floors of the building. The building&#39;s internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires, and the building collapsed completely at 5:21:10 p.m.[1] The collapse began when a critical column on the 13th floor buckled and triggered structural failure throughout, which was first visible from the exterior with the crumbling of the east mechanical penthouse at 5:20:33 p.m.&quot;</p>

<p>Where do you get this shit?  Things fall over when their center of gravity exceeds the boundaries of their base of support.  WTC fell down because the damage didn&#39;t significantly alter its center of gravity, and didn&#39;t alter its base of support in anyway at all.  One high school physics course would debunk a lot of what passes for intellect here.</p>
