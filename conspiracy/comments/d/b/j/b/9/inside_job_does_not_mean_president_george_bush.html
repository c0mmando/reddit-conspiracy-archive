       In fact, I think about 20 Americans knew in advance (including members of the White House).  And if any one of those ~20 had chosen to come forward at the time, the entire event would have been prevented. But no one did come forward. Everyone had a personal incentive to enable it. (Silverstein got a couple $ Billion in insurance money. Cheney and Wolfowitz got their wars. Etc.)

       <strong>
        An "inside job" means simply:  Someone on the inside is
        <em>
         critically
        </em>
        required for the plan to work.
       </strong>
       In the case of 9/11, about 20 American "insiders" (including members of the White House) were required before "the grand plan" could even get off the ground).  The rest were foreign agents (Mossad, primarily), or were simply given and following justifiable orders).

       9/11 was an outsourced job, planned in the Mid 90's with pre approval and tactical support from many western governments.

       The group responsible has been operating for the last century and wont be stopped. They use order out of chaos through false flag terrorism to implement pre determined solutions.

       From 1941 until 1969, he taught a two-semester course at Georgetown on the development of civilisations. According to the obituary in the Washington Star after his death, many alumni of Georgetown School of Foreign Service asserted that this was "the most influential course in their undergraduate careers" and he revealed all in his books.

       "I know of this network because I have studied it for twenty years and was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records. I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and to many of its instruments. I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies ... but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known."

       U.S. Congressional Record February 9, 1917, page 2947

       Mr. CALLAWAY: “In March, 1915, the J.P. Morgan interests, the steel, ship building and powder interests and their subsidiary organisations, got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press in the United States".
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. CALLAWAY: “These 12 men worked the problems out by selecting 179 newspapers, and then began, by an elimination process, to retain only those necessary for the purpose of controlling the general policy of the daily press throughout the country. They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers. The 25 papers were agreed upon; emissaries were sent to purchase the policy, national and international, of these papers; an agreement was reached; the policy of the papers was bought, to be paid for by the month; an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness, militarism, financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers".

       <p>
        The CIA begins recruiting American news organisations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA's media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA's own admission, at least 25 organisations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The CIA ran it for 30 years in house, it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 companies, and the dissemination and disinformation continues.

      <p>
       'We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine, and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practised in past centuries."

       No way. I think hundreds of people knew, if not thousands. People
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       come forward. There was that US Congressman that said the thing was 20 years in the making. A whole plethora of people seemed to know it was going to go down that morning. Everybody doubts their ability to shut up and/or keep people quiet about it. I don't. You think you just get included in that little group easily? Because you don't. Why
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       they come forward? Because we want them to? Because we expect them to? That's not the way it works. It's a hierarchy of hierarchies and only the top of the top gets in. I just happen to think a good amount of people were in on it. It had to take lots and lots of people to execute that plan, not 20.

       you've got the right line of thinking, it would have taken thousands of people to remain complacent and not ask questions but the 20 number is right, In fact it could be even less, I'm talking the people in the upper crust of the upper circles who actually know shit, only about 20 people could know exactly what happened that day, not just bits and pieces, but the whole plan.

       Of course there would be a hierarchy of individuals within the conspiracy, but the "thousands of people" would not have just "remained complacent and not asked questions". They were directly involved and knew exactly what they were doing because it needed to be executed with precision. So they had more knowledge of the plan than you give them credit for. I think at least hundreds knew the whole plan.

       I disagree.  But I am willing to discuss this in some more detail if you have time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question:  Why do you think "thousands"?  Perhaps you would be willing to take a moment to identify some groups (noting that I would like the opportunity to follow-up with some refutes, if I can).

       Thousands of people knew about it? I really doubt that. Thousands of people would not to know about it. It is much easier to assume people who hate us after we abandoned them after the Russian-Afgan war attacked us out of spite

       President Bush would love for you to think he is a bumbling idiot, then you can explain his political moves as an idiots mistake. Truth is he is a very intelligent man who made very calculated global moves. But I guess you didn't hear that on MSNBC or FOX.

       They didn't try it. They thought of it, but never tried it. The CIA thought of all kinds of wacky stupid bullshit during the Cold War. They tried to mine a seashell and place that seashell in an area where Fidel Castro went free diving a lot in the hopes that he'd randomly pick it up and explode.

       The US has learned of a plan by Iran to invade Israel. Pretty much every country in the Middle East has one. They'd be retarded not to have one. They have plans in place in case they need to invade any of their neighbors, as does the United States.
      </p>

       It doesn't mean any of them are going to spring into action. They make plans for everything because intelligence services tend to dislike surprises and even more dislike not being prepared to respond to surprises.

       The only way to know for sure is to do an experiment - that's not going to happen.

       another way is to analyze all the other incidents where planes crashed into skyscrapers - wait, there weren't any.

Even the best physicists can't always predict outcomes before physical experiments. Why can some idiot on the Internet figure out how a fucking skyscraper will react when a plane hits it?

       Conentrate on building 7. The building fell on to its own footprint. That does not happen at random due to random events.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Regarding an experiment. Have you heard of a Discovery channel show called "Mythbusters"? They could write history if they tackle 9/11. They will own all ratings including the "Super bowl" and World cup finals if they produce a 9-11 special.

       Well, we're not talking about a random event. The building was on fire and water pressure was too low to be of help.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the official story: "The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse."
      </p>
      <p>
       What's so "random" about that? And don't give me "fires have never before or since destroyed a steel skyscraper." So fucking what? So because it never happened it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       never happen? Pretty flimsy evidence if you ask me. And if it were planned, why not collapse building 7 when the debris fell? Why do it when people like you would get all suspicious?
      </p>
      <p>
       And don't give me the "footprint" BS. That's how buildings fall. No skyscraper has ever hinged in the middle and bent like nunchucks. These things are not solid. They fall apart instead of bending over.

       Have you ever stood on the curb or next to a passing subway. As it passes you, you feel this woosh. Ok now think of that except a subway think of two of the biggest buildings in NY falling right next to another building..Those things feel so hard they could be detected with simesic detectors from far far away. And besides what would be the point of demo WTC7? I mean it would have to be demoed anyways to do the reconstruction. Even if it didn't fall its not like people could just go to work the next day.

       Correct.  But "weakened" steel still provides an immense amount of resistance.  A building supported by weakened steel will eventually collapse... but WTC1, WTC2 and WTC7 all collapsed at near freefall (i.e., resistance-free) speeds.  (This is indisputable.  Not only is video footage available for everyone to independently evaluate and confirm, but the NIST has admitted to the "free fall" events.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Free fall speeds can only occur if the entire building (not just a few floors, but the ENTIRE building) is deprived of ALL structural integrity.  Weakened steel still provides a tremendous amount of integrity / resistance.  And to suggest that fire weakened all of the steel through-out each floor of each buildings is just wrong.  (Not even the NIST makes that claim.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom Line:  Fires did exist on most of the floors.  Fires surely weakened some of the steel framing (in any one of the three buildings).  But in no case was the entire steel structure "weakened" to the point of zero resistance so as to enable a near-free-fall event (which occurred in all three buildings).
      </p>
      <p>
       Focus on the speed at which the buildings collapsed.  NIST claims ~11 seconds for each of the Trade Towers.  That's 110 stories in 11 seconds.  (Try clapping your hands together 110 times in 11 seconds.)  Yea... that's fucking fast.  (And the speed of collapse remained constant -- never "slowing", which would have been the natural course as te building began to collapse through it's own core -- meeting more and more resistance every step of the way.)  Resistance would slow-down the collapse over time.  Never slowing means zero resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone with a basic high-school physics class has the knowledge to conclude that all three buildings were demolished.  (Yes, it's that obvious.)

(d) Nickel-molybdenum steel. This type of steel cannot be cut easily by conventional steel-cutting charges. The jet from a shaped charge will penetrate it, but cutting requires multiple charges or linear-shaped charges. Nickel-molybdenum steel shafts can be cut with a diamond charge. However, the saddle charge will not cut nickel-molybdenum shafts. Therefore, use some method other than explosives to cut nickel-molybdenum steel, such as

       “The cutting of the piling is performed by a series of tubes radially deployed in the cutter on a common plane. Each tube is filled with what is, in essence, a solid fuel similar to thermite or magnesium. Thus, the cut is performed through the use of a series of
       <strong>
        solid fuel torches
       </strong>
       . The preferred solid fuel is Pyronol.RTM. Pyronol.RTM. is manufactured by Goex, Inc. and the material itself is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 3,695,951. Pyronol.RTM., once ignited, will attain temperatures between
       <strong>
        six and twelve thousand degrees Fahrenheit
       </strong>
       . These temperatures are sufficient to burn through steel and concrete.”

       did you want the building to tip over instead in one piece? These buildings have huge foundations that go deep underground. They are part of the earth if you wanna get picky. What other ways could a building fall over? You want the foundation to just give up and have the building tip over in one piece like a domino

       Yes.  When trees collapse, do they pulverize straight down through their own core?  Or do they tip to the side (and follow "the path of least resistance")?
      </p>
      <p>
       Collapsing down through one's own core structure (no matter how strong or weak that structure may be) is to follow the path of greatest resistance.  All three buildings followed the path of greatest resistance -- collapsing straight down and through their own core structure.  This alone, is an entirely "unnatural" event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, by following the path of greatest resistance, it would have been necessary to see a gradual (but measurable) slowing of collapse (as the collapse encountered more and more resistance -- floor by floor).  But none of the three buildings demonstrated a "slowing" of collapse.  At one more, Building 7 displayed an ACCELERATION!!  (This is simply impossible without an outside force providing some assistance.)  But in all cases, there was never any slowing... rather, all three collapses maintained a rather steady speed --- which was near free fall -- itself impossible unless the building's were deprived of all structural integrity -- not just "weakened steel", but 100% of the building's structural integrity must be removed for these speeds to have been achieved.  There is just no way around this -- it's physics 101.

       this never happened before you cannot predict what would happen. When the Titantic sank no one believed the survivors when they said it split in half because of its strength but it did. You cannot make statements about an event that happened once.

       The weakest side did drop first. We see it start to fall toward where the plane hit before falling straight down. The plane flew through the entire building pieces known to be from the cockpit were found many blocks away on the other side of the building.

       Maybe the middle third fell because that's where the plane hit and the fire weakened the steel structure. The above section followed and then pancaked he lower section.

       The experts you provide state that they do not know why WTC 7 fell the way it did and also that they decline to hypothesize. However they conveniently hypothesize in the next sentence that the debris and the fires could have caused the collapse. Yet they fail to hypothesize that explosives could have accomplished the same thing.

       It is because none of their previous 6 comments show any evidence of explosives used. So why would they hypotozie something that has zero evidence of occurring? You can't ignore the rest of the statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who work in the field do not believe it was a demolition. There is no evidence from their standpoint of anything but a collapse.

       So armchair demolition experts know more about demolishing buildings then the people who do demolitions on a daily basis.

       Symmetrical means even or uniformed.  In other words, the buildings didn't crumple randomly - the left side first, then a but in the middle where the weakened steel existed.  Then a bit more collapse on the right, etc.  Asymmetrical collapses are naturally occurring, which is why demolitions are required to insure a straight-down, uniformed collapse of a building.  It's not bullshit terminology at all.  This is common and essential industry terminology.

       It doesn't seem likely; however, stranger things have happened. I agree with interrogative to an extent. If you want to theorize on the collapse of the wtc, go ahead. Nothing is absolute though. Phrases like "it had to have been" and "there is no way" are not accurate due to the uncertainty.

       I agree. Why is there a lack of conclusive evidence. Considering how much time and money NIST spent on the report one cannot help but determine that it is an apologist's report for the official story.

       All you need to do is watch the videos for conclusive evidence.  The speed of the collapses reveals all.  Anyone with a knowledge of highs-school physics can tell you that near-free fall speed requires near zero structural resistance -- throughout.  That a collapse will naturally "slow" as it meets resistance.  And that a collapse (of any kind) that does not "slow" must either have 1)  external power source (explosives) or 2)  near zero structural resistance.  It's that simple.

       It kind of does when the structure is damaged and weak enough. It's not made of stone here. It's not the leaning tower of piza.

       I used to be a truther, but then I learned to apply occams razor to things. The mainstream explanations for how building 7 fell are completely plausible. Sure, to the layman it seems weird, but they're laymen, so who gives a shit what they think? People on youtube, apparently.

       He says you only need to take out one of the steel columns to take a skyscraper down. With the proper tools and lack of security, you could probably easily do this in an afternoon. Do you really thing a steel skyscraper is as strong as a fortress?

       That's how far the building fell in the 2.3 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       At free fall acceleration, starting from zero, the building will fall about 30 m or 100 ft.  That's about eight floors of WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free fall acceleration is defined as acceleration without resistance.  That means, those eight floors had to disappear for the building to fall at that rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just the truth.  There's no other way to explain it.  Eight floors had to move out of the way in zero time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the building plans.  There were seventy-seven columns connected to each other on each floor.  This is a huge grid of steel.  It just disappeared.  It was all there, and then it was all not there in very little time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is beyond absurd to believe that fire made the eight floors of steel grid disappear in no time.

       Those eight floors don't have to disappear, they only need to fall with the rest of the building. This wouldn't be so far fetched if the structure had been damaged, which it had, from fire and debris from the first two towers collapsing. Further damage could easily have occurred when the penthouse collapsed.

       No, according to NIST, they did in fact test explosives scenarios. They simulated them in software. Further:

       "Blast from the smallest charge capable of failing a single critical column would have resulted in a sound level of 130 dB to 140 dB at a distance of at least half a mile. There were no witness reports of such a loud noise, nor was such a noise heard on the audio tracks of video recordings of the WTC 7 collapse."

       Doesn't matter what preceded the freefall.  You have to get eight-plus floors out of the way in no time.  They have to give less resistance than air.  They do not account for that.  They simply say it happens.
      </p>

       So, clearly, they just say free fall happens.  They do not ever explain how it happens.

       And, the briefing is a farce.  They say on the very same page you quote from, "[t]he actual time for the north face to descend 18 stories, based on video evidence, was approximately 5.4 s and the computed free fall time was 3.9 s."
      </p>

       This is a video from David Chandler, who if famous for forcing NIST to admin the free fall collapse.  It's a two minute video.  It proves that statement from NIST is a flat lie.

       The response to David Chandler is that his video isn't showing the entire collapse and thus is not proving that the statement from NIST is a flat lie:

There's no sound in any audio tracks and it doesn't show up on any seismograph readings around the time of the collapse.

       Okay, assuming you meant the following question:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Is NIST telling the truth when they say "[t]he actual time for the north face to descend 18 stories, based on video evidence, was approximately 5.4 s and the computed free fall time was 3.9 s?""
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I believe NIST was telling the truth. Based on video evidence, it looks like it took 5.4s to collapse 18 stories, which is in fact longer than the free fall time. If you had actually bothered to watch the links I sent, you'd see this is in fact the case.

       What does building 7 have to do with this. The entire city was covered in smoke and ash. Two of the biggest buildings in the world fell down right next to it are you kidding? Why would they secrelty demo it when the two towers was attacked. its not like we went to war over building 7. Holy hell they got the Twin Towers but don't worry building 7 is intact! No war! Yeah right.

       building 7 is exactly what is causing the main controversy. It was not hit by any plane, got some small fragments that started the fire and fell. It is the first steel building to do so in history.  Of course there are going to be questions, and no reasonable answer has been provided.

Engine 94 - 18 years
      </p>
      <p>
       Boyle: ...on the north and east side of 7 it didn’t look like there was any damage at all, but then you looked on the south side of 7 there had to be a hole 20 stories tall in the building, with fire on several floors. Debris was falling down on the building and it didn’t look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firehouse: When you looked at the south side, how close were you to the base of that side?
      </p>
      <p>
       Boyle: I was standing right next to the building, probably right next to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firehouse: When you had fire on the 20 floors, was it in one window or many?
      </p>
      <p>
       Boyle: There was a huge gaping hole and it was scattered throughout there. It was a huge hole. I would say it was probably about a third of it, right in the middle of it. And so after Visconti came down and said nobody goes in 7, we said all right, we’ll head back to the command post. We lost touch with him. I never saw him again that day.

       I doubt the Plane that was taken down by the passengers (not shot) was aimed for Building 7, why would it be, the White house or capitol would b ea better shot. NBoth are easy targets. Not like building 7 which you probably could not even see through the smoke let alone hit it

       or your "theories". One of the fucking planes almost missed the tower, do you really think you could hit a smaller, and lower target, which by this time would be impossible to see from the air? Hell no, go for the white house or capitol which are easy to see.

       Nothing was in free fall. Winds, other debris, heat, dust, there are so many factors that even in a controlled experiment you don't get free fall. Besides, a building collapsing is hardly a free object falling with no wind resistance.

       Wrong.  It proves that eight floors were removed in the same instant. BTW, the building didn't fall. It collapsed into itself through the path of most resistance. It proves you were lied to.

       The building fell apart. I don't know why this is so surprising. Where's the evidence for the lies? Where should it have collapsed? A mile away? Seems to me that straight down is the path of least resistance.

       Path of least resistance?  What about the resistance of the floors below?  When something disintegrates, the rubble and any column that is still connected will provide resistance.  Slowing down the free fall of the building.  This wasn't the case with WTC 7.  It fell as though there was nothing under it to provide resistance.  This is how buildings are affected in a fire now?

       If it happened like they said:
      </p>
      <p>
       The support beams are heated to the point of failure. They can no longer hold up the weight of the building. They collapse. The whole structure starts to break apart because there is literally nothing supporting it. So yes, it "free falls" because there's nothing there to hold it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, it's as if all support disappeared in an instant because that's what happened. When you heat metal, there are discreet quanta that it goes through at very specific temperatures. Experiments with heating metal are literally the historical basis of quantum mechanics. At a certain temperature (an exact temperature) the columns buckled and the structure turned to dust. The only thing holding up a modern skyscraper are the metal beams.

       You must also remember that many fire fighters had already died that day and the sprinkler system wasn't working as designed.

       Metal transfers heat well. A skyscraper's metal skeleton is usually connected. It's possible that there were multiple points of simultaneous failure. It's also possible that support failure in one place helped along support failure in other places due to poor redistribution of load - almost like a house of cards falling down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this appears to be what happened. If there's a better explanation, I'd like to hear it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Planted explosives? How did no one notice unusual workers bringing explosives into the building during the days or weeks before 9/11? Not one witness? No evidence? Why explode the building long after the plane crash? Explosives would've needed to have been planted at support beams. No one noticed this? Where's the evidence? Study building demolition and notice how many tons of explosives are needed. They were all brought in without anyone noticing? All the workers this would take, not one has come forward? A conspiracy of dozens if not hundreds? How did the CIA recruit suicide pilots? A false flag operation makes no sense.

       Look, heat did not remove eight floors in a small fraction of a second to cause the free fall acceleration that occurred.  If you have some real explanation of how that happened, then fine; but NIST did not provide an explanation for it, and "metal transfers heat well" is not the explanation.

       The biggest proof to me that there is much more to the story then the official report is the lack of known evidence.  Such as with the Pentagon, one of the most secure and monitored buildings in the world.  One that also has multiple batteries of missiles along side thousands of cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       No video, other than the poor resolution, grainy few still images were ever shown to the public.  There were traffic cameras that captured the entire incident.  Strangely, these were down.  In addition, many other video feeds were taken shortly after the impact, and never included in the official report.

       I'll tell you why that is, because it's standard operating procedure for the US government. They never release anything without a fight. If it wasn't for FOIA, we'd know nothing. They released that single vid to try and quell conspiracy rumors.

       No, what I'm saying is that when proof is withheld, there is only ONE reason why.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think that FOIA requests are granted.  The videos in question did capture the impact, however the release has been denied for "national security."
      </p>
      <p>
       We saw no plane impact the pentagon or debris.  We also watched the reinforced command center collapse on 9/11 from fires, though it looked identical to an implosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof lies with the official report.  And when critical facts are found to have been omitted, it's pretty easy to understand why.

       300 is the B-25's top speed. It's cruising speed was 230 mph. It's estimated speed when it hit empire was 200mph because it was lost in the fog.

       Mostly correct. The B-25, again, was going 200 mph, thats not 'low' speed.  The planes that hit the towers were going 400-500 mph.  Plus it wasn't leaking millions of gallons of jet fuel like a sieve, or quite as large.

       First im glad you said B-25 and not a B-52 as many people have said before..But the B-25 hit a concrete building, not a steel one. A B-25 is 21,120 pounds. A 767 is 189,750 pounds, BIG difference.

       Yes, but it wasn't head on. The bomber landed on another structure. Also, the B 25 is a prop plane. Lots of differences there.

       The debris did not fall.  They were projected.  What accounts for the energy to project a steel beam across a block?

       Gravity would push the beam down, but if gravity was the only force, the buildings would still be standing, because they would not collapse through the path of most resistance.

       It was affected by the fire inside, however. The same kind of fire which weakened the steel core of the towers also weakened the core of WTC 7. They pulled the firemen out of the building in an attempt to lessen the loss of life of the firefighters and just let the building collapse from the fire. It's documented that they felt too many firemen had already died that day and that they didn't want any more to die fighting the fires of an empty office building.

       The collapse indicates that the inner core was pulverized. A weakened core would still provide some resistance as the building was collapsing. Fire was not the cause of the collapse.

       Two of the biggest buildings in the world fell next to WTC7 I think thats enough force to knock a building down. I never got the building 7 argument. WE SAW PLANES HIT BOTH TOWERS. But when it comes to the pentagon they had to use a missile and WTC7 was destroyed why exactly? Even if it survived intact it would be demolished just so they could rebuild

       The terrorists' training is well-documented. Look it up. Besides, are US pilots somehow special in that only they can learn to pilot US aircraft? MS Flight Simulator is pretty fucking accurate. Besides, there's these things called "books". You can learn a lot from them. Also, RTFM.

       Not so surprising when you consider that US flight security sucks balls. It's a joke. And simultaneous hijackings really threw the system for a loop. Simultaneous hijackings made the plan

       Everything makes sense to me. I don't know why you find it so hard to believe. Even after 9/11 security hasn't improved much. Some describe it as security theater. One only need to compare Israeli security with US security to see how much the US sucks. I'm shocked 9/11 hasn't happened a dozen more times since. But I guess they accomplished what they needed to accomplish.

       Oh yes, of course it's impossible for them to fly a plane. All they had to do was steer these planes. And I don't know why everyone thinks it's so hard. How much did these guys have to know to crash planes? Why is this so unbelievable? Flying a plane isn't brain surgery.

       To accurately hit buildings at 500 MPH is nearly impossible for the skilled.  Try it in a flight simulator for yourself.  The plane that hit the Pentagon hovered over the grass as low as a few feet.  It hit reinforced lamp posts yet did not break up.

       You do remember who sold the explosives to the terrorists during the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, don't you?  You really think they are out of the game?  They tried to push through the same legislation after the '93 bombing, but no one would go for it.  So a mere 8 years later something extremely similar happens, and the laws from before are all passed without any real incident.  Whittled away right before your eyes.

       The main problem with 9/11 being a false flag? It's the most elaborate and deadly false flag the US government has ever pulled. In the past (tonkin, possibly pearl harbor, cuba, possibly the Israeli attack) the false flag targets were military. Why would they go to such trouble? Thousands of civilians? Aircraft destroyed? The Pentagon damaged? The White House almost damaged? It's way overboard and unnecessary. (The Pentagon attacked itself? Yeah right.) Plus there's absolutely no evidence it was a false flag other than the physics look fishy, which isn't much of an argument in a situation that has no comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the identity of the terrorists. The FBI was investigating one. There's little chance these guys were US assets. It's possible the CIA allowed it to happen Pearl Harbor style, but that's giving them too much credit. It has become apparent in recent years that the US intelligence community is almost completely incompetent. I doubt they could've stopped these guys let alone organize them and keep it secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typical false flag is a military target and almost always a ship.
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC was attacked by terrorists I believe twice before.
      </p>
      <p>
       US airport security is awful.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have always had fascists in the US Senate. Unfortunately they took advantage of 9/11. For that I blame the spineless moderates who went along.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate, I want to see one shred of evidence that this was a flase flag. Even circumstantial.

       Because that is obviously what it really takes to bend the will of the American people that much.  The doublespeak Patriot act that stripped away many provisions of the bill of rights.  They attempted the exact same thing with the bombing of the WTC, and it wasn't enough to sway public opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do they do 8 years later?  Something much more grand.  They did it because it was the only way.

       you still didn't address how it is that the most heavily guarded place the earth has ever known was hit by what they say is a 757(a relatively slow aircraft in military terms). nor did you address the tremendous flying maneuvers accomplished by those pilots, especially the pentagon pilot. hitting the bottom floor of a building without scraping the engines of the plane on the grass. oh well, he probably just read lots of books, right?

       The 9/11 plot would have been perfect if not for the precision. Precision is a virtue of a hitman, bang, bullet in the head. But precision is not considered any good for a terrorist who would prefer a big blast, many died, mission accomplished.  This 9/11 plot was so highly precise, as precise as a bullet at the 4th button. Which makes it unlikely a terrorist act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the terrorist become a compulsive attacker?  If they have 5 planes in hand to make a day, just use 1 plane is enough to make such a statement.  It would be easier to crash the plane to the main street and kill more.  That would be easier for the pilot and bigger bang for the buck.  So why two well insured buildings in downtown.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last point is the WTC7 which everyone knows it is a failure.  They should pull the building when the second tower fell, that would make it easier to swallow then falling in broad day light.

       It makes perfect sense they would hijack a number of planes at once. That was to insure success. No telling how many groups would get caught. They probably hijacked as many planes as their resources allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the targets? If you've been following international terrorists for years, it would make sense. That wasn't the first time the WTC was attacked. High casualties wasn't their motive. They attacked symbolic targets.

       Structures don't collapse through the path of most resistance.  Sustained fire would not account fo that.  NIST tested this to try to recreate; their experiments failed.  It didn't happen; it couldn't happen.

       WT7 was an especially strongly-built, steel-framed skyscraper,
       <em>
        even stronger
       </em>
       than the types that have burned for days on end and still stood.  Think of that when you use the word 'sustained' - other, weaker skyscrapers have burned
       <em>
        for days on end
       </em>
       and still stood.
      </p>
      <p>
       WT7 burns patchily for a few hours, the building itself and its environs are neatly evacuated and - just like that, as if anticipated - it falls symmetrically into its own footprint.
      </p>
      <p>

       I don't have all the answers, but apparently WT7 had a crisis-management floor that was to be used in the event of a disaster hitting New York.  It housed several government agencies as well, and it was for these reasons that it was an especially tough building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allegedly, destroying WT7 was done in order to quickly destroy proof that this control centre and specialised equipment inside it had been used to co-ordinate and monitor the WTC's attack and subsequent collapse.

       The HQ was there in place already, to serve the function of a crisis management control centre.  Allegedly, it was then used to do so for the 9/11 attacks.  It wasn't put there for 9/11 - it was ALWAYS there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for WHAT they could co-ordinate and monitor, you'll have to do your own research - it's not like I'm an authority on 9/11, I just helped out with a few obvious low-balls - particularly about WT7's 'sustained' fire leading to unsurprising collapse (in reality, something that would be a stunning world first-ever if it turned out to be true).

       There is no need to rebuild WT7 - we just have to observe how other steel-framed skyscrapers have withstood fires.  For a start, Google "Madrid skyscraper fire" for more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, a modern steel-framed skyscraper is an exceptionally tough construction - WT7 particularly so.  The fact is that no modern-framed skyscraper EVER collapsed through fire - apart from on 9/11 - even after blazing for DAYS on end and having visibly warped beams.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid it would indeed be VERY unusual to think that anyone knew that the especially tough, patchily-burning WT7 was going to collapse, unless there was a reason they were able to predict it.

       <em>
        but as strong as WT7 itself.

       To tarnish the American symbol, drive the plane in an axis right between the two buildings, you can hit the two buildings with just one plane. Bingo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now suppose you are the commander of the attack, if your first plane hit the two buildings, yes, shit all over the place.  Would you send the second plane to finish the job?  Since the two tower is so close, it is possible that the pilot of the first plane kill two birds with one stone. That would leave the 2 towers burning in jet fuel. The pilot of the second plane will go insane when he sees the 2 towers in flame and call back to the command center.  Imagine a rookie kamikaze pilot asking for a second target to hit.  This is insane.   Which means the pilot of the second plane must be very sure that there is a tower for him to strike on that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don't think it was a reasonable plot for a terrorist when he can have a thousand alternatives.

       You entire post is illogical nonsense and conjecture. "hit two buildings with one plane"? The "commander of the attack" (as if to say they were receiving real-time orders from an individual while they were flying)? The pilot would "go insane"? Stop smoking weed that has meth in it.

       Because New York City is a big fucking place, because the WTC featured two towers, because it was the centrepiece of their plan, because they were worried one of them might be intercepted. Your idea that they should have simply planned to hit both buildings with one air plane is idiotic.

       Christ. There was no commander. They were not in contact with each other. they were on seperate kamikazee missions. This is absolutely clear. It's pretty clear that they didn't think so many of the groups would have success. To me, it was a perfectly planned operation. I don't know what you're talking about.

       These terrorists have been attacking the WTC for years. It was symbolic for them. I'm not going to go into it, but WTC wasn't a surprise. Anyone who knows anything about the situation would know that. The other targets are obviously symbolic.

       You are right on this one, they should be on separate mission. One goes to the Pentagon, the other to the White House for example.  The weakness of the plot is, if two planes going to the same vicinity, they need good coordination which didn't exist in that situation. If the first plane has caused a lot of damage, what was the point sending the second plane.  So the pilot on the second plane must have a clear understanding on the damage of the WTC before he drove his plane there.  But why must a rookie kamikaze pick WTC again if he was going to kill himself that day and he has to ask himself all these questions.  Just find a second target. Done.

       Why send a second plane? Because the WTC was an important target to them. They probably didn't expect
       <em>
        both

       groups to get through airport security. Besides, there are two towers and they probably didn't think the buildings would topple.

       Double your stake, Pentagon or WTC, pick one.

       If the terrorist only have 5 to 6 plane to strike, it is very unlikely to double their stake on one place.  But if they have to choose, I think the choice would be the Pentagon.

       The investigation into the event that lead up to all this was made once, by one body and it was released and then forgotten.

       Fuck it.  George Bush was an imbecile, but under his watch we had nearly everything stripped from us.  And as you know, once you open that box, it's not ever likely to be closed again.

       The US has learned of a plan by Iran to invade Israel. Pretty much every country in the Middle East has one. They'd be retarded not to have one. They have plans in place in case they need to invade any of their neighbors, as does the United States.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't mean any of them are going to spring into action. They make plans for everything because intelligence services tend to dislike surprises and even more dislike not being prepared to respond to surprises.

       First im glad you said B-25 and not a B-52 as many people have said before..But the B-25 hit a concrete building, not a steel one. A B-25 is 21,120 pounds. A 767 is 189,750 pounds, BIG difference.
