    <div class="md"><p>If it were true that giving up liberty for safety is never a gain, then we would not have governments because we would never gain anything from it.</p>

<p>But we do have governments and you can gain more, sometimes, from safety, than from liberty.</p>

<p>And vice versa for that matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s retarded. A limited government is necessary to DEFEND our individual liberty, both from each other and from external threats. The fact that government, when not properly limited, can also itself threaten liberty does not change that.</p>

<p>And although that safety may seem to gain you more at first, the fact that you gave up liberty to get it means you actually gave up safety too, as your safety is now subject to the desires of others. What do you suppose happens when your safety is no longer profitable for them?</p>

<p>The point wasn&#39;t that liberty is better then safety, but that you CAN&#39;T get safety by surrendering liberty at all. It was that if you attempt to trade liberty for safety, then what you really get is neither, and that&#39;s what you deserve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any time you give power to government it&#39;s is a giving up of your natural liberty.
When I give the government the right to punish someone that harmed me, I&#39;m giving up the liberty to hurt them myself.

    <div class="md"><p>Stating that allowing government to act on our behalf is giving up liberty would be equivalent to stating that hiring an employee is giving up your liberty to them. It makes no sense. Empowering another to act on your behalf is NOT the same as abdicating the power itself, nor is it the same as giving them any kind of &quot;right&quot; as you wrongly imply.</p>

<p>This is the difference between a properly limited government (employee of the people) and one that is not properly limited (employer of the people).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hiring an employee is a decision made by an individual. Deciding to allow another/committee to handle the outcome of your situation is consent. If someone molests my child and I retaliate in a heated rage, that is liberty. If I stand by calm, while I fight emotions, that is consent.
A hired employee might harm or help me, it is my decision to make, my responsibility to suffer or enjoy the consequences. Shifting satisfaction or suffering by consent or force is a loss of liberty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have come across Locke before, and I do value his contributions, but I would not generally consider myself a John Locke &quot;type&quot;. If I had to classify myself, I would say &quot;practical geo-libertarian&quot;. Think Henry George and Ayn Rand, blended on frappe (Mmmm....).</p>

<p>I was not familiar with Thomas Hobbes, but a quick glance at Wikipedia and I can definitely see his philosophy in your position. I do disagree with the basis of it all though. As I said, that view of humans is not normal, its violently anti-social, and it just doesn&#39;t jive at all with my own experience or our current scientific understanding of ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least research quotations. The original quotation is taken from, &quot;A Historical Review of the Constitution and Government of Pennsylvania,&quot; first published anonymously in London in 1759. The quotation is an excerpt from a letter written in 1755 from the Assembly to the Governor of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin did publish the edition printed in Philadelphia, and most likely the original, but denied writing any part of it.</p>
