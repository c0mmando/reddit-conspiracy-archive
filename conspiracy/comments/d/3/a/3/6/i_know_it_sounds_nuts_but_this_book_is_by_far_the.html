<p><a href="http://www.hollowplanets.com/">http://www.hollowplanets.com/</a></p>

<p>Now I know what you think when you see the title, and believe me I thought the exact same. I actually bought the book by accident because it was a way for me to avoid shipping if I bought more books. But by the end of the first chapter, I couldn&#39;t believe how incredibly science based this was. I am working as a mechanical engineering right now and it took pretty much everything I learned to get through most of the chapters (there are still some things that I can&#39;t wrap my mind around). If you have ZERO physics or sceince knowledge, I doubt you would be able to read through this entire thing (let alone understand most of the more complex theories) but if you can, you will enjoy every last word.</p>

<p>The author is a pure genius. He analyzes the hollow planet theory for Venus, Mars and Earth (along with a few other bodies along the way) but purely through a scientific methods (Astomonomy, photography, seismology, speed of sound, speed of light, magnetism, polar exploration, history etc.) -Of note, there is no mythology, no magic, no aliens involved whatsoever - He even proposes a theory for the fundamental basis of gravity that makes a lot of sense! </p>

<p>Anyway, its just a suggestion, and I thought you&#39;d appreciate a science based approach to off the wall topics. I would love to possibly  have a discussion with other readers (either now or in the future) on its topics at some point too.</p>

<p>here are some reviews as well:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Planets-Feasibility-Possible-Possibly/product-reviews/0620219637/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">http://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Planets-Feasibility-Possible-Possibly/product-reviews/0620219637/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1</a></p>

<p>And NO, I&#39;m not getting money off sales for this. I don&#39;t care how you read this (borrow, download, steal), I just put the link to the homepage since I couldn&#39;t find a description to this book anywhere else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the same attitude as I do with this. It&#39;s just information. It&#39;s up to the reader to make an educated decision about whether the author was correct in his assumptions/ scientific approaches and research. Seriously though, I would not have recommended this book unless I thought it was so fantastic. I&#39;ve read through at least 50 textbooks for my schooling and nothing even came close to tying together so much math and science into their work. </p>

<p>BTW, the author also makes references to the expanding earth, as he mentions how plate techtonics is pretty much impossible. I believe he also had a short theory about the earth being star-like, in the sense that stars expand as the they get older, and that the Earth and the planets are no different. </p>

<p>If you do get to read this book through please contact me after - or even during the read- I&#39;d love to discuss some aspects!</p>

<p>EDIT:: also, the expanding earth and the hollow earth theories do not have to be mutually exclusive. keep that in mind. have you seen this video for expanding earth? I think it is way more sound than plate techtonics...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, there is no way I could ever explain that anywhere near as well as he did. There&#39;s at least 3 chapters on that very topic. </p>

<p>I will attempt to answer it, but I&#39;m sure I will be very inaccurate, so don&#39;t eat me alive:</p>

<p>He explains that the extent of human drilling is only a small percentage of the entire diameter of the earth. The core samples taken show that the density of the earth stays the same (ever more compact) as you go deeper (this is what would cause the heat generation from the pressure of rocks in the mantle and the core in the traditional approach). But this is only based on maybe 10% of the diameter. These samples have essentially been made the BASIS of the value of gravity in all equations ever made. There is a fundamental assumption that all the old geniuses made that gravity was a constant. But this cant be known for sure since it is an assumption made from the effect of what they have seen on the Earth&#39;s surface alone. (There&#39;s a significant amount of info in the book about how gravity can and has changed during eclipses and on different planets) -again, this is a very shitty and probably inaccurate summation. </p>

<p>The book explains this part of the question perfectly. I&#39;ll go on anyway </p>

<p>So he mentions how gravity being a constant could be wrong then it would explain how all the other planets can be hollow as well. According to traditional theory, the center of the earth has the mantle and the core, which are essentially free flowing, but that would be impossible if density remained constant as you go since the mantle would be so dense that nothing would be able to move (he mentioned something about the change of states involved). Through seismic wave analysis, he noted a large amount of data that showed that the continuity of the earth increased for a while, but then reversed back to essentially the same continuity of the surface (so no dense compacted rocks, and no fluid/liquid mix)</p>

<p>As for the magnetic field, thats about 2 chapters worth, and it involved internal heat sources (that i really couldnt understand nearly as well as i would like). He mentioned at one point about the temperatures on the surface of venus, where the outside ambient temperature due to the sun is hundreds of degrees LOWER than the surface temperature of that planet. Which would only make sense if there was some type of internal heating.</p>

<p>Anyway, I realized after writing this, that without quoting the book directly, I take away from the credibility of the author. So I don&#39;t think I will reply to any more questions, I&#39;ll only answer whether topics are mentioned</p>

<p>Read the book, seriously!</p>

<p>Edit: typos and small errors</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I read your response, then got to the end and realized you are either trying to get people to buy the book or don&#39;t know enough about anything to actually give a fair response.  You aren&#39;t going to respond to questions?  There is only one question so far and that is mine.  Don&#39;t take this as hostile, just critical.  What do you have to lose in trying to explain the book or quote it, unless you are making money from it.</p>

<p>Also, gravity isn&#39;t a constant.  The whole acceleration of gravity or g=9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> is only true at sea level on the planet Earth.  The gravitational force is determined by Newton&#39;s Law of gravitation Gm_1m_2/r<sup>2(vector</sup> stuff).</p>

<p>Venus has high surface temperatures because of a runaway green house effect.  This could be an effect of internal heating but is not a directly caused by it.  Think of it this way, if you switched the position of Mars and Venus, Venus would be a cooler version of Earth.  (If you are curious, Mars wouldn&#39;t change it is too small).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how &quot;internal heat sources&quot; explain the magnetic core of the Earth better than the &quot;conventional&quot; theory that says the rotating nickel iron solid core churns the liquid iron core which creates a magnetic field (this is overly simplified to the point where I am probably wrong, I&#39;m not the geophysicist, my wife is and she isn&#39;t typing this response).  Anyways, moving charges creates a magnetic field, and anyways the rest is in your second semester physics course.</p>

<p>I look forward to your intelligent and thoughtful response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you answer my questions?  I&#39;ve read some of your past posts.  They all seem to be of the &quot;I&#39;m so skeptical, I&#39;m too skeptical&quot;.  You talk about how the &quot;institutional science&quot; is basically a giant conspiracy to only keep mainstream theories in the fore front.  But what sort of science is getting pushed out?  Many of the instances of dishonesty in science are when political or bureaucratic powers are influencing the scientists.  &quot;You don&#39;t get more grant money if you don&#39;t produce&quot; and when produce is give the answer the funder wants then you are faced with an ethical question.  Most scientists do the right thing some don&#39;t.  The same is true when you have people who are bringing up crack pot theories like hollow earth.  It&#39;s fun, I&#39;ll admit it.  I loved reading my Tarzan comics as a kid where Tarzan would hop in his air plane and go into the land of dinosaurs and yesteryear that was hollow earth.  But you know what?  It was Tarzan.  Tarzan isn&#39;t real.  Neither is hollow earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about I say I have been convinced that the Earth has a solid nickel iron core surrounded by a liquid iron core surrounded by a mantle and crust and stuff.  I have been convinced by evidence such as plate tectonics.  And that the explanation of how plate tectonics works can be further supported by evidence such as mars lacking mountain ranges because it lacks the internal heat and io having massive surface changes because of the gravitational pulls from Jupiter and its 3 sister moons.  This structure of the Earth&#39;s interior can also be corroborated with the observation of how waves produced by earthquakes propagate through the interior.  I have been convinced by the evidence that the &quot;conventional&quot; theories are conventional for a reason.  The evidence supports them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do appreciate your position because it&#39;s one held by convention and at this subreddit that&#39;s counterproductive. Unfortunately, that also doesn&#39;t support their validity necessarily.</p>

<p>Evidence can corroborate multiple conflicting theories. For instance, if I want to entertain directed energy or scalar wave attacks then a solid/liquid earth core is certainly easier to consider, but what about an artificial or natural construct that accommodates both as well as surface things like plate tectonics? A greater system can include lesser ones.</p>

<p>Another idea I&#39;ve run across is that the Earth is growing over time, like an organism might, implying it would also have a consciousness, which is a completely different area of thought than the science this thread is based on but which may ultimately end up bearing much more and stranger fruit. That the shapes of continents and mysteries of oceans are answered by it is still circumstantial. Of course none of it counts as science until repeatable experiments indicate a conclusion that withstands controversy... which I would expect could only arise the moment we observe what is at the depths we&#39;re curious about more physically directly than the sonar-like methods which may be thrown off &quot;relatively&quot; simply. Again, theories can overlap.</p>

<p>Besides, where else would the reptilian/Annunaki overlords be hiding during the destruction of Atlantis that encircles the whole world as told in myths and legends that predate the written history we&#39;ve been allowed by convention? It actually makes more sense this way for why the world order is so twisted and corrupt, I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s an element of human nature when those two words together are something of an oxymoron at times...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only meant to say that a consensus does not a reality make. Observational evidence of geology in the rest of the solar system may help increase our understanding, but does not explain the whole mystery, of the unique conditions we experience here on Earth. The problem with running the numbers on an object so massive is that a pocket of even 10 cubic km at an astronomical density would immediately throw off all our precious calculations.

    <div class="md"><p>So you are saying without 100% proof there is a high probability of it being false.  100% true doesn&#39;t happen in science.

    <div class="md"><p>First off - starting two posts in a row with &quot;so you are saying&quot; implies to me you can agree with my premise for the reason you don&#39;t know for sure what that may entail, and hurts the logical phrasing of your overall argument - especially if it resorts so much to analogy. On the other hand the rest of what you say, which again appears to me falsely or at least not complete, is not using the number I would like. 99.99%, likely with two to four more significant digits following, is a much more accurate figure representing the state of our world than a cold number like 100. Because it&#39;s then that microscopically small chance that becomes important, and the level of your precision makes it that more aggravating. What&#39;s the smallest chance? Can&#39;t answer that with science and I agree with you on that.</p>

<p>Taking what you said and riffing off what I just did - if you saw a vision of the future wherein you die, how much does that change your probability totaling procedure for determining whether you&#39;d die or not?</p>

I dealt with it all the way up to Shards of Alara and couldn&#39;t do it anymore.  When I have cards that I love that are made obviously obsolete by new cards it just.  Like the lands from ?urza&#39;s? that could produce two colors and tap when you play, you have lands that produce three colors now.  It just got annoying.  Also, all my friends stopped playing.  Haha.  I think that was the real reason I stopped.  I starting playing warhammer 40k.  It&#39;s fun.  I like painting a lot.  It is very relaxing after a weeks worth of work.</p>

I read something on the official site that convinced me Planeswalkers were necessary as a design tool for any problem that may arise - naturally they&#39;re the bane of my existence and have absolutely upended card prices for all time to come. 60 bucks for a Standard rare now with Jace the freaking Mind Sculptor.

    <div class="md"><p>I have a single friend for Warhammer that lives around here, then another that lives 1000 miles away.  I hate the planeswalkers.  A long time ago YOU were the planeswalker, and before that you were the all powerful wizard.  Now you and lion man and blue man and whoever, I cant remember their names are cool like you.  I built a deck of cards in response to the new cards out of only cards from 7th edition and before.  Essentially all of the cards that came out before they changed the design of the card.  The idea was card advantage based on enchantment play with cheap creatures.  So cards like Yavimaya Enchantress who gets buffs from enchantments but only costs 2G, and then cards like Verduran Enchantress 1GG that lets me draw a card whenever I play an enchantment.  Obviously Rancor is a great choice here because its G and you can keep playing it.  Rayne, Academy Chancellor gives me added drawing abilities and Mother of Runes is a great all around defensive strategy.</p>

I never suggested you buy the book, just find a way to read it (if I had an ebook link i would have posted it). It will change your life and answer all your questions better than I ever could. There is way too much evidence in that book for me to ever summarize properly. And when I try and summarize, I only get people like you who tell me i&#39;m wrong about it. In that i&#39;m sure you are correct, but only because I did not lay things out perfectly as the author has. What I&#39;m trying to say, is that it would literally take a book for me to explain these things with enough precision and evidence to ever convince anyone, and I don&#39;t see the point of copying the author&#39;s work when you can just read the book and get back to me on what you have read. </p>

<p>I can see that you have a reasonable amount of intelligence on these subjects, and for that, I would recommend this book to you even more. Borrow it off a friend, steal it, I don&#39;t care. But i guaranatee you will find it enlightening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll explain because this is <em>exactly</em> what I thought before I read anything about hollow earth theory.  Solid earth is the only model taught anywhere and so hollow initially seems insane/crackpot/science-fiction.</p>

<p>Imagine the early solar system.  Matter is clumping together out of the attractions of gravity (same as in the popular theory.)  Here is the difference... as it comes together it is also spinning... so there is an attraction force (gravity) and a centrifugal force (from the spinning).  (Spinning is a part of the current theory as well but the centrifugal force - an established important part of physics - is ignored.)  If you tie a weight to a string and play with it you will quickly see that the centrifugal force pushing outward depends upon angle.  Let&#39;s say we have a round clump of Earth spinning.  At the equator the centrifugal force is the strongest and this force decreases as you move toward either pole.  The are 3 places in the spinning sphere of mass that have no no centrifugal force:  the center of the sphere and the entire axis of spin.  This <em>could</em> form an outer shell of earth (which we know and love) with a hole at the north and south pole (no centrifugal force there).  At the center of the earth there should be another inner lump of mass (maybe a molten iron inner core which gives us a magnetic field) which could have come in through the poles (no centrifugal force) or might have accumulated early in the accretion process before the matter was spinning fast enough for centrifugal forces to push the material out to the &quot;shell&quot;.  Complicated but possible?  A shell earth might also contain molten rock for volcanoes etc.  It could also fit with the expanding earth theory - no reason the shell couldn&#39;t expand if it is essentially a big shell of molten rock held together by gravity and centrifugal forces with a (comparatively) thin cooled shell which we walk around upon and live upon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, there is no way I could ever explain that anywhere near as well as he did. There&#39;s at least 3 chapters on that very topic. </p>

<p>I will attempt to answer it, but I&#39;m sure I will be very inaccurate, so don&#39;t eat me alive:</p>

<p>He explains that the extent of human drilling is only a small percentage of the entire diameter of the earth. The core samples taken show that the density of the earth stays the same (ever more compact) as you go deeper (this is what would cause the heat generation from the pressure of rocks in the mantle and the core in the traditional approach). But this is only based on maybe 10% of the diameter. These samples have essentially been made the BASIS of the value of gravity in all equations ever made. There is a fundamental assumption that all the old geniuses made that gravity was a constant. But this cant be known for sure since it is an assumption made from the effect of what they have seen on the Earth&#39;s surface alone. (There&#39;s a significant amount of info in the book about how gravity can and has changed during eclipses and on different planets) -again, this is a very shitty and probably inaccurate summation. </p>

<p>The book explains this part of the question perfectly. I&#39;ll go on anyway </p>

<p>So he mentions how gravity being a constant could be wrong then it would explain how all the other planets can be hollow as well. According to traditional theory, the center of the earth has the mantle and the core, which are essentially free flowing, but that would be impossible if density remained constant as you go since the mantle would be so dense that nothing would be able to move (he mentioned something about the change of states involved). Through seismic wave analysis, he noted a large amount of data that showed that the continuity of the earth increased for a while, but then reversed back to essentially the same continuity of the surface (so no dense compacted rocks, and no fluid/liquid mix)</p>

<p>As for the magnetic field, thats about 2 chapters worth, and it involved internal heat sources (that i really couldnt understand nearly as well as i would like). He mentioned at one point about the temperatures on the surface of venus, where the outside ambient temperature due to the sun is hundreds of degrees LOWER than the surface temperature of that planet. Which would only make sense if there was some type of internal heating.</p>

<p>Anyway, I realized after writing this, that without quoting the book directly, I take away from the credibility of the author. So I don&#39;t think I will reply to any more questions, I&#39;ll only answer whether topics are mentioned</p>

<p>Read the book, seriously!</p>

Observational evidence of geology in the rest of the solar system may help increase our understanding, but does not explain the whole mystery, of the unique conditions we experience here on Earth.
