       Its just a long rant about the coverup and the "lies of the offical story," a giant info dump of "evidence." This was an active post, the article seemed to resonate with people. It had NOT ONE CITATION. So I tried to fix this. And failed. In 5 minutes of fact checking I was able to stop propagating bad evidence and was reminded to refocus on the good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we please, at least here on reddit - where we would like to set a higher standard for ourselves - stop linking to blog posts and making empty statements 'of evidence'. Instead, lets ALWAYS cite sources. Lets ALWAYS check facts, and lets make
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/911truth">
        /r/911truth
       </a>
       places where people can come and see what serious research looks like.

       That's great advice.  One thing that I think would be helpful is a repository of sorts for video clips, newspaper articles, interviews, etc.  A lot of the same things circulate, and it would be nice if everything was labeled easily for others to correctly cite.

       Obviously theres a "where to draw the line" problem on whats "citable" and what isnt. What matters is that you cite primary sources (interview transcripts, official documents, photographs and videos linked to the original photographer, physical materials, etc). Even if you dont cite primary materials, you still need to show where YOU got the information. At least that way a reader can traceback your research, even if they disagree with the source material, instead of dismissing everything out of hand because its just a bunch of isolated "facts" without any explanation of where they came from. Whether youre defending or attacking the official story, it is never valid to build an argument on evidence that are simply "common knowledge" or hearsay, or "something I heard somewhere"

       The government isn't a primary source.  Primary sources allow for novel but incorrect interpretations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's much better to cite secondary sources that reference, discuss, and evaluate the primary source, and you debate their read of the primary source.

       You are right. Many government publications are secondary sources. I agree that what we should be doing engaging in debate, about how to interpret, collect, and validate what evidence we do get from primary sources. But no matter what the context, the supporting material for a sound argument must be a primary source. Of course, if what what youre debating is another's interpretation of events (e.g. articles, op-eds, books, blogs) then, in that context, those materials ARE primary sources.  However, if you are presenting your own interpretation, then you build off a foundation of primary sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easiest way to loose an argument if your opponent accuses your evidence as being false. If publish with a good bibliography, the burden is on the opponent to dig through all your material and try to attack your sources. Without a bibliography, you loose by default. Its embarrassing when I see conversations that go like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Friend, did you know that 10 of the 19 supposed hijackers are still alive, I think you should consider some of what the 911 truthers have to say!"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Still alive!? Pfft, thats ridiculous, they ALL DIED ON 911!"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "No I am serious, people have found them alive, some of them even came forward to defend themselves when they saw their own faces on the news!"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "Bullshit, there are ton of people in the world, Im sure someone with the same name and rough appearance just THOUGHT they were the ones on the news. Who told you this? Where did you get your information"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "Its just the truth. They really found them!"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        "whose they?"
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       "The people, the researchers and stuff..."
      </p>
      <p>
       -"Ohh, right...those people...im gonna go now, you should get your head checked"
      </p>
      <p>
       A better response would have been cite the various interviews with the non-hijackers when they came forward to various journalists, which you could find in David Ray Griffiths bibliography from "The 911 Commission Report, Omissions and Distortions"
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, then you would be at about the same Journalistic level as
       <a href="http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Hijackers_still_alive">
        here
       </a>
       , where the author uses a few secondary cites, and plenty of unsupported assertions arguing that the supposed hijackers are, in fact, missing - including .

       It takes a community of people, with diverse fields of study, working together to build a compelling theory that opposes the historical record. Done properly, such research is the life's work of many historians and anthropologists. Just because 911 is only 9 years old, doesnt exempt it from being studied with the same rigor as academics apply to studying more minor events such as the what sort of

       If technical reports arnt your thing, try cataloging transcripts of interviews with eye witnesses - or assembling the stock market trading data for 9/01-9/14. Perhaps build a photo-archive of pictures of the pentagon. Or identify exactly which businesses/buildings have a view of the explosion at the pentagon- like
