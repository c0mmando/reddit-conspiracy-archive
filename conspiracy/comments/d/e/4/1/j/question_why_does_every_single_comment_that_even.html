       Has there been a 100% conclusive verdict reached by reputable researches that even mentioning "9/11 might have been an inside job" is a silly and misinformed thing to say? Or is it because people are sensitive abut this issue and don't want to talk about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember watching a 'film' called Loose Change, about half a decade back which addressed this issue. To me, their logic sounded reasonable and it caused me to lean towards calling conspiracy. If the film I watched was an incredibly misinformed one, I would like to know how some of the arguments from it are overthrown.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always yearn to know the truth and be rational about everything, so I was hoping you people could shed some light on this matter.

       Edited for extra truthiness:
      </p>
      <p>
       What you say is horrible for the reason that the case was never opened.
      </p>
      <p>
       19 "already-guilty" conspirators on Day and practically Hour One does not a case shut, it opens the vital question of how their identities (and that of their ringleader, never mind connection to Iraq) were found so quickly yet their actions responded to so slowly -- if at all. The 9/11 Commission failed at this and has admitted so.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the same individuals authored (more or less fraudulent) reports on behalf of different government agencies exhibits a conflict of interests, just to incompletely dissuade any suspicion of demolition or planning, is grounds for "appeal" when no such theory was even considered in order to be legitimately ruled out by evidence-based logic, witness testimony, or otherwise. Why don't you even READ the reports that shut your so-called case?
      </p>
      <p>
       There hasn't been the coordinated, comprehensive, public investigation of internal affairs your comment indicates. It's ridiculous that this must be argued half-point by half-point to brain-dead American consumers of television who also readily accept the explanation for why the economy is tanking. That's where we need to start. Hint: it's because tanks are expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extra hint: The War on Terror is a fraud. Get that through your skulls, people, before the bullets do.

       As I said before you went on your little tirade that it is a considered a shut case now. It has nothing to do with what I believe, you believe, or anyone else believes. I love it when people sit there and throw proof at me telling me why it was a conspiracy. I never said it wasn't. People never read what another person says they just believe that it is an attack on their beliefs.

       A valid question, without a black and white answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, if someone links to anything remotely legitimate, and not just a random youtube vid, they get an upvote from me for contributing and providing something close to evidence.  If someone just throws out wild claims without any reasonable evidence to support, its bullshit and hurts the quality of the subreddit, so it gets downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I don't downvote just because someone cannot prove a point beyond a doubt, only if claims are made without support.

       So, if you got a scientific report on lab analysis of soil and particle matter found at the site, you would understand its implications?  That's my problem with all this proof stuff, how many of us can actually use science to prove any data we see?

       With all due respect if you are asking for 'evidence' from others at this point you have either just woken up from a 9 year coma or been introduced to the wonders of the internet yesterday. All the evidence you need is at your disposal, invest the time.

       That's why you're here.  You require a black and white answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you did some looking and listening to simple videos on youtube....you'd hear explosions....you're see FREE FALL SPEEDS.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need someone to tell you because you don't want to do the thinking or you don;t have the capacity to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free fall speeds should make you say "wtf" and then the desire to be SURE you haven't been LIED to all this time should kick in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consequences of being LIED to all this time and finding out about it, and exacting judgment on the real perpetrators is BETTER than going your whole life denying it and waking up in 25 years and realizing you basically SUPPORTED the whole thing by ignoring it.

       No, but there are plenty of people around here that seem to be intent on discouraging any real discussion, both by trolling incessantly and by making outrageous claims. If someone does it for a few weeks they could just be an immature asshole, but if they persist for months and years it could be their job.

       There is a certain amount of knee-jerk downvoting. In a perfect world it wouldn't happen, but there are so many trolls and saviors attacking us "truthers" and sabotaging the threads it is understandable that some develop a hair trigger response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a lot of the time the people "asking" for information have a history of making comments ranging from condescending to extremely insulting. It doesn't take long for people to realize that an abusive poster itsn't likely to add to the conversation and downvote to reduce the noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're fairly abrasive yourself and defend outright abusive posters, in my opinion you're getting downvoted partially for that reason. If you look through the threads there are plenty of examples of people asking for information with no downvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other reason is you did not ask for information, you demand evidence that meets your standards and you were unpleasant about it. No one here owes you anything and we don't care if the information we choose to consider doesn't meet your standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of us do not agree on which conspiracies are valid and in the case of 911 have varying views of the events and who is responsible. You are free to have your own view and as long as you don't try to force your view on the rest of us or demean our opinions, I don't think there would be a lot of downvotes. Just my opinion of course.

       9/11 Commissioner Bob Kerrey said that "There are ample reasons to suspect that there may be some alternative to what we outlined in our version . . . We didn't have access . . . ." He also said that

       Once you realize that the commission was flawed, you have to consider that the truth was not all reveled.
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point, you realize that it is incredible that anyone who agrees that the 911 commission was compromised for whatever reason, would not support a new independent investigation of the biggest massacre in America since the federal government massacred the Indians?

       I think you need to be a little more critical.  What would you think of someone if they told you something in conversation that you know is completely untrue?  Either they are a liar or they are incompetent.  Now look at NIST and the 9/11 commission.  Anytime members are confronted with questions that deal with reports of explosions, they act flabbergasted and act as if they are hearing about such a thing for the very first time.  Anyone who watched the events unfold that day with a decent memory can clearly remember multiple reports of explosions.  Anyone who's watched replays of the events, such as those aired on MSNBC on the 9/11 anniversaries, clearly heard about explosions.  And anyone who's watches clips on the internet hear clear and multiple examples of first responders reporting explosions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why are these investigators so clueless?  There must be only two explanations, either they are incompetent in doing their job, OR they are blatantly lying.  So which is it, and what makes you more comfortable when these are the people who are constantly cited as the "final say" in what happened that day?
      </p>
      <p>
       The least people can ask for is a general recognition of the obvious, which is the NIST report is a crock and possibly a white wash.  It is so obvious, that people may confront others with a slight bit of patronization because to them, others who don't see it are clearly in some sort of denial, or lack the simple skills necessary to see through what most may perceive as "bullshit."

       That's why you're a denier.  You don't think about much of anything.  Insulting the man just shows what kind of person you are, and motives.

       It's just a user name; that was my point. Take it easy, champ.

       Ah, but you are obviously such a deep thinker. Listen, I don't give a damn what you think about me, or what you think about what I think about Gore Vidal. If you'll recall, my original post was about the lack of evidence for any government involvement in 9/11, and all you replied with was an attack against me and my choice of user name.

       The information is all at your fingertips. The truth cannot be told it can only be realized. Dare to venture down the rabbit hole and begin connecting the dots. If it is the truth you seek, the truth you shall find. Just be ready for it. Most people are not and hence their defence mechanism kicks in at the slightest hint of 'inside job' talk. The big picture becomes very clear when you use 9/11 as your spring board. One thing leads to another and i warn you- the deeper you go the harder it is to turn back. Open your mind and try to use uncontaminated critical thinking. We have all been conditioned since birth so look at your search as a quest to de-program and see things for what they really are. Start by turning off all mainstream media. Good luck.

       I think I have an answer to your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no majority of people who read this subreddit or any other. That "majority" is so disinterested in following through on fact-based research that they skip to other people's conclusions, with or without that kind of thorough background, instead, because they don't have any affiliation to/familiarity with any related subject or field of interest when they're going through Reddit comments and voting on posts. They also identify themselves with the majority they imagine themselves to be defending. They want to find as many conclusions as possible to support whatever theory was prominent in that majority mind before they visit the sub, unless of course they're like you and me, because of speed and efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when they show up and find that this stuff takes time and god-forbid patience to unearth and work out for oneself to undo that colossal fraud we reasonable conspiracy folks see every day, it's much faster and easier to label/file it away as crackpot/kook theory if it does so much as peel away at their solidly constructed reserves of fantasy. Truth and rationality aren't selling points, they're foundational and are easily overlooked, and hard to prove they're hiding under there.

       I don't understand your reasoning. It doesn't matter what else a comment contains if you choose to be abusive to the other people in the conversation. Try it sometime, approach a group of people who are talking and when a question is asked answer it, call them all idiots as well.

       Look around you.  How many posts do you see upvoted in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       that are not pro-truther?  I think its very reasonable to say that you won't get a full view of the issue here, as only one side is represented.
      </p>
      <p>
       And disagreeing, even in a less than respectful manner, does not equal non-contributing if the point behind it is sound.  Are you really claiming that there are equal parts pro and anti-truther in r/conspiracy?

       What I cannot understand is why an "anti-truther" would come here at all? If you don't think there is anything to the conspiracy, why go to a place that is set aside to discuss it? Other than disrupting the conversation and annoying people what could you hope to accomplish?
      </p>
      <p>
       So no there are not many upvoted comments or submissions showing that 911 is not a conspiracy. Since this is
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       I don't see a problem with that either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again you and others are not just disagreeing, you are actively insulting everyone that doesn't believe the official explanation. If this was
       <a href="/r/911_official_information">
        /r/911_official_information

       that might be contributing, but in a place dedicated to unofficial explanations it is disruptive at best.

       So, you and Fountainhead are in agreement.  Looking here for topics which do not support 9/11 conspiracies would be as fruitless as looking for topics which support evolution at a creationist website.

       In r/conspiracy 9/11 truth is not downvoted at all (ie hijackers still alive got about 100 votes the other day).  In other /r/'s it is mostly because the points advanced by 9/11 truthers are ridiculous (wait and see some gems to this post..free fall...silverstien...thermite paint).  Truthers will tell you its cause the rest of reddit are sheep, and afraid of the truth, but the fact is many have read all the arguments and determined for themselves that the majority of 'truther' points are simply misinformed and wilfully ignorant of reality.

       Has there been a 100% conclusive verdict reached by reputable researchers (sic) that even mentioning "Deep within the planet venus is a secret cave full of Forbidden Pez Flavors" is a silly and misinformed thing to say?"  ...No, but if people do not see any compelling evidence that suggests that there is, then they will downvote you whenever you suggest it.

       Hey, if you're confident you're right and you definitely cannot be wrong about it, then MOVE ON.  Get on with it.  Screw off and let us poor misguided souls talk about whatever we want.  You're definitely right, so we will only be talking about nothing for who knows how long.

       So?  Why don't you make like a tree, and get the hell out of here?  Adults are talking about solid facts, like nano spheres in the WTC dust and WTC7 falling because of "fire".  The Pentagon and the NORTH side flyover.  Talking about the real evidence.  The stuff you don't have the capacity to understand.....or are paid to ignore.

       No you get down voted because of all the information out there, you still hold the opinion that 9/11 being a conspiracy is "stupid".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some obvious, BLATANT questions still standing.  So when you say they're stupid, things like buildings falling at FREE FALL SPEEDS, that is not stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physics didn't take a break that day.  So saying that the building coming down at FFS is stupid, means you're denying the physical laws that we all live with every day.  They didn't go on hiatus on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT is stupid.  The opinion that something is stupid, when architects and engineers are denying it could have happened, and YOU say it could have.......THAT is stupid.  Your opinion, given to your by the media Vs. years and years of engineering experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why I down vote you.  Not because I disagree with your opinion, you can have one.  Just understand that is based on ZERO fact whatsoever.

       Questions remain, but the manner in which you seem to force this free fall speed question seems desperate, because that doesn't appear to have any impact on the actual 9/11 conspiracy... at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize there are "engineers and architects" on both sides of the fence, right?   It's not stupid to have an opinion based on observations of events.   You should upvote those you disagree with, because you are then having an intelligent, adult discussion without resorting to emotionally charge actions like "Take that blue arrow fucker!".   That's childish man.

      <p>
       WTC1 and 2 came down in about 10-11 seconds.  Do some simple math.  Divide the floors by those seconds and how many floors do you get per second?  LOTS.  Whatever number you come up with.......is free fall speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       No resistance.  Think of the buildings floors hitting each floor.  100 or 110 times is more than 2 minutes for that impossible scenario to occur.  No pancake theory.....just buildings coming down in less than 13 seconds.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What does Free fall speeds mean to you?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Me: Free fall in a vacuum, any object with mass will accelerate at 9.8m/s² to ~56m/s terminal velocity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why the "what the hell are you talking about?"  Did you forget what you asked me?
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim there was no resistance.   There was observable evidence that this is not the case.  There was initial resistance at the top when the first of the floors began buckling. Once momentum built up, there would be little to nothing to resist the mass times the acceleration.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to recap:
      </p>
      <p>
       Your claim:  ZOMG they fell at freefall speeds! I don't know what it means but something isn't right!
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual:     There was measurable resistance initially(by seismic activity and other ways) , then much less so once the momentum built up.  That doesn't mean there was any violation of physics or some grand explosion that made it that way.  You're simply extrapolating that to fit your viewpoint.

       You actually think when a force with any kind of inertia impacting with a standing structure with zero inertia will actually cause an ACCELERATION?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know the laws of inertia?  Its kind of the OPPOSITE of what you're talking about.

       So if I shove you into your buddy......when you tow collide, do you both accelerate because you hit each other??  No.
      </p>
      <p>
       His standing mass SLOWS YOU DOWN.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when the buildings don't slow down and continue to accelerate, that means all the mass (building structure) below it was no longer there to RESIST the initial fall or collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       AKA, something was moving material out of the way.......no resistance except for air resistance.

      <p>
       The falling mass gains inertia via gravity.  This falling mass with gained inertia impacts this "zero inertia" matter, which outweighed the "slowdown" from the impact with the zero inertia.  What happened to the extra inertia from acceleration?  Did you forget to account for that in your maths?

       Lets make this simple.  The small bit that falls off, hits the bigger bit underneath......but was able to "outweigh" the "slowdown"?  As such the smaller bit was able to crush the larger bit underneath utterly and completely?

      <p>
       Are you making things up?

       Can you watch this for me, and tell me how this professor is incorrect, and you are somehow correct?

       While I think 7 may have been pulled, it was already damaged from the fallen buildings and had multiple explosions /fires going for 6-7 hours.  I think if it was pulled, the support structures at bottom were taken out and the building imploded. Not much resistance there.  Near free fall would be standard.
      </p>
      <p>
       The negligible resistance in WTC 1 and 2 was observable by the material being launched outward.  Once the first 2-5-10-18-24 floors were on their way down, inertia increased with the mass. Another aspect to it is that, from the impact of the planes, the core support structures were also damaged, not there entirely on certain floors, or i'm sure "some" were untouched and began bearing the load of the missing/damaged ones.  This extra load built tension into the structure, so that when the floors finally caved above the impact area, it started a chain reaction downward. There was just no where near the resistance it would take to withstand 10, then 20, then 30, then 40 falling floors' inertia.  Some of the energy expelled debris outward, but most was directed downward via gravity.

       NIST already admitted that the damage to the building was not a factor in that.  Sorry, you can't use that excuse any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inertia increaed sure, but not because it JOINED with any other material to create some sort of crushing energy.  That's not how it works.  You're making this up from your imagination man!  That video shows it exactly, its the same thing as a "building being pulled" just as you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       That smaller bit does not have the ability to crush the rest of the building beneath it, not because it has inertia.  Not because it "gained" inertia.  It WOULD slow down had it impacted anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as you say, material was spewed out the sides, but you don't think about HOW that is possible?  Fire does have the energy to do that, and just because the building starts its collapse, doesn't mean it suddenly has magical powers to toss crap out and into the buildings next to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, one last point.  The building was constructed in three sections.  The bottom being the strongest as it had to carry the heaviest load.  The middle was build just like that, in the middle of the road.  The top was the lightest with technically, the least amount of "strength", and therefor, the least amount of material.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that knowledge, I don't think even you can deny that the smallest and least amount of material could pummel its way through the bottom two stronger sections of untouched building.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're describing is not possible.  It cannot build inertia as it goes through material.  As you admit, material was tossed out the sides.  The cause of that is explosives.  These are beams that weight tons, and concrete that is held together by millions of rivets and then welded together.  An acre in size.  Tonnes of material.
      </p>
      <p>
       It cannot and does not just spew stuff because part of the building falls off the top.  You've seen the footage.  The one where it slips to the side looks like its going over, but as soon as it emerges from the dust, the top had turned to rubble!  What caused that?  The top should be pristine until it hits the ground.

       So falling floors and materials that come in contact with more material wouldn't build mass and eject some out all sides?  That is impossible?

      <p>
       To clarify, this is for 1 and 2, not for 7.   The footage indicates this exactly, from every angle, from every report.  This is precisely what led to 7 even getting damaged. The buildings did not just fall exactly into their footprint, they had specific diameters of material/damage.  This is not really debatable, so please explain why you feel a building is, when falling, not able to """"magically"""" toss material out on all sides.

      <p>
       Since the core structures of both towers were severely damaged, the reinforcement of the lower floors (not debating that) was no match for the falling mass/inertia.  Most of the middle/bottom floors were subjected to the falling mass, and had nothing that could withstand that amount of force.  Could there have been a longer delay on the way down?  Maybe, but the sheer size of the buildings, combined with the amount of mass that began falling proved to be too much for any of the lower floors/support structures to withstand.   Keep in mind, that when they both fell, there were support structures at the bottom still standing, just not the floors themselves.

      <p>
       You nearly hit the head on the nail here.   Tons of material, tons of concrete, and beams that weighed tons.   They were no match (no matter how may rivets!hehe) for the mass/inertia that was brought upon them on the way down.  The top was impossible to retain shape as it slammed into material below, causing more material to spew out of the sides.   You claim it is not possible, but that is exactly what happened. You could at least claim it is improbable, and that more buildings of the same size need to be brought down for further testing, but to you, with no valid research, metrics, or math behind it, it is impossible.

       I am still suspicious of the agenda of those in power.  I am of the "they let it happen" side.  If they used explosives, or they fell as they say from fire and damage ("naturally"),well either way (it barely matters anymore) "mission accomplished" still occurred in that they only had to murder 3000 humans to accomplish their multinational goals... money and power.    It was a successful, powerful, impactful way of advancing an agenda of unknown portions, possibly global domination.

       The lump in my stomach should never go away, because understanding, peace, prosperity, good will towards all will not occur in my human lifespan (which is hopefully a lot longer than 25 years).

       Then you cited a web site who has these curious little blurbs are part of his analysis.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The NIST report states that the initial collapse occurred at about free-fall. 
The above independent analysis by me confirms this.

       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The collapse starts at plane level. The top section falls at free-fall, but initially does not cause the building below to collapse. The lower section was still supporting the building 2+ seconds into the collapse.  However, as the top section smashed into the the lower section, no slowing of the rate of descent was observed. We will discuss the implications of this later. Don't take my word for anything. Belief is the enemy of truth.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So you have me a little confused.  As far as I can tell this is just some guy.  I don't think his website is anything claimed to be scientific in nature but maybe you can go ahead and just fill me in on that.  Either way, you let me know what he is actually saying in these quotes.

       The steps involved:
       <br/>
       initial collapse, then initial resistance, then further (total)collapse at
       <strong>
        near
       </strong>
       free fall speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you even read that article? Sure, take it with a grain of salt, but don't deny it completely by claiming confusion or contradiction.  It doesn't contradict itself. It says there was an initial collapse (near free fall speeds, it never says AT free fall speeds....) then initial resisitance (verrrry brief resistance.. almost disappointingly so)  then again back to NEAR free fall speeds.  Nowhere in NIST  or that article or any article is there a claim AT freefall speeds.  You can not simply drop 1 ton, 2 tons, however may tons of concrete and steel, onto anything that will provide "seconds" of pause during the fall.  The weight/mass of the object falling generates x amount of inertia to be transfered to the matter below. Beyond all of this, everyone hops on the "pancake theory", but the floors didn't fall uniformly at nearly any part of the collapse. The internal support structures  were damaged and began buckling before the floors collapsed.  It is just that it "appears" the floors fell on each other, when internally that was not the case.
