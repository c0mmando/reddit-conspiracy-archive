<p>We do not know what these codes mean, but it considered </p>

<p>These are alerts to &quot;All Stations&quot; before the codes are sent. I did my best to record all these but missed recording &quot;the alert phrase&quot; where they said &quot;All stations, all stations.&quot; This has all happened in the last half hour (0230-0304 EST).
I didn&#39;t record these or write this up btw, this was a thread from 4chan that popped up on /pol/

<p>The fact ts five letter blocks to me says it&#39;s just real basic substitution encryption.</p>

<p>The apparent block size has nothing to do with the complexity of the cipher.<br/>
You can split any data into five character blocks.</p>

<p>Besides, &quot;basic&quot; substitutions (I suppose you mean letter by letter substitutions) are very easy to crack and useless.</p>

<p>It&#39;s probably a stream cipher, and if the encryption is manual it would be a one time pad.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t 1942 so forget about breaking the code.</p>

<p>Those terms refer to error correcting codes, not ciphers.</p>

But who knows, maybe :) If he is, we wouldn&#39;t know, nobody knows just who exactly is involved or aware of the plan on either side of the problem. Drake is the only guy to ever speak of it publicly. He says he was told to do so by some folks in the Pentagon who have been involved with the plan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My limited knowledge on this is that coded government messages have historically been sent out via these &quot;number stations&quot;. They are radio frequencies not meant for public consumption. </p>

<p>Spies and officials are given a &quot;one time pad&quot;, a codex for the message they are meant to uncover. This could be wrong, but I believe the call sign is the hint that the message is actually important, and not just garbled data to throw off unwanted listeners. Because normally that&#39;s all these stations play, are just numbers and Alpha Phonetic NATO messages. </p>

<p>Previously, these stations have gone very active during important events, such as the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those frequencies are not SKYKING, those frequencies are part of the US Military HF-GCS network.  This network does carry SKYKING transmissions, but that is only part of the traffic the network carries.</p>

<p>These recordings appear to be standard EAM like messages and similar messages happen every day, many times a day.  Regardless of World events.</p>

<p>The callsigns COLLAPSE and FLATTOP and how often they are heard have no specific meaning.  These tactical rotating callsigns are selected from a callsign pool.  The exact methodology of the selection has never been released, but it is quite likely to be random selection.</p>

<p>Also, this station / network is not considered a &quot;numbers station&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it one more time: You are not a targeted individual, you are a crazy person. nobody is stalking you. You are not important enough to watch. You are a loser. nobody cares what you are doing until you try to do it to their daughter. Speaking of which... stay away from people&#39;s daughters. Better yet, stay in your mom&#39;s basement and don&#39;t come out...ever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude relax. I wonder why you feel the need to attack and belittle this particular poster (as you&#39;ve posted in pretty much every thread he has made on gangstalking recently)? </p>

<p>This is not about whether he is being stalked or not, but about being a decent human being that doesn&#39;t engage in personal attacks against others, especially not on an online forum. 
I suggest you chill out, take a good look at your life and figure out why you have the need to attack and insult people that you don&#39;t  know anything about.</p>

<p>If you think the poster is delusional,  you should refrain from replying to their posts or threads, because I see no way in which your behavior is productive or indicative of a person  that has any compassion for others. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your reply genuinely saddens me. It seems you feel like people that have mental health issues &quot;deserve the worst&quot; and need to be insulted, attacked and ridiculed.  I wonder how you would feel if you or someone you cared for had similar feelings of paranoia as this guy. </p>

<p>All of your replies are devoid of any compassion and humanity and if the majority of people would act and think like you, this world would be a much worse place than it already is.  Thank god people exist that don&#39;t ridicule those that have problems but instead choose to help them.</p>

<p>I suggest you think about how you interact with people online. I hope you don&#39;t do the same when talking to people face to face. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say &quot;don&#39;t give advice to people who don&#39;t ask for it&quot; and yet you are giving advice to someone you dubbed a &quot;lunatic&quot; and a &quot;loser&quot; to &quot;stay away from people&#39;s daughters&quot; and &quot;stay in their mom&#39;s basement&quot;, as well as claiming you are &quot;wanting him to realize he is a lunatic&quot;.</p>

<p>Sigh....to be honest I just wanted you to see and at least gain some awareness of how you&#39;re acting (and how you&#39;re trying to actively hurt and cause suffering to someone that already seems to have issues) , but if you can&#39;t see it, I&#39;m not going to try to make you conscious anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming your anger and hatred has some source in your personal life, but you should be aware that attacking others because you are having problems or emotional issues is absolutely never the solution.</p>

<p>Being nice and compassionate to people helps them a million times more than insulting and belittling them - <strong>especially</strong> if they have a mental illness. 
If there is any way that will make this man snap and kill someone, it is probably insulting and attacking him, not being nice.</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

I had never seen you on Reddit before, but when I saw your post I had to chime in. I always tell people who claim to be TIs that they are delusional, because they are. You are delusional! Then this morning, while reading about secret radio transmissions, I see another post from you about &quot;your gang-stalkers&quot;. You draw attention to yourself posting ridiculous shit about gang-stalkers in a thread about radio transmissions. I am not stalking you, but you have invaded my space with your insanity, so I will poke and prod you until you go away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m not saying its impossible to have a gang stalker, but just answer these questions to yourself.</p>

<p>Do I have anything special they want?
Could they justify paying a group of people to stalk me? To what end? Why would they waste all that money? On me?</p>

<p>I could understand if maybe you were in something special, and they were spying on you. Why would they reveal themselves though? Wat do they have to gain from fucking with you?</p>

<p>If they didn&#39;t like what you were doing they could just kill you and it would be way easier. You think the mob gives a fuck? I&#39;m not saying its not possible, but it so extremely unlikely that it seems silly to almost everybody. I bet you couldn&#39;t come up with one piece of tangible evidence. You couldn&#39;t get a picture of someone following you. It might be the hardest thing for you to ever admit to yourself, but you&#39;re probably hallucinating. My suggestion would be to lay off the drugs and get some sleep, or if it&#39;s not that then maybe see a physiatrist. It&#39;s your life that is slipping away, I couldn&#39;t imagine living in constant fear.</p>

<p>That being said I have heard conspiracy theories about secret groups using the government to harass people to see how suspectible they are to mind control. There is definitely some crazy shit out there, but chances are you&#39;re just crazy. </p>

<p>Just because it seems unbelievable or hard to accept doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be true. Lots of things like this are simply chemical imbalance or lack of sleep.</p>

<p>i never said i was gonna go on a killing spree. i said the purpose of gang stalking is to make the ti do just that, and thats one of the reasons why there&#39;s more random killings and mass murders, and its only gonna get worse.</p>
