<blockquote>
<p>We have introduced a new theory of space, energy and matter </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you have to introduce an entirely new theory of space, energy and matter to justify that the pyramids are power stations, then that seems a bit like putting the horse before the cart.</p>

<p>If you have such a ground-breaking discovery, then the bit about the pyramids is practically insignificant by comparison.</p>

<p>What anyone who had such a paradigm-changing theory should be doing is producing experiments to prove it, and backing it up with a full background of mathematical proofs, and tying it into what we already know. Not jumping straight to a pretty obscure claim of &quot;Hey, the Egyptian pyramids are totes power stations!&quot;</p>

<p>Also, the Ancient Egyptians apparently must have worked out this theory already, or they wouldn&#39;t have been been able to build such power stations, so it obviously can&#39;t be that complicated, so why has it taken this long for anyone to come up with it again?</p>

<p>Also, there are recently discovered scrolls (found in 2013) which comprise the world&#39;s oldest collection of papyri have sections that detail the final touches being done to the Pyramid of Khufu... so how come they aren&#39;t mentioning anything about power stations there, then?</p>

<p>Most likely scenario - their new theory is actually &quot;horse doo-doo&quot;.</p>

<p>Does magnetism exist???  Is it free??? </p>

<p>Do neodymium magnets exist?? are they powerful?</p>

<p>Can you convert that energy into some sort of a movement which in turn can be converted into electricity using coils? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t get out any more energy than you put in. In fact, you will simply waste energy fruitlessly. Also, a magnet is not really a power source at all.</p>

<p>Your free energy concepts come from a basic misunderstanding of the principles of how everyday generators and motors work.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;re inherently wrong in your thinking, because you&#39;re missing some of the facts. This is not solely your fault - you have been systematically mislead by people who use this as their business model.</p>

<p>To correct this error, I suggest you study <strong>first year</strong> electrical engineering which will crush this wrongness under foot. <strong>Everything</strong> within that level of learning is easily testable by yourself, so you won&#39;t need to rely on my word or anyone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>Or you can continue to believe what some stranger on Youtube claims. And even if you live to be very, very old, you will still not see them produce a working generator which you can use.</p>

His Wardenclyffe Tower, pictured above, was never finished, but his dream of providing energy to all points on the globe is still alive today.</p>
