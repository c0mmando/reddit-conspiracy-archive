        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">94</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/[deleted].html">[deleted]</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In January 2015, I began receiving reports by email, telephone and over Facebook of very specific symptoms from very specific locations under very specific spraying activity throughout Oregon. From my experience as a counselor, having had to do an internship for drug rehabilitation many long years ago, I instantly recognized that the symptoms were being caused, almost certainly, by lithium intake. How could so many people be suddenly dosed up on lithium? </p>

<p>And then it hit here in Reedsport, a tiny town on the central coast of Oregon. I had no more doubt. I posted my findings on the various FB pages.In direct response to these posts, the first letter from the whistle blower arrived on January 30, 2015. I at first thought it was another letter of complaint from someone who thought I had the solution to the horrors of Geoengineering. Instead, the letter is the real thing.For six months, I respected the danger this person, who uses the pseudonym Locke, was putting himself in and I was very discreet about who saw the letter. And I was very discreet in putting messages on the FB sites to confirm to Locke that I was working on his message. I used the letter as a teaching tool and it was very effective. Either readers were completely convinced of what is happening in Oregon or they went into horrified denial. The Geoengineering activists to whom I sent the letter almost always dismissed it, ignored it or immediately responded that they couldn’t do anything about it. This was very disappointing until I realized that the atrocity of Geoengineering, and these experiments, is on such a vast scale that each of us is struggling to fight in our own corner with very little mutual support.That being said, I finally sent the letter to Elana Freeland (author of Chemtrails, HAARP and the Full Spectrum Dominance of Planet Earth). She pointed out that despite Locke’s fears for his family, he is desperate to get the information out to the media, social media and beyond. So shall it be.</p>

<p>A second letter has surfaced, which I will quote from. It was received by HH in Medford around the first of March. Locke expresses his disappointment that the activists he had contacted never responded. Having had essentially the same non-response, I understand his frustration. So, after much research to back up Locke’s disclosures, here is the pertinent information from the whistle blower. His private information will remain private.We can deduce from his excellent use of English and from his job description, that he is well educated in a science field, probably a DSc or PhD, he is most likely in his late 30’s or early 40’s, and is equally at home outdoors as in a lab. His use of the name Locke indicates he knows American history. The original John Locke created the concept of the social contract and whole portions of his writings were copied into the US Constitution. Our Locke lives in central Oregon but travels the state extensively. He enjoyed his work up until it was subsumed for what he is describing.Excerpt from Locke’s first letter:“For example, I could have warned thousands of people of the ongoing (as of January 27th) spraying to manufacture air stagnation in the Rogue and Umpqua Valleys, as well as much of the Oregon Coast south of Florence. The artificially induced period of air stagnation is part of a larger experiment testing the efficacy of psychoactive chemical dispersal from high altitudes.</p>

<p>Currently, spraying is most intense along the coast itself and above inland valleys. The stagnant air currents in the region allow for more direct application of psychoactive agents to test populations. I have little formal contact with the chemistry department, but to my knowledge, Lithium is the primary substance being dispersed in the aforementioned experiment. Given the psychoactive/social nature of the ongoing tests, my department is playing a secondary role collecting water and soil samples. The Sociological Research Division however, has operatives throughout the region gathering a massive amount of data regarding the test population’s behavioral traits, like consumer habits, political engagement levels, and awareness of geoengineering programs. I would urge you to inform your friends and peers of this fact, as avoiding observation by refusing to take surveys and engaging in similar actions that can disrupt this sordid research. “Excerpt from Locke’s second letter:“These dispersal plumes contain lithium and other psychoactive compounds. The areas targeted as of March 1st are inland valleys and coastal towns south of Florence. Over the next two months, additional spraying operations will be conducted to increase targeting areas in the Portland metropolitan area.”In both letters, he explains that he is …”an employee of a weather data collection company and, by proxy, a subcontractor for the National Weather Service office in (central Oregon).</p>

<p>In my work for the aforementioned institutions, I collected data, e.g. soil samples, that were used to direct spraying operations for the last three years.”He sent these letters because of his own family crises which …. “made me recognize the inherent evil of using human beings and the natural environment as a laboratory. Ethical considerations should never be disregarded. Unfortunately at my workplace, they routinely are.”What he says is part of the picture of what is happening on a global scale: a complete absence of morality. Without compunction, these experimenters are capable of killing subjects with side effects or by doing an LD (lethal dose experiment).So here are the facts: For three years, up until July 2015 the small towns on the south coast of Oregon: Reedsport, Bandon, Brookings as well as the Klamath Basin and Rogue Valley’s small towns are being used to test lithium and psychoactive compounds on a regular schedule and have been used for such for the last three years. Soil samples are taken and social interviews carried out, and one can assume, medical records which are now computerized, are monitored.In July 2015 I began receiving reports from observers of symptoms other than from psychoactive compounds. The symptoms indicate an application of a pathogen (disease) component most likely correlated with the use of certain electromagnetic frequencies. </p>

<p>This has happened before during the last three years when a round of severe diarrhea was reported, almost entirely in women and female dogs (October – November, 2014).As of this month, September 2015, another step in this program of direct experimentation has occurred. Up until now, they have had to manufacture a weather inversion or stagnant air inversion to apply the lithium and psychoactive materials directly onto one spot. I noticed the new method of holding the lithium haze cloud in place first over the area in northern California where the massive fires have hit. Elana Freeland wondered if the multiple fine chemtrail lines were of aluminum or some other conductive metal that could interact with the lithium for military communications (C4 -command, control, communication, cyber warfare).At first I didn’t realize what I was seeing: hundreds of thin chemtrails throughout a lithium haze. Despite fairly high winds, the haze, with newly applied daily lines, stayed in one spot for daysOn Monday, September 21st, directly over Reedsport, my town, there was a little square cloud that had been placed there from a storm system up in Idaho. Despite offshore winds and the usual breeze along the Umpqua River valley, that square cloud stayed in place all day like a message seeking recognition.The next day, Tuesday, September 22nd, which is when I travel to the Coos Bay / North Bend, Oregon area to teach Tai Chi, the Geoengineers hit full bore soaking the area in lithium and some sort of psychoactive compound.</p>

<p>Let me explain that I had considered this kind of action to be nearly impossible because of the terraine of this area. It is wide open with vast bays and rivers and the ocean to the west, and always strong offshore winds every afternoon. Yet, here was an obvious haze application directly and very low over the entire area and it was holding in place. I wasn’t the only person experiencing vicious and intense symptoms.When I got home, I caught the radar image. It was exactly the same technique as was used over the fire zone in northern California. Elana Freeland (author of Chemtrails, Haarp and the Total Spectrum Dominance of Planet Earth) wondered if the multiple fine chemtrail lines of aluminum or some other conductive metal interacting with the lithium for military communications (C4 – command, control, communications, cyber warfare).By that evening, I was receiving FB messages from Eugene, Portland and Vancouver,BC of cases of severe chest congestion, coughing, sinus pain, headaches, extreme muscle pain, lethagy. </p>

<p>Reports were also coming in of crazy behavior and wild driving.Locke was right. The experiment over the small towns in Oregon seems to have been successful and is now being used all along the west coast of the U.S. Without a doubt the rest of the world will experience the use of this technique very soon.This is far more than global weather manipulation. The only reason such experimentation can happen without massive uprisings is because of the thorough disinformation campaign and behavior programming we are subjected to. Anyone in the public health field should instantly see that the patterns of these symptoms have no correlation to any known disease vector.Hopefully this article will be the stimulus to investigate and take action.Lithium (Li) is the softest of all metals and is an alkali metal. It is relatively inexpensive to mine as it is fairly common. Lithium, refined, is highly reactive and flammable. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. It is HIGHLY conductive of both heat and electricity, which is why it is used in batteries. This is why it is now being widely used in geoengineering, to increase electric conductivity, as a dessicant (drying agent) and to increase volatility in forest fires. Without any regard as to its extreme toxicity to living creatures. <a href="https://enwikipedia.org/wiki/lithiumFirst">https://enwikipedia.org/wiki/lithiumFirst</a> and foremost, lithium is an FDA PREGNANCY CATEGORY D drug which means, even in very small doses, it causes birth defects, most especially of the heart. Lithium also passes through breastmilk and will harm the baby.</p>

<p>Although the many websites which list the uses and warnings of lithium as a drug often divide the symptoms into COMMON SIDE EFFECTS and DANGEROUS SIDE EFFECTS, these effects are only gradations. The toxic dosage is small and each person is affected differently. For some individuals, even the smallest dose of lithium as a drug can be highly debilitating and some people react allergically. THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE FOR LITHIUM OVERDOSE OR ALLERGIC REACTION.Here are all the side effects listed at once:First and foremost – LETHARGY. You feel heavy and drugged.• THIRST. You can become quickly dehydrated especially if overheated. You crave salt.• STOMACH DISTRESS including both diarrhea and constipation.• TWITCHING of hands and head, sometimes of the whole body.• LOSS OF appetite. You can’t taste your food.• SLURRED SPEECH and BLURRED VISION.• ‘IMITATION’ GOITRE. Looks like thyroid malfunction but isn’t.• ENDROCRINE DISRUPTION CAUSING SEVERE MENSES/PERIODS. Stomach swells up as if you’re pregnant.• KIDNEY PAIN as the renal glands become dysfunctional.Here are just two links to the symptoms of Lithium as a drug. There are many, many more ( via thelibertybeacon.com ).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have since heavily edited this comment, so I will post a second response - </p>

<p>You did not &#39;link to a wiki&#39; - you linked to your own subs collection of psuedoscientific gibberish. That&#39;s not &#39;research&#39;, that&#39;s just a collection of self-help, alt med, and snake oil peddlers. I ignored that research because it&#39;s homeopathic bunk.</p>

<p>I am not a medical student, I am a graduate student working on ALS. My submissions are indeed an attempt to discredit YOU, and your alts, because you are spreading misinformation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to comment in your subs. Those are your subs and you can do with them as you will, and as we&#39;ve seen from other posters, you will heavily delete comments you don&#39;t like. We&#39;re here in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and can talk about whatever we want until a moderator tells us to stop. Just like you have frequently posted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> with offtopic links back to your own <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>, irrespective of the topic at hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, it wasn&#39;t the only example. Hilariously, you said &#39;provide an example&#39;, and I did, and now you&#39;re saying &#39;just kidding examples don&#39;t matter&#39;. </p>

<p>You did not recommend applying for a medical permit - you wrote that you felt governments should make special exceptions for people with your bullshit sensitivity.

<p>Look, you&#39;re a shill, and a terrible debater on reddit. You don&#39;t even seem to remember what you yourself write, which is semi-understandable given all the alts you&#39;re managing.</p>

<p>Why are you telling people how to handle their health? You aren&#39;t a doctor! You aren&#39;t a medical practitioner or a pharmacologist. You don&#39;t know anything about these issues but you&#39;re telling people how to &#39;cure&#39; themselves. </p>

<p>I absolutely have challenged your posted articles, and everytime I do so you just move the goalposts and either say that we need to discuss the articles in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> (even if you post them elsewhere) or that the exact quotes from the articles are incorrect. Or that Milham and Kruse are highly respected. Or that alt med websites are shills. Whatever. You&#39;re delusional, and utterly incapable of admitting that you are wrong about a thing, and prefer to edit or delete all interactions until they fit your strange paranoid little world view. I&#39;ll stop wasting your time when you stop spamming reddit with this harmful gibberish that prays on sick people. </p>

<p>You need help man - start worrying about your own health before you spam reddit with this gibberish that you think will cure others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You lied that I refused to admit sleeping in metal trash cans. Cite the permalink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets just be clear - are you or are you not sleeping in metal trash cans? <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3ohhks/lithium_being_used_in_airborne_spraying_over/cvzcuwg">Did you, or did you not write this comment where you deny wearing a pot when you sleep?</a></p>

<p>Just answer that question - YES, we all understand that a trash can is not identical to a pot with respect to being items you can cook in, but if you are playing a semantics game here I am going to call you an incredibly dishonest poster.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As for whether or not you delete comments you don&#39;t like - I can see from your comment history that you have recently in fact deleted comments in your sub.&quot; Again, you refuse to substantiate. Which mod removed which comment? Cite permalinks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, how about <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/3o8hb4/quick_question/cvv2zjp">this?</a> And <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/3no3ym/im_a_ti/cvqek04?context=3">this? </a> And <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/3no3ym/im_a_ti/cvq18x0">this?</a></p>

<p>Or do those not count for some reason? Because... lets be clear - YOU are the moderator of that sub, and your strange courthouse like rules for what does and doesn&#39;t fly is SUPER arbitrary, and you are constantly telling people (myself included) how to respond to you.</p>

<p>They are regarding posts. Several times in the past, i have corrected your mistakes confusing comments with posts. Do you have a learning disorder?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes, this old semantic canard you bring out. So, when you tell someone via a COMMENT that you&#39;re deleting their POST, that&#39;s not you deleting POSTS, got it.</p>

<p>I am mildly ADD. But, then, you sleep in a trash can and think electromagnetic emissions cause neurodegeneration, and are convinced the world is out to get you, so, pretty confident about who has a &#39;disorder&#39; worth pointing at here.</p>

<p>Lets reiterate the point though, since you&#39;re ignoring everything else and fixating on this - YOU are the moderator of that sub. YOU set the rules. When you say that you remove posts/comments that do not follow submission guidelines, you are saying you remove posts/comments that YOU DO NOT LIKE.</p>

<p>You cannot separate the two - that is YOUR sub. YOU set the rules. The rules are what YOU like. I.e., you REMOVE posts/comments when YOU do not like them.</p>

<p>Glad you admit that you sleep in a trash can. Took you long enough to just concede to the facts YOU wrote, which is pretty par for the course.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, to repeat myself, that&#39;s not a wiki. A wiki is something that the whole community has access to and can update and edit. As far as I can tell, you and the mods are the only people with access to edit that collection of links.</p>

<p>And, again, the &#39;peer reviewed research papers&#39; are all incredibly low impact factor shill journals, or op-ed pieces in the same. Or, hilariously, just as often links to the authors website or some other alt med health website.</p>

<p>I ask a third time - did you not write in the post I linked that you sleep in a metal trash can? If you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m asking you to confirm that yes, you did in fact write that, it&#39;s because a few posts ago you denied that you wrote that when <a href="/u/iqlusion">/u/iqlusion</a> called you out on having written that. It is strange that you deny sleeping in a metal pot, but refuse to admit to sleeping in a metal trashcan, when you yourself wrote that you sleep in a metal trashcan. And, for what it&#39;s worth, I agree with <a href="/r/iqlusion">/r/iqlusion</a> that this is an utterly insane behavior, and I would not trust the health related promises and claims made by someone who undertook this endeavor either.</p>

<p>You still don&#39;t know what an alibi is - you should look it up, because you&#39;re using the word incorrectly. As for whether or not you delete comments you don&#39;t like - I can see from your comment history that you have recently in fact deleted comments in your sub.</p>

<p>You frequently comment in other subs (<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> especially!) with links to <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>, links that have nothing to do with the matter at hand. I will not apologize, I will simply direct you to your submission history in this sub, where you can clearly see you make posts linking people to <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, I have a history of refuting your shitty posts. This is true. I don&#39;t like the way you spread information, and respond to your shitty posts - when not made in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> or <a href="/r/gangstalking">/r/gangstalking</a> - with refutations of your shilling. I don&#39;t care what you think about this - it is not your &#39;right&#39; to post unchallenged on reddit.</p>

<p>Except as we have explained to you numerous times, it brings it up as [deleted]. Which is why even though you were deleting numerous posts, we could still see that you were doing so. Your excuse for doing so was &#39;it&#39;s no longer on the front page&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>wikis have numerous posts linking to peer reviewed research papers, not snake oil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone can see that these &#39;Wikis&#39; are composed of you shilling to various homeopathic bullshit companies, Kruse and Milham, and op-ed pieces. The few and infrequent peer reviewed articles are in low impact factor journals and often say the opposite of what you think they do.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not surprising, since you are obviously not a trained scientist. Which is especially evident because while you&#39;ll admit to sleeping in a trash can, you&#39;re still arguing that you don&#39;t sleep in a pot.</p>

<p>Both of you have been attempting to do so for the past two months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be clear, about two months ago I argued with your spreading of medical misinformation. This is the first time I&#39;ve interacted with you in months. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not lying about you incurring negative karma from the topmindsofreddit posts. I&#39;m explaining to you why you accrued negative karma, and also that you don&#39;t understand how reddit works (this has been an incredibly common theme with you). You having &#39;-82 karma&#39; at TopMindsOfReddit does not translate to a subtraction of 82 karma from your comment history. That isn&#39;t how reddit works. Your comment karma is an aggregate of all your posting karma. Take a look at your total karma, the way I have repeatedly told you how to do, and take a look at how many subs you have negative comment karma in. I have told you to look at this more than once now.</p>

<p>If karma was not important to you, you would not repeatedly bring up how much you &#39;lost&#39; as a result of arguing with me.</p>

<p>I have repeatedly listed the subreddits, and so have you. I will list some here again - ALS, science, everythingscience, undelete, rawfood, rawfood, multiplesclerosis, conspiracy, conspiratard, paleo, drama, programming, environment, veterans, hamradio, rfelectronics, privacy, subliminal, targetedindividuals...</p>

<p>I&#39;m just looking at three pages worth of your submissions. So, yes, you spam the shit out of other subreddits.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;ve already explained why your &#39;scientific research&#39; is bunk. You have failed to respond to any of these things. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you think you&#39;re still in the right here - your sub has virtually zero traffic, and every time you post outside of your sub, you are downvoted. You are trying to convince people of this bullshit, and people aren&#39;t biting. YOU are the one failing to substantiate any claims, and every time you are called on this you only shift the goalposts.</p>

<p>Again, you need help man, and you should stop telling other people how to handle their health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha, you have such a selective capacity to pay attention to what is written!</p>

<p>To repeat myself yet again, you incurred negative karma because you were posting the same drivel in dozens of subs, then deleting it, then reposting it elsewhere as soon as it was downvoted. The posts I made mocking you in <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> were .np, though yes, if you make shitty posts on reddit, you get downvoted. Nothing to be done about that.</p>

<p>I never denied that you whining to the admins got a bunch of people shadowbanned. I was quite explicit in describing what happened in regards to your whining and your shadowbanning.</p>

<p>I am not lying that you spammed dozens of subreddits. You yourself have made posts about how you have been banned and had your posts removed from a number of subreddits! You most certainly were posting in dozens of subreddits - a look through your user history reveals many still standing, though you have deleted many posts.</p>

<p>The wikis do NOT all link peer reviewed scientific research. To repeat myself yet again, the sources you provide are either op-ed pieces in very low tier journals, unrepeated findings in very low tier journals, links directly to an authors website (Milham or Kruse), or links to homeopathic alt med bullshit websites.</p>

<p>You can keep pointing to my efforts to &#39;discredit&#39; you as some kind of negative - I&#39;m not denying that I am trying to discredit you. I&#39;ve also repeatedly done so by critiquing your sources, which you continually fail to respond to, simply regurgitating this &#39;help help I&#39;m being discredited&#39; canard. Would you like me to relink the <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a> thread where for a solid 24 hrs we had a back and forth wherein I asked you to respond to criticisms of one of your papers about electromagnetics non-link to ALS, and you refused to do so?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they just had a school shooting so you can look at it like this.</p>

<p>Maybe they used Lithium to trigger a shooting.. Or they faked the shooting and used lithium to manipulate the public into having strong feelings while being bombarded with propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty awesome living under Nazi rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m asking out of ignorance here, not challenging the theory...</p>

<p>What is the likelihood that these reports are related to efforts to extinguish the fires in California? It was said that these chemicals are used to extinguish fires; I&#39;m not trying to minimize the claims, I&#39;m playing devil&#39;s advocate. What&#39;s to say that they aren&#39;t just chemicals floating around in the air and getting stuck unintentionally?</p>

<p>I can imagine a counter-argument in MSM that says something along the lines of &quot;Conspiracy theorists are grappling around a claim that the lithium used to defeat forest fires was somehow being used to psycho-actively control the population.&quot; (with smirks)</p>

<p>In looking at the map, this argument doesn&#39;t add up, but it would be easy for MSM to dismiss it when you throw in the whole &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot; slam; so, for argument&#39;s sake, and to help build up a legitimate claim, how can my rebuttal be refuted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the chemicals being used, if fully tested for they don&#39;t actually prevent fires, it causes them to become worse.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fe7Gqpb8DQ">This video</a> is long, an interview and I can&#39;t remember where in the talk he mentions it but its all very interesting anyway.  If you go through it, the man speaks about the chemicals and how they don&#39;t actually play nice when heated up via fire.  </p>

<p>Nano-particulate aluminum doesn&#39;t sound like it wouldn&#39;t burn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is insanity. I&#39;m still having trouble understanding their intent. I understand that this is supposedly Geoengineering, but is it possible that they mean to spray poisonous antipsychotics into the atmosphere so that we, as a population, ingest the metal? Is it possible that they are just using the weather manipulation as a cover for their real intent: to pacify and chemically lobotomize the United States populace even further? I am really confused as to why they would do this, when these scientists live here themselves. They must know they breathe the same air they spray with these metals?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Throwaway account here:</p>

<p>I live in Medford Oregon (1 hour south of Reedsport) and I can say that there has been some interesting/deep trails in the sky.  Also, I live very close to the Medford Airport &amp; notice days even with frequent commercial traffic have clear blue skies.. And other days are just littered with the &#39;geoengineering&#39; trails.    This article re-affirms my suspicions.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So basically, an anonymous person on the internet told you this. He uses proper grammar and uses a pseudonym from history (or from the TV show Lost), so he&#39;s vetted. </p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced. </p>

<p>Sorry for the snark, but is this really the level of evidence we should accept for such a staggering claim like systematic spraying of lithium?</p>
