       I just posted another one as a test re:Wisconsin, but there are bunches and bunches - apparently at least 17 states, not just Wisconsin. Lots of chatter on Twitter from docs and toxicologists about the crisis.

       The heroin epidemic in rural Wisconsin is fucking crazy.  They aren't ready for this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a bar up in Chippwea (near Eau Claire and Twin Cities), and they call fridays "Black Friday" because of the black tar that the dealers bring down from the twin cities, who then sling it to the local yokels.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just as bad in the south part of the state.  Hell, a week ago some goober from the 'burbs scored in the city and was trying to drive home when he completely crossed the road while nodded out and nailed my neighbor's car.  He backed up, drove off and passed out again about 10 min later where he was arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously though, there are incidents nearly every fucking day here  where people from the "sticks" drive into the city to get their smack, then shoot up while fucking driving and hit shit.  One lady was really lucky that shit hit a tree on the causeway, otherwise her smack-head ass would have gone into the lake.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is totally unprecedented here, the previous "drug epidemics" (save for the state's drinking culture... we got us a DUI culture over here, der hey) were typically centered in urban areas, where most of the addicts/customer base were comprised folks from those areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the early 2000's, there has been a seismic shift from the inner city to the small town and 'burbs.  Chicago provides a great example of this (although the city's position of a distribution hub has had a similar effect on cities along the I90 and 94 corridors, such as Rockford or Kenosha.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, fuck man, that's some dangerous shit, especially in a place with the drinking culture like WI has.  Fucking kids can't stop taking their xanex or whatever the fuck while drinking.  I guess asphyxiation is super fetch right now, yeah?

       All imported from Afghanistan. Post invasion they are now the world supplier. One conspiracy that is probably true in my eyes. It's cocaine in the 80's all over again with meth too. Shit is BAD in Hawaii, Cali, the And the South with meth.

       Depends on why the article was reported - was it reported for a legit purpose, or to hide something? Ignoring reports on an article that people are trying to bury for political/monetary purpose isn't an abuse of moderatorship.

       This title is bullshit.  It is basically saying if I go buy some oxycodone pills from a street dealer in some borderline-crackhouse in Baltimore that I am doing "legal drugs" despite the fact that nowhere in the process of the sale or my possession was ANY of it legal.  I would bet a healthy chunk of my paycheck that the vast majority of people overdosing and dying from opiates did not get them from a doctor and are not taking the recommended prescription dose.  Sure, some of them might have started when they had a prescription from an injury but they didn't die from taking one or two norcos every 4-5 hours until the prescription ran out.  Even the big 80mg OxyContin pills won't kill you if you take them orally and let the controlled release do its thing.  But if you rub the coating off and grind them up and start snorting 80mg in one go with out enough of a tolerance than you might have a problem.  Opiates have been around forever and that will never change.  Fuck, you used to be able to order a bottle of heroin and syringes from fucking Sears catalogs...acquiring opiates is a hell of a lot harder than that now so I fail to see the shock.  Pills are more desirable than street heroin because you know the quantity and quality you are getting, so they get popular...this drives up prices and people switch to heroin which is much cheaper, then the cycle repeats.  I hate the pharma companies as much as anyone, but I fail to see what the point of this article is...next year the same article will be published but heroin will replace pills.  Opiates should be legal so there are no more street opiates that are dangerous, and we should help people that get addicted, not condemn them to a life on the streets.  Instead, I see articles like this trying to suggest we should bury them deeper in regulation which will just drive up black market prices or push people to heroin.  If more people were educated about opiates, how they work, the relative strengths of the different ones (just because you can handle 60mg of hydrocodone at once does not mean you can handle 60mg of oxycodone and definitely not 60mg of oxy/hydromorphone), and most importantly the things NOT to mix them with and to not poison themselves with massive amounts of Tylenol (it's amazing how many people don't know how dangerous a large dose of Tylenol is, how extremely dangerous it is to mix Tylenol with alcohol, and that if you think snorting a Percocet is a good idea you are a moron (99% of the mass you are snorting is...Tylenol)), a lot less people would die.  But instead we shroud them in mystery and fear.  Once kids (or adults) start to realize all the lies they have been told about drugs they might find some oxy in the medicine cabinet and think it is a good idea...but they don't know how much to take and think 2pills isn't much, that should be fine, lets get FUCKED UP...not realizing they were 40mg instant release pills and they just took 80mg of oxy with no tolerance on top of all the beer they were drinking already and their CNS slows down until they stop breathing.  People need to pay attention and understand what they are putting into their bodies.  But these situations are not "legal" and I highly doubt people who legally get them from their doctor and follow the doctors instructions are dying in any significant numbers.
