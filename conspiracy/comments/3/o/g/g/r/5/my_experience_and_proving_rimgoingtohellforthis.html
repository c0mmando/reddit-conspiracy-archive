        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Edit:  As you can see in the comments, I&#39;ve been raided by <a href="/r/imgoingtohellforthis">/r/imgoingtohellforthis</a>.  And I am getting spam downvoted. They want this post buried.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:Now their entire mod team is here and they are spam downvoting my comments.</strong></p>

<p>So a while ago, I&#39;ve noticed a strange <em>anti-republican anti-Trump</em> trend in <a href="/r/ImGoingToHellForThis">/r/ImGoingToHellForThis</a>.  And if  there was a post ridiculing <em>Bernie Sanders</em>, it&#39;d get removed immediately.  Hard to prove this stuff until the mods get involved themselves.</p>

<p>-Anyway fast forward some time, after a republican debate, a moderator of the subreddit <a href="/u/parisaxoxo">/u/parisaxoxo</a>, not using mod flair, posted a picture comparing <a href="http://zippy.gfycat.com/AdolescentEvergreenElephantbeetle.webm">Trump to Charles Manson</a> (a well known Murderer) and people bashing Trump in the comments.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImGoingToHellForThis/comments/3oftnm/feel_the_b/">This is the Thread</a>
88</p>

<p>Obviously nothing wrong with that, if they allow that kinda humour to all politicians.  </p>

<p>-So I posted <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OFK893j.png">a picture</a> shaming Bernie Sanders and the BlackLivesMatter  protest.   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImGoingToHellForThis/comments/3lbi6y/donald_trump_learned_from_the_best/">This is link to the Thread</a></p>

<p>It immediately <a href="http://imgur.com/cNaTvkm">got removed</a> <strong>by the same moderator</strong> that created the Trump picture.</p>

<p>I first replied to the message and then messaged the mods and I got an answer saying:</p>

<p>**EDIT 3:  This is a list of the mods on that sub.  So now you can see which ones are raiders from that sub:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh excuse me I didn&#39;t answer you within 20 minutes. Not like we have lives or anything.
I told you why your post was removed: it&#39;s shit. And nothing in it falls under</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tasteless &quot;politically incorrect&quot; dark, offensive, &amp; twisted humor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So go fuck yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then I pretty much got a** it&#39;s just black women at Bernie Sanders rally reply**.  Then Both muted and banned from the subreddit.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Z4b2k0C.png">These are the messages to prove them.</a></p>

<p>Anyway, so lots of subreddits are engaged in this bullshit BIAS, and do damage control for the Bernie Sanders campaign.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay here&#39;s the thing</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t remove it and I didn&#39;t ban you, my fellow mod did.</p>

<p>Also it wasn&#39;t removed immediately, some time passed and it got 0 karma</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have enough mods to just constantly comb the sub for shitposts man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also your post doesn&#39;t even really make fun of Bernie so why do you keep saying we&#39;re Bernie shills?</p>

<p>Like it&#39;s making fun of #blacklivesmatter not Bernie. It&#39;s just not funny at all and the downvotes on your post proved that and then we removed it.</p>

<p>Also it would&#39;ve just ended at removing that post if you didn&#39;t mail us with being a whiny bitch. And that broke rule III and got you banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How can funny be measured ? How can you not reflect on your own Bias?  I mean they are allowed to think it&#39;s not funny, and proceed to downvote it, but to remove it entirely, again, that&#39;s censorship.  For example, I don&#39;t find Chris Rock funny, I can not go to his concert and tell people not to go there, but I shouldn&#39;t ban him from my city.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a retard. </p>

<p>Your post was removed because it was shit and not funny. IGTHFT is a <em>humor</em> sub. Your post had no humor. </p>

<p>You were not banned or muted until you started being a little shit in the mod mail. </p>

<p>How were you a little shit? You whined about how I was &quot;not responding&quot; to you because I didn&#39;t immediately reply to you; it took me a whole twenty minutes to reply to you. Wow. So neglected s/ </p>

<p>And yeah, the fact that you had to come to this sub to whine about how your post was removed from a humor sub because it was not funny is pretty pathetic. </p>

<p>And then you linked my user name here so I would see this stupid shit. Get a fucking life. </p>

<p>And btw, no I am not <a href="/u/76one">/u/76one</a> I have no idea who that is. </p>

<p>As if your time is anything but attention whoring, because some white knight saw a grill.   God forbid one day you get judged by the content of your charachter.  Nothing has come out of your mouth but a bunch of unoriginal &#39;talk points&#39; you have been fed through the internet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>cool story bro</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please.  You&#39;ll wake up one day when you&#39;re 40 and if you haven&#39;t fucked one of those white knights over alimony, you&#39;d realize how your life was all but wasted while simultaneously contributed negatively to anything good in society.   </p>

<p>&quot;maybe she&#39;s notice me&quot; was what that white knight mod thought when he let you join the sub, not knowing you&#39;ll give away their whole agenda.    You remove my post because your pro Sanders Agenda and bias got triggered but I bet in your enlightened group you talk about being fair and &#39;why can&#39;t everybody just get along?&#39;</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, go watch your show the American Horror Story.  I am watching it too, just not through the Television or your mirror.</p>
