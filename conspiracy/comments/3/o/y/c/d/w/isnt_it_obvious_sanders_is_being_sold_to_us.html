<p>That is exactly what Libertarian-ism is about. No rules mean those who can use force or with lots of money have all the power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, in libertarian political theory, externalities which violate the rights of others are unjust and illegal.  Many Libertarians also believe in public goods when it comes to things like oceans and rivers.  Most mainstream libertarians are thinly-veiled corporatist, though. However, Paul subscribed to Austrian Econ and there are protections for externalities in these theories. Not a libertarian btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno what you think working for you would look like.  No 1 politician can do shit.  He can make all the right votes but when he is outnumbered that&#39;s the end of the ballgame.  That doesn&#39;t make them &quot;sell-outs.&quot;  It makes them irrelevant.  That is why every once in a while you get a genuine person in office who isn&#39;t taking corporate money and trying to shove wars down your throat.  When it&#39;s only one or 2 guys it doesn&#39;t hurt the overall agenda.  Ron Paul could talk about the Fed all day and Bernie can talk about Wall Street all day and it won&#39;t matter because the majority of people in office are on the take.  They are bought by corporate interests.  You can check Bernie&#39;s donors and see that he&#39;s not.  He&#39;s just outnumbered.  </p>

<p>Ron Paul had a 2 million dollar surplus after paying off his campaign debts.  He isn&#39;t allowed to keep that money for personal use.  He can, however, transfer that for future elections that he is a part of.  All of this information is available online (FEC disclosure page).  All of the spending is tracked.   </p>

So the problem is lifelong politicians and billionaires and you want to solve that problem by only having lifelong politicians and billionaires be able to run for any office?  </p>

<p>And, again, you can track every bit of donation money that is spent on the FEC page.  You aren&#39;t compelled to donate to any candidate.  People donate to candidates they like/believe in.  </p>

Yes you are suffering from stockholm syndrome if you entertain the fantasy your kidnapper(politicians) are honest people worthy of your support. Ron Paul was given that money to make commercials for his campaign. He didnt do that, he went agaimst the wishes of the donors. If you think Sanders is pure, answer how he survived 30 years of national level politics? This isnt an autoclave, there is no purity, rather you are looking for the employee of the fertilizer factory with the cleanest shirt.  Yeah I guess &quot;wake up you dumb ass moron&quot; would be an appropriate sentiment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul donors didn&#39;t give him money just to make commercials... Do you know how campaign donations work?  Every single thing that is a part of a campaign from hotel rooms to travel expenses to, yes, commercials is included.  Paying advisors and pollsters is also included.  If you don&#39;t understand that then you really shouldn&#39;t donate to a campaign because you are an idiot.  You should have your money kept/watched by a financial advisor because you apparently have a tendency to want to blow money on things that you don&#39;t understand.  </p>

<p>How did Sanders survive in office for as long as he has?  Easy... he is only 1 guy.  He can&#39;t actually change shit.  He votes against stuff that the rest of Congress votes for so he isn&#39;t holding the line.  He doesn&#39;t accept money from Wall Street so he isn&#39;t bought by them.  He is harmless.  Most people get into office and they are bought right away.  Some people get into office and they are genuine people and they don&#39;t sell out.  This is of no concern to the greater majority because 1 vote doesn&#39;t change anything in the House or the Senate.  Some people are incorruptible.  They are the people that the media marginalizes and Wall Street doesn&#39;t fund.  If somebody in office starts to be too big of a problem they frame you with hookers or drugs or you wind up dead.  It actually helps serve a greater purpose to have a few genuine guys in office because they help create the illusion of a working democratic system.  Most politicians are pieces of shit but a few of them aren&#39;t.  They&#39;ll never be elected President but they aren&#39;t all bought the same way.       </p>

<p>This is quite intentional. Commercialism and the entertainment industry are designed to be distractions. The best thing you can do is personally resist and not succumb to apathy.  Do things with your life that you are passionate about than can make a difference, even if in a small way, and hopefully other people will follow our lead.  We have got to try.</p>

<p>Well, considering that only 54% of eligible voters actually vote, maybe we should give it a shot before jumping to that conclusion?  I&#39;m not saying we should vote and then all go home and do nothing.  But to me it&#39;s a &quot;might as well&quot; sort of thing.  It&#39;s not difficult, it doesn&#39;t make you complicit in the system, and it might just matter more than you think it does. Consider it part of a variety of tactics.</p>

<p>Well if we want to change, WE have to change.  If we want things to change radically, we have to change radically.  Missing work for corrupt corporations doesn&#39;t seem like a bad thing to me.

You&#39;re saying, &quot;I think my vote can help fix this.&quot;  Well, I don&#39;t think you can fix a corrupt system by working within the confines of that same corrupt system, the entire reason it&#39;s set up how it is is specifically so that you <em>can&#39;t</em> change the status quo from within.</p>

<p>At the end of the day it doesn&#39;t really matter who&#39;s president if the unelected money masters behind the scenes are still writing the checks and if 30-40% of my paycheck is being stolen to drop bombs on people I&#39;ve never met who live halfway around the world.  I don&#39;t support a system like that, and voting is by definition supporting the system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the system is corrupt because we&#39;ve consistently elected corrupt officials who are servants to the corporate elite.  We need a complete overhaul of the people in office.  We should vote for those that commit to never taking corporate money and promote demilitarization and monetary reform.  That&#39;s not being complicit.  With Citizens United always unlimited corporate funding to manipulate public opinion, it&#39;s an uphill battle, yes.  But the fact that there is a concerted effort to take away people&#39;s rights to vote indicates that voting does in fact have some power.  Those in power do not want thinking people to vote.  Them getting elected, albeit by a small number of people, gives them legal legitimacy in the eye of the world.</p>

<p>History shows us that when anti-establishment people actually organize and coordinate to elect a government that actually represents the people, the old power regime will seek to use force to remain in power.  That&#39;s when they lose their legitimacy and the masses will join in revolution.  But until you reach that point, you have no legitimacy in the eyes of the public, and therefore won&#39;t be effective at bringing down the existing power structure.</p>

<p>The alternative is to make them irrelevant (see <a href="http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/lawrence-jarach-anarcho-communists-platformism-and-dual-power-innovation-or-travesty">dual power</a>), but we can work on this and still vote anyway.

    <div class="md"><p>The system is corrupt because money is the true ruling power of America, and thus those who own the money own the country.  No amount of voting or not voting is going to change that, at least not in the current political climate.</p>

<p>And yes, if you vote as part of the &quot;democratic system&quot; (and I put it in quotes because again, it isn&#39;t an actual democracy) you are supporting that system.  How can you argue otherwise?  You are by definition working within the system and thus legitimizing it.</p>

<p>Let me frame it another way: do you think the system - which we agree is corrupt and was created by the rich for the rich - would allow itself to be destroyed by itself?  Of course it wouldn&#39;t.  It&#39;s designed to be self-perpetuating and to continue to centralize power and control indefinitely.</p>

<p>What exactly is it that you think Bernie Sanders could or would do if he was president?  What do you think would change?  I&#39;m not even saying he himself is corrupt or full of shit or anything, I&#39;m literally saying that it makes no difference either way because he&#39;s just one man.  The real powers in the US don&#39;t need to be elected.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the fact that there is a concerted effort to take away people&#39;s rights to vote indicates that voting does in fact have some power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where do you get this idea from?  The people will always be allowed to vote under the current system, it&#39;s a way of throwing us a bone and making us feel like what we think actually matters to those who rule us.  The only way I could see that changing is if we reach a full on <em>1984</em> type state, where the government stops pretending it&#39;s working for the people and just admits outright that its goal is power and domination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The alternative is to make them irrelevant (see dual power), but we can work on this and still vote anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is more along the lines of what I think personally.  Rather than fighting the system and trying to change it from within, I think the more effective method would be to ignore the system entirely and let it fade into irrelevancy on its own while simultaneously working together to build something better that benefits everyone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try everything until something works.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We&#39;ve tried voting.  People have been voting for hundreds of years.  Where has it gotten us?  We need to try something else, no savior is going to come along and fix the world for us.  We need to do it ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I taught economics to public school students for 5 years. My first year, I had to teach them about the Fed- I had no clue what it was about. Once I started learning about it, it changed EVERYTHING I believed about the government and economics (and I thought I knew a lot as a poli sci major). Do some research and prepare to have your mind blown. I recommend watching Mike Maloney&#39;s Hidden Secrets of Money series on youtube (especially video 4). It breaks some of the info down in manageable chunks for new learners- my students really liked it!</p>

<p>Edit: I forget, it may have been J.P. Morgan that coerced Wilson into letting him save the economy. Either way Morgan, Rockefeller, and Harriman were all in cahoots together as Rothschild reps. At least that is what my research has told me. I try not to blindly believe anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing that bothers me is his stance on education. If you believe as I do that much of what we are taught, specifically in regards to history , has been distorted then his free college idea becomes troubling. It would result in more people being formally educated and more buying into the &quot;official&quot; stories of things. It&#39;s not solid proof, but it is one thing that comes to mind and worries me about Sanders being exactly what the establishment wants. </p>

<p>Also I have done plenty of research on the idea of Rothschild Zionism. One thing that keeps coming up is how they supposedly use the idea of Socialism to appeal to the masses and garner wide support for a candidate (kinda like what happened with Hitler). The idea of course being to use Socialism as a quick step towards Fascism. The idea that this is possible is evidenced by how many times other things, that naturally appeal to people, have been used against us the best example being religion. </p>

<p>Lastly, with a lot of the new ways our data is handled and manipulated it is entirely possible that the elite no longer need &quot;money in politics&quot; to have total control over our government. So by removing money from politics you thereby remove the ability for someone to challenge them by using their own means of gaining power.</p>

<p>All of these are just loose ideas that have come to me during my research of Rothschild Zionism. I suggest you research that topic and maybe you will draw some conclusions similar to these, or maybe not.  </p>

<p>Edit: Also just research the Rothschild family in general. A good documentary is called &quot;The Rothschild Empire - The True Leaders of the World&quot;. It is chock full of known quotes from founding fathers and other influential political figures speaking out against what they called &quot;the money changers&quot;. It really seems like it used to be common knowledge if you read quotes from back then. A good example of when the scales tipped heavily in the elite&#39;s favor is when, how and why the Federal Reserve was founded. </p>

<p>Yes you amongst others.</p>

<p>Nothing about taking other actions negates voting for the most radical option you have. Taking a superior view that it&#39;s all meaningless is another way of falling for the trap. Your feelings of impotence around elections is intended because voting can be very powerful. Huge sums of money are spent to insure voting achieves nothing. Voting for the most radical, most misfit candidate whether on the right or left is a powerful act. This position is not falling for the left-right paradigm. The head of the labour party in the UK is a very good example of this and Sanders is a reasonably good example too.</p>

<p>You are encouraging people to do nothing as an act of rebellion and then feel quietly superior about it. You&#39;re just rationalising your own lack of moral courage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That actually isn&#39;t true.  He voted for Clinton&#39;s fucked up military actions in the Kosovo War, he voted against opposition to the war in Afghanistan (aka he supported it), and he voted later to give more appropriations to <em>both</em> the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq.  In 2003 he again voted in favor of providing more &quot;support&quot; to the war in Iraq and the larger war against terrorism.  Then he supported only a &quot;gradual withdrawal&quot; of troops from Iraq and was against impeaching Bush.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re getting the above info from but it&#39;s false, it sounds like a more recent attempt by Bernie&#39;s campaign team to whitewash his very pro-war history.

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s been consistent on his issues and he warned about iraq and was one of the few who has gone against the grain.  Yes he may sell out, yes he may find himself in a position that if he rocks the boat he&#39;ll get kennedy&#39;ed.  But he&#39;s one of the good guys.  Don&#39;t trust me though.  Go on youtube and listen to what he&#39;s been saying consistently for 20 yrs now--similar stuff to outliers Kucinich and Franken.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s been strongly opposed to the military industrial complex, against mass surveillance, he&#39;s been light on drugs, anti-incarceration, anti police state, pro education and anti war basically forever.  He also supports single payer so he was against obamacare to some degree but had to help them out because it was better than the alternative.</p>

<p>I personally love Bernie and I&#39;ve been a long time fan. I never thought in a million years he&#39;d run and neither did he.  I think he was on either stewart or maher and someone challenged him. The audience went fucking nuts and started clapping.  Then a bulb went off in his head and made it a reality.</p>

<p>He&#39;s had a meteoric rise, not because of the socialism but because he&#39;s essentially a &#39;reform party&#39; candidate running under the democratic ticket just so he could be on the stage with reptard hillary.  People are waking up to media manipulation, to lies and they want a &#39;real&#39; change. They want to burn the whole fucking thing down and that&#39;s what Sanders is all about actually.</p>

<p>My point was that he is not exactly &quot;false hope&quot; material. I wasn&#39;t disparaging Bernie in anyway.  My point is &quot;false hope&quot; material, a plant would look prettier and feel less true.  Perhaps you should read what I wrote again.  Added fun fact:  I&#39;m Jewish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually he&#39;s extremely consistent, and as a constituent of his, i can tell you for Vermonters he&#39;s always done or tried extremely hard to do what he says he&#39;s going to do.  That&#39;s all you can ask of him.</p>

<p>He has protected small business religiously from mega corps in our state.  We&#39;re on of the few states where a small business can truly thrive.  We&#39;re one of very few states that make it extremely easy to start a business, including at home bakerys(which are illegal in most states.)  </p>

<p>Back door bakerys are a common occurence here.  This is the type of thing we should be promoting.  Not more Walmarts and Home Depots in every city.  Not more chillis.  </p>

<p>The fact that most of the spent income in Vermont stays in Vermont kept the state from suffering or the housing market from crashing when the rest of America was on their knees.  </p>

<p>As a veteran he was the only one who voted against the Iraq war.  As a veteran of said war I greatly appreciate that.  It was a waste of human life.  He&#39;s also done countless things to help veterans within his ability.  He votes for bills for the right reasons.  He won&#39;t vote for a bill loaded with pork and secret shit even if it is a bill that &quot;should be an easy pass.&quot;</p>

<p>We have almost NO GUN LAWS.  It is completely legal to walk down the street with an AK47 and a &quot;conceal carry&quot; permit is not required here.  Carry till your hearts content.  We also have the least amount of gun crime in the country per capita. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States_by_state</a></p>

<p>&quot;Vermont does allow anyone who can legally possess a firearm to carry it concealed without a permit of any kind. Vermont Residents can carry in the states of Arizona, Alaska, Kansas and Oklahoma with just their state Issued Drivers License or State issued ID if they are 21 Years of age and can legally own a firearm.&quot;</p>

<p>Yea i must be naive to believe him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you made this point. I love Sanders as much as the other circle-jerkers on Reddit, but I don&#39;t see anything wrong with having the discussion that his presidency might not go the way he is describing it. I voted for Obama willingly the first time, because like the top commenter said, I thought I was participating in hope and change. The second time around, I was a little wiser to politics, but voted for him because I thought he was the better choice over McCain. Now, I&#39;m thoroughly pissed at how he&#39;s backstabbed the American people and most people on the left are shouting like they&#39;re at a football game in the South: &quot;GOOOOOO-BAMA!&quot; </p>

<p>So here were are bickering over who should bring in the next wave of hope and change. Sanders is saying all of the right things. He is brining up topics that no top Congressman would talk about, hopefully because he isn&#39;t tied down to donations like other candidates might be. Anyway, I see that he is an intelligent man and he has voted consistently throughout his entire tenure in Congress. Sometimes when I think about it though, I find it hard to convince myself that THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT. Obama got up in front of the American people during his first primaries and put on a wonderful show. He put on the show we all wanted. Now, Bernie is putting on the show we all want. I&#39;m not saying that means 100% he&#39;s a sham; I&#39;m just saying, &quot;Hey, remember when Obama said he was gonna do all these things and then made office and never did them? Why is Bernie better than Obama? What is it about Bernie that would get him to follow through where Obama sold out?&quot;</p>

<p>Basically, I&#39;ve decided to give it one last shot. Vote in Bernie. See what he does. Either he was controlled opposition the entire time and he runs another Obama presidency...or he is sincere in his beliefs, but he gets his presidency steered into the ground by undercover opposition from within. Or the last option would be that he succeeds and sparks a political revolution that extends far beyond his term. The last option is probably the one most Bernie Sanders supporters want to happen, but this thread is about taking a realistic approach. So I think that we should just vote him in and see what happens. If he willingly becomes Obama, then we can burn this motherfucker down. If he tries to stand up for himself against the insiders who would be attempting to sink his presidency, then we could be in full support. If they try to kill him, then again, burn the motherfucker down. I think we should still give this democratic process one last shot. I think it&#39;s worth it.</p>

<p>The guy has been very consistent in his views and I imagine unless his views are explicitly being adopted by the powers that be I dont see how his history matches up with the people we see propped up into leadership positions. </p>

<p>Do you? I&#39;m guessing no. If you dare to say &quot;corporatism&quot; I&#39;ll just point out that that Mussolini quote is fake.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism is where the state has a strong militant police force, colludes with oligarchs and oppresses everyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um, no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A socialist / populist is the polar opposite of what a fascist is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascism <em>is</em> both populist <em>and</em> socialist.</p>

<p>Did you sleep through history class or something? </p>

<p>This is why democracy doesn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one claiming to know more than anyone.  You are the one who said that I have Stockholm syndrome because I think that a few genuine people make it into politics.  You then asked about where Ron Paul&#39;s money went without apparently ever even looking into it for yourself... I don&#39;t claim to know more than anyone else... I don&#39;t talk out of my ass either though.  Just because I don&#39;t know an answer to something doesn&#39;t mean I get to assume what the answer is and assume I&#39;m right.  &quot;I don&#39;t know where Ron Paul&#39;s campaign money went therefor he kept it all for himself!  When will you sheep learn?!&quot;  </p>
