    <div class="md"><p>Easier said than done on this planet, bro.  This is like saying &quot;the&quot; way to get rich is to have $50M in your bank account.  Easy.</p>

<p>Okay.  Thanks.  I know that.  Now how tf do I get $50M in my bank account?</p>

<p>I realize there are techniques to develop your kundalini energy, but - again - it&#39;s much easier said than done on this planet/in this civilization.</p>

<p>It&#39;s <em>totally</em> possible to run a 10 second 100 yard dash.  Absolutely.  All you have to do is train your ass off and eat right from about 10 years of age for the next 12-15 years and you should be a fucking Olympic badass.</p>

<p>Easier said than done.</p>

<p>That being said, the meaning of life can be found in many different ways aside from developing one&#39;s kundalini energy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/JBOVUkY.png">Believe nothing</a>.  Belief is what the vain and ignorant cling to when they do not have actual, first hand, personal experience of a thing - when they do not have valid, logical reasoning for the understanding of a phenomenon&#39;s validity.  The key is not to believe.  The key is to realize; to actuate; to experience - to <em>know</em>.  And if one does not know, it is then best to simply not place too much energy on the thing in question until one has a better understanding of it.  That, or do away with the notion entirely.  Otherwise, the possibility of giving one&#39;s energies to falsehoods is too great, and it becomes very easy to be led astray.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>belief is tricky, and often times misleads a person.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.  Correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To become kundalini, you first must believe you can be it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Belief is never necessary.  Realization is what is needed.  I don’t “believe” that I’m typing these words in response.  <em>I know</em>.  It’s happening.  The realization of kundalini energy happens through specific practices and exercises.  If you do the work, then you get the results.  Belief is not necessary in any of this process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There needs to be direction, like an arrow leaving a bow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That comes through focused work.  That’s all.  Again, belief it not necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A belief in nothing does not have the requisite trajectory for being a Kundalini adept</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t believe that focused intent and energy results in requisite power and influence.  I’ve experienced such things, so I <em>know</em> that it does.  As a result, I also don’t need to believe that the proper kundalini practice, proper intent, and focus can lead slowly to the proper results as well.  This is an understanding that can be acquired through simply experience.  Again, belief is not necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this is something that requires specific and directed focus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct and agreed, but belief need not be part of that equation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, after you become Kundalini, your belief will be in nothing. This won&#39;t be a concept you read on the internet, it will be very familiar, your own inner mind. Further, that belief in nothing will color your dialogue, actions, and thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it’s not so much the belief in nothing that will color your actions and thoughts.  It’s the knowledge of the things you have experienced that will do so more than any level of “belief in nothing”.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Incorrect.  There is nothing about existence that requires any sort of belief whatsoever.  All one need to do is just act.  <em>Be</em>.  Through action one assesses results.  Through the results that come about, one can make a proper assessment of what to do next.  Through the experience that one gains via action and the intelligent, critical assessment of that action, one can acquire a greater understanding of what should continue to be done in the future.</p>

<p>Belief in and of itself doesn&#39;t have to have anything to do with any of this process.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Take, for example, picking up a pencil... In order to perform the &#39;action&#39; of picking up the pencil, some mental framework needs to precede it. Your internal mind allows you to visualize picking up the pencil. Further, in visualizing this, and potentially observing others do it, you see that it is possible. That you CAN do it. Once this is understood, you then &#39;believe&#39; you can do it, which is the catalyst for your action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with everything you are saying is that this isn&#39;t actually how things work.  When you are a toddler, you do not act on &quot;belief&quot;.  You act for the most part on impulse and desire.  Upon actually <em>experiencing</em> the results of your actions, you come to an understanding of what you can or cannot, should or should not do.  There is no belief in this.  There is only understanding and acting upon that understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m guessing you are an atheist and doing mental gymnastics to exclude belief from your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here you continue to blatantly illustrate the great shallowness of your thought and limitation of your perspective.  You have, I say again, what is called hubris.  Hubris is a belief that the way you see things is &quot;the only way&quot; things are.  That is a very shallow, very limiting perspective - very child-like, but sad and dangerous all the same.  It ensures you atrophy mentally and emotionally.</p>

<p>Some of the greatest spiritual figures known to humanity were the first to stand up and expound upon the overarching virtue - indeed <em>need</em> - of realization in one&#39;s life independent of mere belief.</p>

<p>Your guesses continue to show more and more clearly that you are little more than a small child walking around with his chest puffed out, thinking he’s a “big boy” in high school, when he’s still barely just entering the third grade.</p>

<p>My niece is five years old.  I love her.  She’s super cute.  She’s a little asshole though, and thinks that she knows more than she actually does.  She actually gets <em>upset</em> at things that me and her parents tell her to do because she thinks she knows what she’s talking about!  It is sometimes cute.  I have to admit.  I’m assuming you’re not five, however, so it’s not quite as comical in your case that it seems you haven’t yet grown out of your “I’m right!  Waaa!” stage of development.</p>

<p>Life is a <em>lot</em> bigger and more much vast than you think it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh.  You don&#39;t need to first &quot;believe&quot; that you are capable of planning. lol.  You just PLAN.  It&#39;s not like a child has to &quot;believe&quot; that they can think - and, therefore, by extension, <em>plan</em> - before they actually do a thing.  They just DO IT.  You don&#39;t have to &quot;believe&quot; you can walk before you walk.  You just begin walking, you fall, you get up, you walk some more, and eventually you get the hang of it.</p>

<p>And what makes you get up and walk?  Is it &quot;belief&quot;?  No.  It&#39;s impetus.  It&#39;s desire.  It&#39;s <em>intention</em>.  That&#39;s far different than &quot;belief&quot;.</p>

<p>Your downvoting is really sad, childish, and pitiful.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re a dumb child that just gets upset when the rest of the world doesn&#39;t agree with you, and since you are powerless to do anything about it or actually be <em>right</em>, the only thing you can do is downvote.  It&#39;s a continued testament to your failings as a human being.  Come on, man.  You <em>have</em> to work on that.  It&#39;s like...blatantly obvious to anyone looking at this shit...anyone but you, I guess.</p>

<p>You&#39;re so stuck on &quot;belief, belief, belief!&quot; that you don&#39;t understand that that&#39;s not what needs to go on at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religious comes from religion which comes from the Latin Religare which means to TIE or to BIND. It&#39;s a trap.</p>

<p>It aint Kundalini bro, the meaning is to love others as much or more than yourself. To leave this world in better condition than you showed up. To fight against immoral behavior and strive to be a highly moral being. </p>

<p>While nothing I wrote is THE meaning it is better than your statement.</p>

<p>The earth is flat and there is nowhere else to go in this realm, you can bitch about it all you like, or throw questions at me, or call me crazy or whatever but it is FACT.</p>

<p>No curve no ball, I have with my Celestron 127EQ telescope, at 3 feet above sea level watched a ship I could see perfectly up to 50 miles away and could see it like it was right in front of me, at this distance if we are to believe the ball and using spherical trigonometry we are over a thousand feet below my ability to see it yet there the ship is, no curve, no ball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How could I possibly know it is guarded by 43 countries&#39; military Navy ships via the Antarctica treaty. Plus who has the resources to travel 50,000 miles from the equator or 55,000 miles from where I  live to where the edge is via boat? </p>

<p>If you keep thinking about the edge you are not thinking right.</p>

<p>Yes a robot can only compute or say what it is programmed to do, and you sound no different than the hundreds if not thousands of ball earthers I have had the displeasure to deal with, it&#39;s like quitting smoking you guys will only change your min when you decide you want to or when it becomes so viral and becomes accepted is when you will consider changing your minds/stance. We need more people to understand the truth.</p>

<p>My best friend who is one of the smartest people I know, resisted, screamed, acted out and basically made a fool of himself for 4 months before he got it. He makes well into the 6 figures owns a million dollar home has a Porsche and an M3, he was so deeply entrenched in the system he thought I had gone mad. I understand WE ALL remember the day in class when the teacher stated how the ancients thought they would sail over the edge and the classroom erupted with laughter, everyone I talk to remembers this, kinda odd eh? It takes a lot of intelligence to grasp it some will never get it, it takes calculations, time, and deprogramming what you think you know, it&#39;s not easy.</p>

<p>Please do your own research if you are sincere, I swear to yyou though from every fiber of my being, to god, to my family, my ancestors, and on my own family it is without a doubt in my mind flat. I&#39;ve only been a flat earthen for 7-8 months. It has opened my mind up to every lie that the NWO (really old world order) tries to spread. I also suggest you look up critical thinking skills in Google and without even looking at flat earth use that as a guide to put the ball earth mdel to the test and you will see it fails every time. It takes work though which is why most will never do shit but endlessly debate and ask questions that matter not.</p>

<p>Peace bro</p>

<p>So won&#39;t those people know what&#39;s over the edge? Won&#39;t it be public knowledge if so many people know what&#39;s over the edge?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the sun, moon and stars revolve around me. Went from tiny fish in indescribably huge universe, to the most intelligent mammal on a flat plane that was created to serve me. This place was designed specifically so I can live. It is not some random everything came from nothing (singularity) bullshit we have been fed to believe. </p>

<p>This knowledge is the freedom for mankind, however most cowards opt to prefer the lie because they are either paid to spread it, or they have been so mentally crippled they need their knowledge to come from a &quot;legitimate&quot; source. Newsflash people CNN, FOX, HBO, etc. Will NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER tell you about flat earth unless to ridicule it.</p>

<p>EVERYONE I talk to in dozens of states and all sorts of ages EVERYONE remembers when in grade school their teacher made it a point to mock the ancient people of earth and say how they believed the earth was flat and thought they would sail off the edge and then the classroom erupts with laughter RINSE AND REPEAT my 73 year old father remembers it verbatim as I told it. If you remember this as well it should be a CLUE to just how brainwashed you have been since childhood and you may not be as smart as you think you are.</p>

<p>These same &quot;stupid&quot; ancient people also built pyramids on every continent that not one company can even come close to these structures with all of the knowledge on the planet from all these  &quot;intelligent&quot; colleges and universities. </p>

<p>College graduates are among some of the stupidest people I have ever come across. Yet if you ask them their smug ass will endlessly drone on about so much fake ass bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sigh.  You don&#39;t need to first &quot;believe&quot; that you are capable of planning. lol.  You just PLAN.  It&#39;s not like a child has to &quot;believe&quot; that they can think - and, therefore, by extension, <em>plan</em> - before they actually do a thing.  They just DO IT.  You don&#39;t have to &quot;believe&quot; you can walk before you walk.  You just begin walking, you fall, you get up, you walk some more, and eventually you get the hang of it.</p>

<p>And what makes you get up and walk?  Is it &quot;belief&quot;?  No.  It&#39;s impetus.  It&#39;s desire.  It&#39;s <em>intention</em>.  That&#39;s far different than &quot;belief&quot;.</p>

<p>Your downvoting is really sad, childish, and pitiful.  It&#39;s like you&#39;re a dumb child that just gets upset when the rest of the world doesn&#39;t agree with you, and since you are powerless to do anything about it or actually be <em>right</em>, the only thing you can do is downvote.  It&#39;s a continued testament to your failings as a human being.  Come on, man.  You <em>have</em> to work on that.  It&#39;s like...blatantly obvious to anyone looking at this shit...anyone but you, I guess.</p>

<p>You&#39;re so stuck on &quot;belief, belief, belief!&quot; that you don&#39;t understand that that&#39;s not what needs to go on at all.</p>
