        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) The collapse of WTC 7 in under 7 seconds. NIST admits 2.25 seconds of FREE FALL acceleration. NIST refuses to release the data used in their collapse simulation claiming it might “jeopardize public safety”. Steel framed high-rise buildings have NEVER totally collapsed from fire or structural damage. Building 7 was not hit by a plane. Building 7’s collapse was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report. Google ‘Building 7’, ‘WTC 7’.
SOURCED: <a href="https://kendoc911.wordpress.com/15-hard-facts-about-911/fact-1-wtc7/">https://kendoc911.wordpress.com/15-hard-facts-about-911/fact-1-wtc7/</a></p>

<p>2) BBC correspondent Jane Standley and Phil Hayton reported the collapse of WTC 7 (Saloman Brothers Building) 20 minutes before it happened. BBC claims to have lost their original footage on 9/11 “(for reasons of cock-up, not conspiracy)”. CNN/FOX/MSNBC also had early reports of the collapse of building 7. “either collapsed or is collapsing”. “That is the building that is going to go down next.” Ashleigh Banfield. Research ‘BBC wtc 7’.

<p>3) 2300+ Engineers and Architects support a new independent 9/11 investigation. Richard Gage (Founder of AE911). Watch these great documentaries ‘Explosive Evidence’, ‘Blueprint for Truth’, ‘Toronto Hearings’. Research ae911truth.org and ReThink911.org. 200+ Senior Military, Intelligence Service, Law Enforcement, and Government Officials question the official story. Research Robert Bowman, Sibel Edmonds, Paul Craig Roberts, Mark Dayton, Cynthia McKinney. Google ‘9/11 Whistle blowers’ and ‘Patriots for 9/11’.

<p>4) Hundreds of firefighters and witness testimony to MOLTEN METAL was ignored by the 9/11 Commission. NIST’s John Gross denies the existence of Molten Metal. FEMA found “Evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack” on the “Swiss Cheese” WTC 7 steel sample, ‘Limited Metallurgical Examination (FEMA C-13, Appendix C-6)’. Leslie Robertson claimed “As of 21 days after the attack, the fires were still burning and molten steel was still running”. “Like you’re in a foundry” FDNY witnesses. Nano Thermite was found in WTC dust at Ground Zero. Peer reviewed in the Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal (Steven Jones, Niels Harrit et al.). Research ‘Iron rich spheres’, ‘Red gray chips’. Jon Cole “The great thermate debate”. ‘Nano Tubes’. Research ‘Molten Steel’ and ‘Nano Thermite’.

<p>5) Hundreds of Firefighters and witness testimony to BOMBS/EXPLOSIONS ignored by the 9/11 Commission Report. 9/11 Commission Report bars 503 1st responder eyewitnesses and 118 Firefighter witnesses to explosions. From video footage it’s clear to see ‘squibs’ and waves of explosions ripping down the side of the Towers. Many Firefighters witnessed “Explosions in the lobby and sub levels”, ‘Oral Histories’. NIST failed to follow NFPA 921 guidelines for fire and explosion investigations. Research Barry Jennings, William Rodriguez, Erik Lawyer, David Chandler, Graeme MacQueen, Kevin Ryan ‘Demolition Access’.

<p>6) Dick Cheney was in command of NORAD on 9/11. Cheney recalls taking charge from the PEOC bunker (CNN). Norman Mineta testified “Of course the orders still stand, have you heard anything to the contrary?”. Cheney admits that he “Gave the order to shoot down Flight 93”. NORAD failed to intercept any of the four flights in nearly an hour and a half. Several ‘War Game’ exercises were taking place as 9/11 was unfolding. Research ‘NORAD Drills’, Webster Tarpley, Norman Mineta, Mark Dayton “NORAD lied”.

<p>7) The FBI confiscated 84/85 videos from in and around the Pentagon as noted in the ‘Declaration of Jacqueline Maguire’. Pentagon security CCTV does not clearly show a 757. The Double Tree and Citgo videos do not show a plane and the Sheraton Hotel video was never released to the public. Released after the ‘Moussaoui trial’ in 2006 ‘Judicial Watch FOIA request’. ‘5 Still Frames’ (2002).

<p>8) Osama Bin Laden was NOT wanted by the FBI for the 9/11 attacks, “No hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11”. CIA created, trained and funded “Al Qaeda” during the Mujahideen (1980’s). Osama Bin Laden was a CIA asset named ‘Tim Osman’. Fox News reported Osama dead in Dec 2001. At least 7 of the 19 listed hijackers were reported alive by the BBC. FBI has never updated their original list. No video footage of 19 hijackers or passengers boarding the 4 flights. Pilots of the 4 planes never squawked the hijacking code ‘7500’. Research ‘FBI Bin Laden’, ‘Alive hijackers’, ‘Al-CIA-Da’.

<p>9) ‘5 Dancing Israeli’s were arrested with ‘Mossad Truck Bombs’ on 9/11’. Arresting Officer was Scott DeCarlo. ‘Kurzberg, Shmuel, Ellner, Marmari’. They were held in FBI custody for 71 days before being deported back to Israel. They claimed to be in New York to “document the event.” ‘Urban Moving Systems’ was a Mossad front company operated by Dominic Suter. UMS was given a “$498,750 Federal grant” in June of 2001. ‘George Washington Bridge’ and ‘King Street/5th’ bomb threat. Research ‘Mossad Truck Bombs’ and ‘Israeli Spying’.

<p>10) Six out of the Ten 9/11 Commissioners have publicly stated that the report was “Setup to fail” – Co Chairs Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean. “The white house has played cover up” – Max Cleland, resigned calling it a “National scandal’ and “Whitewash”. John Farmer wrote the book ‘The Ground Truth’ where he wrote “the government agreed not to tell the truth about 9/11”. “We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting” – Timothy Roemer. Tom Daschle “Was asked to not investigate 9/11″. Bush hesitated for 441 Days before starting the 911 Commission after pressure from the victims’ family members, ‘Jersey Girls’. The 911 commission was only given $15 million to investigate 9/11. Initially only $3 million was given. Director Philip Zelikow wrote the outline before the commission began. The PATRIOT ACT was written before 9/11 and signed into law on October 26th, 2001. Just 45 days after 9/11.

<p>11) In September, 2000. The Project for a New American Century (PNAC), a neo-conservative think-tank released their report, entitled “Rebuilding America’s Defenses.” In it, they declared that “the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event, like a NEW PEARL HARBOR.” Dick Cheney states that 9/11 achieved the goals of PNAC and was his “highest moment in office”. Listen to Paul Wolfowitz’s “chilling speech” about Pearl Harbor in June 2001.

<p>12) On September 10th, 2001, Rumsfeld reported $2.3 TRILLION missing and unaccounted for at the Pentagon. Renovations were recently done to the Pentagon in the exact spot where “Flight 77” impacted. The area targeted was the Office of Naval Intelligence Accounting department auditing the unaccounted $2.3 Trillion. Dov Zakheim was Pentagon Comptroller and was CEO of System Planning Corporation (SPC) from 1987-2001, which specialized in ‘Flight Termination Systems’. Never identified firms made millions by placing ‘Put Options’ on United and American Airlines. Research “Missing $2.3 Trillion”, “Dov Zakheim”,

<p>13) Marvin Bush, director of Stratesec in 2000 (Securacom, ‘KuAm’) was in charge of security at the WTC, United Airlines and Dulles International Airport. All three were breached on 9/11. ICTS also provided security at 9/11 airports. Research Marvin Bush, Barry McDaniel, Wirt Walker, Ezra Harel (ICTS). “Who killed John O’Neill?”. O’Neill was Former FBI task force agent investigating Al Qaeda/Bin Laden. Was transferred by Kroll Corporation to head WTC security just before 9/11. John O’Neil died in the Towers. Jerome Hauer was Managing Director with Kroll Inc. and former director of OEM. Research ‘Kroll’, ‘ICTS’, ‘Securacom’.

<p>14) “Flight 93” debris was spread out over miles. Media reported multiple crash sites. Chris Konicki described the crash site as “nothing that you could distinguish that a plane had crashed there”. Coroner Wallace Miller claimed there were “no bodies” and “Not a drop of blood”. Mayor Ernie Stull said “there was no plane”. Rumsfeld claimed they “shot down the plane over Pennsylvania”. FBI claimed to have recovered “95 percent” of “Flight 93”. NTSB was called off the investigation. Research the Shanksville crash site.

<p>15) Towers were built to withstand a Boeing jet(s). Leslie Robertson, WTC structural Engineer, claimed he “designed it for a 707 to hit it”. Frank De Martini, deceased Manager of WTC Construction stated the towers “could probably sustain multiple impacts of jetliners” and that a plane would be “like a pencil puncturing your screen netting”. Charlie Thornton, Structural Engineer said “As far as a plane knocking a building over, that would not happen.” George Bush claims he watched the first plane crash into the north tower on TV before entering the classroom, “the TV was obviously on”. Bush was informed about the second impact while reading ‘The Pet Goat’.

    <div class="md"><p>wtc7 is the smoking gun! all others aspects can be somewhat debunked or have a minimum impact on the majority of people (mokten steel / nanothermite).
But wtc7 is the real smoking gun. I&#39;ve show the video to lot of friends without elling them what it was, and everybody thogught for a controlled demolition. This proves nothing, engineers analysys proves something in this case, but this can let people open their eyes and rethink the whole picture.</p>

<p>What, you showed them a <strong>seven hour video</strong> of a building burning out of control before it finally collapsed, or an edited version just showing the last few seconds? I hope you provided refreshments and toilet breaks.</p>

<p>Showing just the end is <em>exactly</em> the same as ignoring the 1953 CIA-backed coup in Iran, and jumping to more modern times and saying &quot;So why doesn&#39;t Iran like America? We didn&#39;t so anything wrong!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so what are the pertinent facts ? a frefall collapsed building ? or (small) fires in the building makin it collapsing at freefall ? or maybe i&#39;m forgotting the debris form the other towers collpase. 
I repeat again. i&#39;m not sayin anything, just that we need to open our eyes. 
we could go on for hours this way; generally i&#39;m pretty confident to say that the official story of the 9/11 have &quot;some&quot; failure in it. that&#39;s all. 
and imo the wtc7 is the biggest one. 
And again, sorry: i&#39;ve not mocked or try to manipulate other people opinion. those who puts their head down the sand cannot be helped. those who (still) have a criticism sense can have an opinion or can or must rethink about that.</p>

<p>&quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;collapse&quot;.</p>

<p>Fires don&#39;t collapse. And the collapse of a building says nothing about whether <em>the fire</em> is out of control, it only says something about the structural integrity of the building, which could mean a lot of things. Can you please try to form an argument that makes sense and doesn&#39;t require me to de-construct your faulty reasoning?</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not what that means at all. An out of control fire means the fire is no longer able <strong>to be</strong> controlled. Many fires are not fought by fire fighters, but they could very well be controlled if they were there. Semantics are very important here, as it is the difference between a good argument and the application of circular logic, which is what you&#39;re doing here, without providing any evidence that the fires were out of control.</p>

<p>By now you must have figured out one of the points of this discussion is to figure out whether the absence of fire fighters was justified or part of the cover-up. Your answer is analogous to &quot;they were absent because they were absent&quot; and is of course complete non-sense in that regard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well since there is no proof a fire has to pertain to your definition of <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=BxEfjuJsPTQ">&quot;out of control&quot;</a> to collapse it&#39;s absolutely not important. Never said they were absent because they were absent. They were absent because wtc 1 fell so everyone got he fuck out of there.</p>

<p>Also nice of you to  not address the lack of sound or visble explosions in wtc 7. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not getting into a debate about WTC7 with you, I am just trying to get to the evidence of your claim that there were uncontrollable fires in WTC7. So far you have produced pictures of the fires in WTC1/2 and an 8 second video of smoke with not a single flame on it. And this pitiful presentation took us almost 10 comments of going back and forth.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say that if you can&#39;t present any evidence after 10 comments and repeated requests, you don&#39;t have any.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why did the BBC report the WTC Building 7 collapse twenty minutes in advance of the event?</strong>  </p>

<p>They refuse to give their source. They also lost the footage for a few years. The BBC explanations for this on their website received much negative comment and attention as it makes sense that reporting an event before it happens, then not quoting the source and losing the footage does not bode well for good journalism, on the day &quot;in the fog of war&quot; as some have put it, or afterwards when questions were arrogantly dismissed. </p>

<p>Conspiracy or not, proper journalists would answer these questions. They are relevant as a matter of record. Ridiculing those who ask these questions begs other questions. Why so certain there is no problem with the BBC reporting on this subject? Heard of Jimmy Savile? After all, these are just questions. Since Quora is a place to ask questions and have them answered by people who know, why not try answering them before resorting to the name calling, defending the establishment as a knee jerk reaction and using dismissive language found in many answers on this question.</p>

<p>Whether or not BBC was part of a conspiracy or not, is not the question. The question is why did they report it all? Who knew it would collapse and why? If there was advance warning of this event it should be known. It may silence those who believe it was a conspiracy. Perhaps the forewarning will explain the conspiracy away. The fact that this is not revealed only makes matters worse. </p>

<p>This is relevant to understanding the event. For anyone to say &quot;they made a mistake&quot; is an opinion. You can&#39;t mistakenly predict the future so another, proper explanation is required. Showing the information they received will resolve this but it&#39;s not forth coming. But the &quot;there&#39;s nothing to see here&quot; attitude answers nothing.</p>

<p>In addition, for those who concede that mistakes are made in the reporting of these things, it would behoove them to apply this instant knee jerk defense to all reporting of such events in the media. There are, no doubt, many incorrect reports and it means that for those who want thorough answers we have to work harder than quoting powerful news organizations that make mistakes, as the final word on these matters.</p>

<p>A proper answer on Quora addresses the question and backs it up. </p>

<p>The answer to this question is: We don&#39;t know why, but we should.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes. thank you‼ </p>

<p>I am accepting that by 3 generations from now I will be dead and the truth will be finally out there. But after I am gone without any closure.</p>

<p>I do think some estimate exists as people will begin to cycle into our bureaucracy, replacing old figures to only discover more than what they bargained for. Mouths tend to be loud sometimes. This is all hopes and speculation of decent humans being politicians...which never comes up in the same sentences ever.</p>

<p>again, thanks for the detailed response. I really enjoyed the list-format of which you provided.</p>

<p>In an experiment, ten people sitting in the same room are asked to choose between an obviously correct answer and an obviously incorrect one...

<p>This is a guy who was diagnosed as having potentially violent antisocial tendencies at 15 years old. He pulled a knife on his mothers landlady as a kid. He was fired from every job he ever had.

    <div class="md"><p>Playing the devil&#39;s advocate, I&#39;ll continue to take the viewpoint of a potential perpetrator(s): one tasked with assasinating an official.  So we&#39;re looking for someone to take the fall.  We most likely can&#39;t blame it on god or aliens, so it&#39;ll have to be a real person.</p>

<p>Checklist
1) Mental problems<br/>
2) Violent, anti-social tendencies<br/>
3) Pulled a knife on his mother&#39;s landlady as a kid<br/>
4) Fired form every job he had<br/>
5) Abusive<br/>
6) Suicidal<br/>
7) Discussed shooting a president to Marines  </p>

<p>All these make him a perfect candidate to take the fall.  If I had to propose the most sane theory, he&#39;d still be the sole shooter; I have moderate suspicions he was victim to extreme brainwashing, and psycho-political priming, for who knows how long.  Him being murdered shortly after following through on his mission only makes this easier to believe. </p>

<p>Just because it&#39;s possible doesn&#39;t mean it happened. I&#39;d need <em>evidence</em> that Oswald was a puppet, because everything about him from all the way back to his childhood screams disaffected lone nut loser, and every single action he took on the day of the assassination fits that same profile. </p>

<p>At least you&#39;re willing to admit that Oswald was the one in that window with a rifle in his hand. Most people around here would strenuously disagree with you on that. </p>

<p>It shows quite a bit more than a signature, but even so, signing a petition is almost to the letter &quot;coming out publicly&quot;, that&#39;s the whole idea behind a petition, showing to the public that you are behind an idea.</p>

<p>Also, why is it that people who believe in the official story always have to resort to turning this into a numbers game? Why not discuss the actual facts and science instead of turning it into a popularity contest?
I mean, the answer to your question is quite obvious, so that begs the question why you still pose it. Are you that insecure about what you know that you have to influence others by suggesting you&#39;re in the bigger group?</p>

<p>And since you now know that thermite can be tailored to fit specific needs (thanks to me) we can go further to determine whether or not it can be tailored for sound! </p>

<p>I feel embarrassed <em>for</em> you at this point.</p>

<p>So at this point you&#39;re 0/2 with the facts. So rather than you spewing out more unsupported opinion...why don&#39;t you try to at least get 1/3 with the facts. Go ahead and account for the VOCs measured at Ground Zero</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>Wow. I can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t understand what you just read. You even highlighted the point that refutes you. Thermite is not as loud as conventional CD explosives and can be tailored to adjust the volume. Yes, you have been &quot;rekt&quot; with this information.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll continue to wait for you to account for the VOCS using only the combustion available in the official story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao. I see in your comment  history you got completely shut down in another thread trying to argue VOCs. Yet you&#39;re still trying to argue it. Because you&#39;re just a broken record that argues just to argue. So yah I ignored it. Just like you ignored explosions not occuring immediately prior to collapse. Just like I&#39;m gunna ignore anything you say until you address this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll start off with correcting a fundamental misconception that crops up at several points and should be dealt with summarily: the 9/11 Commission report only covers intelligence and law enforcement considerations. Any technical or engineering questions are outside its purview so constant repetitions of what is or isn&#39;t in the report is completely irrelevant. For engineering and technical questions, refer to the NIST Report. Conflating the two betrays either basic ignorance or dishonesty.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>These are facts--but they have mundane explanations. </p></li>
<li><p>This is easily explained by garbled communications. The alternative explanation, that the BBC were provided knowledge, makes no sense whatsoever.</p></li>
<li><p>2300 Architects and Engineers is a miniscule percentage of their respective fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Molten steel would have produced steam explosions from the water sprayed on the rubble pile. Thermite doesn&#39;t produce the eutectic melting referenced. The &quot;nano-thermite&quot; was found to be comprised of paint and primer. Iron microspheres aren&#39;t produced soley by thermite.</p></li>
<li><p>Eyewitness reports of explosions are scattered, inconsistent with demolition, and not corroborated by video/audio recordings (which have no audio evidence of blasting whatsoever.) Actual blasting does not produce &quot;squibs and waves of explosions&quot; as seen on the WTC.</p></li>
<li><p>Hollywood expectations of jet fighter intercepts are largely fictional. There is no actual evidence of any suspicious orders given by top people.</p></li>
<li><p>This is an argument from ignorance at best. The Citgo and Doubletree videos weren&#39;t in a position to show the plane.</p></li>
<li><p>This is not one fact but rather several specious and highly dubious claims. In particular the claims that some hijackers were still alive has been thoroughly discredited.</p></li>
<li><p>Every single person who had a camera had it pointed at the WTC &quot;to document the event.&quot; It doesn&#39;t mean that was what they were there to do in the first place.</p></li>
<li><p>Given the embarassing failures of the intelligence and the law enforcement communities to prevent the attack, it&#39;s simply not necessary to invent a conspiracy to be the cause of these quotes.</p></li>
<li><p>Completely irrelevant. Opportunism does not equate to complicity.</p></li>
<li><p>Again, not one fact but more than one smuggled in. The attack did not impact the accounting investigation, and there are put options on thousands of companies every day. That somebody happened to guess right is no more an indication of conspiracy than guessing the right lottery numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>This is innuendo, not evidence. </p></li>
<li><p>That&#39;s what happens when a plane crashes at high speed and high angle into an unyielding surface. It and nearly all of its contents basically get pulverized. </p></li>
<li><p>They were not built to withstand fully fueled high speed suicide attacks.</p></li>

<p>And anyway, most of them--not actually all that incriminating.</p>

<p>Being wanted by the FBI for something means that person is a suspect who can be prosecuted for direct involvement in a crime. Being the leader of the organization that committed the crime doesn&#39;t mean that leader is going to be arrested for <em>that.</em> </p>

<p>&quot;No hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11.&quot; A naked quote with no attribution or context deserves no time wasted in response.</p>

<p>CIA created Al Qaeda? Not really. We funded and trained the Afghan Mujahedeen during the Soviet occupation during the Cold War, but that doesn&#39;t mean Al Qaeda is the CIA&#39;s creature. The fact that we left them without a pot to piss in after we didn&#39;t have any strategic need for their help anymore was a huge part of why we had an anti-American terror problem in that country to begin with. </p>

<p>&quot;Tim Osman&quot;--A claim with very murky origins and completely unverifiable. And even if it were, it&#39;s just part and parcel of the above.

<p>&quot;No video footage.&quot; Except for all the video footage we have. It&#39;s easy to say &quot;there&#39;s no evidence&quot; when you just declare that all the evidence is faked.</p>

<p>On the contrary, they are <em>entirely</em> consistent with demolition and the OP provides a well sourced page to back up the claim. I do like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiIT4HInWjY">firefighters</a> descriptions though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) read the fucking NIST report.</p>

<p>2) There had been reports for hours that WTC7 was going to be allowed to burn out, that it may collapse, that it was about to collapse, that collapse was imminent. It&#39;s completely unsurprising that some remark was misheard as &quot;it has collapsed&quot; and passed along some news wire. But <strong>why would the conspiracy even need a press release at all?!</strong> It makes no sense, it adds no value, to extend foreknowledge to uninvolved people--a <em>foreign</em> news service in fact--when all they had to do was <strong>nothing</strong>. Keep all the journalists in the dark, don&#39;t bother with press releases, just let them report on events as they unfold. It&#39;s unbelievably stupid to suggest that there was a script passed around.</p>

<p>No, those are the architects and engineers who have ever, since its inception, joined or signed on to the AE9/11Truth organization. An organization whose membership reflects less than two percent of their combined fields. Just this year, their proposal got laughed off the floor of the American Institute of Architects convention. Sorry, no, you don&#39;t get to shift the burden of proof on this one. When AE9/11Truth manages to swing a plurality of professionals, then you&#39;ll have a leg to stand on.</p>

<p>Demolition charges are set off seconds before collapse initiates. <strong>Any</strong> report of an explosion by an occupant of the building who later makes his or her way out of the building is, necessarily, not consistent with blasting. Blasting detonations are also <strong>deafening.</strong> The fact that any given explosion is not corroborated by a consensus of all those present indicates that the explosions were not large enough to be blasting.</p>

<p>According to the link you gave, the F-16 fighter jets scrambled to intercept the plane had over <em>four hours</em> in which to do so. So, thank you for proving my point for me.</p>

<p>What you call &quot;confiscated&quot; is also synonymous with &quot;collected as potential evidence.&quot; It&#39;s utterly not suspicious. They probably scooped up every recording they could get their hands on for a mile around to review as a normal part of investigation. Why haven&#39;t we seen a video of the plane hitting the Pentagon? Maybe there aren&#39;t any. Most surveillance video is focused on foot and ground vehicle traffic, there&#39;s no reason to expect a great many would be positioned to capture an incoming plane. And at any rate, the plane parts and the crash damage is so conclusively caused by a plane that even many Truther sites are eschewing the no-plane theory of the Pentagon attack.</p>

<p>What the report from the Guardian said was that after &quot;cruising north-west for about four hours across the breadth of the country, apparently on autopilot, the Learjet seems to have run out of fuel and plunged into a swampy part of north-eastern South Dakota, two miles from the small town of Mina.&quot;, which isn&#39;t the same thing as saying the &quot; F-16 fighter jets scrambled to intercept the plane had over four hours in which to do so.&quot; You changed the meaning there.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the Washington Post story, which has more details and a proper timeline:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the FAA, the plane left Orlando, where Stewart lived, at 9:19 a.m. Eastern time</p>

<p>The FAA said air traffic controllers lost radio contact with the plane at 9:44 a.m., just after they had cleared the twin-engine jet to climb to 39,000 feet northwest of Gainesville, Fla. An FAA spokesman said that air traffic controllers noted &quot;significant changes in altitude&quot; by the plane, but that the aircraft&#39;s crew did not respond to repeated radio calls from the ground.</p>

<p>Pentagon officials said the military began its pursuit of the ghostly civilian aircraft at 10:08 a.m., when two Air Force F-16 fighters from Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida that were on a routine training mission were asked by the FAA to intercept it. The F-16s did not reach the Learjet, but an Air Force F-15 fighter from Eglin Air Force Base in Florida that also was asked to locate it got within sight of the aircraft and stayed with it from 11:09 a.m. to 11:44 a.m., when the military fighter was diverted to St. Louis for fuel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t scrambled at 10:08, the planes were <em>already in the air</em> doing something completely different and were in a position to divert. And they failed to find it. It took a third jet to locate the plane, an hour and fifteen minutes after losing contact! </p>

<p>Again, thank you for proving my point that scrambling jets at a moments notice to zip up to escort errant planes is a largely a Hollywood fantasy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read the fucking NIST Report</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I gather you refer to the unbelievably fraudulent NIST report? That NIST report?</p>

<p>At a press briefing, Shyam Sunder, NIST’s lead investigator, declared that “the reason for the collapse of World Trade Center 7 is no longer a mystery.” He also, announced that NIST “did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down,” saying: “[S]cience is really behind what we have said.”   Both of these statements are patently false.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of science: Far from being supported by good science, NIST’s report repeatedly makes its case by resorting to scientific fraud.</p>

<p>[And as an aside, if NIST did engage in fraudulent science, this would not be particularly surprising. NIST is an agency of the US Department of Commerce. During the years it was writing its World Trade Center reports, it was therefore an agency of the Bush-Cheney administration. In 2004, the Union of Concerned Scientists put out a document charging this administration with “distortion of scientific knowledge for partisan political ends.” By the end of the Bush administration, this document had been signed by over 15,000 scientists, including 52 Nobel Laureates and 63 recipients of the National Medal of Science.  See <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/abuses_of_science/scientists-sign-on-statement.html">this</a> for more details on this.</p>

<p>Moreover, a scientist who formerly worked for NIST has reported that it has been “fully hijacked from the scientific into the political realm,” with the result that scientists working for NIST “lost [their] scientific independence, and became little more than ‘hired guns.’”  Referring in particular to NIST’s work on the World Trade Center, he said everything had to be approved by the Department of Commerce, the National Security Agency, and the Office of Management and Budget—“an arm of the Executive Office of the President,” which “had a policy person specifically delegated to provide oversight on [NIST’s] work.” (See <a href="http://georgewashington.blogspot.com/2007/10/former-nist-employee-blows-whistle.html">this</a> regarding this whistleblower.)]</p>

<p>One of the general principles of scientific work is that its conclusions must not be dictated by nonscientific concerns – in other words, by any concern other than that of discovering the truth. This former NIST employee’s statement gives us reason to suspect that NIST, while preparing its report on WTC 7, would have been functioning as a political, not a scientific, agency. The amount of fraud in this report suggests that this was indeed the case.</p>

<p>According to the National Science Foundation, the major types of scientific fraud are fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism. There is no sign that NIST is guilty of plagiarism, but it is certainly guilty of fabrication, which can be defined as “making up results,” and falsification, which means either “changing or omitting data.” (See National Science Foundation misconduct policies.)</p>

<p>The omission of evidence by NIST is so massive, in fact, that it doesn&#39;t really fit within the conventional definition of &quot;Scientific Fraud&quot;.
NIST seemed to manifest an unflinching determination to disregard half of the relevant evidence. Clearly that goes beyond just a bias in their conclusion.</p>

<p>With regard to there being &quot;no evidence of explosives&quot;... This is because it was simply ignored.</p>

<p>I have mentioned in this thread the &quot;Swiss-Cheese Steel&quot; in the FEMA report.  This piece of steel from WTC 7 had been melted so severely that it looked like Swiss cheese. As also mentioned in another comment above, James Glanz, the N.Y. Times reporter who covered the FEMA findings wrote: “The steel apparently melted away, but no fire in any of the buildings was believed to be hot enough to melt steel outright.” Glanz’s statement was, in fact, quite an understatement. The full truth is that the fires in the building could not have brought the steel anywhere close to the temperature – about 1,482°C (2,700°F) – needed for it to melt. ( See <a href="http://www.uniweld.com/catalog/alloys/alloys_melting.htm">Melting Point of Metals</a> )</p>

<p>The Lee Report (again, as I cite above) said: “A detailed study into the mechanisms [that caused] this phenomenon is needed.”</p>

<p>Arden Bement, who was the director of NIST when it took on the WTC project, said that NIST’s report would address “all major recommendations contained in the [FEMA] report.”   But when NIST issued its report on WTC 7, it did not mention this piece of steel with the Swiss-cheese appearance. Indeed, NIST even claimed that not a single piece of steel from WTC 7 had been recovered.</p>

<p>This piece of steel, moreover, was only a small portion of the evidence, ignored by NIST, that steel had melted. See my other comment regarding the Deutsche Bank evidence.</p>

<p>A key point stated in my comment above is that the Lee Report/study also found that temperatures had been reached “at which lead would have undergone vaporization”– meaning 1,749°C (3,180°F).</p>

<p>Another study was carried out by the US Geological Survey, the purpose of which was to aid the “identification of WTC dust components.” Besides also finding iron particles, the scientists involved in this study found that molybdenum had been melted. This finding was especially significant, because this metal does not melt until it reaches 2,623°C (4,753°F).</p>

<p><strong>NIST, however, did not mention either of these studies, even though the latter one was carried out by another US government agency.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Deutsche Bank building, which was right next to the Twin Towers, was heavily contaminated by dust produced by their destruction. But Deutsche Bank’s insurance company refused to pay for the clean-up, claiming that this dust had not resulted from the destruction of the WTC. So Deutsche Bank hired the RJ Lee Group to do a study, which showed that the dust in the Deutsche Bank was WTC dust, which had a unique signature. Part of this signature was “Spherical iron . . . particles.” This meant, the RJ Lee Group said, that iron had “melted during the WTC Event, producing spherical metallic particles.” The study even showed that, whereas iron particles constitute only 0.04 percent of normal building dust, they constituted almost 6 percent of WTC Dust – meaning almost 150 times as much as normal. The spherical iron particles are also a strong indicator of thermite (although, the intensity required for this demolition lends itself to concluding  nanothermite/thermate was used).</p>

<p>The RJ Lee study also found that temperatures had been reached “at which lead would have undergone vaporization”  – meaning 1,749°C (3,180°F).</p>

<p>Back to the &quot;jet fuel&quot; meme? </p>

<p>Nope...well, you can have your fun if you must, but don&#39;t implicate Building 7. All the alleged jet fuel ignited on impact with WTC 1 &amp; 2....there was no jet fuel in building 7. The fire was caused by burning debris.</p>

<p>With respect to Building 7, FEMA did the initial investigative report. It was comprised of volunteers and was not funded by Congress. It put forth an hypothesis, but qualified this hypothesis by stating that even it had a very low probability. Basically, it increased the mystery... thanks to an appendix written by three professors at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. This appendix reported that a piece of steel from WTC 7 had melted so severely that it had gaping holes in it, making it look like a piece of Swiss cheese. James Glanz (a N.Y. Times journalist who interviewed and wrote an article on the FEMA findings), in describing the conclusion in the report that the fires in the building could not have been hot enough to melt steel, referred to this discovery as “the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if there were iron components in the towers...if you accept the preposterous &quot;pancake theory&quot; of collapse, you would never have that many iron particles.

<p>The fact is you&#39;d need far more heat in far more places within the towers to create the concentration of iron sphere particles in the WTC Dust.</p>

<p>Something apparently out of your reach.</p>

<p>Velocity counts for most of the force behind an impact, and whichever material is the most brittle usually breaks first due to shock. In this case, steel is one of the more brittle metals known to man, and it&#39;s not surprising that it would shatter like glass. It&#39;s the same reason why skyscrapers in earthquake zones use aluminium beams instead of steel, and why water can turn your bones to jelly if you hit it hard enough. </p>

<p>Tl;dr, harder doesn&#39;t mean better, especially when the laws of velocity are in effect. This is grade school stuff, for God&#39;s sake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Steel is ductile and far from brittle. If you want to say its brittle, then it is no more or less &quot;brittle&quot; than aluminum.</p>

<p>However, steel can withstand far more pressure. I don&#39;t know the threshold, but what&#39;s key is that below this threshold, steel will not fatigue/become stressed (indefinitely). Aluminum does not share this strength. A similar threshold for aluminum would be a very tiny fraction of that of steel&#39;s. Considering you could easily dent airplane aluminum with a carpenter&#39;s hammer, it&#39;s obvious that the <strong>yield strength</strong> between the two metals is significantly different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The early BBC report is no mystery. Firefighters at the scene who assessed the damage to WTC7 believed it had become structurally  unsound and was on the verge of collapse and so they cleared a collapse zone around the building before it fell. All the news stations were reporting this information. Some stations misunderstood the info and reported that the building had already collapsed (instead of that it was expected to collapse). </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The fire was out of control because it was literally not being control by firefighters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s not what that means at all. An out of control fire means the fire is no longer able <strong>to be</strong> controlled. Many fires are not fought by fire fighters, but they could very well be controlled if they were there. Semantics are very important here, as it is the difference between a good argument and the application of circular logic, which is what you&#39;re doing here, without providing any evidence that the fires were out of control.</p>

<p>By now you must have figured out one of the points of this discussion is to figure out whether the absence of fire fighters was justified or part of the cover-up. Your answer is analogous to &quot;they were absent because they were absent&quot; and is of course complete non-sense in that regard.</p>
