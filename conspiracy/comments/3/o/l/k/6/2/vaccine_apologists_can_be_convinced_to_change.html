       It's stupid how pro-vaxxers are all up in arms about public health and safety. Are all of these people suddenly germaphobes? Do we have a mass cultural shift toward hyper-cleanliness? Where is it? Is it absent because maybe people are being told what to believe instead of coming to these ideas on their own? Geez, kind of like when pro-vaxxers assert that anti-vaxxers adopted their position from a perspective of fear as opposed to reason. So ironic.

       It doesn't seem to me that they care
       <em>
        at all
       </em>
       about human lives. They are just regurgitating talking points like a parrot, and almost universally seem to be missing the bigger picture. Click the history of any vocal pro-vaxx individual and you won't see anything about cigarettes, obesity, swimming pools, breast feeding, etc. When I bring up these points, they make up all kinds of excuses because it's uncomfortable to realize you are an idiot parrot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obesity is about as big of a problem as cigarette smoke.
       <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/mar2005/nia-16.htm">
        300,000 deaths per year in the US
       </a>
       vs about 480,000 for cigarettes if you count secondhand smoke, those being the two largest killers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common rebuttal:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Obesity deaths aren't as big of an issue because that's middle aged and old people dying, not children. Cigarettes are on a slow decline already, so it doesn't matter.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ok, what about swimming pools and breast feeding?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Water-Safety/waterinjuries-factsheet.html">
        Children ages 1 to 4 have the highest drowning rates. In 2009, among children 1 to 4 years old who died from an unintentional injury, more than 30% died from drowning.  Among children ages 1 to 4, most drownings occur in home swimming pools. Drowning is responsible for more deaths among children 1-4 than any other cause except congenital anomalies (birth defects). Among those 1-14, fatal drowning remains the second-leading cause of unintentional injury-related death behind motor vehicle crashes.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_24824.html">
        Non-breastfed children in industrialized countries are at greater risk of dying - a recent study of post-neonatal mortality in the United States found a 25% increase in mortality among non-breastfed infants. In the UK Millennium Cohort Survey, six months of exclusive breast feeding was associated with a 53% decrease in hospital admissions for diarrhoea and a 27% decrease in respiratory tract infections.

       Yeah, you listed a whole lot of things that arent communicable diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downvote me to hell, but a strong outbreak of a preventable disease that has been under control by vaccination isnt acceptable. You have a lot of problems listed where people die and none of them can be prevented as easily as getting a vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cigarettes, pools, accidental poisionings, yeah, people die. Those things arent contagious and there are already lots of laws and initiatives trying to control the issues you stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are shifting the actual issue. There are millions of kids starving in africa, but that does not detract from this issue. We dont have yo solve the worlds problems from the top down. Different people have different causes that are important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: actually, all of those come down to personal responsibility (or your parental responsibility for a child). Anti-Vaxxers hurt people who are tryng to protect themslves by people who dont give a fuck.

       As I said, all I ever get are excuses for why people like yourself completely ignore things which kill many more children, and for some weird reason, only stick to vaccines when you have discussions. In this case, the reason is communicable disease. If something else kills children, who cares as long as people don't catch it? Right?

       There's already tons of laws and initiatives trying to control disease through vaccination. So, why are you talking about vaccination and not these other issues which are way more important and kill way more children?

      <p>
       So you don't care about deaths and sickness in children as long as it's parents making their own children sick? What about school lunch programs? What about pollution from factories?
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you realize how ridiculous it is to make excuses for the reason people care about vaccines and literally nothing else...Obesity lowers the immunity of children and adults. I also mentioned PFAS in the first comment, but here's more info:

       I browsed your history, and noticed you actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       care about self inflicted harm, contrary to your post here. You claim here that nobody should give a shit if a person is doing harm to themselves or their own children, but it becomes an issue when the harm is extended beyond the family. Here's what you said 28 days ago:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        People argue that having a gun in the house doesnt make suicide more likely. It DOES. When you know you have a thing that is instant and you make the decision in an instant then the gun is the issue.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Why do you care about suicide? It's self inflicted harm, so nobody should give a shit, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said, all I get are excuses. Cognitive dissonance is a bitch, isn't it?

       Lol, all you get are excuses? You basically ignored my post, tried to dig up a personal attack, then implied im makig excuses over something? I honestly cant tell because you just are already acting like you know it all and cant be bothered to listen to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your only response is a non response by deflecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like you think that because people think not vaccinating is risking our herd immunity that they dont care about ANY other issues. I never said I dont care about other issues that are a "bigger deal" than vaccines, just that because one issue causes less death doesbt mean it is less important. Its not all about children, its about controlling disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quoting other ways people die isnt an argument like you think it is and not everyone is a 1issue person like you are implying.
      </p>
      <p>

       This is what you are doing. Disease control is a high priority on the "all problems" scale. But fwwl free to continue to quote studies about guns and swimming pools by all means, it looks like your audience loves it.

       I never said that those arent issues, i said they are cultural and responsibiliry based. They are a different thing. Those are big issues that cant be easily solved.
      </p>
      <p>
       A vaccine is a vaccine. It doesnt take anything but making people get them to help control disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they dont detract from eachother because they are both important. I'm not diminishing anything but the idea that since most people survive and mosy arent maimed or affected long term from a disease that we are vaccinated for doesnt mean its not a big issue.

       So now the reason is that since it's easier to get a vaccine than to buy decent food, you shouldn't care about spreading information on obesity, breast feeding, swimming pools, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's pretty easy to buy a fence for a pool, or simply wait until the children are able to swim, or tell mothers to breast feed, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, it doesn't make sense.

       There are literally fence laws in cali over swimming pools because when they spiked in popularity so did child drownings.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I am saying since its easy to get a vaccine its an easy win to control disease. Hopefully there will be more vaccines for other diseases like malaria in the future. Just like hopefully we will figure out getting people to eat healthier and exercise more and make mental health facilities more accessible.

       I couldnt be clearer that im not diminishing any of the issues you listed. I actually wrote the entire second paragraph of my last comment to make it crystal clear. Its obvious you arent reading beyond sentencr 1 if at all.

       Yes, but why concentrate on one issue, and one issue only? This is what almost every person does. I never see tons of breast feeding posts, anything about swimming pools, etc. You're just basically saying "yes those are issues, but I'm probably going to continue ignoring them and only concentrate on this other, less important issue, and you can't call me out on it because I just said here that I agree these are problems."

       Vaccination is a hot topic right now. Swimming pools drownings were a hot topic in the 70s. Smoking was a hot topic of the 90s. Ecigs are a hot topic now too. Thats all there is to it. This conversation came up because its a hot topic. This post is about a vaccination post on the front page. Because its a hot topic

       ...Because the media push talking points that people regurgitate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the media were spreading tons of information on swimming pools, then obviously all of these people would follow suit and regurgitate everything they see on TV about swimming pools.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, obesity is also a hot topic, but we don't see very many people saying things like "you're harming your children by feeding them shit food." Or: "You're harming other people's children with shitty school lunch programs." Etc. I think the reason is probably that the media doesn't really care all that much, aside from simply reporting on the epidemic because it's crazy, and there isn't much of a reason to make their audience feel morally superior when they talk down to people of different opinion on that topic.

       I'm questioning the stated motives of those types of people. They frequently claim they care about the children, people getting sick, etc, but for some reason believe that vaccines are the only tool one can use to keep from becoming sick. There are all of these other ways to boost the health of the population, and I rarely see any of that when I click a person's reddit history.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think it's fair to point out the fact that most of them are bullshitting. And along the way, I'm spreading health information to these people in the hopes that they would spread some of that to supplement their vaccine conversations.

       You realize the same could be said of you? There are diseases that have been all but eradicated by vaccines. You promoting an anti-vaccine position could easily be seen by others as you wanting people to die, gish gallop not withstanding.

       Having a differing opinion based on scientific research should be treated with more respect. I avoid certain vaccines, but know very well the ones I have taken have saved lives. This all or nothing crap just embarrasses you and those who follow the intellectually lazy black/white dichotomy.

       I didn't do that. I'm talking specifically about people who spend way too much time pushing the vaccine narrative and who believe the world is black and white, without considering that their efforts might be quite inefficient for improving the health of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, a back and forth about this would be a waste of time. All we would argue about is the definitions of anti-vaxx, pro-vaxx, and what I initially meant, which would be stupid, so see ya.

       I may be incorrect, but aren't mortality rates different from actual contracted cases? I thought mortality was death from the illness. If that's the case, then deaths declining would line up with better medicinal practices, where contraction would likely show the vaccinations in a more correct light. I would fm definitely be willing to look at a graph that shows how these diseases were eradicated before the vaccines, as opposed to the mortality rate of them.

       Thanks for pointing this out!  I was really confused by these graphs and was about to jump in and do even more research on the topic and reasons for what this graph SEEMS to show.  Turns out it's just more playing on people's fears and trying to confirm their already held beliefs.  I feel like a fool for falling for it.

       Thank you. I was trying to figure out a way to respond without being a dick about it. Of course I don't think every downvote is gamed, but it's just as dumb to think that none are...

       Occam's Razor. When faced with two assumptions which can't hold true together, which do you go with? The one that requires more complexity or less?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, it's more likely that people just
       <em>
        disagree
       </em>
       , not that there's big-pharma execs paying lackeys to make sure
       <em>
        the fucking internet
       </em>
       , of all places, doesn't talk bad about its drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, shills exist. I just have serious doubts that they're paying attention to posts like this. This subreddit discredits any and all ideas posted to it, automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       , I would argue that the disinfo shills are the only real shills at play here, in any force. Those people who are spreading nonsense that will later be associated with legitimate theories. "Oh you think JFK was assassinated? You must think the Earth is flat too". I've literally had that said to me. Not by a redditor either.
      </p>
      <p>
       That type of disinfo campaign costs money, it's not directed at any one theory but
       <em>
        all of them
       </em>
       , and above all it's
       <em>
        obvious
       </em>
       that money is behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if big pharma were paying for the downvotes, I'd hope they could buy more than a dozen. Why - with me sitting here basically defending big pharma - am I
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       getting all their upvotes, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       No: again, Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is most likely to be the accurate one, which tells me this is just organic disagreement with the theory posited, and not some organized group with money behind it. If they had their kind of money behind a downvote campaign, it'd be a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       more effective than this.

       While you sure do know the philosophy, neither of these two specific possibilities prevent the other. There can be some of both, in this case, so Occam's Razor does not really apply.

       Sure it could apply if that was true, but I think that's an assumption you're actually making. If you're going to knock them for their assumptions, making your own in the opposite direction doesn't make you any more correct or intelligent...

       In this case the "two assumptions that can't hold true together" are A. There are Big Pharma shills on reddit or B. There are no Big Pharma shills on reddit.  Since we know shills exist, and since we know online PR exists, and since we know reddit is one of the largest and most influential sites in the world, and since we know reddit is anonymous and thus very easy to vote game, and since we know Big Pharma spends billions a year on both marketing and lobbying, Occam's razor tells me that there are at least
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       Big Pharma shills on reddit.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And I think it's a lot more likely that elements of both are at play.  I don't think anyone is suggesting that every single downvote on a vaccine post comes from a Big Pharma shill, but I think to outright deny the possibility that some do is ignoring some glaring pieces of evidence regarding the influence of PR shills and content manipulation on the web.

       You know that when typically observing data trends there can be multiple factors interacting to create the trend, right? If that being the case means we shouldn't observe trends, then... well fuck science and stats.

       Well then you'd know that the primary reason for the initial steep decline of reported infectious disease cases was due to water purification practices becoming widespread. Vaccines closed the loop providing greater protections as they're refined and made more effective.

       I argued that showing these pictures subconsciously trick people into wrongfully thinking that these nearly eradicated disease are more of a risk to people not vaccinated than they are and that vaccine skepticism is a logical reaction to avoiding needless personal risk solely for the benefit of others through herd immunity, since the real personal risk of catching these diseases in a developed country is almost nil.

       The great thing about the vaccine hypothesis is that normal healthy factors, clean drinking water, sanitation, nutrition, controlling over crowding are not really important factors in controlling disease, rather, taking our magic pills and injections are the magic ways of curing disease. Let's bury the real truth about health and feed people a superstitious approach based around the infallibility of our institutions, our experts and our claims about our snake oil cures.

       OK, as promised I read the source - it took a while as it was long.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, but there's nothing in there that suggests or provides evidence towards, let alone proves that smallpox wasn't eradicated with a vaccination programme.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was. It was a sustained global programme that completely eradicated the disease in the wild. Before the programme, 10s of millions of people were contracting smallpox every year, with millions dying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since its eradication - nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your explanation for that if you claim it wasn't as a result of vaccination?
      </p>
      <p>
       That article talks a lot about the early days of vaccination - from the 18th century to the mid 19th century. Are you seriously suggesting that problems in the early stages of a new medical field are proof that smallpox wasn't eradicated by vaccination almost 250 years later?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was one point that struck me. It mentioned a potential increase in the spread of HIV in Africa because of the vaccination programme. Even the quote given said that was as a result of using dirty needles. That's nothing to do with the vaccine, it's to do with bad medical hygiene - sharing needles was the issue.

       You don't need to vaccinate the entire population to eradicate a disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you need to do is start a sustained programme and then isolate new outbreaks and prevent them spreading.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every vaccinated person in a population becomes a non-spreader. The more people who are vaccinated, the slower the spread of the disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, focussing on outbreaks becomes easier and easier as the vaccination programme also reduces the number and frequency of new outbreaks.

       Yes they have. Smallpox, for example. Eradicated. Using a vaccination programme.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not be aware of this, but there are not that many diseases that can be eradicated using a vaccination programme.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a disease has a reservoir outside the human body, then it's not possible. By that, I mean if a disease has somewhere outside the human body where it can survive, then it will always be able to re-enter the population if vaccinations aren't administered, or if the disease mutates.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where people get confused - bats are a host for Ebola, for example, so it can never be eradicated by vaccinating humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smallpox was a candidate for eradication and that's what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ebola is not a candidate for eradication so it will not be attempted.

       Your graphs all address death, so of course they're going to show vaccines doing bugger all - But if you got a graph showing incidences of disease, you'd see the implementation of vaccines was followed by a reduction in disease -&gt;

       Take measles for example. Measles isn't life-threatening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the vaccine, people would contract the virus, (usually) recover, and they would come out of it with

       The vaccine
       <em>

       and comes with many risks and side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the 21st century. With proper sanitation and nutrition (
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       vitamins A and C), the risk of harm from the measles vaccine (ie vaccine-induced measles) to me appears greater than the risk of actual measles.

       because it doesn't show how long the drop lasted, or that after the recommended second dose was introduced, numbers plummented consistently to near zero.

       Yet it does reduce the rate of measles to the lowest consistent numbers ever recorded. I dunno, which is better? Getting measles and never getting it again, or never getting it in the first place. Seems obvious to me.

       Uhh, whut? Getting measles from the vaccine is worse than getting measles? If measles is measles is measles, why would one be worse than the other?

      <p>
       But if vaccines cause measles, shouldn't there be a dramatic spike in the rates of infection following the introduction of vaccines? Instead we see it drop to near zero.

       So I'm not following you on the smallpox thing. If it was so detrimental that we introduced the vaccine, and numbers actually
       <em>
        got worse
       </em>
       ... why did smallpox basically just
       <em>
        die right the fuck out at the turn of the century
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like seriously, it's amazing that you can look at that graph and think "and smallpox is way worse now!" when it's literally dropped to almost zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       That graph is not at all supporting your anti-vax cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Oh I get it, because the diseases were already on the downturn prior to vaccines, your argument is that the vaccines were unnecessary. Funny. Guess why those diseases were already on the downturn? Hint: It's because of other forms of western medicine – the same western medicine that says we ought to vaccinate. You can't have your cake and eat it too. And further, the graph still shows vaccines work.

       The argument is that they were "on the downturn" because of a generally increased quality of living, in which healthcare played a role, as did: sanitation, access to clean drinking water, and nutrition.

      <p>
       I'm not strictly on one side or the other here- I think vaccines are a valuable tool against the threat of disease.  But i also think they get more credit than they deserve and should not be idolized in the way they are.

       That's actually not true. Vaccinations for smallpox began as early as the 18th century. Overall changes in health and sanitation led to the eradication of smallpox, scarlett fever, and the bubonic plague. Vaccinations were one part of that whole picture, and a necessary one. Quarantine is often not a solution, but a manner of temporary containment.
