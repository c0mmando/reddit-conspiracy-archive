       First: a quick intro into what a state convention actually is
       <a href="http://www.conventionofstates.com/we_know_the_rules_congress_does_not_control">
        http://www.conventionofstates.com/we_know_the_rules_congress_does_not_control
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Police nowadays pepper spray any social gathering they damn well please.  Could you imagine what kind of opposition would be shown by the federal government towards a self proclaimed state convention?  This is their last resort however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their first line of defense would be to use the media to make sure that the delegates they want would be chosen to go.  But in today's world of independent media, I think we finally have the power to defeat that front.  Because remember, aint no gerrymandering in a state convention... Its the popular vote from each state.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said, I think the biggest problem would be the initial organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       But A call for a state convention initiated by key leaders all all once... The possibility of that going viral might be their worst nightmare...
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see it now... A video of Noam chomsky &amp; Farrakhan holding hands (and many others, I just think that would be a funny sight) , calling for a state convention..
      </p>
      <p>
       Is non violent revolution just a pipe dream at this point?

       The essential element of the framing of the Constitution was compromise. The only reason it happened was thanks to a powerful common enemy in England, without the threat of annihilation they never would have put aside their differences to find agreement.

       We couldn't do it again today. People have no concept of compromise, they value more the power to force others to follow their personal beliefs. An unquestioning belief in democracy has saddled us with the tyranny of the majority, liberty is no longer valued.

       The Constitutional convention began in May of 1787, 4 years after the
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783">
        <em>
         Treaty of Paris
        </em>
       </a>
       . What common enemy was that again? It was the People.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Framers were the 1% of their day. They benefitted tremendously commercially with a stronger Federal Government. The entire New York delegation walked out of the
       <em>
        secret meetings
       </em>
       in Philadelphia
       <em>
        that had private security
       </em>
       .  Hamilton signed on their behalf, of course, and after
       <em>
        Marbury vs. Madison
       </em>
       , he has his federal central bank. Mission accomplished.

       Of course not. Too big now. Under the Articles you needed unanimous consent to amend the government. In the constitution, you only need 75% (...which means that the Articles were amended illegally, right?)
      </p>
      <p>
       So the Bill of Rights is staying. And it isn't going anywhere - including #2. It reads as follows:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,
        <strong>
         the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This says you have a
       <em>
        right to keep and bear arms
       </em>
       and the federal government can't change or interfere with that. Not that the government grants you these rights. You got 'em.

       No. The 2nd Amendment states that the People have a Right to keep and bear arms. This Right is not given by the US government, but by a Creator.

       Exactly MY point.  Govt and SCOTUS follow the public will, not the Constitution, when push comes to shove.  After 9/11, public screamed "do ANYTHING in the name of stopping terrorism !", and govt did.  Same will happen when public opinion has changed enough against guns.

        So what about your "This Right is not given by the US government, but by a Creator." ?  Contradiction.

       The document itself states that
       <em>
        the government may not unfringe upon this Right
       </em>
       . Ultimately, thrvadmit tobbeing outranked. Remember the dudes who wrote this. They were deists, or Christians, whatever, but they were certainly not athiests. I don't see it as a contradiction, but an important point to note re: Washington and the Right To Bear Arms. Even if I myself do not currently believe in a Creator. If anything, I maintain I allow myself this Right (to defend myself) by mere existence. I owe it to the countless millions of organisms that came before me on this Pale Blue Dot.

        Exactly MY point.  Govt and SCOTUS follow the public will, not the Constitution, when push comes to shove.  After 9/11, public screamed "do ANYTHING in the name of stopping terrorism !", and govt did.  Same will happen when public opinion has changed enough against guns.

       I see where we disconected. I thought you were arguing the People demanded it, forgetting that they can be manipulated. Mea culpa.

       There you go.  The rights in the Constitution come from "We the People", not some Creator.  The people limit what the govt can do.  The people can change the Constitution.  And in practice, the popular will has caused changes in interpretation, sometimes major changes.

I still meet many people today who have friends or relatives in NYC and still feel govt is right to do ANYTHING in the name of fighting terrorism.  Secret prisons, torture, drone strikes, whatever.

       Same will happen when public opinion has changed enough against guns.  Politicians and SCOTUS will see which way the wind is blowing, and will do what it takes to greatly restrict or ban guns.  Without having to change the Constitution.

       You miss my point.  If public opinion has changed far enough against guns, SCOTUS will find a way to rule a gun-ban as Constitutional.  For example, they will rediscover those words "a well regulated militia".

       There is book out there titled "liberty amendments" that goes over what needs to be done. We could try to organize to supercede the federal government. Odds are we would be crushed. The feds would declare everyone involved "constituents" aka domestic terrorists and start infiltrating, sabotaging, and arresting according to textbook oppression guidelines.

       I'll tell you how this would go. It would receive no media coverage initially and when it could no longer be ignored, the movement would be portrayed as tinfoil hat wearing crackpots. Organizers would be targeted by law enforcement and other authorities. Middle class citizens would be hesitant to join or fund the movement because now a single arrest can lead to financial devastation for them and their family.

       and I wrote a book on it. That's how certain I am :). We're only a few states away, and we need to guide the delegate process when it happens.

       Why can't the (US) govt be righted ?  We've had rich people and corps out of control before, and we changed laws to restrict them (a bit).  See 1880's to 1900's and the robber barons and trusts and Teddy Roosevelt.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the solutions for most of our problems, we just need to enact them:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Change SCOTUS or get Constitutional amendment to allow taxation and regulation of paid political speech (campaigns, lobbying, etc).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Change tax system to tax the rich more and change incentives (national progressive consumption/sales tax, and a wealth tax, instead of income tax).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Revenue-neutral carbon tax, and end subsidies to all forms of energy and agriculture.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cut military/intel/security budget to 1/3 of today's size.  Better for our budget and better for our behavior.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's a slow, frustrating struggle.  Not as exciting as calling for a revolution or a convention.  But a lot safer and more likely to produce good results.

       The rich have tirelessly spent the last 30 years systematically dismantling US democracy to allow oligarchy. Do you really think that they're going to allow the power to be restored to the people without a fight?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really think that you can effect real change by playing by the rules, start a PAC whose goal is to outbribe the wealthy. Buy enough legislators to pass a sweeping, loophole free, ban on all contributions to all legislators.

       You miss my point.  If public opinion has changed far enough against guns, SCOTUS will find a way to rule a gun-ban as Constitutional.  For example, they will rediscover those words "a well regulated militia".
