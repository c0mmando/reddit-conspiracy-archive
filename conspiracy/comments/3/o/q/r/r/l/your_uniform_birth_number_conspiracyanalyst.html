        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>this is not the same as your social security number. supposedly this started in the late 40&#39;s. it&#39;s possible there&#39;s a DNA database that we weren&#39;t aware of.</p>

<p>&quot;If you were not otherwise aware, there is another number assigned to each baby born in the U.S. under a separate  program that came about sometime in 1948 (not too long after the National Security Act was passed). It was known at the time as the “Uniform Birth Numbering System”. <em>It’s not a number you are openly informed about as a parent filling out a birth certificate</em> for your baby, a certificate you are told is just “for the record”.</p>

<p>In fact, the most in-depth information we could find on the Uniform Birth Numbering System came from an interesting source… the March 1951 edition of Eugenical News (Vol. 36, No. 1), <em>published by the American Eugenics Society</em>.</p>

<p>“The principal innovation introduced by the uniform numbering system is the fact that each certificate will have a unique number which cannot be duplicated until one hundred years have passed [note: the year 2051]. This makes the birth certificate number a potential identity number, a positive name, which may some day make it usable not only in birth record files but in all other file and record systems which keep track of persons, their rights or their documents.”</p>

<p>The Uniform Birth Number is made up of 11 digits in three groups, a lot like the social security number: 000 – 00 – 000000. Each state has its own three digit “birth number area code” which comprises the first number; the middle section is the last two digits of the year the person is born; and the last portion is “a simple serial number” we all receive when our birth certificate is issued in relation to the year and place we are born.</p>

<p>. . .  A 1952 issue of “The Rotarian” mentions briefly that the whole system actually went into full swing January 1, 1949.</p>

<p>from <em>The Rotarian</em> &quot;Where&#39;s Your Birth Certificate&quot; (the font is small)</p>

<p>But others have reported that <em>a federal DNA database is quietly being kept on all Americans born</em> (and has been for decades now) without their express permission, a system we get added to when our blood is taken at birth during the “routine” newborn screening examination hospitals give all newborn babies.</p>

<p>During this exam, the baby’s heel is pricked and the blood droplets are placed on a special card that is sent to a state government lab for testing. Parents are told this is being done to detect rare, life-threatening genetic disorders (if they are even explicitly told it is being done at all). The government authorizes millions of dollars to states for these screening programs (current legislation has authorized $20 million through 2019).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world doesn&#39;t work like a CSI episode. Today, funds are misallocated for unnecessary and freedom-sucking projects like this instead of being used for useful things like what you suggested. We can just take a look at the misappropriated funds that are buying our police forces MRAPs and military gear nowadays as an example. Our government and judicial system does not work in our best interests, unfortunately. Personally, I believe this project is highly plausible seeing as it surely couldn&#39;t be that difficult to hold everyone&#39;s DNA information like that, knowing the scale of projects like the NSA and how long that has been going on. Comparing the two, the NSA is more complicated than simply taking every baby&#39;s blood at birth and storing it. Would you or I do something like that? No...but then again, we aren&#39;t mad scientists/politicians/&quot;philanthropists&quot;/etc.</p>
