       Corporations can be liable for things like slander and defamation. I'm not saying it's likely, but a case could certainly be argued. Aside from whether it is currently illegal, as a nation we need to look at things from a "how should it be" lens, and not accept how things are when they are clearly wrong. A news giant intentionally censoring news is clearly wrong.

       Internet polls can be heavily and very easily brigaded.  4chan was able to skew an Internet poll so badly that it had to be canceled.  They managed to make the winning submission for a new Mt dew flavor "Hitler did nothing wrong" by a landslide if I remember correctly.

       Then we would be having a discussion about why they're lying on air.  Obviously I'm not sure why they did it.  It's certainly possible that it was because of an unfavorable outcome, but just because it's possible doesn't make it true or even probable.  There's just not enough information to draw a reasonable conclusion one way or another.

       Of course they are.  They're unverified completely anonymous polls.  One person with proper use of proxy servers could vote a million times given the opportunity.  Doesn't make it fake, just makes it easy to manipulate.  Their was a whole batch of commercials that pretty much said to take anything on the net with a grain of salt.  Remember the girl who was dating the French super model?

       Political polls are very heavily skewed to pump up the mass media favorite. Most political polls are conducted by phone (very low response rate), and have small sample sizes (300-2000 people). These polls can also have gender biases, age biases, income biases, race biases, and question biases which often aren't published in the news outlets. Even if the data on those biases is available, you usually have to dig 2-3 levels deep to find that data.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more apt to believe an Internet survey with tens of thousands of responses than I am a phone poll with 352 responses.

       Legitimate political pollsters typically weight data to match population demographics to correct for response bias, and they always publicize margin of error (typically ~+/-3% for national polls). I can say with absolute certainty that a phone survey
       <strong>
        that includes cell phones
       </strong>
       and polls among
       <strong>
        likely voters
       </strong>
       is MUCH more reliable than any Internet survey.
