<p>Corporations can be liable for things like slander and defamation. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s likely, but a case could certainly be argued. Aside from whether it is currently illegal, as a nation we need to look at things from a &quot;how should it be&quot; lens, and not accept how things are when they are clearly wrong. A news giant intentionally censoring news is clearly wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political polls are very heavily skewed to pump up the mass media favorite. Most political polls are conducted by phone (very low response rate), and have small sample sizes (300-2000 people). These polls can also have gender biases, age biases, income biases, race biases, and question biases which often aren&#39;t published in the news outlets. Even if the data on those biases is available, you usually have to dig 2-3 levels deep to find that data.</p>

<p>I&#39;m more apt to believe an Internet survey with tens of thousands of responses than I am a phone poll with 352 responses.</p>

<p>Legitimate political pollsters typically weight data to match population demographics to correct for response bias, and they always publicize margin of error (typically ~+/-3% for national polls). I can say with absolute certainty that a phone survey <strong>that includes cell phones</strong> and polls among <strong>likely voters</strong> is MUCH more reliable than any Internet survey.
