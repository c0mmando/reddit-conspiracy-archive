       A recent ‘leaked’ video of what appears to be a UFO coming out of the sea and apparently splitting in two is alleged to belong to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and has got truth seekers all over the world stating that this is the real deal and could not possibly be anything else. The VIDEO alleged to have been leaked from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shows a “UFO being tracked by thermal imaging camera” recently appeared online.The almost 4 minute long video is being taken seriously by UFO and alien researchers all over the world and was placed online by a group calling itself the Scientific Coalition for Ufology (SCU). According to the SCU website, its researchers confirm that the UFO “exhibits characteristics that cannot be explained by any known aircraft or natural phenomenon”. The video was apparently captured by the US ‘Department of Homeland Security’ (DHS) off one of their planes in the sky! This appears to be a very clear video of an unknown object moving in a way like nothing ever seen before!A US Customs and Border Protection Bombardier DHC-8Q200 – Apparently the type of plane that caught the UFO on cameraThe SCU have confirmed that the leaked footage has come from a DHS whistle-blower who does not wish to be named. Apparently since the video has been released by the SCU, quite a few other witnesses have come forward to confirm the sighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SCU apparently spent two years reviewing the footage and building up an in-depth report to confirm the videos authenticity. It has been confirmed that at least 6 scientists and researchers have been named against this project.This UFO incident allegedly started at about 9.20 pm on April 25 2013 at the Rafael Hernandez Airport in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico and was “monitored by the crew of a DHC-8 Turboprop aircraft from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – who are part of the US DHS.Please see the interesting video below:The object in the video appears to look like a metallic sphere, which moves fairly quickly over land and then into the ocean and seems to tumble or change shape, almost like the UFO is ‘morphing’ into something different.U.I.P.s friend and supporter of our project, Nick Pope (who formally investigated UFO sightings for the British Ministry of Defence) who sometimes gets a fair bit of criticism for sitting on the fence too often, gave quite a positive response to this footage, he said:“Assuming the video isn’t a clever hoax – which is always a possibility these days – it’s a fascinating piece of footage.”
      </p>
      <p>
       About the only conventional explanation that might fit the bill is that this is some new drone, but the entry and exit from the sea and the apparent splitting in two of the object makes even this explanation seem unlikely.This is exactly the sort of video that I and intelligence specialists at the MoD got most excited about, as the available data allows for a proper, scientific analysis.I’ll be watching developments on this one with interest.” Nick PopeThe UFO appears to fly with immense control between trees and tall buildings, with knee jerk reactions when racing towards any object in its way! It is hard to tell but the UFO is either joined by another UFO or breaks into two towards the end of the surreal footage.According to one report, the DHC-8 plane had taken off on just a general ‘routine’ flight when they had noticed this strange “pinkish to reddish light over the ocean approaching towards the south.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Straight away there was a concern on the plane as to why nobody at the tower had “informed them of any incoming traffic “so immediately radioed it in!A USC graphic showing the flight path of the object and craftIt appears that there was much confusion that day. Apparently the tower responded immediately with:“tower told them they also had a visual on the object, but they were unsure of its identity.”The SCU confirmed that an actual flight was delayed due to this UFO hurtling through the sky. It was confirmed that FedEx flight scheduled to leave at 9:10 pm was delayed until 9:26 pm.The SCU has also released details from a Freedom of Information (FOI) Act request response which purportedly shows the DHC-8 took off at 9.16 pm and circled the airport twice before leaving the area after 10 minutes.Please see below video details from the SCU:There were also further details released which confirmed that tower tracked on radar an “unknown object” minutes before the DHC-8 took off which was offshore to the north and north waist of the airport from 8.58pm to 9.14pm.The report stated that The object was between three to five feet in length and its speed varied between approximately 40 mph to 120 mph. Its median speed was roughly 80 mph.”
      </p>
      <p>
       But the really intriguing part about all this was that It said the object “apparently submerged into the ocean for over half a mile and flew back out.” Something which makes this object appear very ‘Alien’ to this world as there is no ‘known’ technology out there that is capable of this!?It was then stated that the “researchers ruled out a theory the object was a balloon as wind speeds of “eight to 13 mph” at ground level and 12 to 18 mph at 400 to 3,200 feet”, meaning the object “was moving too fast to be carried by wind currents,” plus it seemed to submerge in water. I am pretty sure I have never heard of a balloon act or behave in this manner before!? (return of the ‘weather balloon’ perhaps!?).It was also mentioned that this could have been a type of bird….but, a peregrine falcon’s top speed in stoop was 69 mph, which immediately ‘dismisses’ this idea!It had also been suggested that this could have been some kind of new Navy ‘drone’ called a ‘”flimmer” drone which can fly and dive under water, but has an air speed of 68mph! But immediately it was questioned WHY would such a test go ahead near a civilian airport?! Also the speed of the Flimmer is a lot slower than the top speed the UFO reached too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The interesting report concluded with:“There is NO explanation for an object capable of traveling under water at over 90 mph with minimal impact as it enters the water, through the air at 120 mph at low altitude through a residential area without navigational lights, and finally to be capable of splitting into two separate objects.“No bird, no balloon, no aircraft, and no known drones have that capability.”Could this ‘unknown object’ of been an Alien Scout type craft?U.I.P SUMMARY – IF this is all completely true and not a hoax story, which from doing our homework this does appear to be very real, this could in fact be one HUGE piece of evidence towards ‘Disclosure’It is not just the way that this UFO manoeuvres into the ocean at such an impressive speed it is the fact that the object appeared to be morphing into ‘different shapes’ whilst being followed on camera, and then eventually appears to break into TWO flying objects!We have heard many stories about unidentified SUBMERGED UFO’s which have been a subject of discussion for sometime in the Ufology arena, but could this possibly be ‘evidence’ off one, caught on camera by the US Government!

       I'm up voting this for the sheer fact that it contains no political agenda. Nothing about Russia, nothing about Israel and Palestine, or anything to do with world politics. While all that stuff is interesting to read against a conspiracy theme I feel like the more outlandish stuff gets buried to easily by political posts that basically say the same thing. Thank you for posting something different. This was a sight for sore eyes. Bravo.

       "The Russian thing" is a move from Putin to aid Assad in keeping his country his and allowing Russia to keep their biggest ally in the region a float. This move is described by Russian sources as a means to take serious action against Isis which claims American forces have not taken seriously against American claims that they have in fact been dealing with the threat. If you believe that the west is the root of all modern day problems then Russian actions seem to justify a need for change and are acting out against the evil empire that is the west.

       It all comes down to who you support or rather who you don't on the world stage that is causing people to choose sides. Its interesting, sure. I just feel its getting a bit out of hand with the propaganda pouring in from both sides.

       AFAICR Russia is fighting "terrorist groups" in Syria, which includes ISIS, Al Nusra, and as Assad decides who's the terrorist there: every other opposition group.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a sole reason why I support Assad: the JewSA would remove him way before they'd lift a finger against actual terrorists.

       People just feel that the Russians are a countrbalancing force to the US/Saudi/ISrael policy on the middleeast and the world more generally., and support them because they oppose the US's actions. You think that even the US, the richest country in the world, would spend money influencing a foreign language website not frquented or know to its citizens?

       Russia has "apparently" nearly crippled the Isis regime in a few days time. The U.S. has reasons not to support this but haven't been stated other than "only we can bomb the shit out of people".

       They have absolutely not nearly crippled ISIS what so ever and that's a fucking lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're doing fine but have not done much damage to ISIS at all, in fact ISIS was making gains as recently as last week because Russia is bombing other rebel groups and ISIS is taking advantage of it.

      <p>
       Iranian troops might fix this problem though.

       Not to downplay this but this isn't breaking, it's been around a while and people are generally unable to agree upon what it is, although most agree that it's a flying object that we are unable to identify.

       There were clearly no wings on the object and its average speed was 80 mph, maxing out at 120 mph. The fastest bird in the world is the Peregrine falcon and it maxes out at 242 mph. The next fastest birds that can fly over 120 are the Golden Eagle and Gyrfalcon. None of these birds dive into water, and none of these birds live near the coast. They live mostly in tropics, woods, and tundras. The Golden Eagle can skim the top of rivers for easy fish to catch but doesn't actually go under. Pelicans don't fly nearly as fast as the object was flying and birds just simply don't act that strange. Also, if it was a bird, then it would have slowed down much more drastically when it went underwater. It wasn't a bird.

       It's a controversial subject to be sure, but I'm continually surprised that people don't believe at this point. Then again some people believe that climate change is a liberal hoax, so maybe I'm putting too much faith in them.

       It gives me faith in humanity that they look at a bunch of hoaxers, scammers, and old men telling stories, and do not conclude that the aliens are here, man.

       Patently untrue. Most people reduce the level of recording quality to store more footage in the same amount of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now even assuming they have a decent camera and were recording at optimal fidelity, how many of them have the first idea how to operate a camera properly, video or otherwise? Have you seen the average cellphone camera video?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take that number of people and divide it by how many of them take the time to actually look into the sky, then take that number and divide it by their chance to be in the presence of an anomalous event in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason most of the compelling evidence comes from the Air Force; they're in the right places with expensive gear operated by people trained to use it.

       Probably because most people don't wander around with DSLR cameras sporting telephoto lenses or thermals.

       Wouldn't it seem more likely that the second one popped up out of the water - meeting up with the other one?  You can't really see it split in two.  Either way, its some pretty good footage.

       Many believe there is a alien civilization living underwater. I myself seen something flying in and out the ocean once. I was in Cape May NJ on the beach watching the sunset with my girlfriend. We both spotted 1 bright light about 5 miles into the ocean. At first we were both sure it was a flare because of the red and orange glow it was giving off and how it just floating up towards the sky. Then things got weird. The 1 single light turned off and then turned back on. At this point we still believed it to be a flare but then 3 more shot up to the sky. They stopped midair, flew back up and then back down to the water. One of them was going to the left and then to the right. At this point we knew flares couldn't do this. It only lasted about 4 minutes. Just enough for a small crowd to join around us and make us all scratch our heads trying to figure out what the hell it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I have family in PR and have visited. Lots of UFO activity over there and I have stories for days. Personal experience to stories from my grandma and uncles who lived there all their lives.

       I remember back in 2011 or 2012 there was this big circular cloud formation that was symmetrical, I even took a flick of it.. it all happened when a beam of light was filmed going into a volcanic mountain somewhere in mexico.. coincidence?

       To me it seems more like military technology. It's small looking. It's fast and from the looks of it, it has stealth as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably testing real life scenarios for the technology. Remember, the private sector gets the technology that is obsolete for military standards.

       But how do you explain the submerging into water and coming back out. Plus I've seen drones small and big, and none, so far, have that level of aerodynamic and stability in the air at that low altitude.  They seem to wobble or need stabilizers like a helicopter tail rotor. This seems to flow very smoothly through the air, almost like it does not need propulsion to move.  I've never seen anything like that before.

       Two possibilities:

      <ol>
       <li>
        It never actually goes into the water.  What looks like a craft going into the water is just an infrared-optical illusion -- similar to the way it appears to split in two.  It's a false image.  It's  meant to be a false image.
       </li>

       Maybe you missed the part where it goes just under the surface of the water and resurfaces repeatedly and with basically no change in speed? I was thinking basic small drone too until I saw the second half of the video.

       And yes, I do presume to know that 90 is slower than 120, in fact, I'm pretty sure it's a 25% change which is substantially more than "basically no change in speed".

       I don't disagree with you, but the engineer in me says that the rotors would turn horizontal to propel it through the water. The change of angle from vertical to horizontal blades would also explain the speeding up.

       Or, or... and bear with me here... I'm not willing to jump to the conclusion that aliens have come from outer space or under the sea when there are thousands upon thousands of more plausible explanations for this. It's a grainy, blurry, video shot from a moving vehicle of another moving vehicle where scale and distance are anyone's guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, no. I'm not willfully ignorant. I just require actual proof of things before I buy into them wholesale. Sorry!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Just watched the video again. I'm not convinced it actually goes underwater. At the 1:42 mark, you can see it "disappear" when it's clearly over land. I'd attribute this to the video quality, distance, etc. So no, I don't think it's aliens.

       The post. The original post talks about it being possibly being aliens. That's who said aliens.

      <p>
       UFO, colloquially, means "extraterrestrial phenomenon." The origin of the term stems from flying saucers and sightings of "alien" ships. So yeah, when you start talking about UFOs, people are going to assume you're talking about aliens.

       Where does the original post mention aliens? A UFO could be anything that's the whole point, it's unidentified. I would guess 50% of those interested in UFO's believe it's actually governments testing their new tech so I'm not really sure why you are so determined to make a connection to aliens.

       I want to sort of clarify something about people assuming UFOs are operated by aliens. The reason so many people automatically think aliens is because flying saucers have been sighted since the beginning of time. So these things definitely had to have at least
       <em>
        originally
       </em>
       been from outer space for obvious reasons. I don't know why people try
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       hard to deny that aliens have visited our planet. It's not that far-fetched. However, I'm not saying that the government doesn't have secret technology either. I think it's very possible that governments have reverse-engineered these crafts in secret. Again, UFOs have been sighted since the beginning of time, so aliens are the only the really plausible answer if you look at it
       <em>
        historically
       </em>
       . Just my contention anyway.

       The second link is a video of a drone.  Looks to be about 3 feet across.  it crosses roads several times and passes behind and in front of buildings, so the scale is easy to judge.

       That is certainly true.  But an object that is clearly human-made-drone size, traveling at human-made-drone speed, and filmed in the cosmic neighborhood known to be inhabited by humans, is probably going to end up being a human made drone...

       I feel like advanced aliens could just make shit that looks like the shit we have. Why observe a planet in a foreign vehicle that will arouse suspicion. Just make your spaceship look like a plane or a drone. Fuck even a bird if they're advanced enough. Or a bug. Imagine a bumblebee that was actually a small alien drone buzzing about recording shit.

       I've watched it 5 times now and I don't think there is evidence that it ever submerged. From the angle, distance and quality the video was taken I can see this flying low and going behind a swell where the angle of the video would make it look submerged because the water in debt is higher. Also I can easily see the quality being so bad that the object just blends in with the background due to loss/compression.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to change my ideas just please point me to a spot in the video where it is obvious that it is submerged.

       I also find it hard to tell if it did go underwater. It's looks like either it did go underwater (which is impressive) or it was compression / blending in with the background.

       Since when do many drones split in half in mid air? Well since we have no way of knowing if we do, this is the definition of a UFO. Unidentified flying object. It's a flying object that's not identified.

       I'm pretty sure we're seeing a false thermal image throughout the video.  In fact, I think the purpose of the video is to demonstrate this capability (military helicopters project false thermal images too).
      </p>
      <p>
       The times the drone disappears and the times there are double images are very likely due to the thermal image reflecting off the water.  So it never splits in half.  And it never goes underwater.  And in fact, when it's near the water it is never where it appears to be at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is almost certainly a military UAV.  Unidentified solely because military research is meant to be kept secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       To date, the only time I ever saw something I was absolutely certain was a UFO (in 1987) -- because it seemed like there was no way in hell something shaped like it could fly -- and it sounded like nothing I had ever heard -- well, I learned a few years later that what I had seen was an early
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_F-117_Nighthawk">
        stealth aircraft.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And the thing in the video?  You'll know precisely what it is within the next few years.

       Thank you for taking the time to just explain your thought process to me. I will look into what you have presented.  It has always made sense that regardless what the truth is about alien life, it's in the governments best interest to just let UFOS be UFOs, which provides an easy cover for military projects that aren't public knowledge yet.

       That was a genuine question I asked you yesterday. Either you don't know what you are doing, or you are trying to mislead people into thinking you are the author of the articles you don't even provide a link to. I'm sure you do have more link karma than me since I have hardly posted any topics in the two years I've been here, but the fact that you have any link karma at all tells me you
       <em>
        do

       I'm well aware of what you put at the end and it's not a source. That is the name of a random website, and you couldn't even be bothered to hotlink it. Even if you
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       hotlink it, a reader is still given the impression that you are the author right up until the very last few words. That is misleading. Self.posts are for things you your
       <strong>
        self

       wrote, not for copypasta. If you have an article to post then fucking post it.

       Let me re-iterate my first question: You don't know how reddit works, do you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Press the button that says Submit New Link. Compose a title. Copy/paste the
       <strong>
        link to the article
       </strong>
       into the box. Done.

       Sorry but I really don't see any type of hypothesizing over ancient reptilian new world order bullshit or claims that this is from a race of aliens from planet Zoidberg in the Moondingle galaxy.

       It's a video of a strange object. I don't understand your objection to this simply being posted.

       Sorry, but defiantly see a two birds flying next to each other. Its even has a flapping motion, as if with wings. The only alternative, would be a drone, but unlikely, because the diving in and out of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to give some credit, maybe an alien drone? 3-5 feet long wont provide much cabin space for anything alive that could operate it.

       So which is it, a drone or a bird, because drones don't flap.

       You should be sorry.  You "defiantly" see two birds flapping (at over 120 MPH, faster than any living bird on the planet) but it could also be a drone.

       How about we label it what it is, a UFO.

       Where does the original post mention aliens? A UFO could be anything that's the whole point, it's unidentified. I would guess 50% of those interested in UFO's believe it's actually governments testing their new tech so I'm not really sure why you are so determined to make a connection to aliens.

       Not to mention it was a government helicopter, meaning that the pilots were experienced and would have recognized a bird in most situations.

       And those top speeds are for diving only.  The fastest flying bird in flapping flight would be the White-throated needletail, clocked at 69MPH.
