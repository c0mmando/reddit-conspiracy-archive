       On September 11, 2001, the three worst structural failures in modern history took place when World Trade Center Buildings 1, 2, and 7 suffered complete and rapid destruction.
In the aftermath of the tragedy, most members of the architecture and engineering community, as well as the general public, assumed that the buildings’ destruction had occurred as a result of the airplane impacts and fires. This view was reinforced by subsequent federal investigations, culminating in FEMA’s 2002 Building Performance Study and in the 2005 and 2008 reports by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
Since 9/11, however, independent researchers around the world have assembled a large body of evidence that overwhelmingly refutes the notion that airplane impacts and fires caused the destruction of the Twin Towers and WTC 7. This body of evidence, most of which FEMA and NIST omitted from their reports, instead supports the troubling conclusion that all three skyscrapers were destroyed in a process known as “controlled demolition,” where explosives and/or other devices are used to bring down a building.
      </p>
      <p>
       KEY EVIDENCE
      </p>
      <p>
       Rapid onset of destruction,
      </p>
      <p>
       Constant acceleration at or near free-fall through what should have been the path of greatest resistance,
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous eyewitness accounts of explosions including 118 FDNY personnel,
      </p>
      <p>
       Lateral ejection of multi-ton steel framing members distances of 600 feet at more than 60 mph,
      </p>
      <p>
       Mid-air pulverization of 90,000 tons of concrete, and large volumes of expanding pyroclastic-like dust clouds,
      </p>
      <p>
       Isolated explosive ejections 20 to 60 stories below the “crush zone,”
      </p>
      <p>
       Total destruction and dismemberment of all three buildings, with 220 floors each an acre in size missing from the Twin Towers’ debris pile,
      </p>
      <p>
       Several tons of molten steel/iron found in the debris piles,
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of thermite incendiaries on steel beams,
      </p>
      <p>
       Nanothermite composites and iron microspheres found in WTC dust samples.

       I encourage everyone to pay 2 dollars or whatever for their PDF "Beyond Misunderstanding".  It is
       <em>
        well worth it
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So much so I ordered 20 hardcopies to try to convince people with.  It really is very good.  It's good research that was peer reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think is funny is the backlash.  People say, 'not peer reviewed'.  They have at least 7 professor emeriti, PhD chemists, PhD engineers, etc.  These people really are refusing to accept science that is peer reviewed.  They say, 'well those people are all convinced 911 was a lie, so they are all part of the same peer group'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is funny, because that's like saying the PhDs of chemistry at BYU for example are all mormons so they don't count and therefore any new grad student defending their thesis is invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, these people are actually
       <em>
        much more diverse
       </em>
       given they are all from different schools, backgrounds, etc.  and the core of their belief is necessarily that the science will speak for itself, and corrollary to that is that science is agnostic to politics.

       “EVIDENCE AGAINST A NUKE THEORY
The hard physical evidence presented is strongly against the hypothesis that mini-nukes destroyed the WTC Towers:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Observation of tritium (an important component of hydrogen-bomb fuel) at WTC sites at the few nano-curie level only. This is strong evidence against the mini-nuke hypothesis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The fact that radioactive iodine concentrations were actually lower in the upper/WTC debris-filled layers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Radioactive hot-spots in NYC were found to be due to radium, which is traceable to industrial uses (not bombs). This in itself does not rule out mini-nukes, but these data certainly do not support the mini-nuke hypothesis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lioy et al. report that radioactivity from thorium, uranium, actinium series and other radionuclides is at or near the background level for WTC dust.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nuclear activation or residual “fall-out” radioactivity (above background) was NOT observed, in tests performed by the author on actual WTC samples. This result is consistent with the low Iodine-131 measured by independent researchers (point 2 above) and the low radionuclide counts (point 4 above) and again provides compelling
evidence against the mini-nuke-at-Towers hypothesis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No fatalities due to radiation “burning” were reported near ground zero. William Rodriguez survived the North Tower collapse.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No observed melting of glass due to the collapse-process of the Towers.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         One more: The mini-nuke idea fails completely for WTC 7 where vertically-directed plumes of dust were absent during the collapse, and the building fell quite neatly onto its own footprint. (Molten metal was observed under the WTC7 rubble as well.)”
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       The nuke theory is attractive for one reason only:
      </p>
      <p>
       the incredible amoung of 'missing Joules' that were an unmet requirement for converting that amount of steel structure into liquid metal pools and orange-hot twisted debris that remained highly radiant for 3 months after 9/11 while hundreds of millions of gallons of water were poured on them constantly during that interim, with temps that melted worker's shoes and were reported to be over 2000F in some places--which is literally impossible due to physics / chemistry limitations within the context of the offcial story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the more reasonable explanation is thermite.  Because they found: thermite.  And verified there was uncombusted: thermite.
      </p>
      <p>
       People keep eyerolling.  Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you found thermite, then there was fucking thermite, man.  It didn't spontanesouly form, as if thermite insects laid thermite eggs into the dust for us to find later and confound us.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       There's this sayiing we say in ancient russia.  If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, lays eggs like a duck, cooks up like a duck, then you should be happy, becuase you're fucking eating duck and 9/11 was an inside job.
