        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Full Disclosure:  I&#39;ve been a lurker here on and off for a few months, mostly because I&#39;m fascinated by conspiracy theories (I have my own personal favorites, but I don&#39;t really &quot;believe&quot; them, I just kinda accept them as a possible explanation for what&#39;s going on, just as likely as any other possibility, but that&#39;s neither here nor there.)</p>

<p>So I&#39;ve seen it posted a couple times in comments here that &quot;people don&#39;t know how deep the rabbit hole goes&quot;, or &quot;people don&#39;t want to know how deep the rabbit hole goes&quot;.  Well, where DOES it go?  What are your theories?  Who or what is at the bottom of the rabbit hole?  What are they trying to achieve?  How do you think it will all play out?  Is it possible they can be stopped (assuming you&#39;re not on their side and want them to be stopped)?</p>

<p>Why does there only have to be one rabbit hole?  Can there be multiple rabbit holes?  (serious question, I&#39;m not trying to mock anyone).</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the only goal there is is for the richest and wealthiest to do and have whatever the fuck they want (including illegal and dastardly things like pedophilia and murder) without ever having to physically work for it. </p>

<p>for that you need a labor force (citizens) to make your food, technology and comforts. </p>

<p>we know they ARE doing that already, and we&#39;re just trying to figure out how so we can wake people up and break out of the chains. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there really is an endgame. there are one of 2 encompassing possibilities </p>

<ol>
<li><p>God is not real: perpetual slavery for all who aren&#39;t wealthy, plain and simple. Bible is just another control method, including the prophecies </p></li>
<li><p>God is real: government is controlled by Satan/worshippers trying to turn as many people from God as possible. </p></li>

<p>Am I right then in assuming no-one seriously believes in anything as baroque as the Illuminanti or as out there as Venusian reptoids...  oh well.  I was hoping.  I mean we barely even have the Masons to kick around anymore...</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing tho.  I&#39;m assuming there isn&#39;t one unified conspiracy then; many of these families/factions/syndicates/agencies won&#39;t necessarily be working together and may at times be working as cross purposes.  </p>

<p>If there&#39;s no-one &quot;in charge&quot; is it really a conspiracy, or is it just how humans deal with power/politics at the scale that we are operating at now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say there are several rabbit holes, but digged mostly by the same persons. Personally I just focus on the geopolitical / historical content. That means it does not matter to me in the first place if David Cameron has fucked a dead pig in a secret society (which he did) but that he has conspired to bomb several countries. </p>

<p>In this regard I find the book &quot;None Dare Call It Conspiracy&quot; by Gerry Allen very helpful for newcomers. You can also find reading and lectures about it on the web.
This book starts with the FED systems and covers a lot of topics about all major player and their motivations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read theories along these lines.  I&#39;ve not seen it explained exactly what they plan to do once that point is reached.  I&#39;m also not sure how it would benefit anyone, since a population drop like that would probably collapse the current banking system that they depend on to prop them up.  They would risk being destroyed in the chaos along with everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it can be stopped. I do not know exactly who is at the bottom of it/them/how ever many offshoots there are. But I think those who control the world banks are for sure on the list. Also top guys in pharmaceuticals and all big big, global industry. Probably if you looked at exactly who was profiting from TTP that would give a ball park too. And the CIA. </p>

<p>I think they got global illegal drugs and arms too. </p>

<p>And the dissemination of false information. Nasa and all outer space travel and beyondouratmospheresatellites is all a lie. No - but what about - just a lie. Very possibly our world is not even a spinning ball. trade routs follow a flat earth model. A lot of reasons o consider a flat earth model. And even more reasons to question globe model - consider if you stand still at equator you are traveling (spinning) over 1000 miles an hour. If you stand still near the north pole you are spinning  say  5 - a few - miles an hour. If you take a plane from say Alaska South to Central America - you should be accelerating (in addition to your travel/ acceleration of the plane. etc) roughly by 800 miles an hour, the body can not survive this rate of rapid acceleration.  If the earth were really a spinning globe - traveling any significant distance from north to south should be  deeply sickening if not deadly. </p>

<p>And - yes - I think the people at the bottom of the rabbit hole know the globe model is a joke/ trick. the UN map is literally a flat earth illustration. </p>

<p>anyway -- I also think there are tons of other psyops going on. And I think a lot of people on TV are literally under hypnosis to help sell them. I think the media sells packaged stories w/ staged shootings weekly these days. And it means there is an effort to do something in this country after that propaganda has reached its intended effect, And/But they have been selling fake stories for a long time in other ways as well. </p>

<p>I think the sphinx may have been a hoax built by Napoleons army to give fake history and steer attention away from the fact that Europe just lots America - and as the beginning of the plan to get America back. (exactly how one leads to the other - I&#39;m not sure - but I think that&#39;s when this big global pattern of &quot;look over here and misunderstand what you are looking at&quot; started.)</p>

<p>And then you have all the unmotivated but highly profitable wars - by far the biggest crime of all here and all connected to them and their profiteering. </p>

<p>The reason I think it all can be stopped is because for a total win they have to show their cards, being wolfs in sheep clothing is one of their big weapons. Once they show their true colors/fur that&#39;s when the great populous will fight back, I hope.
