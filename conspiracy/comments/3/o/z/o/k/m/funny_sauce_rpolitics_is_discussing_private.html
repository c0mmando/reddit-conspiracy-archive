    <div class="md"><p>I totally get you; it&#39;s a natural reaction to feel slighted when your viewpoint is reduced to being one of &quot;crackpots&quot; or &quot;weirdos.&quot; We just have to remember that the majority of people have been conditioned to scoff at you; that your thoughts being met with resistance is exactly what a controlling class would want. And that we won&#39;t get anywhere by continuing the divisiveness that prevents people from looking deeper into things. </p>

<p>The only reason I woke up to a lot of shady goings-on in this country is because by older brother was really patient with explaining what he thought and how I could find out more; rather than being as big of a dick to me as I was to him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s absolutely hilarious coming from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>On top of this, private prisons have been discussed in many circles for many years and almost everyone is against them.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of my time debating people on reddit from various subs, and by far the most &quot;intellectually&quot; devoid ones have all been from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>The absolute lack of critical thinking ability you&#39;ll find on this sub is insane.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> because of the echo chamber bullshit but holy shit when I read this on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> I nearly spit my drink out.</p>

<p>And I actually did spit my drink out when I read your submitted history. </p>

<p>I&#39;m avoid ever throwing out &quot;intellectually devoid&quot; again unless you delete your post history because it&#39;s fucking hilarious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because not voting is how you end up with the GOP in control and they&#39;re absolutely awful in every way possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re naive to still believe there&#39;s a difference. That these political sides really represent any different belief than just being targeted marketing campaigns for different groups of citizens/sub-cultures.
Like music marketing only with more serious consequences.</p>

<p>For the people who control both parties they have no personal belief than what&#39;s good for their own personal career/bank account. They are opportunists which delude/confuse/scam the population for their masters.</p>

<p>The few people which get voted into congress/senate which actually have a real political agenda not just for a certain tribe&#39;s outcome but an &quot;altruistic&quot; goal for all citizens will get marginalized sooner or later.</p>

<p>So in essence psychopaths run your political system and who you vote for is completely meaningless only because one side is managing your ego more convincingly.</p>

<p>About your left/right good/evil/rational/irrational delusion. As if there&#39;s a &quot;moral&quot; difference between the disgusting Iraq/Afghanistan wars or what happens afterwards in North Africa, Syria, Ukraine and where not.</p>

<p>Red/Blue both kill people with no restrain for no moral reason what so ever. They do it because they can. They do it because they want to project an image to the world. They do it because it&#39;s good for their and their master&#39;s accounts. They do it because it gives them political brownie points to be seen doing something.</p>

<p>They do it because..they..are..scum. They are the Mafia with the slight difference that the traditional Mafia has/had a moral codex, how twisted and wicked it might be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the &quot;look both sides are the same!&quot; fallacy which is popular with conservatives interested in suppressing voter turn out.</p>

<p>Climate change is easily the biggest threat to mankind and the right denies it and refuses to do anything about it.</p>

<p>The right denies evolution.</p>

<p>The right is anti science/education.</p>

<p>The right is warlike and will provoke/start wars at will with anyone they don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>See Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p>The left is many times more rational and many times better than the right on literally every single issue facing us as a country.</p>

<p>You&#39;re free to not vote if you want, but you&#39;re the reason the system is shit.</p>

<p>George Carlin not voting isn&#39;t relevant, he&#39;s loved by most idiots on the internet but what they fail to realize is he wasn&#39;t infallible and most of his acts were just bullshit.</p>

<p>He was smart enough to know the importance of voting, even if he acted like he didn&#39;t on stage.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d rather stick your head in the sand and wait for everything to go to shit be my guest.</p>

<p>But people like you are the lowest of the low.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure your tone would change real quick when the GOP is in control and they start slashing welfare/social benefits in order to cut taxes on big companies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;d change real quick when they try to destroy our already shitty healthcare system and we&#39;re the laughing stock of the world.</p>

<p>When they start slashing education making us fall behind the rest of the world in innovation.</p>

<p>When crime rates start to sky rocket because of all the poor people starving to death that have to turn to crime to survive.</p>

<p>Yeah, you keep that head in the sand at the expense of the country because you&#39;re an edge lord.</p>

<p>The right is warlike and will provoke/start wars at will with anyone they don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>The right/left paradigm is bullshit. Obama (&quot;left) has invaded more countries than his predecessor (&quot;right&quot;). </p>

<p>The fact is, Bush and Obama both belong to the War Party. They&#39;re just two different factions of the same party.</p>

<p>One of the dangers of participating in a corrupt and immoral system is that one&#39;s thinking also becomes corrupt. Example: thinking there&#39;s any difference between Bush and Obama.</p>

<p>Are you saying that because people choose not to vote we are in this mess today? The system is rigged to nominate who they want in office and we&#39;ve seen this in the past. </p>

<p>When you think about it who is crazy enough to want to be president of something yet alone president of a dominating world power. You have to be completely insane to want to do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so fucking sad. When I try to discuss things like that with friends, they look at me as if I have nothing better to do with my life than to rant about politics. I&#39;m like &quot;hello those are fucking people in there that should be free but are having their free will stripped from them by the government because a judge was paid off to say &#39;guilty.&#39; What the fuck better thing do YOU have to do than to take action against people that are abusing the system in a way that affects peoples&#39; lives so substantially?&quot; I understand that people have jobs and families to take care of, but if you don&#39;t follow what is happening politically, decisions that other people make about how the world gets run WILL affect you. At that point, you won&#39;t have any say because it will be too late. TPP for instance. We have the technology to be able to organize the largest mass movement against anything in history. Is anyone doing anything besides talking about how shitty it is? Even then, the portion of us who are having that discussion is too small compared to the total population of the US. It won&#39;t be until the effects of the deal have put Americans out of work en masse that they decide it&#39;s time to do anything about it. Whether Sanders is genuine or controlled opposition, I respect him for bringing up the discussion on national television. I feel as though that gives me more confidence in him. Hillary paints herself to be a progressive, but is for-profit prisons a discussion she would ever willingly bring up? The most she does is gay marriage and, during the debate, I heard her mention about taxing the upper class more. Bernie mentions a lot more of the significant issues, like corruption in campaign finance policy. He understands well what is truly happening and is one of the few people who is willingly to stand up for himself instead of play ball. Hillary just loves to play the game.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy isn&#39;t special. It does not serve the interests of these discussions to hold them in private, away from the general population. It <strong>only serves to strengthen the conversation</strong> when more people get involved with these topics.</p>

<p>Shame on you for attempting to subvert what should be considered a victory for awareness of the injustices. You are only doing this conversation, and this sub, a disservice by talking like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not like this sub is a movement, it&#39;s more a place for individuals who share some beliefs.</p>

<p>This people over at r/politics follow the medias route and have some belief in the cult of authority, even when they debate these points. Not saying they don&#39;t know shit, but they have a long way to go down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>So while what you say is true - it only gets better the more people get near the truth - Nobody is going to convince me that intellectually someone that believe this or that candidate may develope a good leadership knows much at all, and i can&#39;t respect his opinion ( i can respect the person, but not the opinion. Much like with religious fans )</p>

<p>And when there is a big, huge movement on the net to expose these things that mostly get ridiculed ( well i also ridicule some ideas in my mind but i keep shut about it, flat earth anyone.. this kind of ) and people are helping their own demise, some amusement has to be farmed from the situation to make life good.</p>

<p>I mean, if there is nothing good about it, atleast let it amuse me. It&#39;s not stroking an e-penis, it&#39;s more like a survival mechanism.</p>

<p>Also it&#39;s impossible to become a movement on any open forum i think. Infiltration follows quick, this sub may give some hints.</p>
