<p>There are consequences of revolution.  For the US, a revolution with would take the US of the stage as being the sole global super power.  That void will be filled by China or Russia.  Other countries that do not like the US may see a revolution in the US as the perfect time to declare war and invade.   If the government is successfully over thrown , chances are high that a dictator and/or much worse government would come to power.  international use of USD would most likely end.</p>

<p>Basically a revolution would over be very bad for the people of the US and thing woulds most likely be much worse after and would take decades to fix the damage done during the revolution. </p>

<p>That is why there has not been one.  There will not be one until things are 1000 times worse then they are now.  </p>

<p>Not really.  The US has always operated in the same way.  The people elect officials to take action/represent  the people.  We do not and have never had a direct democracy.</p>

<p>The main problem today is that so few vote and so few   people donate to campaigns. Also so few people try to reach out and contact their representatives. The politicians are only going to represent those that participate in the system.  Right now we have big business as the main financiers and main group of people trying to get a word in with those in government, this is why so many politicians are representing them over the people.    The system is not broke it is that the people are not doing their duty to their country and getting involved in the election and political Processes.  </p>
