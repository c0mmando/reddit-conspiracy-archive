       Why hasn't it happened? We're lied to constantly, yet us Americans don't change, we just don't get it. Time and time again we get leaks of these agendas that they want to force feed us with and we take it like infants. No one is motivated, so many inconsistencies in the media yet all we do is make a video or comment (pretty ironic considering thats exactly what I'm doing.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If we could all just band together against the government and change this, make it right, but we need to change quickly, we need to make a better world for our children, for us.

       17 year old here too, I consider us the "internet generation" because we grew up side by side with the infancy of the internet. Unlimited information available at our finger tips yet so many of us don't use it to its full advantage. I know our generation will definitely have an impact on the future of the of humanity without a doubt, once we're a bit older and can organize certain events; we can definitely change the outcome of whatever all of this is leading up to.

       I just hope that we aren't too late. The older 'awake' generation isn't going to do anything. It's up to us, but the amount of young 'awake' people is sadly low as hell. All this Tech yet we don't turn it into weapons. Our government has! Why haven't all the rest of us done it?

       It's the "band together" part that is the problem.  We can't even get most of us to vote.  The system seems to have been designed to have us not band together.  Unless it is around some meaningless issue du jour every four years at election time.

       There are consequences of revolution.  For the US, a revolution with would take the US of the stage as being the sole global super power.  That void will be filled by China or Russia.  Other countries that do not like the US may see a revolution in the US as the perfect time to declare war and invade.   If the government is successfully over thrown , chances are high that a dictator and/or much worse government would come to power.  international use of USD would most likely end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically a revolution would over be very bad for the people of the US and thing woulds most likely be much worse after and would take decades to fix the damage done during the revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why there has not been one.  There will not be one until things are 1000 times worse then they are now.

       Changes to government will always be slow and the attempts to make changes must be made at the right time.  The right time can be figured out by what the political climate looks like, who is in office, what resent events have taken place and what issues are the top topics of the time.

       Not really.  The US has always operated in the same way.  The people elect officials to take action/represent  the people.  We do not and have never had a direct democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main problem today is that so few vote and so few   people donate to campaigns. Also so few people try to reach out and contact their representatives. The politicians are only going to represent those that participate in the system.  Right now we have big business as the main financiers and main group of people trying to get a word in with those in government, this is why so many politicians are representing them over the people.    The system is not broke it is that the people are not doing their duty to their country and getting involved in the election and political Processes.
