        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi,</p>

<p>My first attempt at a debate regarding the moon landings devolved very quickly when my opponent simply refused to debate.</p>

<p>As such, I thought I would give it a go.</p>

<p>I am looking for a moon-hoax advocate that would like to take part in a sensible and organised debate on the matter. I sit on the side of &quot;moon landings are real&quot;, and I&#39;m looking for someone to argue against that fact.</p>

<p>I look forward to debating.</p>

<p>Kind regards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the more interesting conversation about the moon is why it&#39;s there (<a href="http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question38.html">nasa still don&#39;t know</a>) and why are there ancient civilizations that reference the arrival of the moon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Giordano Bruno (a 16th century Italian philosopher) is reputed to have written in De Immenso: (Bk IV, x, pp. 56-57):  “There are those who have believed that there was a certain time (as our Mythologian says) when the moon, which was believed to be younger than the sun, was not yet created.  The Arcadians, who dwelt not far from the Po, are believed to have been in existence before it (the moon).”  “Theodorus writes in his first book that the moon had appeared a little while before the war which was fought by Hercules against the giants.  Aristochius and Dionysius Chalcidensis, in the first of their works, confirm the same.”  “Mnaseas said that the Arcadians were born before the moon, and so they were called ‘proselenian’; meaning, ‘before the moon’.” [1]  </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.halexandria.org/dward200.htm">http://www.halexandria.org/dward200.htm</a></p>

<p>Iterestingly the Wikipedia page for Giordano Bruno has no mention of him stating these things although there is plenty about his martyrdom for science</p>

<p>The moon landing debate is an irrelevant distraction in comparison</p>

It is likely we were stumped with overcoming a complication in manned spaceflight past a certain difference; so we embelished to trick the USSR and made high budget films to act as evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have time for a full debate but I think there are a few points that are not debatable and tells me that it was fake. There are no rational counterpoints to the following, although I&#39;m willing to review your eventual debate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>lack of testing; first testing of Apollo  beyond low earth orbit was with live humans. That means first attempts for re-entry at escape velocity was with live humans. That is irrational.</p></li>
<li><p>no flights beyond low earth orbit before or  since Apollo (by nasa or any other nation). Cost is not a rational answer because the tech has supposedly already been developed. And if it was possible with 1960s tech, then advances in technology since (e.g.: materials sciences, etc) should have make the mission past Leo easier.</p></li>
<li><p>timeline - 1961 nasa barely makes sub orbit and 9 years later they allegedly walk on the moon. However zero progress on manned flight since. Bullshit if you ask me.</p></li>
<li><p>loss of telemetry data, LEM blueprints, original video footage and 700 cartons of other evidence by NASA. Losing a little data is incompetence - but the scale of information loss here is more likely a cover up.</p></li>
<li><p>lack of radiation shielding (NASA now claims the Orion needs radiation shielding to get past van Allen belts).</p></li>
<li><p>lack of testing for lunar landing and takeoff they had a few tests on earth where an unsimilar mockup went up only a few feet (most of these crashed anyway). Nothing compared to the 4000mph descent and 69mile ascent allegedly performed without any symmetrically testing. Don&#39;t say math - people don&#39;t bet their lives on math. Also battery tech was in the dark ages in the 60s (they basically used car batteries) - no way they had enough energy to maintain envrionment amongst extreme lunar conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>abandonment of Saturn - a highly desirable single chamber weight saving design. No other nation could do it because single chamber design is unstable as far as combustion. NASA has since abandoned single chamber design and now uses the much heavier Russian multi chamber design for heavy lift atlas 5. Not just Russian design but actual Russian rd-180 engines.</p></li>
<li><p>multiple flaws with pictures and videos that others have documented - but my favorite is clear delineation between background and foreground which is evidence of projection screen. Also movements of astronauts appear to be supported by wires - see multiple videos on <a href="/r/moonhoax">/r/moonhoax</a>.  Also all the pictures were perfectly framed and composed in spite of the fact that the astronauts had no viewfinder and were clicking pictures blindly.</p></li>
<li><p>astronauts deny seeing stars but much later claims to have seen stars (which would be expected in an atmosphere less environment). Also astronauts retire shortly after mission and after initial press have generally kept a low profile (except buzz - and he has had an interesting history since).</p></li>
<li><p>a couple of rebuttals on your 1st debAte. Lunar rock has been documented to be available on earth. Studies of the rock assume chain of custody from Apollo but do not prove it (not to mention moon rock given to Dutch has been proved to be petrified wood and most of the moon rock can no longer be located now per collect space.com). Pictures from Lro and Selene could have been photoshopped and cannot be used for definitive proof.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There are no rational counter points to the above.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous because if there was a cover up, then how does OP suppose there were &quot;detailed and sourced evidence&quot; that was documented?</p>

<p>And the moon debate has been argued to death and it&#39;s fucking pointless because the people arguing either for it or against it don&#39;t know one way or another if the US landed on the moon or not.</p>

<p>There are lots that don&#39;t and it is a subject that I am passion about. I enjoy to argue with moan-hoax proponents. It isn&#39;t to feel better about myself (my life is already great), but I just hope to spread some knowledge and understanding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand the word fair and it&#39;s obviously something that you can&#39;t comprehend because nothing in life is 100% fair, <strong>nothing.</strong>  It&#39;s all compromises.

<p>And again, I&#39;m asking you, what can you possibly add to the argument that hasn&#39;t been argued before?</p>

<p>Quit fooling yourself.  All you want to do is argue about a subject that has been beaten to death already and the only reason you want to do it is because you know that there isn&#39;t much <strong>documented</strong> evidence contrary to the narrative and that&#39;s the main crux of your argument and the <strong>only</strong> reason you&#39;re doing this is to make yourself feel better by trying to ridicule someone else and not under the guise to &quot;spread some knowledge and understanding&quot; because there were others wayyyyy before you doing the same bullshit.</p>

I&#39;m pointing out that you cannot deny the moon landings without denying the existance or authenticity of the evidence which has been independantly verified.

<p>What I mean is that any claim should be substantiatiated. You couldn&#39;t, for example, say &quot;that moon rocks are made from concrete&quot; without using some kind of evidence or analysis to prove that.</p>

<p>I know the main arguments against the lunar material and I have done some reasonable research that proves beyond doubt, in my mind, that the samples came from the moon during the apollo missions, not found in antartica or whatever other ideas people band around.

<p>Well, good for you.  But one things for certain and that&#39;s, just like me, you don&#39;t know <em>for sure</em> if man went to the moon or not.  All you&#39;re doing is believing it and arguing for it.  And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that but no matter what you say, you&#39;re not going to change anybody&#39;s mind.</p>
