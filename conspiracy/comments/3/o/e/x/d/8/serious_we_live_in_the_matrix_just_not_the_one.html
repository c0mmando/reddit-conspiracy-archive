        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I guess this is my conspiracy edition of Shower Thoughts. </p>

<p>Our world IS &quot;The Matrix&quot;. Instead of machines, it was created and is controlled by members of our own species. </p>

<p>In the movie, humans are hooked in with a physical connection that projects an artificial reality directly into the brain, and our BTU&#39;s are then used to power machines. </p>

<p>We got an even worse fate if thats even fathomable. </p>

<p>Instead of a direct single input, we are wirelessly sent and projected a fake reality from every source of sensory input that can be manipulated to achieve the same end goal as the machines did in the movie. Create a prison, that doesn&#39;t look like a prison. At least in the movie, the machines had some fucking decency to make the fake world somewhat enjoyable and desirable to want to STAY in that state and not even attempt to learn the truth. </p>

<p>Instead of harvesting our BTU/body heat for their own gain, our Matrix controllers sacrifice the entire heart, soul, and essence of what it means to be a human being and have harmony with nature/the universe, all to gain more $. (Would truly intelligent people even value $ above all else? I think not). </p>

<p>In the movie, when the characters wake up to &quot;reality&quot;, sure it was cold, ugly, and definitely not conventionally &quot;appealing&quot; to the average humans idea of a better alternative. But in the end once you pull the plug on the back of your head, what you saw was reality completely unfiltered and in its true form. How to navigate or live in it, that&#39;s another story. But at least you have what was REAL to start with as a base. </p>

<p>In our Matrix, none of us can pull a single plug and all of a sudden see the world for what it is. The never ending amount of inputs that are entered into our senses make it infinitely more complicated. And often, you can&#39;t even be certain the plugs your pulling out are the right ones, or even important at all in the mess of 1000 other plugs that are all simultaneously streaming and skewing reality. </p>

<p>We have to stop arguing on this sub about stupid ass shit and semantics about events and subjects we can come to a general consensus on to begin with. We don&#39;t have to know WHO exactly shot Kennedy to know it was a high level conspiracy by our own government and its agencies, and other players who had a stake in the law remaining the same and not some good guy coming in and trying to fix it. We can prove that. If you have any talent at reading people, just watching lee Harvey Oswald plead innocence to the media, and his genuine shocked reaction to being told he was being charged for the assasination by a reporter to only be killed shortly afterwards could be enough for some. That&#39;s if you are looking at it objectively and not with the implanted idea that it is this horrible monster that murdered our beloved president. What sense does it make to be alone gunman and do it for your own personal gain yet not take any credit whatsoever. Guess you would have to be truly insane? Everything I&#39;ve ever read about that man did not strike me as an insane individual. The endless declassified CIA documents proving he worked for the CIA up until the day they set him up proves its not the official narrative. Just because we can&#39;t give a second by second play by play of every wrong thing the elite and powerful have ever done, doesn&#39;t mean that what known factual evidence we do have cannot be self evident to prove our accepted reality is not right. We don&#39;t NEED to prove who the exact members of the 9/11 plot was to stand up and say, who cares the exact names at the end of the day we know it was our government, other governments, the military industrial complex, and a ton of other loose random players. WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IS THE SITUATION IS FUCKED AND HOW WAS THIS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN TO BEGIN WITH. </p>

<p>The earth is dying. The oceans and everything in it are dying. We lose a unique species that took millions of years to evolve every single day that goes by. Think about that. It&#39;s science. Every action has a reaction. You can&#39;t put endless amounts of carbon into an atmosphere that took an eternity to get the correct balance to be what our biology requires and expect he chemistry and makeup of it to remain unaltered forever. If you think that&#39;s possible then I do not mean to be rude but there&#39;s nothing I can say to you because you&#39;re not operating in a world of facts. You can&#39;t dump plastic and garbage endlessly into an ocean that has very specific needs, PH, temperatures, etc., for the whole cycle of life to work in sync and harmony as it exists today. Fukushima all these years later is still dumping one of the nastiest things mankind ever created, man-made radiation, into the oceans....every...single...day...still. Unchecked. Unmeasured. Not talked about. Altering and changing the DNA of every biological being on earth forever. Silently. Oh you didn&#39;t know Fukushima had 3 nuclear meltdowns out of the 8 or so reactors? Ya that&#39;s cause the media was onto the next story by time that was confirmed and reported. It dumps an exponentially higher amount into the ocean on a daily basis than all nuclear detonations in history. </p>

<p>So does it matter EXACTLY WHO did what at the end of the day on every fact of every subject. Of course not guys. What matters is we live and operate in a system that allows a conspiracy of these levels to be pulled off often and with relative ease. It&#39;s the same system that is allowing and helping to destroy our world. What matters is that our society does not operate for the better of itself as a whole. Why do we not seem to observe any other of the millions of species on earth do things to directly sabotage their existence and drive them self into extinction all for the gain of a few? Common sense guys. </p>

<p>What matters is we continue to destroy the earth and without a fucking planet to live on, nothing else matters. If we can never come together enough as a whole to change the direction of our species, the &quot;winner&quot; of whoever was right about a fact, that in THE biggest picture of all big pictures, doesn&#39;t mean a flying fuck in the end. </p>

<p>While humanity has had close calls with wiping itself out before (thinking nukes), all that took to prevent was someone to not push a button or give an order to fire. </p>

<p>How do you stop a natural reaction of an entire planets ecological trajectory when we all can&#39;t even get along long enough to understand how the fucking planet functions. </p>

<p>While in our part of history, many of the conspiracies we discuss daily shine so brightly in our eyes of what is important because those events are the causes of many of you and I&#39;s current daily struggle. Humans and civilizations have been around for 1000s and 1000s of years. I&#39;m sure way crazier shit has been pulled off in the past that no surviving record exists of. It&#39;s not the events themselves as much as how we think, work, and live life together as human beings. All these fucked up conspiracies are a symptom of that. We need to save ourselves and our planet because unfortunately there&#39;s nobody to just convince not to press a button on this one. We also cannot say oh well the next generation or the one after it will fix it. There isn&#39;t that much time. The greatest challenge to humanity is going to be how to attempt to right the wrongs of the earth and hope that it has mercy on us. Every other civilizations before us had it a lot easier in a way...worst case scenario they end up destroying their culture, way of life, and all the knowledge it had gained. Some ends up being rediscovered organically by another civilization, some events and history will never be known again. </p>

<p>If we fail, there are no problems left to worry about. There will be no humans left to rediscover what is lost and destroyed. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant guys, but I just have to at least try and help some of us step back and quit getting lost in the minutia. The disinformation campaign in this sub has gone off the fucking scales and I think we all need reminded that even in this somewhat &quot;safe&quot; place, we can still be lead like cattle if we take our eye off the ultimate priority. Saving ourselves, from ourselves. </p>

<p>TLDR: Sometimes information is too important to be summed up in a nice digestible sound bite. Read the goddamn post and try to understand what I&#39;m trying to convey. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point there. I always wonder about the input via MSM and the depressions that stem from believing their standards.
Adverts are the worst, they show a certain kind of family or home life that is not true for the majority of people and this discrepancy leads to depression, because we are made to feel inadequate of we don&#39;t live like in the adverts.</p>

<p>I am talking clean homes, new furniture, happy families, sunshine, tended gardens, you get the idea.
In reality, some middle class people manage to get close to those standards but when I look at my own life I seem to come from a different planet.
I am not the only one that doesn&#39;t live like the advert clones. But if you keep seeing them you may believe that anything less is somehow &#39;not normal&#39;.</p>

<p>I can take it because I took the red pill. But there are a lot of people  who try and achieve that level but fail, due to lack of money, work, etc. </p>

<p>I always wonder who sets these standards? I understand that an advert for window cleaners doesn&#39;t want to show a messy home but &#39;perfect world&#39; adverts still have an impact on everyone watching them. Most people take anything on TV as the given standard. </p>

<p>They do try and manipulate people though. Of course it sees only for positive things, like mixed families [on every single bloody advert] for example, but only if they are all living in an IKEA environment, being all middle class.</p>

<p>Wow, I didn&#39;t mean to write this much only say:</p>

<p>TL;DR: TV adverts influence our perceptions of an acceptable norm, which does not relate to real life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the same note, is it not strange how it is rare to ever see any positive public PSA&#39;s anymore? You never see things that try to teach people and children that knowledge is power or that getting an education is the most important thing that you can do, or any other of the concepts that we should be teaching our children as their foundation. I&#39;m not that old but even I remember as a child seeing a lot of I guess what you could call positive propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This might be a bit of confirmation bias: You see those &#39;positive propagandas&#39; in things generally geared towards children. When you were a child, you saw them more often. Now that you&#39;re not a child, and not watching childrens&#39; TV, you might simply be thinking it stopped entirely, when in reality you just stopped watching it. </p>

<p>Just sayin&#39;. I have a kid who watches Sesame Street. There&#39;s a ton of positive out there still directed at children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We as people who are currently alive need to broaden our mental horizons and quit thinking in 50 year chunks or what equates roughly to a human lifetime. What I like to call the grand conspiracy of life, isn&#39;t going to be fixed in a generation. And many people are going to HAVE to sacrifice their life and any type of happiness they may have had in it, to ultimately save the human race. If you have children yourself this should not be that much of a far out concept. In other aspects of your life you have no problem sacrificing so that your kids have a better future. Well name one problem on this earth of more importance that need some sacrificing for our children&#39;s tomorrow. </p>

<p>A very good reminder that with the JFK assassination (as with all conspiracies) we should be concentrating our energies on demonstrating that the &quot;official story&quot; is false - a lie - first and foremost.</p>

<p>This inevitably leaves a void (ie, if not LHO then who?), and it is human nature to want to fill in the gaps, but this our Achilles&#39; heel as a community, because this almost always involves speculation, and of the dozens of theories of &quot;who killed JFK&quot;, most of them MUST be wrong (albeit with fleeting elements of truth). And many of these theories (eg it was... the Mafia, the Cubans, the Russians) are probably deliberate red herrings put out by the real perpetrators to muddy the waters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you completely. There has been over 50 years for people who want the truth remain hidden to work at skewing it beyond any recognition. And we may have to accept that the truth can never be fully ascertained at this point about his assassination. But just because we can&#39;t tell the world exactly who did what and where on a second by second basis does not mean that the overall conspiracy didn&#39;t occur. </p>

<p>If you are one of the psychotic mass murdering elite, are you not going to try and hide what you did to the best of your ability? Is it that far out of the round of reality to think that at least a few of these events were actually pulled off with such precision that they did not leave any smoking guns? Just because the perpetrator did such a good job of burying what they did, does not change the fact that they did it. And it sure as hell doesn&#39;t end up with some lone nut pulling the whole thing off, while every single government agency that had any part in the investigation all ended up accidentally covering and burying everything of importance? In my mind that&#39;s almost even worse. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t accept the government deliberately covered up facts, then the only other conclusion is that the people that run the world are so fucking stupid and that every branch of our government failed to complete their part investigation correctly? EVERY SINGLE PART? Come on now. COMMON SENSE. </p>

<p>dont encounter the police, dont borrow money from them, tax revolt, dont pay student loans, join the most subversive groups, make them record all your harmless communications, make them decrypt all your harmless communication, dont feed them with threats of violence, be so free and true that the system doesnt even want to look at you.</p>

<p>and get really good at what you do, like ai wei or picasso or einstein, or food not bombs, make them make fools of themselves going after you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m been on the path before man. The thing is change doesn&#39;t occur without convincing the masses. Oh you might be personally able to convince a few people and that&#39;s great, keep doing that. But the bigger picture doesn&#39;t get changed. So long as the masses clamor for a leader, there will be no change.</p>

<p>Now about the masses. The reason I ask is because at first I thought the mass is stupid, and they still are. <strong>We</strong> still are. That fact alone is disheartening, but it didn&#39;t deter me. What deter me is that <strong>people don&#39;t care</strong>. Going along the bell curve, a vast majority of people are average or below average IQ. <em>They don&#39;t understand</em>. They don&#39;t understand what it means to be human. They don&#39;t understand society and how it we got here. All they know is the current society show them <em>something</em>, a path, a way of life they can understand. 90% of the people will not throw themselves at a system they dont even understand for a system they do understand; no matter how shitty it is. </p>

<p>To get them to understand you have to show them a working functional system that is not the current system. And to build a working functional system takes what? <strong>money</strong>. And round and round we go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the sad truth is: the earth <em>is</em> dying, i wish more people would acknowledge this. we live <em>here</em> (on this planet), by destroying it we also kill ourselves, evidently that doesn&#39;t bother those in power, as the code they seem to live by is a death wish.</p>

<p>many civilizations have died in the past, ours could be next. should this happen there won&#39;t be any great relics remaining, only evidence of violence &amp; pollution.</p>

<p>i think the fact that more people are interested in &amp; want to discuss &quot;conspiracies&quot; is (some) proof that they are becoming &#39;unplugged&#39; from the Matrix (in a way), i think that&#39;s an improvement.</p>

<p>now that some truth is realized it should be acted upon. what&#39;s been done so far: whistleblowers, petitions, demonstrations, alternative news. the push back has been extreme as many people have died or disappeared, but they can&#39;t kill everybody, at least not all at once anyway.</p>

<p>so we continue to reveal as much as possible, i feel it&#39;s empowering to be aware, that may not mean much, but i believe it starts here, in <em>knowing</em>. the &#39;slave&#39; has to realize that the slave master is never going to give them their freedom, or admit the truth. </p>

<p>WE have to learn the truth &amp; free ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humanity is facing its greatest trial. I think it will <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34489266">massively fail at overcoming this challenge</a>, as it should. If humans cannot earn tutelage of the planet, whatever comes next should claim dominance of this tiny piece of the universal map. It will be a shame that we spoiled our chance at something grand because of pettiness, selfishness, and clanishness, but that fate is an adequate summary of our species. If we survive and pull through, that too will be an adequate summary of our species. </p>

<p>The Matrix movie is a contemporary adaptation of the Parable of the Cave. At this point in time, there are infinite shadow shows flickering on cave walls. The few who wake up and venture out of the cave are going to be desperately few and powerless to change anything. </p>

<p>That said, it seems the only course for a reasonable person now is to fall to the hedonist, selfish path that is ruining the planet to begin with. This paradoxical situation is our doom. If you could stop all the machines exhausting limited reserves of valuable energy, producing tons of garbage no one needs, who would want to do that given our pending terrible fate? Best to soothe the unbearable sting of our massive failure with Netflix, steak, and ice cream.</p>

<p>The despondency of the human condition frequently troubles me. We are all here for such a sadly finite amount of time, so why do any of us bother to be hurtful and repressive of others? Why create so much unnecessary suffering when we have within our grasp an ideal world for all? The answers I&#39;ve developed are only conjecture: ignorance, limits of human neurology (limits of compassion, limits of understanding reason, limits on base level intelligence), primitive urges of greed, excess manifestation for control arising from utter lack of inner control, environmental factors e.g. unhealthy society structure and pollution exacerbating negative pre-existing conditions (widespread lead poisoning is a great example), generational conditioning and forced compliance with incorrect worldviews, resulting cognitive dissonance from contesting programmed worldviews. The real answers are probably more depressing and frightening. </p>

<p>I guess your post offers some reassurance. If only one person alive had these thoughts, they would go mad from the loneliness of it all. I guess my sincerest question to you is: how are you reacting to your knowledge of our pending doom as a species? Me, I am reacting in fear and choosing to focus on selfish pursuits like my own health and happiness, as I see any attempt to alter the status quo resulting in increased pain and suffering in my life. I have intense bitterness, too, for uniquely personal reasons, so I have no motivation to help the world around me, other than those I perceive as being within my in-group. I feel like saying to our surrounding world, &quot;So <strong>this</strong> is what you want for existence?! Great, you can have it!&quot; and fucking off to my own little storm cellar while the shitstorm rages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what your saying and when I read it fast it seems to make sense. But just like anything in life nothing is ever absolute. They DO try EXTREMELY hard to get us to believe global warming is not real and that our industrial aspects of life have no effect on the earth. There isn&#39;t a lie that exists that could convince people who have an understanding of the world based on science and fact that it&#39;s NOT happening. </p>

<p>So I would say the powers that be do try to make us think it&#39;s not happening, it&#39;s just such a whopper of falsities that there is no made up explanation they can transmit to the masses that&#39;s going to convince anyone who any type of fact based reasoning in their life that the laws of nature apply, just not in this scenario. I would liken it to how the official narrative of 911 tries to have us believe that the laws of physics took a lunch break that day. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not money, it&#39;s power that is valued.</p>

<p>Sure you can. It&#39;s call living outside of civilization. Essentially back to being caveman.</p>

<p>1) You don&#39;t</p>

<p>2) Science</p>

<p>This is a very biased thinking. Talk about self-importance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original point was that humans now wield a destructive force without an equal in history.  </p>

<p>As it is, humans can significantly alter an environment to make it uninhabitable to all visible and many unicellular organisms. In the past, we might wipe out one species and a few dependent species, but had (or if) colony collapse disorder continued progressing (or increases significantly), it would have been bye bye majority of flora and fauna on earth. Hundreds of millions of years of progress are lost. That&#39;s not something to be dismissive about, saying &quot;oh there will be still be protozoa&quot;.</p>

<p>That is true but my original statement stands. Every organized empire in history can burn this planet till nothing survives. It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t because living things like to continue living. Nukes just make it faster/more efficient.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is being &quot;high&quot;? Are you coming at me with that word in the sense that the idiot masses use it? Meaning that any chemical alteration to my brain automatically means that I am speaking drivel and should be dismissed on that fact alone? </p>

<p>When you get to the point of your awakening where you have wiped your brain clean and started building reality from the bottom up, you will learn and realize that altering our consciousness is not always a negative thing. In many ways and circumstances I believe it can be very helpful, or if nothing else just neutral. Your insinuation that just because I may have consumed a substance means that everything I said should be written off is extremely naïve and I think you should learn some more before you make such ridiculous statements.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We as people who are currently alive need to broaden our mental horizons and quit thinking in 50 year chunks or what equates roughly to a human lifetime. What I like to call the grand conspiracy of life, isn&#39;t going to be fixed in a generation. And many people are going to HAVE to sacrifice their life and any type of happiness they may have had in it, to ultimately save the human race. If you have children yourself this should not be that much of a far out concept. In other aspects of your life you have no problem sacrificing so that your kids have a better future. Well name one problem on this earth of more importance that need some sacrificing for our children&#39;s tomorrow. </p>

<p>Edit: when I say &quot;you&quot; I don&#39;t mean you specifically op. I mean &quot;you&quot; in an abstract way that stands for whoever this argument needs to be made towards. </p>

Our enslavement entails using our own bodies and physical energy to accomplish the goals required to keep the elite humming along in their global conquest.

    <div class="md"><p>I know what you&#39;re saying. I&#39;m been on the path before man. The thing is change doesn&#39;t occur without convincing the masses. Oh you might be personally able to convince a few people and that&#39;s great, keep doing that. But the bigger picture doesn&#39;t get changed. So long as the masses clamor for a leader, there will be no change.</p>

<p>Now about the masses. The reason I ask is because at first I thought the mass is stupid, and they still are. <strong>We</strong> still are. That fact alone is disheartening, but it didn&#39;t deter me. What deter me is that <strong>people don&#39;t care</strong>. Going along the bell curve, a vast majority of people are average or below average IQ. <em>They don&#39;t understand</em>. They don&#39;t understand what it means to be human. They don&#39;t understand society and how it we got here. All they know is the current society show them <em>something</em>, a path, a way of life they can understand. 90% of the people will not throw themselves at a system they dont even understand for a system they do understand; no matter how shitty it is. </p>

<p>To get them to understand you have to show them a working functional system that is not the current system. And to build a working functional system takes what? <strong>money</strong>. And round and round we go.</p>
