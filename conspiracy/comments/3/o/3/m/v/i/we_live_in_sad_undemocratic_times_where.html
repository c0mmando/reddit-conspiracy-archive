    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t any newspapers or broadcast media outlets convey sustained outrage about the outrageous misconduct of the American government? I mean, if the rich and credentialed are free to do so, why do none of them go up against each other or the government agents so clearly feeding their reports and commentary? Why do they admit &quot;buying&quot; access with slanted coverage? Your idea of a free press may be at odds with mine; especially the print media looks whack to me and the broadcast media all being on the same page as well doesn&#39;t make your &quot;free press&quot; claim evident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not after a free press, you&#39;re after an <em>honest</em> press. There&#39;s a huge difference. The press <em>is</em> free.. to be honest, dishonest, fearmongery, profiteering, fluff pieces, or yes: hard reporting and any number of other things. They are <em>free</em> to do all that; it doesn&#39;t mean <em>they do</em>. They have incentive to do the wrong things because the wrong things <em>pay more money</em>.</p>

<p>The fact is that power and money go hand-in-hand: no one wants money and not power, nor wants power and not money. The big names are all bought because they&#39;re run by <em>people with money</em>. The little names don&#39;t have influence because they have no money, and if they did, they wouldn&#39;t be so quick to post things that might affect their money. That&#39;s why the moneyed-media doesn&#39;t report things that might cause a fluster; they actually <em>stand to lose money if they do</em>. Same reason they use clickbait and bombastic language: It <em>brings in more money</em>. This is why they can be bought. Because money exists. Think you can do better and rise above it all? Build a media network wholly unbiased and report the hard news, every turn? Never sell out? And manage to pay employees and expenses? You are <em>free to try</em>. That&#39;s what &quot;free press&quot; means. It does not mean &quot;equal&quot; press <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p><a href="https://reason.com/archives/2015/05/22/theres-no-such-thing-as-unbiased-journal">There is no such thing as non-biased journalism.</a> Not now, not ever.  It simply <em>does not exist</em> because it is <em>literally impossible</em>. Everyone has a bias, and that is their own well-being. That doesn&#39;t mean anyone speaking out &#39;gets silenced&#39;. No, it means that people don&#39;t <em>easily profit from</em> speaking out. The ones who are &#39;speaking out&#39; and profiting are the ones <em>least trustworthy</em>: Alex Jones. David Icke. They&#39;re profiting off of <em>fear</em>, and they have zero regard for the honest truth. They have an agenda, just like CNN, and they profit off it immensely. They do that by <em>manipulation</em>, just like the big bad MSM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your analysis works up to a point, but, as newspaper after newspaper after newspaper has declined, they have as a group declined to publish what I&#39;d suggest would have been more profitable albeit more controversial text. The trouble isn&#39;t simply that the wrong things pay more money; it&#39;s that the powerful only have media toys they own to be toys and their focus hopes for no mutual exclusivity between power and money, but what <em>seems</em> a media monolith tows a government-mandated line, money or no money. I am mystified that variety doesn&#39;t find its way into the media and, if these 7 or 8 ultra-rich fat cats are free and own media outlets, assuming you&#39;re right and I&#39;m wrong, seems like they&#39;d go off the reservation instead of towing the government line. Never minding their manipulation of everyone else, how are the rich and credentialed press owners so manipulated?</p>

<p>Again: money. These guys don&#39;t stand to profit by throwing the country into upheaval. They don&#39;t stand to profit by telling people that the rich are trying to get richer while making the poor get poorer. They <em>are the rich</em>. That&#39;s why the majority of the coverage is dedicated to pointless fluff. It&#39;s <em>comfortable</em> for the populace. Reporting all the bad shit would make the populace uncomfortable, which will in turn cut into their profits.</p>

<p>You keep focusing on the media; focus on the <em>money</em>. If you&#39;re wealthy, you&#39;re not about to tell everyone how this wealthy person is trying to do this, or that wealthy person is doing that: All the people hear is &quot;wealthy&quot;. That paints you, the wealthy owner of the media, as a target, even if only subliminally. </p>

<p>Media exists to express bias, not to suppress it. You don&#39;t own a media network without having a message and agenda you&#39;re trying to spread. <em>Historians</em> exist to suppress bias. But current events are not history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they support a discreditably bad information dissemination system in which their businesses are shamefully involved for greed&#39;s sake. They tell kids knowledge is power and giggle that their suppression of knowledge is <em>real</em> power.

<p>Unless you&#39;re rich, I should point out that it&#39;s difficult to put yourself in their place. There&#39;s one thing all rich people agree on: &quot;It&#39;s good to be rich.&quot; That&#39;s the common thread among them all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You state it openly, yet not plainly: The media owns the government, and the government owns the media. They&#39;re both entities controlled by <em>excessively wealthy people</em>. </p>

<p>The media all but dictates who gets elected, but the government all but dictates who <em>can be</em> elected, and vice-versa. It&#39;s a game of pass, with neither being the primary instigator. <em>Yes</em> there are groups of people that fall into <em>both</em> the media <em>and</em> the government. They are the primary manipulators. They manipulate towards the end of gaining profits. </p>

<p>You talk as if there&#39;s some over-arching, objective morality that these people are slighting, but there is not. <em>We commoners</em> think there is, even if not openly, we act like it. But there is no objective morality. Atheists can preach this, but even they don&#39;t really understand what that means in the scheme of things. </p>

<p>Their subjective morality tells them it is okay to endeavor to <em>keep that money and power</em>. That&#39;s why they lie. That&#39;s why <em>anyone lies</em>: To keep control. They can rationalize it a thousand ways. They can rationalize child-rape and murder as a means to &#39;further the global good&#39;, because to them, the &#39;global good&#39; is staying in power. That&#39;s why they can cover up these things without faltering in their sleep at night: they <em>honestly believe</em> they&#39;re in the moral high ground. They&#39;re not <em>evil</em> - evil is predicated on a desire to harm. They don&#39;t <em>want</em> to harm, but they will rationalize doing harm by saying they <em>have to</em>, for the greater good.</p>

<p>And yes, that is the only thing they agree on, across the board: &quot;We need to stay in control, where we are now&quot;, because, and in other words, &quot;It&#39;s good to be rich&quot;. You see Democrats and Republicans alike gathering in places like Bohemian Grove and the CFR: They&#39;re talking about wealth, not party-line politics. The political parties are and always have been a sham: They&#39;re <em>funded</em> by the same wealthy players.</p>

<p>And of course not everyone in the media is wealthy. Not every reporter is &#39;in on it&#39;. But they&#39;re just <em>working a job they don&#39;t want to lose</em>, just like anyone else. They do what their bosses tell them, and their bosses are just doing what <em>theirs</em> told them. All the way up to the wealthy few at the top. They don&#39;t even have to be aware of any of it; most aren&#39;t. And I can&#39;t <em>prove</em> any of this except by observing that it&#39;s happened as such over and over and over so it must not be by random chance. Something is doing it. Like anything, follow the money. If you want to get to the bottom of a thing, follow the money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My friend, I hope you remember you&#39;re the free press guy now saying...pretty much that we have a kinda free press manipulated for financial gain by the subjective morality of excessively wealthy people who control the government and media. You got me beat articulating that, but, before heading to the dangerous realm of religious philosophy, we are closer on this than I thought at the start. My bad for believing to the extent I do in God almighty and acting to move His Love forward in the world to the extent this sometimes soul-less sinner can, but, hey, assuming I&#39;m wrong to believe in His objective reality (being a doubter at heart), I, very much like the news readers who aren&#39;t &#39;in on it&#39; but seek a paycheck, at least have some sense of spiritual gratification or comfort in wishing for others without any forceful dominion over them to wish to conform to dictates of God&#39;s expressions defining moral righteousness. (I saw a debate where Ron Paul got booed for mentioning the Golden Rule in connection with foreign policy, but aetheist Jesse Ventura doesn&#39;t have a problem with that. Devout Christians worried militarism won&#39;t sustain their employment needs are the ones who booed, concerned that &#39;hearts and minds&#39; wars wouldn&#39;t be championed. So--ever the doubter--I hope there <em>is</em> an objective morality/reality that favors the righteous, even the folks booing Ron Paul since I booed that detestable infomercial and I&#39;m his biggest fan.) I <em>still</em> insist there is an over-arching, objective morality that has to apply universally to those pursuing a level-4 Aristotelian happiness (heaven) and wish those wealthy media manipulators following the money well when their hearse is pulling a U-Haul full of money because then the money will be following them. I am proud of not (altruistically or otherwise) seeking to displace God&#39;s dominion over others, even the media manipulators, but I will admit to thinking that their &#39;faltering in their sleep at night&#39; might help them in the pursuit of happiness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it is a free press. Not a fair press. Not an equal press. But you&#39;re more than welcome to do it differently. No one guarantees you will profit from it though. That&#39;s what makes it free. </p>

<p>I agree, we&#39;re more in agreement than you realize, but that&#39;s where I started this line of discussion: we <em>do have a free press</em>. I think you just didn&#39;t understand exactly what that actually meant. </p>

<p>Regarding morality, I&#39;m a theist. I won&#39;t get into it, but I do believe there is a objective, ultimate &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;. That said, I have to realize that not everyone agrees with me on that. Some think it&#39;s all subjective. Even if they do, we won&#39;t agree on all the various details of what is right or wrong. Despite my sense of morality, you live by your sense of morality. Others live by their senses of morality. In that sense, it <em>is</em> subjective. Morality is subjective to the beholder. </p>

<p>If you want to know why there are people out there with a sense of morality so perverted from your own understanding of it, you really can only ask one person, and that&#39;s your God. That&#39;s between him and you. I don&#39;t really question it. It&#39;s observable that people don&#39;t all live by the same sense of morality, therefore it&#39;s true, in my world. Again, that doesn&#39;t mean I <em>don&#39;t</em> believe in an objective, ultimate morality. I do, and strive to understand it as best I can. But I&#39;m also as fallible as any human; I&#39;m incapable of fully comprehending it. You are too. We all are. That&#39;s why we believe differently, in my opinion. The bible explains it with original sin. </p>

<p>And I feel it&#39;s important to respect that sense of subjective morality, because again: I&#39;m fallible. So are you. So is everyone. So are mobs. Mistakes will be made, what&#39;s important is people actively and consciously try not to. A lot of people live their lives in the unconscious or subconscious, never really reflecting on why they act how they do. To me, it&#39;s a big piece of our education that&#39;s missing. It&#39;s one of those things left to each on their own to learn, and as most of those things, many people never bother to learn them, because no one is forcing them to. A lot of people literally have no purpose, in the true sense of that term. Not that they&#39;re useless, just they have no direction or drive. That&#39;s something that, at least on this country, you can totally achieve. That&#39;s why I might come off a bit less agitated by the state of affairs than you. </p>

<p>Because I understand it&#39;s not just &quot;they&quot; in the MSM to blame, it&#39;s all of us, to some extent. When you boil it down, it&#39;s the fault of money for even existing, and we all endorse the mighty dollar. Would you turn down ten million dollars right now, no strings attached? Honestly. If you wouldn&#39;t, that&#39;s an endorsement of the power of money. Think of how many people would. You&#39;d be hard pressed to find a dozen who would say no. They&#39;re a very, very rare breed. And I&#39;m not one of them, if truth be told.</p>
