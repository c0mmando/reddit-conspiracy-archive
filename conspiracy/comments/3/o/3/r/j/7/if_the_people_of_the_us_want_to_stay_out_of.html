    <div class="md"><p>I upvoted you but do want to nag on the feeling of helplessness, we shouldn&#39;t have this. I admit, my feeling in 2015 is a LOT different than my feeling in 2012. Whereas I knew there was some corruption before, news was controlled, and 9/11 was coordinated by more than just Al-Qaeda, it&#39;s now clear that the media is a full-blown government propaganda arm. The extent people are going to in order to perpetrate this fakery is alarming and worrisome. The corruption runs far deeper than I would have ever guessed.</p>

<p>But all that being said, we must remember how <em>small</em> a percentage, regardless of how wealthy, these fools represent. No doubt, a growing piece of discussion among my family and friends has been, &quot;when is enough enough?&quot; People have been dying for freedom for millennia - if anyone physically comes after our weapons, they will meet resistance.</p>

<p>But, the real fight right now is waking people up and making sure they don&#39;t buy in to the changes our elected officials are hoping for. They&#39;re using fakery in an attempt to change public opinion to prevent a coup for their takeover. If public opinion doesn&#39;t change, then they&#39;re gonna have a hell of a lot more work to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This a thousand times over.  However, it&#39;s not easy when so many listen to and are guided by the msm conditioning that exists in this country.  So long as we stay beholden to that and we continue abiding by the race baiting that it perpetuates, we&#39;ll remain divided.  So long as we remain divided, we will remain conquered.  One of the first and biggest steps in freeing ourselves from the manipulative grip of TPTB is to fight <em>against</em> the racism that they/the msm indoctrinate in the masses - that indoctrination that keeps us apart, separated from one another, and unable to mount a concerted front against that debilitating, weakening manipulation together as the one people we are.</p>

<p>Therefore, we must see the racism that exists in this country.  We must be aware of it, we must call it out so that others are aware of it and see it as such as well, and we must not support it.  The more and more we imbue a culture of NON-racism and togetherness, the more we will engender a climate of national togetherness and unity among the citizenry.</p>

<p>Once we do that, then TPTB will simply not be able to keep all of us from moving together as one against their b.s.</p>

<p>I generally agree with this.  However, keep in mind that I posted the above comment, I champion our awakening and doing away with racism, I’ve <em>always</em> championed such a stance…and I’m <em>42</em>…so even though I feel you’re right in that the older people get, the more “set in their ways” they tend to be, the more “old” they tend to be and act…I am proof positive that such cannot be said for <em>everyone</em> “over 40”.  ;)</p>

<p>Just as there can be people like me in the “over 40” crowd that are 100% anti-racism and pro togetherness, there, unfortunately, can be <em>many</em> ignorant, bigoted racists in the “<em>under</em> 40” crowd.  There are, unfortunately, quite a few moronic, caustic, closed minded idiots in this subreddit alone, and I would bet you a <em>lot</em> of money that most if not all of them are younger than I am.</p>

<p>And that is the very reason why we <em>all</em> of us need to absolutely stop worrying entirely about “cracking open their inner circle”.</p>

<p>Fuck them and fuck their inner circle.  We need to create our <em>own</em> “inner circle” - and in that “inner circle” we need to accept everyone who is simply not racist and is willing to help everyone else.  Period.</p>

<p>And at the end of the day, our “inner circle” can be a lot bigger and more powerful than their inner circle.</p>

<p>Well, awakened or not, I’ve certainly been a lone wolf pretty much all of my life, so…</p>

<p>Perhaps that’s part of what’s helped keep me from being too much of a “stereotypical 40+ year old geezer”.  ;)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know if it would be all that easy for them to do that if the movement were simply really, really strong with the core foundation and principles.  It would need to be very steadfast and aggressive against those who tried to be agent provocateurs.  And by “aggressive”, I don’t necessarily mean “violent”.  I mean that such a movement should be very proactive and assertive with regard to fostering an ongoing community of open communication and information.  That way if anyone “steps out of line” or starts advocating notions that run counter to helping everyone, then that person could get called out soon enough and exposed to the group.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Honestly I see this planet filled with animals, some of which are humans who can actually think, but the rest are just selfish animals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cannot say I disagree with that, sir…and that does indeed make the situation pretty dismal because, under those auspices (and I, again, feel that what you’re saying is the case), it simply doesn’t matter how intelligent or disciplined any group is, there will still be agent provocateur animals and idiots who “just want to watch the world burn” kind of thing.</p>

<p>It makes it very difficult because it seems that a proper movement would, therefore, have to be REALLY careful and vigilant (and, yes, aggressive…) in order to make sure and not allow itself to get infiltrated with forces that would ultimately undermine and disrupt it.  For that reason, it would further seem that such a group would need to be willing to “play rough” and not be afraid to fuck some people up to keep the group from getting taken over by negative forces.</p>

<p>But then at that point, the lines between who are “the good guys” and “the bad guys” would likely begin to start blurring pretty badly real soon.</p>

<p>:/</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So how does a planet like that evolve towards something greater?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would seem to me that it is a question of one’s <em>individual</em> struggle.</p>

<p>You have to do it alone.  Help and teach as many as possible, get help and learn from as many as possible…but ultimately, it seems that the way to really and truly evolve on this planet isn’t so much to align yourself with any one group (for there are just so many ways to be deceived on this planet), but to try as much as possible to follow your <em>own</em> path and do as best as you can <em>on your own</em>.</p>

<p>42 years old, no wife, no kids, living on my own…looks like I’m well on my way to following my own advice!  :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suffering? Pollution? Nuke Wars? Before finally getting everyone aboard the same talks?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there are quite a few sources (not the least of which is <a href="http://cdn.preterhuman.net/texts/alien.ufo/Bramley,%20William%20-%20The%20Gods%20of%20Eden.pdf">this</a> one) that have done extensive research showing the great amount of evidence on this planet indicating that the human race is also a <em>genetically engineered slave race</em> created by a much more evolved species that, to a great extent, also happens to be the species responsible for all the insane manipulation and divisions that exist here <em>keeping</em> us apart.</p>

<p>As such, if there is truth in these and other sources, then the suffering and the pollution and the nuke wars are…kind of part and parcel for what was expected out of the Earth human species/animal.</p>

<p>I think it might be A.I. and reengineering a new human 2.0 with extremely high I.Q. and self mastery over the inherent animalism and sociopathy that breeds selfish ignorance and stupidity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if there is any truth in the above source, I’m not sure that the average rung of humanity would ultimately be <em>allowed</em> to have the technology to accomplish such things.  Heck, there is already great evidence indicating that the level of mainstream technology that exists today and is out in the public arena is possibly <em>centuries</em> behind what exists in deep black military projects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But they&#39;ll probably all want to leave here and colonize mars to start a new.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here’s where things continue to get <em>really</em> strange.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3m9i9o/what_mystery_of_mars_do_you_think_nasa_will/cvd8mj8?context=3">There are people</a> - highly knowledgeable and accomplished people at that - who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3m9i9o/what_mystery_of_mars_do_you_think_nasa_will/cvdcbh0">swear up and down that Mars has been colonized since <em>at least</em> the 1950s</a>.</p>

<p>Go wrap your head around <em>that</em> one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Heck I&#39;m regular human 1.0 and already want to get away from this place as far as possible and be around a bunch of enlightened folks that have a utopian society</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I definitely would chose <em>not</em> to be in stuck in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfGMYdalClU">what we’ve made of this planet</a> either, but I’m not sure that Mars is much better from what some have described (particularly Cpt Randy Cramer).</p>

<p>Is there a book written about these Mars jumpers?</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m familiar with - just a shit ton of interviews that they&#39;ve given and I&#39;ve listened to over the past few years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if there is no book, why not?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my knowledge, a sizable portion of this information is actually pretty brand spanking new - i.e. it has only just come out in the past few short years.  Additionally, and according to some of these whistleblowers, this is some <em>seeerious</em> information that TPTB do <em>not</em> want out to the masses.  People have gotten killed for far less.  So why aren&#39;t these people dead?  Well, plausible deniability on TPTB&#39;s part, perhaps, or because they fear a Striesand Effect.  Who knows?</p>

However, racism above all those other issues has historically led to the most divisions and the absolute most violence against the population.  Therefore, that is the biggest factor to tackle.

<p>Thats the entire point of a political party, a newly formed one would have no incentive to act any different then the 2 we have now.</p>

<p>Despite popular opinion, Texas no longer has a legitmate option to secede without being considered high treason. And no new third party would form, you would have the same parties in a seperate nation, now with 0% of a unified goal.</p>

<p>&quot;United We Stand, Divided We Fall&quot; if the US broke into pieces it would turn into seperate competing nations and foreign policy would destroy us. Other powers would try to pit one side against the other, just like our revolution, just like our civil war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The false flag of ISIS that the CIA created and demonstrated by wikileaks cable about deposing assad (and so many other examples)... which is used as a plot device to take us into a war with Russia.  Russia is now attacking CIASIS and telling the US public they are &#39;helping&#39; with Putin&#39;s glib shrug, which they believe because they are mostly cow-eyed stupids who believe the msm as scripture.  Meanwhile, Obama having a shitfit because he doesn&#39;t know how to manage the propaganda, but the outcome is already planned.  </p>

<p>In fact, WW3 had been planned since late 1800s, along with the other wars.  I just posted something to conspiracy that--if it&#39;s real--details a plot by exalted master mason Albert Pike who planned ww3 as a war to pit zionists against islam.  If this is true, it&#39;s what I&#39;ve been saying which is that freemasons and other secret societies have taken over international intelligence networks per their longstanding plans to cause war.  </p>

<p>This would mean hurting them in their weak point. Advertising.  However advertising drives the same businesses that most US people pay their bills by working for.  When a handful of companies cover 96% of media (printed, screen, etc) then they essentially have everyone by the short hairs because any attempt to attack media would end up with a severe blow-back.  I have discussed this with many people at great length and have yet to come up with a solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Putin has made a very brash move in Syria and I don&#39;t think it will pay off for them. They will repeat thier history with Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The US was make some of the right moves. A lot of the real problem was the Security Concil &#39;s Russia and China rejecting sanctions which has turned the region into a quagmire.</p>

<p>Just Today Russia&#39;s Partner in Syria, Iran was dealt a devastating blow by ISIL when they were able to Kill a Top Revolutionary Guard General.</p>

<p>So Putin&#39;s moves are NOT a diss to the way America has handled things as we see. The short term is not going to be indicative of Russia&#39;s long term.</p>

<p>EDIT: It has come to my attention that Russia as we all know is actively pursuing ISIL and that is what they say they are there for but in doing so their other agenda is to dismantle all of the opposition forces and in doing so have blundered by not being definitive in their action. Russia drove out other opposition groups on the edge of Allepo which have been helping keep ISIL in check and now ISIL has seized the area.</p>

<p>In reality Russia is just going to speed up the overthrow of Assad leave the area and will have given the country to ISIL like they gave Afghanistan to the Taliban.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the difference.  Putin is there at the request of the legitimate government.  Western MSM aside, they have the support of a lot of other nations.  And the people of Syria sick of the civil war brought about or at least inflamed by US covert actions and paid mercenaries.  I don&#39;t see them making the mistakes we did in the middle east, or repeating their tour of Afghanistan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have already been two mistakes. The Iranian General and Underestimating ISIL so that they have taken part of Aleppo.</p>

<p>I am not saying that the US does everything right or for the right reasons either but Russia is not in the position they claim to be in with their Armed Forces. For one I think they lack a strategic Infrastructure of top top level personnel. Which is show in their shortsighted plan. They have made several moves in ISIL and it looks like they have done in 2 weeks what the US and others have tried to do for years. But these moves are brash and not thought out. We are starting to see that. That it is quick short term gains that are going to in long run strategically backfire on them.</p>

<p>Think of it as a guy trying to take down a two story building, He was hired a year ago and still at it because he started from the top down. Owner gets pissed and calls a new guy and says that he can do it in a week. The new guy comes in and starts collapsing the building from the outside in from the first floor and it looks like he is right, that is till he gets into the interior and he takes a swing at a column and the rest of the building above him comes right down on top of him.</p>

<p>This is what Russia is doing in Syria.</p>
