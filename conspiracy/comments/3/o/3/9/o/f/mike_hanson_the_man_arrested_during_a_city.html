    <div class="md"><p>You have to be able to present your message inside of the time limit. This is fairly easy to understand. He is complaining about the police so they are going to want to fuck with him. Also easy to imagine. </p>

<p>Further, he is complaining to the mayor about the government. He should know by now that this will not make him loved by the mayor. He should either run for mayor, or move, or take some other actions that might insure an outcome that is acceptable to him. He is stupid if he thinks complaining to the government is going to improve it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you there, but arrest is overkill. Escort him out and let him walk away. If he continues to interrupt or whatever, then ok arrest him but going over a time limit and such is an abuse of power to be arrested. Same thing happen to that lady in Quartzsite, AZ. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree. It was clearly overkill. But, the cops and DEA are fighting with the Mexican Mafia, who are not playing around. Parents do not want their kids strung out on tar, and more toys for the cops is what they like to show their power while the government has an excess of mine-hardened vehicles that it wants to get rid of. </p>

<p>He should say his piece and sit down inside of 3 mins. And he should put up a facebook page about his community etc. Reach out in other ways. But, as I said, once you criticize the government, they will come after you. You cannot be so stupid as to expect that they will just accept the criticism and improve. That is not how humans react. He thinks it is still 1950 when the US has moved on to 1984.</p>
