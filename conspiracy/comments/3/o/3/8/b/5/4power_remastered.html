       That's not very enlightened. If this journey is about self, you're #1 should be something quite different. Before you say, I'm going to hell, maybe you should contemplate if
       <em>
        you are
       </em>
       , for not seeking higher wisdom and being blind, rather than projecting on others
       <em>
        your lack
       </em>
       of enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are already in hell and you do not even realize it. I pity you, for you will never reach higher enlightenment. Maybe in the next life you will learn, but maybe you will be a druggy whore. May take a few life cycles.....

       You have so much to learn. I suggest, rather than trying to preach to others,
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       actually seek self enlightenment. You are not wise, you are a fool who cannot even see past
       <em>
        your own
       </em>
       rules. Let alone, abide by them. You are self projecting on others because you feel inadequate and are lost in this world. I pity you.

       Did your father (the one who cared "numero uno" about you, unborn) give you that central nerve, or did his father give him that nerve to give to you? How far do you want to go back? His father's father's father?

       For your own benefit, worship 4, for you've been evil for too long; and that's still me being humble.

       All academia is not stupid.  There is a legitimate need for math, science, comprehensive reading skills, etc.

       There is no silver bullet theory of everything.  Regardless, none of that speculation proves there is a conspiracy.

       The theory of everything isn't a 'silver bullet', it's the ineffable truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       A theory of everything would be something difficult and eternal... Not something you can lay back and say, "I know it all".
      </p>
      <p>
       1, 2, 3, 4 is eternal and difficult, yet we, being wise animals need only 4 to understand almost anything; not academia, which teaches us only 1---which is 1/4 of our total intelligence; and this was through rotary education that in the beginning we all but a few repented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when you repeatedly wrote down the letter 'a' and the rest of the alphabet? That is the foundation to all your knowledge, rather than a wordless central nerve...
      </p>
      <p>
       We are rote-educated so much it had become a part of us {i.e. a word-virus}, we rote-educate ourselves, our families, and we rote-educate other people---implemented by rotary academia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worship of 1, only, equates to anti-1, 2, 3, 4 behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a legitimate need for our species to continue if we want our children to experience life on the planet. This isn't a planet for adults to have fun, it's a planet for reproduction and survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Academic, math, science, language, are all against this notion. It's death education that will, and is, leading to the extinction of our species and 'hell on Earth' {i.e. a habitat we struggle to live in; world war III approaches; waste product is amounting to a habitat where we are forced to be cannibalistic in; and to infinity}
      </p>
      <p>
       That statement does apply except you're referring to academia, whereas I'm referring to the truth.

       In 1884,  meridian time personnel met in Washington to change Earth time. First words said was that only 1 day could be used on Earth to not change the 1 day bible. So they applied the 1 day  and  ignored  the  other  3 days. The bible time was wrong then and it proved wrong today. This a major lie has so much evil feed from it's wrong. No man on Earth has no belly-button, it proves every believer on Earth a liar.
      </p>
      <p>
       When   Do  Teenagers  Die? Adults Eat Teenagers Alive, No Record  Of  Their Death. Father Son Image, Not Gods. Every Man Born Of Woman. Belly-Button Is the Signature Of  Your Personal Creator - The Pastor Told His Flock That God Created All Of Them - Truth Was That They All had Mama Made Belly Buttons, Church Was Full Of Liars. Earth Has 4 Days In Same 24      Hrs., 1 Day God Was Wrong. Try Belly-Button  Logic. No God Knows About 4 Days, It  Is  Evil  To  Ignore 4 Days. Do You Know ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a Knower of 4 corner simultaneous 24 hour Days that occur within a single 4 corner rotation of Earth. Till You KNOW 4 Simultaneous Days Rotate In Same 24 Hours Of Earth You Don't Deserve To Live On Earth Americans are actually RETARDED from Religious Academia taught ONEism -upon an Earth of opposite poles, covered by Mama Hole and Papa Pole pulsating opposite sexes. The ONEist educated with their flawed 1 eye perspective (opposite eyes overlay) Cyclops mentality, inflicts static non pulsating logos as a fictitious queer same sex transformation. It Is The Absolute Verifiable Truth &amp; Proven Fact That Your Belly-Button Signature Ties To Viviparous Mama. Life is pulsing opposite mirror Pairs, Death is ONEness of Godism.

       Ignoring 4 Corner Earth Days will Destroy Evil Humanity. Renounce  Pale QueerGod ONEist maths IMITATION of meta-fractal trans-reflection and Embrace the truth of hyperdimensional TIMECUBE!

       In this word-world's social societies, there are many cases of
       <em>
        vocal-stimuli dampening
       </em>
       ; which, inter alia, lessen one's intellectual integrity and manipulate their sexual energies. People who commit such acts are classed by the central nerve {i.e. consciousness; 4} as paedophiles; in western social society, there is an abundance of repetitive or rote-paedophilia, and thus an abundance of paedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paedophilia, directly and indirectly; the direct paedophilia is the manipulation of ones sexual energies {i.e. sperm } and the indirect paedophilia is the influence to commit the activity through manipulation of the central nerve {i.e. 4}.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's anti-1 behaviour.

       a response I may get to this thread:

       "Shannon Green talks in circles like a crazy person."

       This would affect
       <strong>
        vocal-stimuli
       </strong>
       (the secondary stimuli to consciousness) of everyone who reads, causing them to read my words with a
       <em>

       </em>
       after-effect. The braver and intelligent, would bypass this effect.
