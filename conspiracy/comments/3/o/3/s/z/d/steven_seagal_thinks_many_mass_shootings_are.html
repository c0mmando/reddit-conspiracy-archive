    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I remember the CNN clip of an interview with Britney Spears in the early 00&#39;s that was played as nauseam by any and all who wanted to make a point that she was dumb. She was chewing gum through the interview too. She was asked what she thinks of George Bush or if it&#39;s right that the US is in Afghanistan or something along those lines. Her answer was basically (not the EXACT quote but definitely very close). </p>

<p>&quot;I think we should all just trust George Bush and trust that what he is doing is right&quot;. </p>

<p>Fast forward 10 years later, and that is the answer you would get with slight variations from most celebrities, and probably most people on the street. I think most people are terrified that they will be ridiculed or made to look stupid for questioning any official narrative. At the end of the day it&#39;s all about money and having an opinion on anything that matters can hurt their earning potential and very rarely will ever boost it now. </p>

<p>You&#39;re making emotional arguments, and they aren&#39;t convincing me.  I don&#39;t worry too much about labeling people as good or bad, I think their individual actions are more important than trying to define a person as if you had omniscient ability to look into their soul.</p>

<p>I understand that Mr.Seagal has worked with lots of different people including law enforcement.  He has stated that he feels that the spirit of the law is paramount to creating justice, and I very much endorse that philosophy.  Beyond that, I don&#39;t know the guy, he&#39;s a movie star from the 80s that a lot of people seem to love to hate.  But that&#39;s emotionalism, not logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So a mass shooting is a shooting in which 2 or more people are shot. Edit: Link is not specifically stating a mass shooting is 2 or more people. They call these &quot;incidents,&quot; but slide that into a mass shooting conversation. </p>

<p>Misleading, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<p>Also, they are tring to say there are more school shootings in the US than any other country. While this might be true, you have to look at this on a per capita basis, otherwise, you&#39;re deliberately trying to mislead people. They then deliberately mislead the audience by comparing Germany&#39;s 3 school shootings to the US&#39;s 55. Germany has 80 million people, the US has 320 million. </p>

<p>You might also be interested in this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_attacks_in_China_%282010%E2%80%9312%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_attacks_in_China_%282010%E2%80%9312%29</a></p>

<p>The media in the US is the primary cause for the number of mass killings, not the guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You won&#39;t get a sense of the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community by reading <em>these</em> comments. </p>

<p>Forget who Steven Seagal is. The actor. Activist. Whatever. Let&#39;s look at whether other people of relevance to the sub have come to the same conclusion. </p>

<p>Mae Brussell. Conspiracy researcher and radio host from the 1970s and 1980s. Concluded that Sirhan Sirhan, Charles Manson, David Berkowitz (Son of Sam), Mark Chapman (John Lennon&#39;s killer), John Hinkley (Ronald Reagan&#39;s would be assassin), et all were all Manchurian Candidates. That is, hypnotized and drugged with mind control techniques developed out of the US MK-ULTRA experiments to murder against their will. Also the Jim Jones &quot;Jonestown Massacre&quot; in Ghana as a CIA mind control experiment gone awry. </p>

<p>David McGowan wrote a book in 2004 called <em>Programmed to Kill</em> that explores many other serial killers and mass killings from the same perspective. It&#39;s not like Seagal came upon this idea entirely on his own. </p>

<p>I have a Youtube Playlist of material related to this. Interview with McGowan, BBC program about stage hypnotist Derren Brown exploring how to program an assassin, historical material on mind control, and a series about McGowan&#39;s book <em>Programmed to Kill</em>. There are also selected Mae Brussell radio programs from a Brussell archive. All related to this subject. </p>

<p>Go to town:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All these killings have in common one thing, 4chan:</p>

<p>&quot;4chan is all about mind control, the embryonic marginals of society become entrapped there, pupate and ultimately emerge as &quot;soldiers of 4chan,&quot; i.e. mind controlled psychotics; it works by the principle of reflexive (or mirror) mind control, whereby the subject subconsciously learns to brainwash himself (yes, it&#39;s almost always a &quot;he&quot;), by repetitive, ritualized interactions with images (usually shock pornography or graphic violence) coupled with absurdist/fascistic slogans resulting in acute adreno-dopaminergic arousal and addiction, followed by tolerance, to same; the ultimate consequence of which can be fruition and externalization of mind-controlled rage fantasies, which are themselves purely real-life replays of the selfsame encoded violence they had unguardedly and unawarely been surrendering themselves to over a period of months, in some cases even years, through the mechanism of 4chan&#39;s mind control image-centered gestational framework. In short, 4chan is a forge for violently active insanity.&quot;</p>

It doesn&#39;t help that he&#39;s pretty old and overweight now too. As far as I can tell it, he&#39;s a master of 90&#39;s movie martial arts, but that&#39;s about it.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue.

    <div class="md"><p>You must really have a hard on for Steven Seagal.firstly, I never said I&#39;d beat his ass, I think I&#39;d win in a mma match, but he&#39;d have to make weight in the first place, which he can&#39;t do. But who knows, maybe he would win, I think it would be fun to find out. 
Secondly, the guy is ancient and I&#39;m in the prime of my life. At his age, people in fight sports tend to get hurt. Especially if they&#39;re full of shit, which he is. 
Thirdly, I&#39;m the more experienced fighter. I&#39;ve trained under more styles for the purpose of mma fighting. He&#39;s trained in Aikido for the purpose of it sure looks cool in 90&#39;s movies. Once he is on the ground, it turns into a losing fight for him. </p>
