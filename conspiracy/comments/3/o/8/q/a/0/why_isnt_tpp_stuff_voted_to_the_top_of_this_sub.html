<p>Submissions seem to be dropping from the front page quicker with the new algorithm yet some submissions seem to defy the algorithm and stay much longer than expected.</p>

<p>New submissions seem to have more weight and displace submissions with much higher upvotes that have been on the front page for some period of time.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of odd things going on with how submissions are displayed.</p>

<p>A submission that hits the top slot hits the front page of all 340,000 subscribers. A submission that hits the front page of this sub will reach perhaps 500 people. The sidebar tells us how many people are here vs subscribers. </p>

<p>Edit: I would pay special attention to the top slot around 6-10 pm EST. That is when Reddit traffic peaks. If a TPP post hits the top slot at 3am, it doesn&#39;t really mean much. </p>

<p>Two, the major news outlets have done such a good job not telling us much about what has been released.</p>

<p>As a result, very few people have a clear understanding of the full implications of this deal or what actions could have been taken to stop or alter it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What are the serious issues?</p>

<p>• While the TPP has been kept secret from the public, large corporate interests have had a seat at the table throughout the process. These businesses have an obligation to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. This means that a great many of the deals that form the basis of the TPP have been negotiated with an eye to advantaging those businesses, potentially at the expense of the average citizen.</p>

<p>• &quot;Free trade&quot; as the TPP proposes is nothing new - globalization has already happened, and we are all the beneficiaries. What this deal will offer is not for the average citizen, who might see a few price differences on common products - it is for the large corporate interests who will have more freedom to move jobs and production to areas where it is cheaper to conduct business.</p>

<p>• There should be no such areas within the TPP zone, but part of the negotiation involves exceptions in place specifically to help these companies. The consistent standards that the TPP desires to set? Corporations would like to see those standards lowered - it is in their best interest to have access to a labor, property and capital market where they pay the least amount of money to conduct their business.</p>

<p>• Tariffs exist in part to protect domestic industry - jobs - from the vagaries of a global market. If cheaper US milk is sold in Canada, Canadian milk producers will have to choose whether to sell their own products more cheaply or else close down and go out of business. If it is not possible for these farmers to sell at a lower price and still remain profitable, then that choice is not a choice at all.</p>

<p>• The TPP&#39;s intellectual property provisions, which have been the subject of several leaks, are harsher than existing law, a product (again) of corporate involvement in the deal. They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harrassment.</p>

<p>• More damagingly, the TPP applies those laws to drugs with an eye to preventing cheaper medicine from being available on the market - products that by rights should be subject to competition as their prices are heavily inflated beyond the cost of production.</p>

<p>• The TPP will offer a method by which companies can attack laws that affect them, suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images, trying to protect the environment from dangerous industrial contaminants, or even refusing to pass laws removing or suppressing regulations where beneficial to corporate activity. These are all issues that already happen under various trade deals.</p>

<p>• We, the public, and our elected representatives will not have a great deal of time or means to push back against this trade deal if we dislike it. The text will only be released when absolutely necessary (a period of 60 days in the US) and steps have already been taken to ensure that elected officials cannot muck about with the deal. While this is logical (it would not be fair to negotiate terms and then change them back at home without discussing it), it does mean that instead of being able to debate and dissect we&#39;re committed to an all-or-nothing deal.</p>

<p>Tl;dr the TPP puts local industries at risk, threatens jobs, attacks your privacy, and you may be looking at paying more for important medications (either directly or through your government). It&#39;s being sold as lower prices and better standards across the board, but lower prices are meaningless by themselves - purchasing power is what you really want - and there is no guarantee that standards need to be raised instead of lowered.</p>

<p>Most of the points you mentioned are either over-exaggerated or are not true. The points also speak broadly without mentioning any specifics to back up the claims (for instace you say &quot; They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harassment.&quot; yet you have not listed a single component of the IP laws which are harsher or are open for abuse. </p>
