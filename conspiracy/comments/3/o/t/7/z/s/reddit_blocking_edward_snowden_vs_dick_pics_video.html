<p>Reddit is suppose to be about freely spreading information and keeping the important conversations going.</p>

<p>This is not only a hilarious interview by John Oliver, but it&#39;s also very informative and worth the 30 minute watch.</p>

<p>Supposed to be, maybe. But Reddit is a <em>Corporation</em>. This means that its first goal is <em>profits</em> - which supersede integrity.</p>

<p>You never know wjst you AREN&#39;T seeing on reddithese days.</p>

<p>Over 10 million people now rarely see stories outside the mai stream media post which were already controlled.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes..</p>

<p>Its horrible now.</p>

<p>And i rarely find anything interesting on reddit anymore except occasionalky inthe comments or in rlconspiracy.</p>

<p>Even r/technology and science limits posts now!</p>

<p>You cant even post in rlpolitics anymore unles you just want to promote some mainstream media outlet. All theold good outlets we used to get the real scoop from are banned. You cnat even highlight an i interesting portion of an article in the title anymore.</p>

Soon secret promotions of wanted stories weere put into place and secret elimination of stories that wereunwante were put into place.

<p>You never know what you AREN&#39;T seeing on reddit these days but most people still think it is the same old place. Thats thev alue to the owners. Controlling the information people see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I havent found one.</p>

<p>My problem with voat is it is repeating the mistake of having moderators and it is also subdivided into little groups.  Those werethe two major tools used by the new reddit owners to destroy the free flow of information on reddit.  I really dont want to spend a lot of energy building up more of the same. And apparently neither do others becuasethe new submissions over there have gotten very slow just like reddit.</p>

<p>When reddit was all r/reddit.com  you had 10 million people submitting stories of all kinds and shsring their knowledge. It was amazing. And it was like a continous flow of new stories with each refresh.</p>

<p>Now stories only come once every 3hours or something.</p>
