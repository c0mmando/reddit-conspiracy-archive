       Reddit is suppose to be about freely spreading information and keeping the important conversations going.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not only a hilarious interview by John Oliver, but it's also very informative and worth the 30 minute watch.

       Supposed to be, maybe. But Reddit is a
       <em>
        Corporation
       </em>
       . This means that its first goal is
       <em>
        profits
       </em>
       - which supersede integrity.

       Actually reddit was purchased to get control of the new widely read information outlet to control what was being discussed and who saw it sinceover 10 million peope weres suddenly for tje firdt time in their lives being directly exposed to direct unedited information that was affecting control of the elections and the legislative process. Those people werelearning they had more incommon than they thought and that established power structures wereusing them and trying to keep them ignorant and divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       This needed to be stopped so the8thlargest media family inthe world bought the renegade platform to bring it under control. One of the three founders aaron schwartz protested. He later famously died for his beleifs in open  information
      </p>
      <p>
       Afterthe purchase reddit was quickly subdivided into small subreddits whose readership in important political issues rarely crossed over to kepe the readers subdidvided as theyare by regular media, and moderators were quickly installed to start limiting what could be posted.  Soon secret promotions o wanted stories weereput into place and secret elimination of storiesthat wereunwante were put into place. Secret bannings of feequent posters or stories that werent wanted or people who attempted to get around the new censorship mechanisms were put into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       You never know wjst you AREN'T seeing on reddithese days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over 10 million people now rarely see stories outside the mai stream media post which were already controlled. Most alt outletsre banned and any cooperation between redditors to discover information is banned. All ama's which used to be a great source of insider secret information arenow just media controlled celebrities distractions and promotional material promoting the same braindead fodder the media always tries to distrsct you with.

       And i rarely find anything interesting on reddit anymore except occasionalky inthe comments or in rlconspiracy.

       Even r/technology and science limits posts now!
      </p>
      <p>
       You cant even post in rlpolitics anymore unles you just want to promote some mainstream media outlet. All theold good outlets we used to get the real scoop from are banned. You cnat even highlight an i interesting portion of an article in the title anymore.

       I havent found one.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem with voat is it is repeating the mistake of having moderators and it is also subdivided into little groups.  Those werethe two major tools used by the new reddit owners to destroy the free flow of information on reddit.  I really dont want to spend a lot of energy building up more of the same. And apparently neither do others becuasethe new submissions over there have gotten very slow just like reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       When reddit was all r/reddit.com  you had 10 million people submitting stories of all kinds and shsring their knowledge. It was amazing. And it was like a continous flow of new stories with each refresh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now stories only come once every 3hours or something.
