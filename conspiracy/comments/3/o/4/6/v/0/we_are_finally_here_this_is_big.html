       I have been following conspiracies, watching all the dates come and go and listening to all the talking heads just talk for YEARS! Fifteen to be exact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this Russia thing is finally something real! It is not a scare tactic date. It is not a report on the government knocking down your door. And it is not another story about aliens teaming up with the government to trade secret technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the first time that they are NOT in control of our minds!

       I've been studying conspiracy theories for 14 years 8 months to be exact (much longer if you include corporatocracy) and I have grown more than wary of 'this is it!' posts/articles/talks.

       Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Qatar, The UAE, Pakistan, Turkey and of course Israel will all remain Western aligned.  Egypt and Syria have gone back and forth or been on the fence since the beginning of the Cold War and were never of much geopolitical use to either side.  The leverage on oil supply, domination of OPEC and the Arab League and military power mean that even assuming the loss of Iraq's Western alignment (a real possibility at this point) the area will still in no way be Russian controlled; not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       The region's 4 most powerful militaries (Israel, Pakistan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia) will remain Western aligned as well as the region's 3 nuclear powers (Israel, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia).
      </p>

       The real threat to the dollar comes from East Asia, but we are buffered there in 2 respects.  1) If China were to begin ditching its Dollar reserves as an aggressive economic move against the US, their balance sheets would see a huge drop in real terms as their sales depressed the value of the Dollar and they saw lower and lower return on each dollar sale.  2) The other big holders of the Dollar, Taiwan and Japan, and to a lesser extent South Korea are all American allies and even if they did want to ditch their Dollars, the only reasonable replacement global reserve currency is the Yuan.  Japanese and Taiwanese relations with China are even worse than usual right now because of China's aggressive moves to gain territorial and thus sub-sea drilling rights in the South China Sea, making their buying up Yuan even less likely.

       Well, there's this old one about syria being the one where more and more nations jump in to join the war, once the US move in and it'll escalate but hey, it's not like anyone really cares if the others die. Or if the people there flood europe.

       It's weird, you know? I'm reading
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but it seems to me that people aren't aware that current happenings regarding Syria fit into one of the "better" conspiracy theories. It's as if people had no idea about the conspiracy theories that existed before literally everyone was able to spread his own.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ... a disclaimer, just to cover things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note that this is just a hobby of mine. "Conspiracy theories" are a fun sparetime of mine, because there's so many meta things to consider. It's nothing I can explain within a few minutes, my brain's just weird. I totally side with the intelligent and smart ones who realize that even most conspiracy theorists do not realize that they are still the mental slaves they believe not to be anymore. It's complicated. All about the ego, you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       I care more about experience and reality than about knowledge. I realise that it does not matter if fuel melts steel (don't get me wrong, ofc physics/chemistry matter), because it's besides the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't talked about this in years. It's really hard to talk with anyone (conspiracy-theorists or antis alike), because 99.9% are unable to keep their egos out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, with the disclaimer out of the way ...
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing with Syria was that there will be some shit (it's called War, but I think no one calls it that nowadays) going on down there and Russia will be involved. Putin actually hinted last year (iirc) that when the US touch Syria, it'll be WW3 all the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So eventually the US will actually engage in Syria and some leaders consider that a really bad move and so they jump in as well, because they don't want the US there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Syria is special for some reason. No idea why, only guesses not worth sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       So ... the narrative goes that the US gov will
       <strong>
        nuke
       </strong>
       manhattan, or let someone else do it, so they can go to war AND declare martial law in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a problem in my timeline.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people of the USA will start rioting when this happens. World Economy is going down as a consequence of the "terrorist attack" and people in Europe are (still, btw, as it is  now) being manipulated into ignoring what is actually happening right around them and even inside their own countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's still things missing. I'm waiting for an energy crisis to hit the world and I'm still waiting for the Internet to be killed off and turned into something else. Other things not worth mentioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably notice that I'm intermixing several "theories" into a timeline, but there's things I can be certain that they will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like governments not being happy with the internet and eventually regulating it into the ground or ruining the freedom of creativity. (TTIP etcetc)
      </p>
      <p>
       And I kid you not, I even consider words from a guy called "Alois Irlmair" who was an Austrian person who got mentioned in Spiegel (or was it Profil? Magazines with actual journalism). You can look him up yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key really is to keep ones ego out of this whole shit, which most "conspiracy theorists" don't manage just as much as all the assholes who couldn't think a conscious thought if it saved their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aaaanyhow, before I completely derail (I'm actually busy ...... haha you notice? xD).
      </p>
      <p>
       WW3 ends with a lot of people dieing, because for some reason there will be a gigantic, nuclear explosion under the earth somewhere in the range central to eastern europe, upwards to russia. It will be so gigantic, that it'll rip open earth itself and volcanoes will cause a darkening of the sky for three full days (you might have heard of the (several!) stories about "three days of darkness" ... the chinese have a variation as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the first day I will die.
      </p>
      <p>
       So will you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ha ... funny, isn't it? (:
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care about opinions, but if you know something that fits,
      </p>
      <p>
       or have a question, just go for it. :)

       I think nothing will come of it. The war has already happened and by the looks of it we lost. We are headed into decline it's over. No wars can amass the punishment that a decline in growth, fairness and most off all democracy could destroy any and all nations. This is it not it, it's past. What is it is what To do.

       It's great that there are people on this site that can see through the bullshit and do some research, but honestly, NATO has been saying "We're going to put pressure on Russia!" for a while now.  It's just them bluffing at this point I think.

         I'm not sure what you're saying here. Are you attaching some significance to the fact that the article called the Islamic State "IS" instead of "ISIS"?

       I still don't understand what you mean. By the words "They can't even mention the name ISIS any more" are you referring to the fact that the BBC didn't use the "ISIS" acronym in that article? If not, who do you mean by "they" and "can't even mention"?

       Your initial post is basically rambling, so you can't get too uppity about someone not immediately getting the point you're trying to make.
