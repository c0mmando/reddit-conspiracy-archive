       I realize this "theory" has been debunked too many times to count, but it's happened too many times to be a coincidence... always random products that I've literally spoken out loud about in the past 6 hours. I know nothing today is truly private, but this makes me uncomfortable.  I feel like I'm going crazy. Is there really something to this? If so, is there any way I can keep it from happening? I've even looked through Facebook's data policy to see if I could find anything, to no avail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please direct me to a more appropriate sub if necessary. I just thought maybe someone here would actually believe me and know if there's anything to this.

       They call it

      <p>
       Caveat: Facebook doesn't mention that they're grabbing voice, though, in their announcement to businesses, although the article asserts it. But I can't find any proof that Topic Data grabs voice as well as status updates/comments.

       On the latest versions of android, you can check what apps can do what to your phone (and block them if you want). For example, Google Play Services has requested access to my text messages 76000 times since June 10th (I blocked it from doing so as soon as I updated my phone). I don't know if they want my texts for ads or not, and it could also have been any number of other apps with access to it for no reason. Always check permissions when installing new apps (and check preinstalled ones too)
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what degree of app permissions other OSes give, but android is good for it (assuming it isn't lying, but I also use cyanogenmod instead of a stock android version)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: just checked the Facebook app on the store, and it requests access to your texts too

       I deleted my FB app about a year ago because the new permissions at that time gave it access to the microphone...  Well, that and FB flat out acknowledged that this is exactly what they were going to do.

       You aren't crazy. This method of advertised was
       <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/android-eavesdropping-patent-matches-ads-to-background-chatter-23219726/">
        patented in 2012
       </a>
       , so one could imagine it's in use, especially as California
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       outlawed it:

       Might be worth digging through privacy policies to see it - as it's got to be mentioned there. Also, I was digging around Nuance's web site awhile back and while they didn't explicitly state it, it felt like they were doing that. Basically, they can grab audio data, run a buffer, pick out words and match them. They're always listening anyway when you have voice-activated applications/systems, it's not a stretch to to pick out "Taco Bell" from the buffer from which you're looking for voice activated commands and feed the advertising data to the beast.

       Edit: Also, Facebook's Terms and Data policies are the absolute worst simplified, vague patronizing pap. Good lord.

       I mean... Not to be a giant dick or anything but if this makes you uncomfortable you might be in for quite a surprise... What you are describing don't even qualify as 'conspiracy' in comparason. That is unless you define 'conspiracy' as "piracy committed by state sanctioned cons." ('cons' as in 'should be' convicts)

       Don't that seem like some sort of criminal behavior someone should actually care about? weird.

       On the latest versions of android, you can check what apps can do what to your phone (and block them if you want). For example, Google Play Services has requested access to my text messages 76000 times since June 10th (I blocked it from doing so as soon as I updated my phone). I don't know if they want my texts for ads or not, and it could also have been any number of other apps with access to it for no reason. Always check permissions when installing new apps (and check preinstalled ones too)
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure what degree of app permissions other OSes give, but android is good for it (assuming it isn't lying, but I also use cyanogenmod instead of a stock android version)
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: just checked the Facebook app on the store, and it requests access to your texts too
