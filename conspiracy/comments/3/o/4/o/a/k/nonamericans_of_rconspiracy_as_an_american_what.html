    <div class="md"><p>Your country has one of the worst human-rights records in the world. From the genocide of Native Americans to the continuing institutional discrimination against blacks, your government (as a whole, not just the leadership) has been pretty consistent about mistreating a particular subset of the population for centuries now.</p>

<p>Your country is not especially &quot;free&quot;. The &quot;Liberty&quot; your government and media implore you to worship is... Exaggerated. A lot. You have a lot of dumb laws that imprison people for a stupidly long time. Those who can restrict your freedom (police) are protected if they do it without good cause.</p>

<p>Your government has not successfully &quot;freed&quot; or &quot;liberated&quot; any nation after WWII. They&#39;ve provided more military and financial support to dictatorships than democracies. They&#39;ve provided material assistance and training to governments committing horrific crimes against their own people. Your government has frequently and consistently used political and military pressure to support American corporations dispossessing and/or starving and/or poisoning and/or outright slaughtering innocent people all over the globe.</p>

<p>Your democracy is a sham. Thanks to gerrymandering, your vote is counted before you ever see the ballot. Your election oversight is, overall, sub-par, practically non-existent compared to most other established democracies. Your politicians are bought and paid for. All of them. They choose who pays them, but they&#39;re still bought. That&#39;s not normal, or okay.</p>

<p>Your UN delegation has vetoed several motions to hold your government accountable for it&#39;s actions in other countries, to which a vast majority of the other delegate nations have voted &quot;Yes&quot;. No other country with veto power has done this <em>nearly</em> as many times, including the Soviet Union. South American nations in particular have made undeniably valid, solidly proven claims, to no avail.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that they don&#39;t want you to know this, but your Nobel Peace Prize-holding president commands a fleet of flying assassin robots. I just feel that doesn&#39;t get mentioned enough.</p>

<p>Essentially, America is The Evil Empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A federal-centric education system. I&#39;ve never been in an American school, but I&#39;ve heard that flag-waving and patriotic songs are thoroughly drilled into kids&#39; heads. I doubt they teach American war crimes in their History classes. </p>

<p>The short-term memory and sensationalism of the American news media makes it harder to keep these things in the public attention, unless they can be made fun of in some way (think 9/11 conspiracies). People would rather hear about the bravery of Bruce Jenner than criticism of their oh-so-brave &quot;troops&quot;.</p>

<p>Truth is, you see this in most, if not all countries. Germans have made an active effort to erase Nazism from their conscious history by banning the swastika and such. Russia still denies crimes committed by the Soviet Union. France, the UK, Spain, etc. still prefer to pretend they did a good thing by invading the Americas and killing pretty much everyone there. Canada still does it&#39;s best to downplay the &quot;cultural integration programs&quot; that tortured Native and French children. China still talks about Mao as some great benefactor, even though he ordered the death and starvation of millions.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s just cause they&#39;re effective. There are some changes here and there and throughout history we&#39;ve seen variations on how to manage large groups of people but the US isn&#39;t doing anything that anyone else hasn&#39;t tried. WW2 was a major fluke for them. But I&#39;d say every other country on the planet wanted to take over the world, they just figured out how. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with almost all of that, one thing is worth noting.  Re: Native Americans.  Before large scale immigration and sizable military strength, settlers were more often the victim of Native American raids than vice versa.  Neither side acted honestly or honorably for the most part.  It was only with the introduction of lopsided military power that abuses became overwhelmingly committed by whites.</p>

<p>More importantly, the vast majority (well over 90%) of Native Americans who died during European colonization never saw a European but rather died from the Flu and Smallpox and such.  Much as Bubonic Plague had been endemic in parts of China for centuries (still is in some remote areas) by the time it devastated Europe, the population it was introduced to had no immune resistance either through a previous die-off leaving only those built to survive it, or through mechanisms like transmission of immune properties through breast milk.  This was accelerated by the British and later the US giving Natives Smallpox infected blankets, but it was pretty inevitable given basic biology.</p>

<p>The rest of what you state is pretty much spot on, but with the voting thing you don&#39;t mention that with the highly suspicious, non-transparent introduction of unexaminable, easily hackable electronic voting machines and the coinciding failure of exit polling Gerrymandering is hardly even necessary any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first genocidal wave in the Americas was accidental infection, yes, but that doesn&#39;t excuse (and even somehow worsens) the ensuing destruction by biological, conventional and social warfare (introducing strong alcohol, lopsided and trickery-based trade, etc.). </p>

<p>To imply that the defenders from an invasion were &quot;just as bad&quot; as the invaders is disingenuous, inappropriately apologetic. Whatever the initial balance of violence may have been, the invaders ultimately made active efforts to eradicate the defenders by whatever means. That&#39;s not an accident. That&#39;s not inevitable given basic biology. That&#39;s fucking horrific, is what it is.</p>

<p>To my knowledge, there aren&#39;t any proven cases of e-vote hacking yet, <em>probably</em> because of lax oversight. I seem to remember seeing something about a passionate guy trying to get people to look at his proof that fraud was committed, but it&#39;s a vague brainwave, I don&#39;t think it got much attention. Either way, I prefer to stick to verified fact. The fact is that nobody&#39;s really watching closely for that kind of cheating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yeah, except for the alcohol part that&#39;s totally true.  Either side will always abuse power and thus the stronger will inevitably be culpable for more.  I deplore Israeli policy towards Palestinians, but I don&#39;t delude myself that if the relevant factors were reversed the Palestinians would act any better.</p>

<p>As far as alcohol there is abundant evidence that it is quite similar to the pandemics.  Unlike Eurasian nations, Native Americans had zero experience with alcohol.  Europe, matched only by Russia had had thousands of years for alcohol to weed out many those who could not deal with it from the genetic pool, either by dying from overdose and health problems or by becoming such a sot that no one wanted to procreate with them.  Eurasia also evolved from beer and mead and such to wines and only later hard liquor whereas Native Americans were immediately presented with very hard liqur which predominated in frontier settings.  Sure plenty of Europeans sold liquor to natives, but I know of no cases where the motive was anything other than profit.</p>

<p>The colonists took up residence in unoccupied, largely un-hunted areas and built walled communities at the center of farm land and were all but unarmed with a few hunting rifles too slow to be very effective in combat.  This does not strike me as an invasion.  Native tribes would relatively regularly (hence the walls) raid these settlements, kill a few men, rape a few women andmake off with what they could carry.  I have read primary on secondary sources on this aplenty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the invaders ultimately made active efforts to eradicate the defenders by whatever means.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is simply not true, nor is it evidence that the natives would not have opted for extermination of Europeans had power positions been reversed.  The fact is that Europeans and then Americans wanted land and policy was largely indifferent to whether or not natives died.  If the policy were one of extermination, why bother setting up reservations on shitty land or kicking them off their land at all?  It would have been much simpler to just routinely massacre every native community which would have been in line with a policy of extermination.  The Trail of tears would&#39;ve just been one big mass grave before it started.  You are incorrect.  The indifference is pretty disgusting even if it is a pretty hard and fast rule until very recently in human affairs, but it was just that: indifference to the life or death of natives, not a desire to eradicate them, at least not by a greater portion of people than wanted them treated fairly and humanely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To my knowledge, there aren&#39;t any proven cases of e-vote hacking yet</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proven?   No.  Easily inferred with great certainty?  Yes.  Part of the reason it is unverifiable is that the code is private property and the owners won&#39;t let independent experts see it.  There are machines with USB ports which can have the totals changed with the insertion of the right stick, cases where election officials took machines home or to private warehouses overnight, machines that would show people having voted differently than they had on a confirmation screen and not change when the voter went back and reentered it, machines that print paper trail but print the wrong votes, so you have to verify every vote to be sure your votes were properly recorded (how many people are going to do that), machines that can go into an administrator mode just by pushing the right combination of tabs on the screen etc.  The head of the largest manufacturer (maybe 2nd now, there are really only two has been convicted of fraud and other white collar crimes.  Then there&#39;s the sudden and coinciding failure of exit polling which has always been the most accurate predictor of the ultimate results.  Germany routinely gets below 1% error, often 0.1%.  The U.S, has traditionally been well under 3% but with the introduction of e-voting machines we&#39;ve see 5, 6, 7 and in on case over 11% error for entire states.  In 2004 all  (I think) 6 states that deviated statistical impossibly from exit polls was a swing state and every one went to Bush.  Even discarding the swing state part, the odds that all the aberrant results would go to Bush are 1 in 64 (if it was actually 6, double the 64 for each state more than 6) or 1 in 32 that either one of the 2 would get all (?) 6.  In one case during the &#39;08 Democratic primaries where in I think South Carolina (not sure) Clinton and Obama&#39;s vote totals were more or less precisely inverse of exit polls (i.e. they just recorded the votes as being for the other candidate.  The same happened with Ron Paul where exit pols consistently showed him in the first through third spots bbut his votes were switched with another candidate&#39;s.  That&#39;s why, even if by the time of the primaries Sanders appears to have the numbers to beat Clinton, we&#39;ll have anomalous results in enough state that he won&#39;t.  Verification is an impossibility, but this is more than enough evidence for me.  Check out blackboxvoting.org.  Bev Harris has been tackling this since the beginning.</p>

<p>&quot;The people who cast the votes decide nothing, the people who count the votes decide everything.&quot;</p>
