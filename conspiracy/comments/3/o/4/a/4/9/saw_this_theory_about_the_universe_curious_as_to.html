       I saw this on a friend of a friend's Facebook page. I'm curious as to whether this is a commonly considered theory, and if there are many others that contemplate it. I've never heard this one before, and it seems quite absurd and impossible to me, but I'd like to know a bit more about the theory itself and if anyone else has considered such?

       The post was accompanied by a picture of a statue that is apparently at the Vatican.

       Friend's friend said:
"The firmament actually encompasses the universe. It is exactly the opposite of what we have been fed. It is not infinite. The Earth is concave, not convex. There is a type of glass at 100km, then inner space, then the celestial sphere in the center that contains the Source. All things emanate from this central location. We do not spin, we are stationary. The sphere in the center rotates, and contains the sun, moon and all stars. We are essentially in a pressurized container. Obviously much more to it, but... This statue is an actual representation of the real universe, of which we have been lied to about. Not to mention the trillions of dollars that have been stolen from citizens for a bogus "space program", but the implications of this are astronomical..."

       Are you asking if "hollow earth theory" is a conspiracy theory? If so, an emphatic yes..

      <p>
       You recall Stephen Hawking's recent comments that black holes do not exist, they have to release the energy they collect eventually, and the coining of the term "grey holes"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there's another guy who says everything that exists is, in a way, a small black/grey hole -- each atom, exerting a pull, the Universal forces and constants

      <p>
       What is life? It consumes. Food, water, gases, sunlight, ... information.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the meaning or purpose of life? To spread the information/sentience "infection" through as much matter as possible -- process the matter through its matrix. A worm turning a dead leaf to dirt? A sentient species learning to capture solar/stellar energy, or even static or magnetic or nuclear energy, to power ships and tools in order to terraform a promising new planet...
      </p>
      <p>
       A person's deepest thoughts influencing the other information-life-matrixes around them, building a collective perceived reality... Each action of our bodies bringing that reality into the physical plane..

       That's just MY personal conspiracy, mind.

       I have heard of the hollow earth theory, but I never read anything on it, so I wasn't aware that that's what this was (if I'm understanding your statement correctly). Thanks for the input. I'll look it up some more and see what it's all about. I'm piqued, but only in theory.
      </p>

       I can easily agree and with everything you've said, I hadn't thought of it alongside grey/black holes though, so thank you for the new food for thought.

       No, I said Hollow/Concave/Flat Earth Theory (all different flavors of the same thing) was a conspiracy, and then explained another one, my own personal one, which I think is far more plausible and exciting to think about. Let's not go back to the whole Dark Ages model of the Universe thing, there's a reason they're called DARK and it's because they were NOT ILLUMINATED. The Greeks knew the Earth was not the center of the Universe, they knew the circumference of the SPHERICAL Earth. There is nothing to be gained and everything to be lost in the Earth-centric model

       Where does his idea of everything, including the earth, being encompassed in a sphere or whatnot come into the hollow earth theory? Or is that a separate thing entirely? Sorry if I'm not grasping everything here, I actually find this rather confusing due to physics and space travel, among other things.

       This is very interesting, but I'm having a difficult time picturing this, can one of our Reddit friends with some art skillz maybe draw something up and post? I'm not sure what theory this is referring to so can't exactly google it.

       Basically the theory is that earth is concave and that the universe (space) is within the bowl that is concave earth. First- to understand this you need to understand what concave means.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read here to understand the theory.

       The phoe of two halves of Keppler’s concave Earth model was pretty interesting, so basically we're in the earth is inside a sphere and the Universe is the center of the sphere??? Is that it?

       Yes, basically what you think of as space, is just the cent of this sphere. Or maybe a better way of looking at it is like the earth is a bowl, and space the soup. I linked a website in this thread that explains it (and experiments done that suggest it may be true) pretty well. Another user provided even more links.

       Its an interesting idea. I remember seeing a video where some ex airforce and ex(submarine guys?) discussed flat earth ideas. The sub expert explained that throughout his many years he never accounted for earth curvature, and that no sub operator does- same for pilots. This doesnt make sense if the earth is truly as round as they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting point was discussed about how the space stations oxygen use and things related of that nature, would work just like a submarine. But a problem was, how is the space station being cleared of pressure and re-filled with oxygen to keep the guys up there walking around in khakis alive? Where is this oxygen coming from? Are they secretly sending tons of oxygen and equipment up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could remember the video because I cant explain much going off of memory, but there are a lot of un explainable things about the space station and how those people are living up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like something is definitely wrong with the info we are given about space but nobody seems to notice or discuss it. Like its hidden in plain sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did we go to the moon? Absolutely yes, and to say otherwise is foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are people in space now? Absolutely yes, and to say otherwise is foolish.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the problem isnt wether we wentthere, but how are we staying up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe getting to space isnt as hard as we are let on. Maybe space isnt what we think it is. And somehow, people are in a space station, sipping coffee in khakis and polo shirts, just enjoying life, walking around in this starwars like space vehicle, when all logic says they shouldnt be and couldnt be.
      </p>
      <p>
       People needd to start questioning the space station. So many things dont make sense. Question the nature of your reality. Maybe space is just as simple as "jumping up there".

       Whats up there. Whos up there...

       I'm having trouble too. Especially with breaking down the different lines of thought involved here ranging from apparently the earth is hollow to we are encapsulated in a pressurized sphere that contains everything to the physics of that to our "fake" space programs...

       Your friend is describing "Concave Earth Theory".  "Hollow Earth Theory" is different and usually refers to a globe with an opening at one or more of the poles that leads to a hollow interior.  In general this theory is far less promoted than flat earth, but may be more complete.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it true?  I don't know.  Theories about the shape of the world can be a touchy subject here.  For many people considering the possibility of a lie this big is too much.  For the model to work light is required to bend in a specific way (explanation can be found at wildheretic link below).  In any discussion about the shape of the earth it is important to separate disproving the official spinning globe model from proving any other specific model.  Finding a hole in this model does not excuse the problems with the official spinning globe model and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Cellular Cosmology" (
       <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/cc/index.htm">
        http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/cc/index.htm
       </a>
       ) by Cyrus Teed in 1922 lays down much of the foundation for this theory.  Teed along with Ulysses Grant Morrow performed the rectilineator experiment (a mechanical apparatus on a very long beach) to demonstrate that the earth is not convex or flat, but in fact concave.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested in more information on this theory, this site has a good intro with discussion of evidence:

      </p>
      <p>
       One of the current main proponents of this theory is Stephen Christopher.  (forum:

       Thank you for all the info!!! I really appreciate it. While I don't personally see merit in his opinion or even necessarily in that theory, I am interested in reading more about it to see what makes people consider it. Like I said, I'd always written off the hollow earth stuff before I even read about it, so I wasn't totally sure what the title was for what he was discussing.

       This subject can be a difficult one to wrap your mind around.  The thoughts of most people new to theories about the shape of the earth immediately go to "this is impossible, too many people would need to be in on it" or "the shape of the earth was settled hundred of years ago, all those people can't be wrong."  If you approach it from that angle it seems like it should be dismissed quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another approach however:
       <br/>
       -There is tight control of who has access to information about "space".  Most information comes to us through agencies like NASA and, historically, royal societies.  Disturbingly most people get most of their information on the topic from TV or movies.  The history of NASA is something that everyone should look at (this is an interesting read:
       <a href="http://www.themoderngnostic.com/?page_id=52011">
        http://www.themoderngnostic.com/?page_id=52011
       </a>
       ).  Next critically examine the material they put out (why Apollo moonlandings are bs:
       <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html">
        http://davesweb.cnchost.com/Apollo1.html
       </a>
       ).  Some of the stuff they have been putting out lately is so fake looking it appears they are trying to get caught:
       <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/08/05/dscovr_moon_transits_earth.html">
        http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/08/05/dscovr_moon_transits_earth.html
       </a>
       So what are they hiding?  Is there a vacuum up there at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       -There are a large number of problems with our official cosmology (distance that objects can be seen over water is a simple one.)
      </p>
      <p>
       -There is evidence for glass in the sky.  This is an interesting video:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TEEWxqzx3M">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TEEWxqzx3M
       </a>
       Also Libyan desert glass.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more to say on this, it is a huge topic.

       I think one of the biggest problems with the experiments in the Wild Heretic link is of how old and primitive they are. The margin of error due to the imperfections in the testing apparatuses alone are enough to render any conclusion inconclusive. I mean, the Earth is calculated to be concave (physically impossible), with a radius of only 4,000 miles (also physically impossible). But somehow light bends only near the surface of the Earth (like a mirage), but I can't see the surface bending up when using a telescope. It's a weird physics-breaking and non-observable hypothesis that hasn't really panned out over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's definitely fun to think about, though! It's pretty fun to propose these hypotheses (concave Earth, flat Earth) to students and have them debunk them using only high school physics and math.

       By all means document this and prove the concave earth theory wrong. It seems to have not been done yet. If all of these students are "debunking" it lets see!
