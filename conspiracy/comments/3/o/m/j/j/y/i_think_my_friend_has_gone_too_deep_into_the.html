        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One of my best friends has recently become, well maybe conspiracy theorist isn&#39;t the right word, but maybe a doomsday-ist... he believes the world is going to end soon.  </p>

<p>He was one of the people who thought the world was going to end on September 23rd, 2015 and when October 1st rolled around I told him we survived and he told me something about the Julian calendar actually having the right date (though that has passe too). But he actually believes it&#39;s the start of the end, not that everything would just <em>end</em>.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s turned his life over to God and he&#39;s very religious, but it doesn&#39;t seem like a positive thing, because I just saw him recently and he looks awful- he&#39;s super skinny and his eyes are shot and he&#39;s chain smoking and you can just hear the worry and stress in his voice.  </p>

<p>He say&#39;s he feels like if he were from the future and he came back to tell us of this event that was going to happen and no one believes him, like say he&#39;s from 2001 and he goes back to 1995 and tells us about the WTC or something. I can obviously imagine how that would make a person feel, to believe something, to know something as an absolute certainty and for no one else to believe you.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s basically refuted all modern science- that climate change isn&#39;t real (not that it&#39;s real but maybe we&#39;re closer to Hell because we&#39;re so sinful) that the Earth isn&#39;t round, that there were never any dinosaurs, etc.<br/>
He&#39;s pretty adamant about the Old Testament and he doesn&#39;t believe in gay marriage and he thinks all of the &quot;progress&quot; we&#39;ve made as humans is actually Satan deceiving us from God.  </p>

<p>He thinks Obama and the current Pope are going to be the last president and the last pope and he thinks Obama is going to ban guns and that a major catastrophe is going to usher in the NWO, that the powers that be are going to control everything like air and water and the roadways and people will have to conform in order to survive.  </p>

<p>His big belief is that all if this is happening, and we&#39;re also being bombarded with alien culture (&quot;ancient aliens&quot;, water on mars, etc), because Satan is going to come to Earth and he&#39;ll appear as an &quot;alien&quot; and we&#39;ll accept that because we&#39;re so inclined to believe in aliens and if you don&#39;t accept it as happening or accept whatever they&#39;re imposing then you will be beheaded (like how Christians were beheaded in the Old Days, or so he says, I&#39;ve never read the Bible) and that coincides with the head transplant in 2016 and it will make it easier to persuade people to condemn Christians that don&#39;t conform to the &quot;aliens&quot; ideas or existence, and they&#39;ll be beheaded.  </p>

<p>And he&#39;s gone on about what&#39;s going on in Syria with ISIS and the US and Russia and Isreal and Zionists and nuclear weapons and I mean, it&#39;s as if everything in the world is a conspiracy theory or connected or something.  </p>

<p>He&#39;s just always going on about so much and honestly, he&#39;s made me reconsider everything- because all science is essentially a theory- sure gravity is a theory, but even if it&#39;s not correct or it turns out to be something else, we&#39;re still <em>here</em>- I can&#39;t see that drastically changing my life. Maybe dinosaurs aren&#39;t real- I&#39;ve never dug up a fossil or seen the Earth from outer space or been to Antartica (the edge of the world according to him) but I also don&#39;t really think about this the same way he does- I frequent this sub alot, just to keep up with what&#39;s going on in the world, to balance out my news sources and learn other&#39;s opinions.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m skeptical bout 9/11 and the moon landing and this whole thing going on in Syria, so I&#39;m not new to this idea, but I feel like he&#39;s onto a whole other can of worms.  </p>

<p>So I guess, aside from him making me reconsider the things he believes (which is a good thing, I think) I&#39;m also wondering if I should even be worried- he&#39;s not really hurting anyone, but I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy, he&#39;s always upset and he isolates himself and is always on the internet, he has no friends or relationships and his financial situation isn&#39;t really good. I just want my friend back that I can hangout and play games with and just talk to. I can&#39;t remember the last time we had a conversation that didn&#39;t involve <em>this</em>.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how to reason with him, or if I even should or if any of it matters, because what if he <em>is</em> right, you know. Maybe he&#39;s crazy, I don&#39;t know, but I feel like there&#39;s a way to believe what he believes and have a &quot;normal&quot; life- one with relationships and hobbies and goals and art and pizza- I don&#39;t think the two are inseparable, but this is just consuming his life.<br/>
There are alot of things I do agree on with him, like how people are kind of blind- we&#39;re so wrapped up in ourselves and our smart-phones that it&#39;s becoming a really dangerous thing in society and I think there&#39;s alot more going on in the world, with society and nature in general that we&#39;re not paying attention to and it&#39;s becoming unhealthy as well.</p>

<p>And if all of this is happening, why does it matter? The world is constantly ending, we&#39;re heading towards entropy at all moments- and maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s worried about a terrible thing happening and people like me not going to Heaven, I don&#39;t know, because he&#39;s pretty incoherent about it, but I mean, I don&#39;t think you can have a &quot;good&quot; life if you&#39;re constantly worried about the end.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, I guess I&#39;m just looking for some input because I don&#39;t know how to deal with it.  I&#39;m not sure if I should suggest therapy or a mental health solution, or if this will just play out on it&#39;s own, or if this is life being itself and I should just let it be.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> My friend has become consumed with biblical prophecies and the doomsday and I think it&#39;s unhealthy and I don&#39;t know how to deal with it. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>EDIT: I just want to add some stuff... he&#39;s been convinced someone was out to get him- he found a white chalk-mark on his door or by his apartment or something and he ran off for a while. He&#39;s convinced someone slashed his tire, and while it did look like a cut- I think it&#39;s coincidental. He&#39;s stockpiling food and rations, and he has a crossbow.<br/>
I know he used to smoke alot of pot- I think that made him paranoid. I&#39;m not sure if he still does  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not really sure what he&#39;s worried about honestly- because it comes off more or less about being spiritual- like a natural disaster or government take-over only affects us physically and what he&#39;s most worried about is our spirit Every time I tried to talk to him he just has no interest for what anyone is saying- only getting his viewpoint out and then when he gets too far into it he says &quot;there&#39;s just so much, you don&#39;t even know, there&#39;s just so much&quot;. So if you try to say something he just rebukes what you say and backs it up with a quote from the bible or some video he watched online.<br/>
He just wants us to believe what he believes, it feels like, but I feel like even if I did he wouldn&#39;t be satisfied either, because when I say I believe him, he says that I only believe in the <em>possibility</em> and not that I actually <em>believe</em>, which is true, I guess, but I also don&#39;t believe in everything being a conspiracy.<br/>
I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most problematic thing here is: &quot;he&#39;s not really hurting anyone, but I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s healthy, he&#39;s always upset and he isolates himself and is always on the internet, he has no friends or relationships and his financial situation isn&#39;t really good.&quot;  No matter how the world really is, we all still have to live in it.  </p>

<p>When people are initially learning about conspiracy theories their world view can change multiple times very quickly which is quite stressful.  After some more experience (watching multiple doomsdays come and go), you realize that doom is unlikely to be imminent.  TPTB move slowly, socially engineering each generation to accept the new normal.  If I were you I would try to help your friend through this process by discussing controlled opposition with him.  The Alex Jones style doomsday fear mongering is part of the control strategy through fear and confusion.</p>

<p>Ask him to review the things he knows, consider the sources and see if he might be buying into elements of controlled opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, enough. Your friend is having a psychotic break with reality and needs serious help. I don&#39;t care what you believe about psychiatrists pouring mind countrolling drugs into our oat meal and sending brain controlling waves that special hats can repel. </p>

<p>Your friend needs help. Serious, psychological help. He&#39;s experiencing what seems to be a schizophrenic break with reality, which can be caused by external trauma (eg: putting so much stock into the world ending, and then waking up the next day when everything seems fine to everyone else). </p>

<p>If you genuinly care about this person, please contact their family and let them know what is going on. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy issue, this is a mental health issue. </p>

<p>Go, do it now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His situation sounds kinda like me when I first started doing research into conspiracy theory. So much evidence that is so contrarian to what the general public believes that is awkwardly dismissed while you know for sure. You think the whole world&#39;s gone mad and you&#39;re the only sane one alive. </p>

<p>So you want to tell people about it, especially those you care about. Because you know staying in the dark will end up hurting them. I guess I still do that, just not in real life anymore. I became a lot more moderate in my beliefs. You&#39;re buddy seemed to have shifted from being interested to being engulfed and if you&#39;re not careful you find yourself overloaded with ideas. I guess it takes time to balance this out again.</p>

<p>You obviously care about him seeing the huge story you wrote. And him constantly going on about this stuff to you seems to suggest he cares about you as well. My advice would be to just hear out what he has to say and try to reason with him in an as little narrow minded way as possible which seems to be no problem for you. </p>

<p>Anyway since I can relate to your friend I think you have to give it time. Don&#39;t assume he&#39;s becoming crazy, I think he&#39;s having a shift in perception that his mind is having trouble with. But I do feel it&#39;s good to be &quot;reasonable&quot; for him since he&#39;s obviously having trouble with that. </p>

<p>Good luck man, I sincerely hope your buddy can crawl out of this. But I have no reason to assume he won&#39;t.</p>

I doubt your friends crazy just having a hard time sorting out what is good evidence and what is planted evidence to make his fear grow. there is a lot of planted doomsday stuff. but learning the history of how many times it looked like the world was about to end might help him get some perspective. I would not call him crazy, i doubt he is. I think he just needs some help sorting through information and suggestion. </p>

There will also be accidental changes through medication and the use of  various means connected with livestock supplements </p>

<p>There will be increases in sociopaths and psychopaths who control everything  while others become more rare just through self defense. There will be more constraint of movement and actions. There will be more outright slavery and spying of an even more intrusive nature.</p>

<p>All of this will happen even sooner than you think.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty depressing. Humanity is a failed experiment because we let greed get control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your friend has an obsession and this happens to a lot of people who find something new and then really get into it by putting a lot of their time and effort into it.  Sports and other hobbies do this to a lot of people.</p>

<p>You mentioned that your friend looked all skinny and sickly looking and this isn&#39;t good.  He may not be hurting people around him but he&#39;d definitely hurting himself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these obsessions are something that a person needs to grow out of and some people grow out of it faster than others.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve been friends for a while, what I might suggest is to find something to do with your friend that you guys use to enjoy back in the day together to try and get your friend&#39;s mind off his doomsday outlook.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really sad that there is only one post on this board that mentions schizophrenia and it&#39;s nowhere near the top.  This is pretty clearly the case here and it needs to be managed, certainly by regular counseling and if that alone fails, then I hate to say it, then by meds.  It will grow progressively worse and there is a significant chance he could become a danger to himself or others and very little chance of him living a happy, productive life without mental help.</p>

<p>Also, I seriously doubt the pot smoking has anything to do with this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think <em>if</em> he is schizophrenic or has some mental/emotional problem that pot could exacerbate it?<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean that I thought pot was the source of his change in mental state, but I don&#39;t think you can rule out it maybe feeding his paranoia.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be hard to talk to him about this though, because he&#39;s very insistent on not being &quot;crazy&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, you said &quot;used to&quot;.  If he is still smoking it, that probably isn&#39;t a good idea until he talks with a clinical psychologist who specializes in abnormal psychology who will probably tell him not to.  I don&#39;t however, think it contributed significantly to his becoming this way based on evidence from non-biased studies.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s anxious or depressed or has other neuroses that don&#39;t really constitute what most people think of as &quot;crazy&quot; you could urge him to see someone for those reasons and maybe they&#39;d see fit eventually to discretely refer him to someone who handles more extreme disorders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like your friend. Why don&#39;t you get a pair and hear him out on some of his thoughts? Sounds like you really got it together big guy, coming down from your throne to pull your buddy back up from koo-koo land. </p>

<p>How about entertain the idea that he is onto something, and some of his ideas are blatantly wrong but he is nonetheless onto something.</p>

<p>How about you go listen to some Corbett Report and see if you really are aware of what is going on in the world. Your friend would really appreciate not being treated like a complete outcast because his friend couldn&#39;t wrap his head around some basic albeit fucked up truths about our reality.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so sick and tired of pretending like people like you are in any way fit to manage people like us. Some of us here are stressed, anxious, nervous, etc not because we have some fucking mental disorder but because we have stared into the fire and it fucking burned. It burned and it changed how we feel and experience the world around us. Unwashed pansies like yourself see us and feel like you have something to offer us, but our anxiety comes from the realization that we are in a minority of awakened, and you, the unwashed masses of absolute unabashed daywalking zombies will inevitably REact to whatever calamity happens (as opposed to taking some proactive measures, working together, identifying sociopaths, helping out one another, etc) and we will literally be swallowed by your ignorance, forever, and that will be game over humanity.</p>

<p>The stakes are what makes us anxious. I feel what your friend feels and I feel it daily. I have taken positive measures so it doesn&#39;t eat me up. I try to remind myself it&#39;s my duty to help anyone who wants help, and I owe nothing to those who willfully stay ignorant to the truth. I wish your friend best of luck, I hope he finds us here (and at voat.co, among other online outlets... twitter is another great community) and most of all, I hope he cuts out losers like you who only wish to recondition him into this gross pathetic culture you call reality. Good luck, godspeed. (lowercase g, he&#39;s wrong about all the biblical shiet.)</p>
