       Does anyone else think that this will become a front for a series of mass voter fraud across the United States of America?

      <p>
       Just think, with everyone registered to vote, but a low voter turn out, coupled with a growing electronic voting system market could lead to corporations adjusting who voted for whom by adding in votes from people who declined to vote.

       There is no good reason to have electronic voting, or certainly no reason good enough to outweigh the huge risk of fraud inherent in such a system. The paper ballot system is infinitely superior - it can be scrutinised throughout the voting, counting and tallying process by accredited observers from all political parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US system of commercial "proprietary software" which means election officials aren't even able to open voting machines, let alone analyse the software or the results, is a huge red flag know the system is rigged. How could Congress even agree to such a system...(rhetorical question)?

       When did voting matter? At the end of the day it is based on your electorals (assuming we're talking about presidents here). Also, all of the candidates are just tools for someone with greater power. They are powerless and just have strings behind them regardless of their political background.

       Well, as we head toward the 2016 Presidential election cycle, California is clearly engaging in election fraud. They've been giving drivers licenses to foreign nationals in the country illegally [people who Constitutionally can't vote]. And then they're rolling out plans to "automatically" register people to vote through the Department of Motor Vehicles lists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article entitled "More Than Half of New CA Driver’s Licenses Go to Illegal Immigrants":
       <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/07/18/more-than-half-of-new-ca-drivers-licenses-go-to-illegal-immigrants/">
        http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/07/18/more-than-half-of-new-ca-drivers-licenses-go-to-illegal-immigrants/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       For naive people who think that illegal immigrants aren't being mobilized to fraudulently vote (and swing close elections), see here:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILJDudUpct0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILJDudUpct0
       </a>
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: What California's Democratic party is doing is creating plausible deniability. "Oops! We sent out letters to all people with drivers licenses, telling them that they were eligible to vote? Why, we didn't mean to send these letters to foreign nationals in the country illegally. Ooopsies! We totally didn't mean to give them ID and letters that they could present to election boards, making it seem like they're eligible. Total accident! Crazy oversight!" It's blatant fraud, and abuse of bureaucracy. . . . . What they're doing is the latest iteration of the old "having dead people from the local cemetery show up and vote in elections" scam. And it's a reaction to the Republican "vote-cage" method of disenfranchisement. Because make no mistake: The Republicans are crooked, too. Their methodology consisted of scouring the voter rolls for "African-American-sounding names". Say, "Tyrone Jackson". They'd use national databases to find a felon named Tyrone Jackson and pretend to confuse him with a "Tyrone Jackson" in a totally different place. Regardless of the fact that the two men had different social security numbers, different ages and different middle names. "Tyrone D. Jackson, aged 43, is a criminal in Utah? That means that Tyrone A. Jackson in Florida, aged 22, can't vote!" They'd pretend that it was due to a "clerical oversight". But by the time the innocent man got it straightened out, the election was over. . . . So both parties are engaging in illegal activities, vis-a-vis elections. One side is trying to scrub the voter rolls of eligible voters, while the other side is trying to counteract it by extending voting privileges to foreign nationals in the US illegally. Both are un-Constitutional. For a great website to track this stuff, go to

       Voting. When the slaves get to choose their masters. That's not the joke. That was the old joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real joke is that the ones pre-chosen are the only options you get to choose from. Of the three hundred million  folks here in the U.S., somehow and by mysterious magical means, 'the best' few are the only options. What an amazing coincidence, suckers.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the joke, and the joke is on us. We slaves get to choose the next master, but only from those already approved - by THEIR masters. Hahahaha!
      </p>

       Vote damn you. Vote!
