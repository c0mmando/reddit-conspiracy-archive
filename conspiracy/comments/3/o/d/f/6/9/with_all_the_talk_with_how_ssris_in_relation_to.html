       With SSRI'S going under the scope finally with all the shootings what about all the Police shootings or violence resulting in death?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't SSRI'S brought up or at least explored when seeing the violent  decision making displayed time and time again?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they not do mental backgrounds and drug testing for all drugs? The reason I say they don't is I know personally three people hired with prior and current SSRI'S and two were previous military with paper work easy to see.

        Mostly a myth; testosterone (including injections) can increase impulsivity in some but this does not appear to be reliable (does not affect every person tested), impulsivityÂ mightlead to aggression but this is drawing at straws now with the connections

       I think a problem might be the type of person who becomes a cop and uses steroids is also the kind of person who is a dick. But I've also trained bjj with cops on steroids who were pretty cool guys.

       I truly believe you are on the right track here. Why didn't they do a tox on Darren Wilson? That "he looked like a demon" comment was almost a dead giveaway...and remember Officer McBarrelRoll from McKinney who manhandled the young girl in the bikini? He'd witnessed two suicide scenes the night before - what are the odds he doubled up on his meds to deal with it and his batshit reaction the next day was a part of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't they do toxes on ALL of them? And forbid anyone with a gun to take anything like Chantix...Especially given the fact that domestic issues are really, really common among law enforcement, too. It could save lives and promote peace.

       Not every depression diagnosis can easily be solved with non-drug treatments. There are solutions but after a certain point for some people, there's a unconscious chemical imbalance in your brain and you can only fix it with a drug.

       Because if they did toxes on all of them they would be forced to admit the very probable truth of what you're saying here.  What percentage of "mass shooters" were on some type of prescription drug?  I don't know the actual numbers but I also don't really know of any who weren't or who weren't suspected of being on them.  Even if you believe in coincidences, at what point does the available evidence become too much to ignore?

       I think the whole cop/violence thing is due to multiple factors.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Increased media coverage
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Everyone has a cellphone cam these days
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Steroids (and whatever other drugs)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ex-military becoming cops
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Media influence (movies and TV shows showing violent cops as heroes)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       There are probably a bunch of other contributing factors too.

       Actually, I'm not so sure about ex-military, more like non-military wanting to be military. A lot of the folks I know coming out of the military see what police are doing and the first thing out of their mouths is, "We'd be court-martialed for that, what the hell?"
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing you missed is training and groupthink/propaganda - there are private companies training these police officers to react this way, and there's a culture of fear - a lot of "you could be next! just get home alive, derka derka!" email forwards that go around departments. Not to mention the free trips to Israel.

       There's a spectrum of personalities in the enlisted military. Some just want to do their job, go home, and live a normal life going to school or working. Others want to continue the military life so they become police because that's pretty much what they did in Iraq daily. They carry over the mentality of fighting the insurgents to the job of policing a community of civilians. They distance themselves from the civilians because in their mind, they above them, they are the authority. Some become police because they actually want to help their communities, these are the good ones.

       Ex or current military (reserves) can be a problem.  I mean, military are trained to kill people and enemies of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Battlestar Galactica had a good quote.  Something along the lines of when you try to make a military a police force, they inherently turn the people into the enemy.  They aren't trained to protect generally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a hard thing to train out of someone.  All of us who joined post 9/11 joined knowing we would go to war.  We volunteered to do that crazy shit.  Over the next 15 years you're going to start seeing those young officers come to power.  I was part of first graduating cadet class who joined up as soon as we were eligible.  Right now I have 10 years in.  When my peers hit 20 to 25 years you're going to see us start to run the military completely.  No more 80s/90s guys who joined up when there wasn't a war going on.  I digress.  But you're going to see some interesting innovation come from my generation when the old guys keep retiring.

       SSRI = Ego booster, i.e improves confidence.

       It's not an ego booster. It's a drug that stabilises the Serotonin in your head if you either produce too much or too little. The outcome [and this is important] is feeling NORMAL, not high or in any way on drugs.
Having said that, I know from personal experience that there is a window of absolute craziness before the levels are stabilised, this can be up to a month or two.
In that adjustment time you can find yourself doing absolutely mad stuff. As an example, my husband walked out with a monitor at college [long tome ago], he brought it home and said: "I have no idea why I did this", and we brought it back straight away.

       So with police in mind, the crazy behaviour would only be temporarily if SSRIs were involved, hence I have to assume that the majority of violent cops are on steroids rather than SSRIs.
