       I'm referring to things like interpreting
       <strong>
        body language
       </strong>
       (e.g., "Look at Cheney's posture in that 9/11 photo, it's way too relaxed, thus he clearly orchestrated the whole thing!"), reading into
       <strong>
        facial expressions
       </strong>
       (e.g., "Look at that wink Albert Thomas gave LBJ; why would he do that if it weren't for LBJ's involvement in the assassination?!"), and drawing conclusions from
       <strong>
        vocal tones
       </strong>
       (e.g., "Those callers from Flight 11 didn't
       <em>
        sound like
       </em>
       they were being hijacked; obviously they were crisis actors!").
      </p>
      <p>
       To the people who post and up-vote these types of submissions every single week: Why do you do it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe that you can read minds via your observations, and that your "reading" actually counts as definitive proof? Here's a reality check: It counts for nothing. Language - spoken or motioned - is symbolic, constantly changing, and it's arbitrary; local to geography, age, upbringing, and countless other variables. To come here and act like you, whoever you are, wherever you're from, can see through all these layers and essentially
       <em>
        read minds
       </em>
       is to peddle pseudoscience and degrade this community. Please stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you do it because you are desperate to find an answer? Well, aren't we all? But we won't find anything while wasting time to project our mind onto single, contextually-ambiguous images or minute-long video clips. Instead, we must look to the incredible resources available and which we're lucky enough to have access to in 2015: leaked documents, investigative reports, interviews of event witnesses, power-player memoirs and declassified old documents. Please start.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been fun reading your single-minded, vitriolic replies. Though this crowd is admirably focused on the debate of body language itself, and quite poetic in its insults of me, I'm sad to see that the central issue - you know, the whole drawing conclusions about the secret nature of global events based on how a few images or recordings made you feel - hasn't materialized anywhere in your replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, good luck:

       Non verbal communication is not pseudoscience just because you do not believe or understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       NLP or neuro linguistic programming isn't just about Tony Robbins self help shit it is a widely practiced and effective tool for psychologists in media, advertising, and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       With video the observer has the advantage of slow motion and pause functions allowing a greater analytic ability to discern non verbal cues. This means you don't have to be an expert to spot what you call "pseudoscience" you just need an understanding of what to look for and time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck you and your high horse OP, any and every tool is necessary to an individual when gauging truthfulness and believability of a source.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a shit poster posting shit posts and maybe we need to talk about that instead of your ignorant ass opined bullshit...

       I think that's OP's point: isn't this understanding often self-proclaimed and not really substantiated by anything? I understand that there's a lot of information in body language but how do you actually

       Oh man I totally agree!  So many people don't know much of anything about real science.  Like, there was this one OP I was looking at recently.  It was just absolutely, laughably horrible.  The OP was making all kinds of assumptions about what they thought real science was about when all they were doing was showing how little they knew about the true expanse of the world and existence in general.  It was like listening to a third grader who just learned how to add talk haughtily about "all he knew" about the world.  lol.  Shit was funny (in a sad kind of way).  Sometimes a little bit of knowledge can do a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of harm if it's had by someone who doesn't know how to deal with it.

       From the Wikipedia article on Diane Downs:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Investigators and hospital workers became suspicious because they decided her manner was too calm for a person who had experienced such a traumatic event. She also made a number of statements that both police and hospital workers considered highly inappropriate.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Damn those investigators and hospital workers! Imagine! They actually trusted their instincts and decided she was lying! Today they'd probably just say something like, "People just experience trauma differently, don't ya know. Just because someone is totally calm after having had their car car-jacked and their kids  shot, doesn't mean shit. They're just experiencing their trauma differently. Nothing suspicious here!"
      </p>

       Seriously, thanks for  drawing my attention to this fucked up Diane Downs story. It's a TIL for me too.

       Are you saying that from watching this interview with her that you would still think she wasn't lying and was merely suffering from trauma in her own way? By smiling when recalling the death of her children? Including the link to the video, which is a few seconds, just in case you missed it.

       I was standing in my kitchen, listening to the radio when this

       alert came on. Just the intonation of this mothers voice told me she was lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was living in the South and we had a soccer tournament and we gathered around in the parking lot for lodging details and one of the parents reminded everybody to be on the lookout for this car... I'm a loud ass Westerner and popped off that the mother drowned her kids and made the whole story up. Sadly, I was right.

       I went to school for human services, and one of the things we were taught was how to read body language when dealing with clients.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are taught that people lie, and their body language might prove it. We deal with cases where children's safety is at risk. It's not exactly pseudoscience. Head to the social work department of your local research university, and ask them about body language and deception.

       Did they teach you to draw conclusions based solely on this? Or to investigate further and find supporting evidence, then draw a conclusion? Seems like OP is referring specifically to people who are drawing conclusions based only on the unconscious cues.

       A lot of the time, we lack the resources to investigate for supporting evidence. Doing such, would be "crossing ethical boundaries," with our clients. A lot of calls are made solely through intuition, and our supervisor's experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Dealing with clients can be exceptionally difficult, because if you probe too much, you might lose them. They aren't required to speak to us, so it takes a lot of wordplay and observation, to sometimes get someone to start telling the truth. Usually patience.

      </p>

       Basically you can use that intuition to investigate something further but you need that person to speak up before you can take actual action? For example, you think a kid is being abused so you can offer more resources to them, but you can't actually remove them from custody without some form of proof such as the kid saying they're abused?

       I have seen children be pulled, and families destroyed, based upon just statements. By other workers and supervisors. If a supervisor has enough 'pull' in the criminal justice and judicial system, they will take the word of that supervisor, over any actual physical evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a lot of politics, and building up a reputation of proving your intuition is right, after a pull, and during the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: A rookie social worker on their first case, is probably going to be observing the environment for evidence of drug use, over the interviewing technique. Veteran social workers develop a complex where a mix of burnout and their own confirmation bias gets in the way.

       That sounds pretty messed up, if there is potential to ruin a family's lives they should need more than just their intuition. I've read stories on other subs (maybe this one too) about cps doing things like that.

       While body language itself isn't a giveaway about a person's intent, it does show emotional state of that person.  If a person is acting in ways makes him appear nervous, I might start to check the person's facts much more.  Humans have a hard time lying to other humans, and when we do, there are small indicators that you can pick up on.  Even the best liars have body language that can give them away.  This is why poker is so popular and portrayed as a rich man's sport.  It's more of an exercise than it is a game.

       So inference, a cornerstone of piecing together conspiracy theories or any theory for that matter (hint: this is a sub for such things.) is to be completely disregarded why? Because you can't
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       emotional state?

       This is solipsism 101. Nothing can ever be known for sure. There is no truth. Blah blah blah.

       Israel Profiles Hard. They claim a huge success rate. They utilize body language, vocal and datum...

       Not sure how you shrug as if you proved your point at all.

       No. I did not click on your Interactive Feature. Doubt few if any in here did so, and would caution others to NOPE!

       btw got 8/10 on that quiz despite some of the students were obviously super aware of their body language which probably funked with my accuracy. The squirrelyness of those students made it harder to guess.

       I feel like pseudoscience and conspiracy theories (or r/conspiracy) go hand-in-hand. Just look at all the topic discussed here (anti-vaccine views, "chemtrails", flat Earth, nanothermite, space travel) that fall apart under any scientific scrutiny, but that never go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a small study done here awhile ago that checked what subs a lot of the users here also commented in. There weren't very many scientific ones, so we can conclude that science is not a strong suit of the user base here, and that pseudoscience will be preferable in discussion.

       Are you saying that from watching this interview with her that you would still think she wasn't lying and was merely suffering from trauma in her own way? By smiling when recalling the death of her children? Including the link to the video, which is a few seconds, just in case you missed it.
