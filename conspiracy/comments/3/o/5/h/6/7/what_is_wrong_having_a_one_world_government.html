    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, the problem starts when this white supremacist propaganda started when Obama was elected. Before that, everything seemed to be peachy! </p>

<p>Even the 9/11 truthers didn&#39;t speak out on it as much. Now they try to group all goverment together as if our newer, more reasonable goverment is apart of that problem. It is not, they also try to call these people &quot;puppets&quot; when it is the pure will to change the world that moves their actions.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been into conspiracies a long time, sometimes longer than I care to admit and through it all I&#39;ve learned that there are two forces, one that has conquered the lands from the Middle East before that, Europe,before that America, before that Spain, before that the Afrikas. If one will simply look to history and realize who it is that claims to be Jews but are not, one will begin to see a pattern within these horrible conflicts. This is not to say the race of people is bad but rather there is a handful within the race that wish to dominate minorities world wide by decentralization and divide and conquer tatics. </p>

<p>The other a now more powerful group using human emotional logic as a means to win over public opinion and through changing the mind they have won the war or at least get to control it through analytical means. There is no way the old can win over this group, they are to diverse, all of them come from similar paths but their races are different. Through this blending of ideas,diversity,kindness and human ethics, they have won over the public.</p>

<p>Irregardless, the one world goverment will be formed under equality, this way nobody feels they will be on top except for the elite at the top, which has always been so. By using logic, than it would be only pure hatred and insanity to continue such futile attempts to stop it but the people trying to stop something as grand as the one world goverment are in fact <strong>insane</strong> look at people like Alex Jones.</p>

<p>As a man once said, &quot;that ship has already sailed&quot;, with love they could have had it all but they used evil and hatred as their force and now, they must witness the greatest checkmate of them all, love is funny like that.</p>

<p>I browse <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to simply correct information that is wrong and spread the love and awareness that yes, the world is changing but if you have only pessimistic values to share you will never see the other perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but you said some things that strike me as odd...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Saddam Husein wasn&#39;t hung by his people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope he was hung by Bush and his alliance to the British Royal crown as with most the south and people who are republican, even if they don&#39;t know that&#39;s where the republican parties roots lie.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Muammar Gaddafi wasn&#39;t slaughtered in the street by his people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope, he was also killed by the same group after exposing them! The same group that decentralizes their group and use false terms like &quot;Jew&quot; to relate words to what we know. Thus, conspiracy is ended up being spearheaded by the same Ashkenazi Jews (white Germans) blaming Sephardic Jews (the original Jews) who have not only suffered from the holocaust but previous expansion of white supremacy during world history and still till this day the same can be said with ALL minorities.</p>

<p>This is also why he reintroduced the protocols of Zionism and showed it again to the to remind them. This pissed the white supremacy power structure off which ultimately led to his death. His plan was to reunite Africa with a new currency the Dinar. The dragon bit back and led to his death.</p>

<p>When Hitler showed the book, he didn&#39;t tell which Jews he was talking about. This leading to his followers encouraging the slaughter and mistreatment of Sephardics. it wasn&#39;t until you look at the people (features) from areas like Poland do you understand the true nature and purpose for Hitler, to expand white supremacy at any means necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They do not give a fucking shit about you, me or tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What about a large portion of the conspiracy content that is pushed under a white supremacist agenda? Do they care about you? I don&#39;t think so, they are just pulling random souls to get angry and form hatred.</p>

<p>Think about this, we all know our goverment is at least 10 years ahead of the population, with that just that information alone, I don&#39;t think guns alone could be able to stop some form a corrupt bad goverment, <strong>therefore the only people that can actually save us the people, would come from within the goverment.</strong> It&#39;s best to start watching the world a little more open! We must use our vote to change the world, do not let these crazy people tell you your vote doesn&#39;t matter, it matters more than anything right now!</p>

<p>Now, use more logic, if you look back 10 years, does it seem like the world was better or worse? In my opinion, we have moved FORWARD as a race since the last 10 years. Things that politicians and companies used to get away with seem to be on the front page time and time again. We don&#39;t notice this because people are fueled by hatred and rash thought rather than looking at the good things that have been accomplished.</p>

<p>Do you know why the push happened? Why conspiracy wasn&#39;t on mainstream before? Because there is a system, on it&#39;s last legs, attempting to fight what the people have already spoken for. The one world goverment will bring PEACE to the world, whether its out sense of peace or our future generations doesn&#39;t matter. We as humans must begin to think for the future and stop LIVING in the now. We may not get to see it but to know that we participated in the forming of world wide peace... It&#39;s something grand...</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is start looking at conspiracy with both perspectives, introduce critical thinking into your critical thinking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One world goverment constitutes from many... It&#39;s not ONE person, rather a multi racial group of leaders from all over the world.</p>

<p>We cannot live peacefully because of the system (referred to as Zionism(fake),beast system,white supremacy) is absolute. Therefore, if gaps are not enclosed and another system is not in place, it will always find it&#39;s way back into the world like a weed sprouting in a garden. We can see how it&#39;s impossible for people to live in peace and harmony when there will always (at least for the last 6000 years) be this system trying to divide and conquer the world. </p>

<p>It isn&#39;t possible to have peace with one another when so many feel wrong, what must happen is, the wrongs must be undone and healed fully, no more bandages, so the world may forget. That is what the UN is doing by spreading people of all colors everywhere.</p>

<p>With the way they are setting up things right now, everyone will be watched including goverment officials. This leaves a huge leap of faith in the plan that everyone will participate in this as global surveillance. Public Opinion of all people will judged much like how China is planning. There goverment officials will not be exempt from this either. Much like how we are getting our officers police body cams. In 5 years it will be 100% harder to commit a crime than it already it is, which is already hard. Everyone will watch everyone basically in like some of those future movies. Crime rates are down globally everywhere and experts don&#39;t even know why... It&#39;s because of the cellphones,drones,cameras people are recording footage constantly.</p>

<p>Again, it might seem odd for a lot of people that live in this time but our future generations will not know the ways of the old so we guide them with a hand hoping to change the world for the better.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you meant by this statement. But if you meant that somehow it was Jews that did this you&#39;d be 50% correct. The Jews you speak of are <strong>White German Jews</strong> known as Ashkenazi&#39;s (fake) who adopted the religion after coming from the mountains in Russia. They go by other names as well, the first being the Khazars and modern time Rothschild&#39;s. These people are behind most of the evil in the world. Many scholars know it but still write tall tales. <strong>The house of Rothschilds</strong> controls the queen, UK&#39;s money and EVEN the Federal Reserve. Which is why both Lincoln and JFK have all been murdered. All moves on white supremacy are guided by these men and these men alone. Even the queen must bow to him when she walks into the the city of London.</p>

<p>Go google who wrote the Balfour Declaration and read who the lead Germans (British Empire) reneged on France in order to setup camp over in the middle east to do nothing more than expand white supremacy globally by moving Ashkenazi Jews with Sephardic (Semitic Jews) and giving the Nazi Jews the power. Thus spawning the lie that Jews and Muslims hate each other when it&#39;s really Jews and Muslims are being attacked by fake Jews who are of German Descent.</p>

<p>Context: Again this is not say all people who are white are bad, I am here to give the other perspective, only research can you begin to see that most of the information here is tainted with the same drivel that you must avoid. I love you regardless, I am only here to save those who are willing to listen to the other side. Just have love in your heart and you will be safe. I am trying to work on my own hate, I try to do something diverse as possible every chance I get now, you should go out of your way to do the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ideal UNLESS the powers controlling it are bad and don&#39;t have the best welfare and interest of the population in mind and heart.  And guess what?  TPTB <em>don&#39;t</em>.</p>

<p>Giving one world government power to the megalomaniacs that are already currently running the planet to the ground would give them even more power than they already have, and the world citizenry would be even <em>worse</em> off than we currently are.</p>

<p>THAT&#39;S what&#39; wrong with having a one world government.</p>

<p>It&#39;s be <em>great</em> if TPTB were awesome and benevolent and cool and were working for the planet and everyone else on it.</p>

<p>But they&#39;re not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing, people just had a taste of evil for so long they don&#39;t understand how a new better world can be formed if we all work together. Most of them hold on to the ideologies of evil people and work but openly say they hate it at the same time.</p>

<p>A very confused public is what we have, no doubt from the same people who work with these evil entities I.E people like Alex Jones or anyone who subliminally perpetuates white supremacy (Zionism) over equality.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m downvoted, for 6000 years they have ruled the world and now it&#39;s time for someone else to try, if they want to kamikaze because they can&#39;t be top dog anymore that&#39;s fine it will only make things worse. A one world goverment is the most reasonable idea out of all this chaos.</p>
