       That goes both ways.  Conservatives love to bash college students as being liberal brainwashed elitists.  I mean.. even this thread is: "aren't people who go to college really just fuckin retards for not realizing they are wasting their money and enslaving themselves?"  This isn't a new idea.  This is a common criticism of college and college students/graduates.

       Bit of a hasty generalization you're coming to.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's not a strong correlation between high school drop-outs and Republicans, in fact they are more likely to vote Democratic. Also, people can be "conservative" and "liberal", I defiantly am, split down the middle on many issues. Only on the post-graduate level is there a strong link with progressivism.
      </p>
      <p>
       All comments like yours do is further the divide. Brand conservatives as backwoods uneducated racist, sister-fuckers, and people with college degrees as liberal elitists? LOL nah. Go visit Vanderbilt, Texas A&amp;M, or even ASU.

       I'm talking about people like Rick Santorum who said the President wanting people to go to college makes him a snob and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly and Ann Coulter who consistently bring up college to talk about how it's a bastion of liberal elitist zombies.  You don't ever see a Democrat in office saying "College is full of brain-dead elitists!"  You can hear Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity say that shit anytime they talk about college.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea where you are getting this high school drop out shit from?  I never said anything about high school or a correlation between actual intelligence and ideology.  I just said that Conservatives constantly criticize colleges for being "liberal brainwashing echo-chambers" and college students for being "elitists."

       It's kind of ironic you mention O'Reilly, since he is highly educated, with an MA from Boston, MPA from Harvard.

       No worries and yeah...That is fairly common with these people who criticize universities.  Ann Coulter went to Cornell, University of Michigan and University of Michigan Law School.  Santorum said Obama is a "snob" for wanting all kids to have the chance to be able to afford a college education and he went to Penn State and Dickinson Law School.

       No OP, but there are many. Learning a skilled trade, such as welding, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, etc. There's a huge demand and can't be outsourced, pay is very good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's community college. Plenty of 2 year degrees offered there with high paying employment opportunities such as dental assistant, radiology, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll get downvoted for this, but there's also the military. Air Force and Navy, lots of technical and computer related jobs that will lead to good civilian employment, and you get college paid for. It is what you make of it, and not for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: IT, product development, jobs. Learn to read code. Companies couldn't give a fuck in this field, for the most part. If you can read code, and can prove yourself during an interview, you can easily get hired in this field, and earn six figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, working the oil pipelines doesn't require any kind of degree, and pays a SHIT ton. Texas, North Dakota, Wyoming, Western Montana are all the hotspots. I have a buddy that got his CDL and went to Odessa Texas with 0 experience, and made over 100k in a year. Very hard work, but they'll take anyone with a pulse.

       I've never heard of them testing after they hired. I'm sure some of the elite/specialized ones would, but I've heard meth usage is rampant in the fields, especially the ones that live there in the makeshift camps/housing.

       You could also leave the country....if you're from US, you'd actually be pretty amazed how valued just being from the states is in certain other countries, and also how far your small savings will go in some places. I think a while ago I read NZ was recruiting Americans for hospitality aggressively....you could get your TEFL cert. and go command a decent wage teaching English somewhere. Union-busting paramilitary death-squad leaders are in high-demand all over these days too.

       But doing that pretty much requires a college degree. There's no "easy" way.

       My sister did go to Czech Republic to get her teaching certification after college, and teaches English to South America.

       That's news to me, but cool. My sister said that some of the lower tier Asian schools didn't require degrees. She also said a shit a ton of people lied or had fake degrees lol.

       That's key. Ain't nobody gonna look up if you really graduated from University of Whateverthefuck. Also, I did private classes....they pay MUCH better than schools. Go around to corporate offices and just have chill little convos with rich people in that country who usually already speak english and just want to practice. I made $75 (US) per hr. for a single student....up to $200/hr if it was a group class. Again, people who did the same thing did NOT have college degrees.

       You can teach yourself programming from scratch &amp; be employable for a Jr. Dev position within 2-3 years max, even sooner if you work harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Salaries are very reasonable too. Even lower-end jobs like frontend webdev can start around 40k-50k/yr with benefits. Higher-end like Python/Ruby/Java can easily clear six figures in certain places like the Bay Area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trades are another route, but not everyone wants to work with their hands as an electrician or a plumber. But writing code can be just as much of a trade if you're willing to teach yourself and keep learning on the job.

       Believe it or not a resume/CV is not as important as proving that you can do the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of bulking a CV/resume I'd suggest just making stuff. Build webapps, plugins, frameworks, libraries, put stuff on GitHub. Use GitHub as a portfolio to showcase what you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many programming/dev job requirements now follow suit with what you'd expect of a designer or concept artist: age &amp; experience don't matter as much as what you can do right now. Obviously experience helps. But if you have no previous work history you can still land a job if you're capable, trustworthy, and a cordial human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       An employer just wants to hire someone they know can perform the task without having to worry. Prove that you can write code with real examples and don't worry as much about the CV.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as where to learn, you first need to decide what you want to learn. Do you want to make websites? Mobile apps? Desktop software?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a fairly in-depth subject so check out subs like
       <a href="/r/learnprogramming">

       Then maybe you need to try asking around more? Because it's definitely possible.

      <p>
       Recently there was
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/3iyd98/cool_interview_with_steven_foote_a_selftaught/">
        a full interview
       </a>
       in
       <a href="/r/webdev">
        /r/webdev
       </a>
       with a guy who self-taught himself programming &amp; now works as a Sr. Dev at LinkedIn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started HTML/CSS/JS/PHP at age 18 and have followed the webdev industry for 6-7 years now. Nobody cares how you learned what you know, they just care that you know it. Luck is a factor and of course a CS degree doesn't hurt, but is it possible to make this your career without a degree? Myself &amp; many others would say 'yes'.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're skeptical then make a post in a programming/webdev subreddit asking for opinions. Although I think if you search you'll find this question has been asked many times:

       Portfolios of past work are better than resumes in some cases.  I'd certainly rather see someone's art/photography/website/design/articles as a sample of work before hiring. Unfortunately I only hire accountants, and excel skills and accounting knowledge are hard to fake.  Marketing degree types in business school used to put together portfolios of their work.

       Despite how much the government and lenders have debased and inflated the cost of college, I don't think it's fair to compare to slavery. You have a choice where to work, or to work at all, or to leave, etc.

       While I have serious problems with the student debt going on in this country (I have a decent amount myself) , there are plenty of people who are better off in life doing something they enjoy/are good at. Even with my debt, I'm in a position where I am pocketing more money than I would be able to make without an education. And yes, don't get me started on the quality of US education it can be horrendous. Some people really need to do their homework before deciding if they want to go through college, like not taking out debt that will take 10 years of their income from their new job to pay back. As fucked up as the situation is, people need to realize that every diploma that someone earns doesn't magically create a new job they can walk into. There are a lot of qualified people looking for jobs, no one is going to give you anything just because you have a piece of paper. That said, I do really feel for people that were uniformed/had no guidance going into this debt trap, but you have to look at it as a serious investment into your life, not an 'experience' with a huge price tag you can just 'pay back later'.

But don't sit your on ass and play games or watch youtube all day and expect your life to get any better. If you want to make a difference or have a life that you find worth living, do something -  no I don't want to sit with you until 3 in the morning talking about how capitalism is ruining the world, or the food that I eat (and you eat) is filled with poison or how 911...chem trails....fema camps... technology is ruining man and creating a worse world.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you consider yourself more free than me, but all you can talk about is the horrors that go on in the world and how you hate it here, go move on, find a community that lives off the land, be free and yourself.
      </p>

       Oh ya, it's easier for you to ask me for money or for me to buy you your Bolthouse drinks and living in a community like that may require you to actually work hard for your food.

       Nobody is forcing you to work somewhere that requires a particular college degree. Did you have any useful skills upon graduating high school? No? Why not? You're literally an adult, yet you have no ability to survive on your own, and you expect others to the foot the bill for another 4-8 years of full time education you so that you can eventually work in some particular degreed capacity? And you don't expect to have to pay those years back somehow? Is a mammoth sense of entitlement the only thing 18 years of Western life has taught you?

       <p>
        The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by the character Emmanuel Goldstein, is the fictional book that is used as a thematic and plot element in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), by George Orwell. According to Orwell's plot, in the totalitarian society of Oceania, ruled by the seemingly omnipotent, omniscient Party, Emmanuel Goldstein (in the Party's propaganda) is the principal enemy of the state – a former member of the Inner Party – continually conspiring against the leadership of Big Brother. Early in the story, the protagonist thinks to himself: "There were ... whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as The Book".

       Yet less than a few decades ago you could support a family, have a house and cars working at a gas station or whatever. The US still developed, people still went to college and our economy boomed because everyone could be on their own two feet and contribute. Sorry you feel serfdom is deserved amongst the people these days, but the fact remains with automation the 40-60-80 hour work week should be dead, and college heavily subsidized for those that want to pursue real degrees.

       I certainly don't know of anyone who supported a whole family along with a mortgage and cars on a single income as gas station attendant, but let me ask you why we should incentivize the reproduction and family obligations of men whose only station in life is gasoline-attending in the first place? Should such men be starting families at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to take it as an article of faith that someone should be able to subsidize a whole family by "working at a gas station or whatever." Why? Have you considered that maybe we should not incentivize the proliferation of the least productive, most needy members and classes of society?

       Even though what I'm going to say is a bit all encompassing and too general, the sentiment remains the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been saying for years that what is the point to going to college nowadays? Any bump in salary is cancelled out partially if not completely by the loan payments you will be making for decades after.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even beginning to discuss the question of what is the point of PAYING to become more indoctrinated and brainwashed by the same system that's destroying the earth? So many articles lately talking about this or that college now censoring or removing things from the curriculum. College isn't meant to create a free thinking person to better the world. It's just another stage of the indoctrination at this point.

       Not only that, but  our whole system of education is designed to weaken free will and independent thought. Its a creation of the masons based on the cult of Saturn designed to turn people into slaves of a system that cannot do without. College trains people to think in terms of selfishness and exploitation and ultimately its a diversionary tool that divides people based on schools of thought.

       Like all things of this nature, there is no proof only speculation. But if you look further into it you can draw your own conclusions.

       Anything more believable though? I'm not saying you're wrong...I'm just saying...I'm intrigued.

       There is a lot of information out their on the cult of saturn, do a google search. Michael Tsarion and Jordan Maxwell both talk a lot about this subject. The level of believe-ability might be due to our current level of condoning. Our society uses propaganda to force us to think in certain ways that is very far from independent thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest problem is our current level of conditioning. Your own mind is going to stop you from looking at this stuff seriously. So it's going to be very hard to talk about this subject because we are using words that are already corrupted. The term belief is one of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I prefer awareness or intuition. So when I look at this information I have an intuiting sense that its true, based on byproducts of these particular systems of control. If a thing is producing and negative outcome, their are reasons behind it. When you look at the core of it you can discover the information yourself, but you have to unlearn what you have learned to get there because our foundation of knowledge is based on deceit. I would start with the hypothetical question. What if everything you have learned is a lie or deceiption to keep you in check and make you into something exploitable? Ask that question and see what you can find. That is the only way I am getting myself out of the mass deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you have to do is discover the truth for yourself, because nobody is more qualified for that then you are. When you want someone to prove to you if something is either right or wrong, you are not taking responsibility for proving it to yourself.  That's another control mechanism designed to prevent critical thinking. Your basically taking on someone else's thought system by allowing them to prove it, and if you believe it, it becomes reality for you without any real thought on your part.

       Paying for a college you cant afford is like paying for a car or a house you cant afford. Go to school in your price range folks. Go to community college or don't go to college at all if you cant afford it. Instead, make as much money as possible to be able to send your kids if you have or are gonna have any. Unless you really enjoy the field you want to go for and money isn't an issue.

       I'm not excusing my country's insane college prices, just a little tip.

       It's kind of ironic you mention O'Reilly, since he is highly educated, with an MA from Boston, MPA from Harvard.

       It really pisses me off when such smart people say such stupid shit. They are just pandering to their lowest-denominator when they say that stuff.
