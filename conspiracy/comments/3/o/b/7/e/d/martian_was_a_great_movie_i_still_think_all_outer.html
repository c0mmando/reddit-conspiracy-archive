       The easy part about space is the posts and questions raised here are so simple. Moon shadows, flag movement, visibility of stars, whether or not the earth is flat or if going to space is possible - These topics really don't take much research at all. In fact, most of the topics posted here can be answered by just going outside.

       Do not poison the well, with lumping together fringe things with legit. Have you ever been to space? FE is bullshit, but NASA losing/over writing all the original video is real.

       Face it, you've never been to space, and most likely will never go. So, you cannot be 100% sure of the shit you are spouting.

       Now answer the question. Are you in the USAF? I'm a US citizen, and I'm asking you. If you are, remember your oath and answer accordingly.

       Everything posted here about space/moon is the same old rehash of points I described in the next sentence, the shadows, flag movement etc.

       Once you remember the basics it's just a matter of possessing a memory - Because posts here about space are just that, 'basic'.

       That "you've never been to space and will probably never go" argument is stupid.  That would be like me saying "you've never been to Antarctica and you'll probably never go so you can't be 100% sure that it even exits."  Most thinking people will tell you they aren't 100% sure of anything regardless of how certain they feel.

       Yup. I have no idea of what that place is. Just like I have no idea what Pennsylvania looks like, until I saw it for my own eyes. Relatives grew up there and described it, with bias and imagination. When I visited it, it was nothing of their stories. I perceived it how I saw it. Shitty, red neck, and lonesome, with some beauty. They described it so much different. Your mind is a funny thing, seeing is believing/perceiving....

       But surely you believed that Pennsylvania existed and was full of people.  You simply hadn't been there yourself.  The question is do you limit what you believe to only things you personally have been able to do or seen yourself?  In other words, if you don't personally get on a space ship and fly to the moon you'll never believe anybody has?  There is no level of evidence that could convince you outside of a personal experience?  That's like believing that every time you cover your eyes with your hands the world literally stops existing.

       No I don't lack philosophy but some questions aren't philosophical.  If I ask you if Antarctica exists I don't care about what it means to you.. I'm asking does the physical land of Antarctica geographically reside on the Earth?  Anybody can do the "what does existence truly mean" horse shit.  There is objective reality that is independent of your imagination.  That is what I'm talking about.  If you want to go into a Philosophy 101 class your kinds of answers will be a hit.  I'm talking about Geography 101.  There isn't an overlap.

       It's not about me being daft.  I am making a point.  You are willing to believe that Antarctica exists and that people have been there even though you personally haven't been there.  Sure if you go there you might decide it's colder than you expected or whatever but you still believe that people have been there even though the only evidence you have of that is pictures from government funded excursions.  This is the same exact level of evidence that we have for the moon landing but you summarily dismiss that evidence as bunk and say the moon landing never happened.  By this standard you should also be saying that nobody has ever been to Antarctica either.

       And no.  I'm not any military.  "think before answering."  What the fuck is that supposed to mean?  Are you going to uncover a conspiracy right here where I'm lying about it?  And I don't know rockran outside of seeing him post on this thread... but I'm not surprised that yet another conspiracy has arisen in the comment sections of the conspiracy sub.

       You know a lot more about what?  Apparently you thought you knew I was in the Air Force and you were wrong about that.  You also seem to think that I know rockran and I don't so you are wrong about that... so I reckon you have other things you think you know that you are wrong about also.  People who never admit they are wrong always think they know more than everyone.

       He's not mad at you, he's just looking for approval and someone to agree with him. Maybe there is a touchy spot for the airforce (his dad or brother could have been killed or not around etc) .

       A lot of people are wondering if Antarctica is what we think it is. - Specifically people are wondering if Instead of it being a large solid mass of ice - it may be the outer rim of flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       nobody has ever physically traversed Antarctica, all mapping of it is based on the assumption it is continual ice throughout - but because nobody has physically crossed it by plane or on the surface - technically exactly what it is - is "unproven".

       Relatively speaking it isn't "a lot" of people who are wondering that.  It is a very very very small percentage of the population that thinks the shape of the Earth is not yet settled.  Is it daytime where you are and night time somewhere else right now?  Won't have that with a flat earth.

       There are billions of people on the planet and a lot of people viewing those videos are viewing them to have a laugh.  I have watched plenty of flat earth videos.  I think they are funny.  Not to mention that a lot of those views could be repeat views by the same people.  If you want to prove the earth is curved on your own go buy a weather balloon and put a camera on it and send it up to take pictures.  It will get high enough that with a good camera you will see the curvature of the earth.  You don't need to rely on NASA or say "that's a fish eye lens!" on other peoples videos.  You can do this yourself.  Or you can go look at the stars in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the stars in the Northern Hemisphere.  They aren't the same.  You wouldn't have that with a flat earth either.

       If you've really looked into flat earth theory you would know that day and night is one of the first things explained, so given your previous statement, and from what you are saying here too about curvature and stars -  I can tell you have not looked into the reasoning for flat earth theory and you do not have even a cursory understanding of why A LOT of people are sincerely interested and further investigating the theory.

       No I have and it was all bullshit.  It's super religious people who believe that God made Earth the center of the universe and in the Bible they talk about "corners of the earth" and that can't be possible if the earth was a globe so some Bible literalists reintroduced the flat earth idea in spite of mountains of evidence to the contrary.  Go buy your weather balloon.  You can debunk this theory in a few hours.  Anybody can.  Why do they ignore that in favor of pushing their agenda?  How is that "seeking the truth?"  It's willful ignorance.

       you are wrong. I am not religious, and i've never even read the bible. the theory is based on math and science. some people have apparently picked up on that it confirms something in the bible but lets agree that happens all the time with the globe model as well and it neither proves nor disproves any theory.
      </p>

       I can watch all the weather balloon footage I want on youtube - I see what it looks like from high up over and over.  and what it shows confirms flat earth.

       You are using selective youtube videos.  I have shown other "flat earth" people videos and pictures that show the earth curved and they say "that is a fish eye lens in that shot."  Nobody actually wants to do the research themselves but they want to ignore the evidence that goes against their ideas and embrace the evidence that supports it.  And you might not be religious but you have fallen for a theory that was reintroduced by religious zealots.  They bend the evidence to suit their needs.  Every picture that shows a curved earth "that is fake!" or "that is a fish eye lens!"  But then every picture that shows a straight horizon is called evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a video, for example, that you will ignore:

       I literally know a person who worked on Felix's jump - from Red Bull. This is one of the easiest to explain. You see the curve flipping up and down. this is a clear indication of a fish eye lens, also it WAS a fish eye lens - fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you want to show the curvature is a result only of reality and not the lens it needs to never flip upwards. the curve should only go one way - find me a video like that and we can talk.

       I'm talking about the mounted camera before he even jumps.  There are more cameras.  Just buy a weather balloon and do it yourself because you'll never believe anything until you see it with your own camera.  You won't do that because you don't care about the truth.  You are content to ignore pictures and videos from other people if they don't coincide with what you already believe.  If I thought the Earth was flat and I had a way to prove myself right or wrong I would do it.  Hell, it's the age of the internet.  I would get together with a bunch of likeminded individuals and group-fund my own trip to the "ice wall" that allegedly surrounds the Earth.  You said yourself that millions of people believe this.  Well, if everyone chips in a couple of bucks you could easily fund this sort of exploratory excursion.  You could literally change world as we know it.  Nobody does it.  You all just say "The government protects the ice wall and will shoot us down if we get near it!"  It's just a never-ending list of excuses to not do any more than share youtube videos.

       I don't have access to anybody who can personally speak to Felix, my friend wasn't at that top level - just the assistant to a guy who was. I just know for a fact it was a fish eye lens. It is interesting tho that Felix gave zero interviews confirming what the earth looked like to his naked eye before his plunge.

       Well because the world was decidedly round since about 2000 years before Columbus sailed to America... I think if he was up there and saw that it was flat he certainly would have been saying shit and would be giving interviews every day about it.  Nobody asked him what the Earth looks like from up there because it was 2013 and everybody knows what the Earth looks like.

       It was the church that originally declared the earth was round and made it law to teach only that model. So "knowing" is debatable when you consider the source of that enforced knowledge.

       I would say there was no way Felix could see the shape of the earth is either respect even from his vantage point he is still limited by the limited distance the human eye can see.

       You absolutely could see the shape of the Earth from 25 miles up.  You can look at pictures taken by the ISS and see very clearly that the Earth is spherical.  Really, what the hell would be the point of a global conspiracy to lie about the shape of the Earth?  A Conspiracy that dates back to the time of Aristotle?  Why in the world would every government on the planet decide to keep this centuries-long conspiracy going?  Magellan circumnavigated the world proving that it was spherical in the 1500s.  Why would they lie about that 500 years ago and still need to keep this lie alive today?  You are caught up in a belief that is held by religious nuts who think that the world governments are leading everyone astray so they stop believing the Bible.  It's Satan's trick.  You are falling for that...

       you can't have it both ways - say the religious people are trying to trick you now - and say why would the church lie to everybody way back then?!
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact is religion doesn't really matter here they can say what they like either way at any time -  they are seeking to secure the faith of the people that is all. they can be right or wrong in the proclamations they make in securing that faith. they have their own agenda that sometimes involves accepting or denying scientific discoveries as it serves them - that's all.

       you can circumnavigate a flat, disk earth. exactly as Magellan did. this again is a basic of the flat earth evidence, theory.

       I'm sorry but that is just bullshit.  This idea that nobody on the planet has ever traveled far enough out to notice that it's an ice shelf all the way around the planet is crazy.  Again, this is something that can easily be crowd-funded and put to the test.  If you don't want to take any government's word for it then why aren't there a bunch of Flat Earth independent explorers proving their theory?  In the matter of a few weeks this could be done.  Nobody is trying to do that.  Why?

       I'd say it's pretty proven already, just a lot of resistance by most people to listen to the proof  and understand why, but to answer your question - it's illegal to go to Antarctica as an independent person it's controlled by the military. you can look at the edge from a ship for 10 grand, as my friend has done, but you can't attempt to cross it as a private citizen.

       But this is where the "flat earth" thing can be proven.  Antarctica doesn't actually surround the planet.  You can travel around the Equator without ever hitting Antarctica.  You can literally start and end at the same point.  If the earth is a sphere that will be possible.  If you attempt to do that and you end up running into an ice shelf you will have proven that the Earth is flat.  Why aren't Flat Earth explorers doing this?  We have the internet and GPS and cameras.  This whole thing can be documented.  Nobody does it.

       yes, you can travel around the equator without ever hitting antarctica, this is what is expected in flat earth theory. imagine taking any standard globe, puncturing a hole in the sound pole - center of antacrtica - and then, pulling that hole so open that you can stretch out the whole map of the earth into a big huge flat circle. like a pizza with an antarctica crust. that's the idea. you can still travel in a circle east to west and never ever get to the edge just keep going in a circle. the only uncrossed outer perimeter or what could be thought of as the edge of the known world (who knows what lies beyond) is the furthest you can get south - from anyplace on the world. the edge of antarctica. and you are right nobody has crossed antarctica. probably because it is a lot lot lot freaking harder to attempt than we like to think.

       for a plethora of reasons. the goofiness of the science for one. the explanations for how space travel is accomplished sound great until you break it down are see there are gaping holes in the physics-logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's science fiction - there's enough of an explanation for all of it you can buy into it if you don't question too much - but if you examine the explanations too closely you have to laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's all theatrics. rockets go up - that's real. but when they arc down - they come back down and do not continue going up. and they always arc down if you watch them long enough. that's end of story for real space exploration. the rest is faked for the imagery.

       for one thing that orbital path is something that you can just merge onto and merge out of like some space highway. If (and I do not think it unlimitedly is what is happening) - but if all our current understand of how the planets orbit the sun/ moons orbit the planets - and nothing ever stops orbiting/ falls out of alignment  is right - then how do satellites enter orbit and then leave it/ ....I know they say it's happening over and over so to question is like -- blasphemy/stupid - what have you. ---- but if you think about it they are trying to get you to think of orbital path like a highway - like a path you can enter or exit - when talking about space travel/sattelites. but when they talk about planets/sun/moon - orbital path is something that is apparently fixed for what is essentially eternity, -- that I see as a physics-logic-flaw.

       If I understand what you're saying, the reason satellites can move in orbital planes is both because they actually have a source of thrust moving them, which planets lack, and they have far far less mass than most orbiting bodies.

       let's assume they all do have enough of a power source to fly circles through outer space every day, while it remains impossible to fly circles around the globe in small plane with solar power or without stopping to refuel numerous times. but ok - the only way this would really be possible if is there is no atmosphere/ no resistance - so just a tiny push will get you wherever you want to go, if you are in outer space. thats the explanation they give - so ok - lets assume it's true. but then you have another problem. you can not steer through nothing. you have to have substance to push off from to choose your direction constantly, so you can't have it both ways. you can't near effortlessly fly though nothing and also navigate where you are flying. and they are trying to get you to think - well the orbit path steers for you/  it's like a ride you can get on and off. no. it is not a ride it is supposedly a phenomena of dueling forces. a phenomena powerful enough to keep the universe in fixed motion. you should not be able to hitch hike on it, -choose to be effected by it when you want and then have it release you - it makes no sense,

       The way that most vehicles and satellites maneuver in orbit are OMS systems, which use gas to force the ship in different directions. You don't need to use any form of power source to fly through space if you are in an orbit, I don't understand what you mean by this.

       you can't navigate without friction, or more specifically the ability to take the substance in front of you and put it behind you - trade places. a car's wheels push the road behind the car. airplane engines such air from the front of the plane and push the air behind the plane. a boat rudder chooses where the water will be moved as in passes and thus the boat moves in the opposite direction. this is a problem with their explanation of any satellite and space travel. there is  no substance and no engine/wheel/rudder steering/ navigating mechanism, they say it's computers that steer it, (haha they literally say this) you need physical mechanics to steer. - computers can control them sure - but you need mechanics too, and they can not explain the physical navigation so it makes plausible sense,

       This navigation is done with the OMS systems, which shoot compressed gasses outward to force the ship in another direction. It's the same basic principle as what Watney does in the Martian with his glove. It's a very old system, the first astronauts used compressed gas guns that they carried with them, before it became more developed. You can actually see the nozzles on the Lunar lander and the Command capsule.

       Because of both the insulation and the variance in temperature. We use massive amounts of thermal insulation on all manned ships, this very much helps balance the temperature. Space also varies in temperature wildly, from incredibly cold to incredibly hot depending on weather or not you're in the direct view of the sun. Just because you disagree with the way that a system might work, that doesn't change the fact that
       <em>
        that is how it works
       </em>
       Ships have used some version of an RCS system for half a century, and it's the best way to maneuver in space.

       Nope. Newtons third law is key here. It's like if you use an air compressor - You can feel the recoil when you release the air. That recoil creates motion.

       You seem rather confused, I think you could learn a great deal about orbits if you played the game Kerbal Space Program - It has the appearance of a child-like game, but the physics simulations in it are real and would help you see and experiment with space travel.

       The moon has no source of locomotion, and yet it stays relatively fixed to it's orbital path. Explain this.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I'm going to save you a few burned out brain cells):
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon (like other satellites) has been given enough lateral motion to achieve centrifugal force capable of overcoming the effects of gravity. Simply, it's moving fast enough that the motion has a quantifiable effect of preventing it from falling into the planet's gravity. Technically it is, it's just the spiral's actual angle is so low it's imperceptible.

       I'll elaborate:
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever someone says slomo accounts for the appearance of low gravity, they tend to ignore the fact that slomo cannot account for other anomalies like low-grav and lack of atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If slowmo cannot account for these, then it shouldn't be used as an argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       To use it as an argument, is to suggest you're aware of something to explain away the anomalies (Thus the implication that you know what you're talking about)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So far, you don't know what you're talking about. Would you care to prove me wrong?

       That doesn't make sense. Watch videos from on board Apollo 8, or the first space walk. They move at normal speed, but things float around. Slow motion doesn't create the illusion of weightlessness.

       The burden of proof lies on you. Of course your argument doesn't make sense. If something is done in orbit, that means its in space.

       Definitely not in slow motion. Simulating anti-gravity is an extremely expensive, difficult thing to do today. This video was clearly shot in a zero gravity environment and has been available since 1965. It was very clearly not done in a plane.

       OK so explain to me how all 0 gravity video is in real time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, slow motion recording can give the appearance of staying in "flight" for long periods of time, but explain to me how they get their motions to still seem natural?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they just flailing at massive speeds to overcome the time-reducing effect of slomo? No. They'd be obviously reacting to the force required to move their body fast enough to seem like it's in real time according to Newton's 2nd law and that would be obvious in the whiplash of moving rapidly.

       GPS is all done on ground level. it was invented and in use by the navy long before any satellites were allegedly in the air. anything they are saying is done by satellites is either not happening at all (some high level surveillance claimed capabilities) or is done at ground level.
      </p>
      <p>
       consider when a plane is lost or a crime committed on the ground - satellite imagery is never used to track or prove in a courtroom - anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       drones can take picks from above, planes can too. weather can be animated from observation from ground level. etc.

       So if GPS was invented on the ground, why would they start lying and say it was satellites?
      </p>
      <p>
       They did use satellite imagery when looking for MH370 in the ocean. They thought they could use the large areas the satellite covers to search for relatively static debris. As far as using imagery for proving crimes were committed - The satellites are traveling more than 15,000 MPH, and they take images over large areas every couple seconds and stitch them together. The fastest satellites complete their orbit in 90 minutes. That does not seem like an effective tool for proving crimes, does it?
      </p>
      <p>
       You also didn't address my question about why amateurs can spot the ISS through their telescopes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I question your understanding of physics if you think satellites in orbit are loopholes. Or you're just fucking with me.

       originally satellites were used to scare the world into thinking we could launch long range nuclear missiles the world over at the press of a button. it was cold war propaganda science fiction. the people trembled with fear, the governments showed them some fake imagery and goofy math.  if you don't realize propaganda is a huge tool in warfare and domestic control - -- I dunno what to say. i'm not the expert on this, I just read up on it and saw the logic in it - there's extensive research to look into with all the documents / proof/ etc. if you are actually interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for iss as an object you can photograph - yea it looks like there is an object up there, I don't know what it is or how high up it really is -  - either way it does not seem apparent that anybody is living there.

       Saying that propaganda is a tool in warfare then using that as proof for satellites being fake is quite the logical jump.

       What is your explanation for the ISS? What makes you say it's not apparent someone lives there - and why does that matter to your argument?

       How many people do you think are in on this hoax? Millions of mathematicians, rocket scientists, pro/am astronomers? What are people actually studying when they go to school in rocket science?

       You still have not explained why getting a satellite into orbit is physically impossible.

       you are right, just because there is propaganda does not mean a given thing is propaganda, to say satellites are propaganda is a huge leap/claim and one that should be backed up with a lot of evidence.

       I agree. It took me months of research to come around to this conclusion. so chances I can persuade you in a reply comment on here are slim.

       Well, for one, you didn't even try with your sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, none of your sources addressed the science of why satellites can't exist. These random youtubers focus only on how these videos and photos could be faked. I could analyze one of your childhood photos and "debunk" that the picture was ever taken too... Except that there's absolutely no evidence behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you rummage around a haystack long enough, you can convince yourself you found a needle. One of the pieces of evidence in the ISS fake video was that people can't go that long without a proper shower...

       ah. a lot of the evidence is cumulative. we are talking about questioning a whole "fake science" that has some real science mixed in.  there is a lot to dismantle because to question any specific part of it sincerely contradicts what we "know" about the big picture so i think a broad explanation of why you should be questioning it in a big picture way is the best first step ....  imo those videos give a really good overview of the reasons to question - and then you can go deeper with whatever specifics that make the most sense for you. like the science of rocketry for one.

       Why do you think I am taking this personally? I am asking you questions that challenge your consistency on the subject. I thought surely you would appreciate that.

       When did I insult you? Your go-to argument tactic is to say something controversial in the hopes the other person will insult you. Then you get to say "that's an ad hominem attack" and you win.

       I don't think you actually believe anything you're saying. I think you just like to argue and get people riled up. The character you're playing is too one-dimensional though. You need to step it up.

       The math that dictates satellite orbit is fairly simple. Apply enough force against gravity by flying on a tangent line to the gravity well of the Earth as to create an equal force to gravity. That way, it stays in one arc relative to the Earth that it doesn't fly away or succumb to gravity's unwavering strength.

       I'm talking about the mounted camera before he even jumps.  There are more cameras.  Just buy a weather balloon and do it yourself because you'll never believe anything until you see it with your own camera.  You won't do that because you don't care about the truth.  You are content to ignore pictures and videos from other people if they don't coincide with what you already believe.  If I thought the Earth was flat and I had a way to prove myself right or wrong I would do it.  Hell, it's the age of the internet.  I would get together with a bunch of likeminded individuals and group-fund my own trip to the "ice wall" that allegedly surrounds the Earth.  You said yourself that millions of people believe this.  Well, if everyone chips in a couple of bucks you could easily fund this sort of exploratory excursion.  You could literally change world as we know it.  Nobody does it.  You all just say "The government protects the ice wall and will shoot us down if we get near it!"  It's just a never-ending list of excuses to not do any more than share youtube videos.
