<p>What propaganda? The film takes place in the future, somewhere in the United States. Food scarcity is an issue because of over farming. Global warming and all of it&#39;s effects are in full force.</p>

<p>There is a scene where a woman concedes that the moon landings were hoaxed in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union during the Cold War. </p>

<p>For those of you who have seen it, did this film strike you as odd? </p>

<p>I do agree that there is some subtle propaganda found within the movie:  </p>

<ol>
<li>Moon landing told as a hoax from antagonists</li>
<li>It&#39;s about a future Earth with survival issues and dust bowl style weather which is a untold nod towards global warming.</li>
<li>Pro-drone (that looks like a predator) but is fully automated and thought of with pride and acceptance, and it was built in India. Which is quite telling.</li>
<li>Nasa comes off as a super bad ass group of people.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of media circulating that is begging the public to stroke NASAs dick. Interstellar is the one I encountered most recently. Apart from that, there was the hyped announcement of water on Mars (which is cool) where they made everyone wait in &quot;suspense&quot;, Neil deGrasse Tyson wrote Cosmos: a space time odyssey which was basically a big plea for people to take interest and fund NASA...</p>

<p>A publicly funded, open, and continual exploration of space would be wonderful. The reality of that occurring is pretty bleak unless the public steps up and decides it&#39;s important. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a very passionate advocate of NASA because I&#39;m a little cynical about the benefits being shared with the public. I think a lot of the discoveries and innovations slip under the radar of the public, or worse, are deliberately hidden. There is too much red tape and dogma in areas where the public&#39;s interest is most keen: SETI projects, cheaper/better technology creation, unregulated media, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying all of this being fully aware of all the tech we&#39;ve got out of publicly funded space research. </p>

<p>But the really cool innovations? Look to DARPA and the private sector -- oh and other first world countries.
The private sector is doing just fine financing private rocket creations/launches. The government has a shitload of patents on tech that are classifier because of &quot;National Security&quot;. Should it be a cause of concern that CERN isn&#39;t in America? We definitely aren&#39;t leaders or innovators in STEM fields anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t seen someone kicking their car when it breaks down on the side of the road.  So, how will our culture deal with others treating human like &quot;machines&quot; like shit when they say or do things that anger someone else?  Will we hold the real human accountable or his bad behavior?  Or will we just allow it, because after all....  They&#39;re just robots.</p>

<p>My opinion:  If a robot or machine resembles, in any way shape or form, a human, we should on principle respect it&#39;s function and purpose as if it was a human.  If we don&#39;t, then we stand a chance of lowering it down to a slave status.  History will repeat itself, and we will find ourselves, slowly shifting back to the &quot;old ways&quot; of allowing other humans to be enslaved.  I think in the future, slavery, will absolutely be abolished, even in thought and in simple actions.  The robots will be a constant reminder of why we should treat each other with human empathy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some would argue that placing humans on the same level as robots would be demeaning to <em>humans</em>.</p>

<p>In any case, we don&#39;t need robot empathy to enslave people. Most people are already slaves via economic control,  i.e. Wage slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve only seen it once, and it was probably a year ago, so I might not be 100% on this, but I believe the scene toward the end where the daughter is somewhat adrift between the timelines is a lot like the <a href="http://hyperdiscordia.crywalt.com/library_of_babel.html">Library of Babel</a>.  James Corbett has a Film and Literature in the New World Order podcast piece on this work too, available <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/the-library-of-babel-flnwo-27/">here</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also some pro-drone material toward the beginning iirc.</p>

<p>Also I hate to be the one to say it, but the moral is that gravity is magic, which flows into flat earth territory</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the weather balloon footage I&#39;ve seen including the Felix Baumgardner jump actually all indicate that the Earth is flat</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fisheye Lens:</strong></p>

<p>The apparent curvature we see in these clips is caused by the shape of the camera&#39;s lens.  This is proved when the horizon dips below the bulge in the lens and the Earth&#39;s curve bows the wrong way, as is demonstrated in the screencaps linked after each video.</p>

<p>In the opening seconds, we see a flat and level horizon over what I assume is Felix&#39;s shoulder.  The external shot uses a fisheye lens, as we can tell by the curvature present in the capsule that Felix is jumping from.  Also features bonus tacky spinning globe animation if you watch the whole thing, which I do not endorse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I&#39;m surprised you put in the time for this comment, but every video source you show me ( including the beginning of Felix&#39;s video) seems to show curvature, &quot;fish eye&quot; lens or not. Even your stills are photos taken when the camera is at an angle that only shows earth&#39;s slight curve up. That toy robot video is actually perfect, it totally demonstrates earth&#39;s curve.</p>

<p>Do people still seriously believe in flat earth? You honestly think that if I boarded a plane and only travelled east, I&#39;d never come back to where I started? Like have you never been on an airplane before? Basic physics? Ever been on a beach? What about all the videos of the ISS and it&#39;s live feed? Jesus christ. </p>

<p>Nope, food scarcity is an issue because of <a href="http://interstellarfilm.wikia.com/wiki/The_Blight">The Blight</a> - A plague. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Global warming and all of it&#39;s effects are in full force.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall global warming being a plot device, let alone mentioned.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For those of you who have seen it, did this film strike you as odd?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moon landing part struct me as humorous, a kind of <em>&#39;what has the world come to</em>&#39; joke. </p>

<hr/>

<p>But your point is lost given your summarisation of various points in the film are false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that they are growing okra indicates they are most likely dealing with global warming.  And the fake moon landing portion was a jab at those of us who do not believe it occurred and is meant to show that if the critics of science were to run the world we would be left utterly hopeless which is complete bullshit.  We would finally be free.  So why don&#39;t you chill out.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with the post.</p>
