    <div class="md"><p>My friend&#39;s daughter is in her senior year of high school. I spent half an hour trying to convince him that she should do two years of community college and transfer to a four year to save money. </p>

<p>His wife and daughter consider doing that a failure and that the daughter really wants to go to some school on the east coast known for water polo. The daughter is working on getting a scholarship to this school known for it LS water polo program. </p>

<p>I told him many parents now are putting themselves in debt to sign up their kids to four year schools and after the students graduate, they typically can&#39;t find a job. </p>

<p>Circling back, when I was in high school, our school pushed us really hard in college and job preparation. It was at the point where I so annoyed and so jaded from the bombardment, I said fuck it I don&#39;t want to go to college now. I wound up teaching myself IT skills as I wanted to do something I was passionate about. </p>

<p>Anyway, it is a big scam nowadays. When I have kids I plan on letting them deciding what they want as long as they realize they&#39;ll put themselves in debt and only if they&#39;re passionate about what they want to do. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad really. If we didn&#39;t have so many trade deals in place, we might actually have some decent labor jobs in this country instead of China. Even then we would still need to bring back training for those skills in high school, which are becoming less present due to liability reasons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually beleive one of the biggest obligations a parent has now is to keep their kid out of debt  and start on their own with at least a non negative balance.</p>

<p>No new cars with debt. No college debt.</p>

<p>Its as important or perhaps even more important than keeping them from smoking</p>

<p>Today that means someone pays their way through college or some type as they go. </p>

<p>It also menas you teach them how to make money which is NOT the same as getting an education. </p>

<p>If i had a young chold now i would link their goodies to them making a profit in some kind of independent business like grass cutting buying things at yardsales and selling them online for a profit or something to form that essential basic idea that they can make money simply and independently of being hired by someone  elses business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Here what they should have said.</p>

<p>Never borrow money to buy something you cant sfford or that goes down i  value.</p>

<p>Never borrow money if you THINK something will go up in value. You have to have a buyer in place who will pay you more than you borrow already BEFORE you buy it vand it needs to be and signed legal contract.</p>

<p>You have to spend money to make money is a lie taught by those who want to sell you something.</p>

<p>Anyone who likes you less becuase you dont have nice things is someone you should sell overpriced nice things to and not have as a friend.</p>

<p>Never borrow on credit cards.  Dont try to build good credit. Its like learning to be a good slave.  Build savings and you wont need credit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think technical college is wise, however a piece of advice:</p>

<p>We hired our last 2 developers by finding their open-source / hobby projects on the internet and then beginning conversations with them. </p>

<p>The most recent was a guy who had a hobby project using a piece of hardware that our product uses. What was unique is that he interfaced it from .NET so it fit with what we were trying to do. We started off just offering him a consulting gig - $1500 to modify the code in certain ways to make it easier for us to integrate. </p>

<p>Soon we saw that he was intelligent, open-minded and easy to work with. Thus, we offered him a full-time position. </p>

<p>This is something I try get younger people to grasp: The internet is your greatest ally, use it to market your skills!</p>

<p>Trust me, in a job and its between some guy with a piece of paper degree and another with demonstrable experience - the one with experience will win. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the advice. </p>

<p>I unfortunately don&#39;t really have the drive to teach myself stuff like that outside of school, I just want to do it as a job because it&#39;s more interesting than most things out there to me that will make me decent money. I probably would if I wanted to live a high end lifestyle, but I just want to live in a $500 a month 1 room apartment and live comfortably, so I don&#39;t care for a $100,000 salary.</p>

<p>The things that interest me outside of school don&#39;t earn money, learning about the truth of the world and diving deep deep into the rabbit hole. I wouldn&#39;t be able to focus on something boring, like networking, when I could be learning about numerology, etymology, cults, false flags, etc, which are all far more important than IT in the grand scheme of things.</p>

<p>I am going to get an internship before I graduate, though, which should help with the experience part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those some college and government administrator who have no problem trapping young people in student loan debt are pretending to care by making it harder for credit card companies to market on campus. Good to know they care. </p>

<p>“Students are brought up, and by the time they really first get into some of the classes about that or where they become aware of it, they already find themselves quite often in debt. And I have very mixed feelings about this whole thing, because on the one hand I think that many people could benefit from a better understanding of how credit works and what the contracts mean and what they’re getting themselves into. On the other hand, I also feel like the law says you’re a responsible adult at age 18, and here we’re finding one little area in which you’re really not quite responsible,” said White.</p>

<p>White said he doubted the law would keep students from signing with credit card companies. He said such companies will find other places where students can be reached, such as malls.</p>

<p>“They’re not going to allow them to solicit on or near campus. The problem with that is, how do you constitute ‘near?’” said Mary Beth Pinto, professor of marketing at the Pennsylvania State University School of Business and researcher at the Center for Credit and Consumer Research at Penn State. “A lot of colleges themselves come up with regulations that say you can’t solicit on campus, but then people just go across the street.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the professors are getting squeezed like hell.</p>

<p>The school investment advisors who handle the endowments are the ones raking it in.  And the private managmeent companies who now take over from collegesand management their real estate and personnel and who cut wages to nothing.  They are the ones making millions.</p>
