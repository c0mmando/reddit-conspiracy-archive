    <div class="md"><p>In WW1, we were fighting with the ottoman empire. Seeing their opportunity, Zionists asked us to take palestine and hand it over to them. As rothschild was one of the richest men if not the richest in the world at the time, and we were desperate for funding, it seems it was quite easy for him to convince us to sign the balfour declaration, &quot;agreeing&quot; that palestine belonged to Zionists.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks later, we attacked Jerusalem. </p>

<p>Its possible that when we were losing the war in 1916, zionists offered to try and use their influence over the US to bring them into the war on our side, in exchange for palestine. </p>

<p>Basically it seems clear than we acted as the zionist&#39;s attack dog, or mercenaries, and cleared out palestine so that they could move in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason Israel exists is because Zionists bribed the British Empire to conquer the region off the Ottomans in WW1. In return we got the financial backing we required to win the war. Clearly this was unfair on the people who were living there but modern day Zionists just completely gloss that over. I&#39;ve actually been told that the land &quot;never belonged to the arabs&quot;, or that they &quot;left on their own&quot;. Why don&#39;t Zionists ever mention the British Empire&#39;s &quot;Jerusalem Operations&quot; or the &quot;Battle of Jerusalem&quot;?</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: the arabs didn&#39;t leave on their own. We encouraged them to leave, with machine guns. Although Zionists have done everything possible to muddy the waters of legality, somehow claiming this entire operation was legitimate and legal (obviously, in the eyes of the British Empire, for whom the slave trade was once legal, and so was massacring Indians who didn&#39;t get in line) The holocaust was legal so clearly legality is irrelevant because it is defined differently by different sides.</p>

<p>The only perspective we can take on these operations is a moral one. We were paid to wipe out a population so that Zionists could move in, because they believe they inherently deserve the land more than the natives, due to their race.
Whichever way you look at it, it was hideously unfair on the native population and modern day Zionists would do very well to remember that. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jerusalem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jerusalem</a></p>

<p>It sounds crazy but it&#39;s been done before.</p>

<p>If that gets you thinking about things, good. Seriously, in the entire history of the world, when has anyone ever gotten together and given someone their own country in order to solve a refugee problem?</p>

<p>Some people think of Israel&#39;s existence as some sort of miracle. I see it as evidence of something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Zionist Jews are also responsible for the creation of the Federal Reserve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Debatable. Your definition of a &quot;Zionist Jew&quot; seems to be anyone who was involved in the history of politics or finance who was Jewish...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The &quot;Fed&quot; is the private corporation that prints the U.S dollar.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. That&#39;s the US Treasury. The Fed requests printing from the Treasury, but they are not the same organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve then charges Interest to the American Government.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they don&#39;t. They mediate bond issues. That&#39;s not the same thing. The US Federal Government is under no obligation to issue bonds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This creates perpetual debt to the American People, and since 1971 the Dollar is no longer backed by Gold. So now the Fed can print unlimited amounts of money that are essentially worthless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, before 1971 the gold standard didn&#39;t prevent the US from printing money, it simply devalued the currency in a different way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mossad (the Israeli Government) has been holding the United States and the World Hostage with Nuclear Weapons </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very strange definition of &quot;hostage&quot;.</p>
