       This is nothing new, just something that goes easily unnoticed which I had an experience with last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 nights ago I was chilling with a friend of mine, he was tagging me in various facebook posts as a "look at this, oh and this, and this one, this one's good" sort of thing. They all went through, no problem. Then yesterday he tries it again on an article outlining the West announcing that they will attack "hostile Russian aircraft" in Syria and I got no notification, I still haven't, and the only reason I know he tagged me was because he showed me that tag in the comments &amp; the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a little funny, in my opinion, that it was that particular article that was chosen. The guy falling off his bike and hurting his leg, sends it through. The girl blowing chunks over a random girl, sends it through. Further proof that the West is controlling ISIS in the hands of someone who takes the out-of-context story and links it to the larger picture most who view the articles ignore, suddenly no notifications are available.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those not aware - The west has claimed the right to attack hostile Russian aircrafts in Syria, Russia is of course attacking ISIS and "have them on the ropes", doing more to combat terrorism than the West since the US began the "War on Terror". Why would the West suddenly decline this "International coalition to combat terrorism" when finally there's a participant doing more than missing their targets and hitting civilians instead? And why is Israel getting fussy over Putin supplying Assad with anti-aircraft weaponry to defend Syria? It couldn't possibly be that Israel has been attacking the Assad government alongside the Western Alliance using ISIS as a scapegoat, one with a blade firmly pressed to its neck now Russia's involved! No, the news says we're the good guys.

       I use it as a means of communication. Reddit can be just as bad, as can mobile phones, laptops, and tablets in general. At the end of the day, facebook's just a tool, it's not good, it's not bad, it's just whatever it needs to be in the hands of the person wielding it.

       You're bitching about facebook censoring, when you know you damn well they are corrupt. You pointing it out, is a tireless effort. We all know they do this. Hence, my response.  May be new to you, but not new here. GTF off FB. Why feed em, especially after this?
       <strong>
        You are the product
       </strong>
       , so do not bitch here when they say STFU and censor you. You sound like you are in an abusive relationship (with FB), those never work. Best nip it in the bud.

       I wasn't being censored, it censored something from my account - bit of a difference
      </p>
      <p>
       And either way, 9/11 isn't new, gets posted constantly. Jew conspiracies aren't new, constantly posted. I decided to add a new experience for an old problem to the community for discussion. My apologies for using this forum for the free speech pedastal it is to share our experiences and connect with people with a similar interest.

       I'm not saying reddit is any different. I'm just saying, reddit doesn't know who I am or my friends. Yea, they may know what I say about topics. But, half the shit I say is bullshit (or is it?). As with anything/anyone, take it with a grain of salt ;)

       Reddit !== NSA. NSA may know who I am, but reddit doesn't. I'm an ever changing IP. As for FB or imgur, I do not go to FB and imgur, once again I'm an ever changing IP. Do you even know how technology works? You know you can disable trackers, right? Get ghostery, and as long as you are paying for normal internet, your IP will change, pretty normally. No away around the NSA though, fuck em. William Binny for 2016!

       You browse reddit without loading image links? Well, more power to your tinfoil-hat-wearing head then I guess. Everything you're doing online is being monitored. It all passes through the ISP, it's all monitored.

       You are failing to see NSA !== a private corp. There is no way around NSA, but you can avoid/not be tracked by a private entity (if you choose). Once again, do you even know how technology/the internet works? An ISP cannot give info to FB or any other website.

       It's the point being made; I get notifications for the countless things he sends across, the one thing I'd share pointing out how ridiculous the notion is considering who our enemies are (supposed to be) over there, and Russia being an automatic-ally given we have the same motivation, unless our media is lying to us.

       Yeah, it would be if every other tag hadn't worked. If it was a 1/3 thing, yeah that's coincidence. When it's the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       tag that doesn't work, there's either something fishy or you have a peg on your nose.

       There shouldn't really be an algorithm for notifications considering it's saying "Hey, someone liked/commented/tagged you in this". The only algorithm needed would be A-&gt;B, but since we're C, it's intercepted... so why intercept this specific one?

       Couldn't tell you, but I'd damn near guarantee it uses an algorithm of some sort. To weed spam would be my guess. Perhaps after so many tags news articles don't get listed or something. More probable than conspiracy anyway

       When it's a tag in the comments section of a posted article on a third party page, it really shouldn't make a difference, especially since it then suggests you don't receive all notifications anyway which would be counterproductive to the whole notification idea

       Not really. They consolidate notifications when you get a lot for a single topic. Their algorithms for showing you content are pretty interesting. Dont see why this would be so far fetched
