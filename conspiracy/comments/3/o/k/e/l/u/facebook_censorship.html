        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is nothing new, just something that goes easily unnoticed which I had an experience with last night.</p>

<p>2 nights ago I was chilling with a friend of mine, he was tagging me in various facebook posts as a &quot;look at this, oh and this, and this one, this one&#39;s good&quot; sort of thing. They all went through, no problem. Then yesterday he tries it again on an article outlining the West announcing that they will attack &quot;hostile Russian aircraft&quot; in Syria and I got no notification, I still haven&#39;t, and the only reason I know he tagged me was because he showed me that tag in the comments &amp; the article.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a little funny, in my opinion, that it was that particular article that was chosen. The guy falling off his bike and hurting his leg, sends it through. The girl blowing chunks over a random girl, sends it through. Further proof that the West is controlling ISIS in the hands of someone who takes the out-of-context story and links it to the larger picture most who view the articles ignore, suddenly no notifications are available.</p>

<p>For those not aware - The west has claimed the right to attack hostile Russian aircrafts in Syria, Russia is of course attacking ISIS and &quot;have them on the ropes&quot;, doing more to combat terrorism than the West since the US began the &quot;War on Terror&quot;. Why would the West suddenly decline this &quot;International coalition to combat terrorism&quot; when finally there&#39;s a participant doing more than missing their targets and hitting civilians instead? And why is Israel getting fussy over Putin supplying Assad with anti-aircraft weaponry to defend Syria? It couldn&#39;t possibly be that Israel has been attacking the Assad government alongside the Western Alliance using ISIS as a scapegoat, one with a blade firmly pressed to its neck now Russia&#39;s involved! No, the news says we&#39;re the good guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re bitching about facebook censoring, when you know you damn well they are corrupt. You pointing it out, is a tireless effort. We all know they do this. Hence, my response.  May be new to you, but not new here. GTF off FB. Why feed em, especially after this? <strong>You are the product</strong>, so do not bitch here when they say STFU and censor you. You sound like you are in an abusive relationship (with FB), those never work. Best nip it in the bud.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying reddit is any different. I&#39;m just saying, reddit doesn&#39;t know who I am or my friends. Yea, they may know what I say about topics. But, half the shit I say is bullshit (or is it?). As with anything/anyone, take it with a grain of salt ;)</p>
