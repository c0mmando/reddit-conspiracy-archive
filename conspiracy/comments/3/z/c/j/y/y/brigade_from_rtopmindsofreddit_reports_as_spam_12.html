<p>PositiveBalance[M] via <a href="/r/GetOutOfBed">/r/GetOutOfBed</a></p>

<p>Yeah I just remove posts with reports. And every one of your posts had reports. I don&#39;t feel like babying anybody, so i banned you.</p>

<p>to PositiveBalance[M] via <a href="/r/GetOutOfBed">/r/GetOutOfBed</a></p>

<p>For months, there has been brigades who downvote and report as spam in posts on electromagnetic fields in numerous subreddits. It is not your subscribers. It is subscribers of <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>. Several months ago, the admins banned some of them. I will report these new incidents to the admins. Could you please not be influenced by brigades? All my posts linked to research papers. Could you please unban me? Thanks.</p>

<p>[â€“]from PositiveBalance[M] via <a href="/r/GetOutOfBed">/r/GetOutOfBed</a></p>

<p>No. You are far and away the highest reported person on this sub. I&#39;m not babying people, I will not monitor your posts.. Goodbye</p>

<p>I am reposting the removed the posts in <a href="/r/undelete">/r/undelete</a>. They immediately are downvoted to zero. I am also reposting in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. </p>

<p>My posts in <a href="/r/insomnia">/r/insomnia</a> were removed and I was banned. i asked why. No response.</p>

<p>There is a pattern of censorship in reddit on the harmful effects of electromagnetic fields. Subs that removed posts are:</p>

<p>Pineal gland synthesizes biopterin, a rare coenzyme. Biopterin is a cofactor of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and melatonin. Magnetic fields and blue light cause biopterin deficiency. Biopterin deficiency can cause depression, circadian rhythm disorder &amp; parkinson`s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put no sub on a pedestal per say, I don&#39;t really believe a brigade is a punishable offense. So groups of people find out about a story and migrate to vote, so what, that&#39;s how reddit was supposed to work. Small sub groups which sometimes intertwine if the subject gets big enough. I admit, I try not to vote on comments or stories from subs I don&#39;t subscribe to, but to expect the silent participants on this site to follow suite, it ain&#39;t gonna happen.</p>
