       Yeah I just remove posts with reports. And every one of your posts had reports. I don't feel like babying anybody, so i banned you.

       For months, there has been brigades who downvote and report as spam in posts on electromagnetic fields in numerous subreddits. It is not your subscribers. It is subscribers of
       <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">
        /r/topmindsofreddit
       </a>
       . Several months ago, the admins banned some of them. I will report these new incidents to the admins. Could you please not be influenced by brigades? All my posts linked to research papers. Could you please unban me? Thanks.

       I put no sub on a pedestal per say, I don't really believe a brigade is a punishable offense. So groups of people find out about a story and migrate to vote, so what, that's how reddit was supposed to work. Small sub groups which sometimes intertwine if the subject gets big enough. I admit, I try not to vote on comments or stories from subs I don't subscribe to, but to expect the silent participants on this site to follow suite, it ain't gonna happen.

       Eleven out of twelve posts has a [J] tag in its title indicating the post links to a paper published by a medical journal. No 'new-agey pseudoscientific bullshit.'
