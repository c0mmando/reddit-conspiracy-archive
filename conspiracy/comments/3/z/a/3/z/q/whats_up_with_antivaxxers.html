       So do you guys think that all vaccines are bad/contaminated/whatever or just some of the newer seemingly useless ones?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the polio vaccine was clearly a massive advancement of human society, you can try to dispute this but you won't win.

       The HPV vax on the other hand is constantly being pushed by my doctor and I say no thanks I'm all good. So basically, fill me in on this, what are your thoughts and beliefs?

       The biggest concern for me is that it seems to question the efficacy and safety of vaccines at all will get you put in the same short bus as people who say they cause autism or are intentionally designed to stupefy/damage the recipients. Whenever a topic becomes polarised to that extent intelligent discussion becomes a somewhat forlorn hope. 
The primary issues I have about vaccination is that a) there is no publically available data around the amount of vaccines being administered (only the amount of units purchased), b) U.S pharmaceutical companies have 0 accountability for any injury caused by vaccination, and c) the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (tying into b, this is a court funded by the government at $.75 per vaccine purchased to compensate any successful vaccine injury claims brought to it) seems to be the only reporting means for assessing vaccine injury. This is inherently flawed as all payouts are classed as settlements, not actual verdicts the vaccine caused the harm, and relies on the claimants having sufficient evidence for a successful claim AND for them to be aware of its existence in the first place.
So basically, there's an unknown amount of vaccines being administered, with an unknown amount of injuries occurring as a result. And yet the status quo is that vaccines are unquestionaly safe to be administered.
Personally (in the magical land of fantasy I live in), I'd like there to be a similar level of accountability and investment in safety standards in the vaccine industry as say, the commercial aerospace industry.

       This seems very logical. I appreciate the need for data to make an informed decision. As Lord Kelvin once said:
      </p>
      <p>
       “When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarely, in your thoughts advanced to the stage of science.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree that this should be a much more transparent system if it is basically compulsory for children.

       Yes, this is how they get away with it, by not tracking the data, none of the vaccine-injured people I know ever reported their injuries, doctors and nurses aren't trained to recognize them.  It simply doesn't get tracked.  Yet independent studies show that it's around 1 in 6 going Asthmatic after the Tetanus jab, people die of Asthma every day, that means vaccine deaths, but this type of data is being avoided and covered-up by the CDC.

       No, it's clear that you're ideologically driven and here to affirm your overall sense of smug superiority.  Your use of "anti-vaxx" and the delusional sense of self-import that leads people like you to create a new thread rather than contribute to existing discussions betray you.

         How effective are polio vaccines?

       </ol>
       <p>
        Polio is virtually nonexistent in the United States today. However, according to Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, medical  investigator and pediatrician, *
        <em>
         there is no credible scientific evidence that  the vaccine caused polio to disappear *
        </em>
        [50].  From  1923 to  1953, before the Salk killed-virus vaccine was introduced, the polio  death  rate in the United States and England had already declined on  its  own by  47  percent and 55 percent, respectively (Figure 4) [51]. Statistics show a similar decline in other European  countries  as  well [51]. And  when the vaccine did become  available, many European countries questioned its effectiveness and refused to  systematically inoculate  their  citizens.  Yet, polio epidemics also ended in these countries [50]. Figure 4.

       <p>
        <strong>
         The  standards  for defining polio were changed when the polio vaccine was introduced.
        </strong>
        The new definition of a polio  epidemic required more cases to be reported.  Paralytic polio was redefined as  well,  making  it  more difficult to confirm,  and therefore tally, cases.

         Prior  to the introduction of the vaccine the patient only had to exhibit paralytic symptoms  for 24 hours
        </strong>
        . Laboratory  confirmation and tests to determine residual paralysis were not  required.
        <strong>
         The  new  definition  required the patient to exhibit paralytic symptoms  for at least 60 days, and  residual  paralysis  had  to  be  confirmed twice
        </strong>
        during the course  of  the disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, after the vaccine was introduced cases of
        <strong>
         aseptic  meningitis  (an  infectious disease often difficult to distinguish from  polio)  and  coxsackie virus infections were more  often  reported as separate diseases from  polio. But such cases were counted as polio before the vaccine was introduced
        </strong>
        . The vaccine’s reported  effectiveness  was therefore skewed (Table 1 and Figure 5) [52,53].

       So I just read that entire article. It was very well written (and scientifically formatted) albeit filled with hearsay, speculation and written like a children's story book.
      </p>
      <p>
       excerpt:
Kyle believes “The CDC
could disprove my entire hypothesis by testing the vaccines they
have in their possession. The fact that they haven’t done so is evidence
there’s something wrong with the vaccine [134:106].”
      </p>
      <p>
       <sup>
        That's
       </sup>
       one of the least scientific statements I've ever read and no scientist would ever put that in a paper. Specifically because argument from ignorance is a logical fallacy not a logical argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said it is a suggestive point that something is going on. But you have never elaborated your views of the vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do they not work? Are they dangerous for other reasons? Is contamination your biggest fear?
      </p>
      <p>
       A blanket "vaccines bad, nature good" is not sufficient to continue this debate. There are legitimate points you can raise but I'm not going to do your research for you anymore than you will continue to do mine for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone want to legitimately debate this?

       Calm down please. I clearly made a mistake in using the word "anti-vaxxers" and I apologize because I would really like to have a good conversation. I don't like an echo chamber, I like hearing many different ideas and choosing from them whichever most accurately reflects the world I live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was genuinely unaware of such controversy involving the polio vaccine such as SV40 DNA virus that contaminated ~ 80% of the samples from 1955 to 1963. I really want to learn and appreciate being enlightened to things that I did not previously know.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the NZ Miller report that you linked is not a scientific paper, and is just a dead link on google scholar and other databases. And it was completely funded by the ThinkTwice Global Vaccine Institute, which is in no way an impartial or scientific organization. I take these papers with a grain of salt much the same as you do the papers that Pfizer and Bayer pump out; you get what you pay for and I understand that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will continue to do my own research regarding the contamination and effects of these vaccines but links to fringe anti-vaccine echo chambers do not qualify as science in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: Basically I want a civil, scientific debate. I don't want to call each other names until we agree or turn off the computer. I want to discuss the science and statistics and methods behind vaccines until either one of us, ideally both, has a better understanding of the situation. Because I can tell you right now, neither one of us (nor anyone else) is completely correct. The world is not so black and white rather many shades of grey.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit2:
And polio outbreaks had sporadically occurred throughout the entirety of human history and throughout the 18th 19th and 20th centuries until the development of the vaccine. I'm not saying its a safe vaccine but how many polio outbreaks have happened since?

       This is a good conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that those who make vaccines intend to eradicate certain diseases, and that we will continue to learn. I also feel, however, that there could be more done to improve the safety and reporting on vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto can come up with a million ways to kill bugs and weeds but we're injecting people with live virii/bacteria as protection? It has worked well in the past, but I think it can and should be improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I doubt big pharma has any desire to really improve these vaccines due to the cost to do so and the perfectly adequate market they have at the moment.

       Polio is still around.  Now they just give it other names, like Guillaine Barre Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, or for more sever cases, "Acute Flaccid Paralysis" or "aseptic meningitis" or spinal meningitis, etc.

       This is true, as do many other social/health policies we have. Do the extra people who get to live outweigh the negative effects in the gene pool? I don't know, but this might be a good place to start.

       I think it boils down to human innovation, like many other problems we are facing. Are we all doomed? Maybe. Probably not.

       What's up with the shills; seems like all we get are temps and interns anymore. R/conspiracy used to have multiple PR agency regulars active at any given time; I'm talking purchased accounts, and reams of quick-draw industry propaganda and captured science links. Have we lost our touch?

       You're clearly completely fresh to the topic and have just seen some pharmaceutical adverts/marketing.  There's a lot for you to learn, it's a steep learning-curve.  If we tell you the way it is now it won't seem realistic, if you really are interested in learning more about the reality of the vaccine situation I'd recommend starting with this award-winning documentary which fairly allows both sides of the debate to state their cases

       Not all vaccines are good, not all vaccines are bad. They should not be mandated, and people should be educated. Hypothesis like herd immunity should be studied longer instead of parroted.
