       I am suffering with a tonsil abscess for quite some time now. 1 year and 3 months. Below is the image. I have seen 5 doctors. One ent one primary and 3 er visits. I am becoming an expert at recognizing medical hasbara in the work place. Even my insurance co is confused by whats going on and they are cal optima. I was kicked out of er today and not given any discharge paperwork. For the first time ever. Instead I was dismissed as and told since I walked out I can have discharge paperwork. No diagnosis forthe image. The last 2 diagnosis have been tonsililoth and strep. See the image. Draw your conclusions ask away. Also I am banned from askadoctor on reddit.

       Is that white on your tongue? To me it looks like you have severe oral candida thrush and that abcess could be your immune system freaking out about it. Candida and strep bacteria can live together in the same bio film. Candida is a conspiracy all of it's own.

       I mean the times I have seen someone for this its been cryptic as fuck. The firt 2 doctors both told me the same cryptic rationalization for not wanting to treat. They both said; "If I cut you you will bleed".  This quote appears in a few books. Really strange they both said it.

       Schizophrenia doesn't mean hearing voices in your head. It's a catch all term for people that think in an odd way. Thinking there is a connection with a specific phrase that doctors have said and thinking it is part of a conspiracy and that you are "medically targeted"  seems to fit.

       They both said it. It's a coincidence. I will not say it makes me targeted.  I am saying I observed it, it happened. The lack of I&amp;D no matter what is what's making me worry.

       Well yeah, it is odd if they are refusing to treat you and not giving you a legit reason why. They should at least be able to tell what it is. Maybe you should try finding a new family doctor and start from there. The ER is notorious for pushing people out of the way that aren't in immediate danger.

       You stated that OP is a paranoid schizophrenic and that this is obvious to anyone including non-doctors.  Nowhere in there did you mention an opinion, you stated it as fact.  Not to mention that your comments served no purpose at all but to belittle OP.  If you have nothing of substance to add to the discussion, simply say nothing.

       The quote you are seeing in books is actually slightly different and it is Shakespeare:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you prick us, do we not bleed?

       I will spare you the meaning, but it does not apply to what the doctors are saying.

       They are right, you will bleed in your throat and choke on your own blood.

       If they think it's a tonsil-lith that means its a
       <strong>
        stone
       </strong>
       and they can't simply remove it with a needle, because its somewhat solid. Your body will try to push it out, the thin around the stone will get thinner and thinner until a hole a appears and hard cheesy stuff that smells bad starts pooping out.

        peridontal syringe

       you can poke it into the hole and flush some goop out instead of waiting for it to irritate it's way out. Gargling will help move it out as well.

       Someone notice a recent pattern about Posts being to paranoic about a conspiracy without being one?
      </p>
      <p>
       To OP, I understand your frustration about this, but I don't think this is a conspiracy, also banned from askadoctor... why? Show us the post you have made, pics? Personally I found those sites about asking to a doctor on the internet pretty useless since they always tells you to go to a Doctor actually, and the simple stuff they said you can find it by yourself with 5mins on google.

       This is how to treat this. Crush ice in a blender or get some from a fast food place that uses crushed ice, get a lot of it. Chew and swallow lots of this ice , trying to get the area of the abscess numb. Holding an ice pack on the outside of your neck helps as well. Chewing crushed ice in general will help you throughout your day to day pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you are doing this, boil water, let the temperature cool where it's a just a bit too hot to drink. Add salt to a glass of this water, then gargle it. Might hurt like hell. Gargle for as long as you can take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get back to the ice as soon as you are done gargling, to get back to a numb state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do this 2 or three times a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The heat will bring the access to a point it can break, if and when it does break, spit everything out, gargle but more gently now that you have a seeping hole in your throat...more like just swooshing water back at the hole then spitting out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll want to keep this kind of gentle gargle for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drink plenty of water, everyday, dehydration will make the abscess worse as your kidneys don't have fluid to flush the infection out of your system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take ibruprofen for no more than ten days after you pop the abscess to reduce swelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and buy lemon drops, that abscess is probably a blocked salivary gland, lemon drops will activate the gland and unblock it. Suck on lemon drops or hard sour candy any time you feel even the slightest dry or sore throat as a blocked salivary gland is generally the first symptom of many ailments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't smoke, don't eat rough foods like toasted breads, or pizza, or chips, or nuts while you have this abscess or post-abscess hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay on a soft food diet until your throat is popped and healed, always with plenty of fluid and a good rinse with warm salt water when you are done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sleep/rest with an ice pack against your neck to reduce swelling as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had two of these abscesses before and this is what I mostly did to heal from it.
Second time however it popped on it's own as soon as I opened my mouth to show the nurse, however my airway was about 70% closed, so they drained it with suction, put me on IV solution for two days, and prescribed some opiate pain killers which let me sleep for two or three days and quit smoking, so it all turned out pretty good in the end.
