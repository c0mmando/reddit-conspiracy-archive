        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was systematic political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union,[1] based on the interpretation of political opposition or dissent as a psychiatric problem.[2] It was called &quot;psychopathological mechanisms&quot; of dissent.[3] -Wikipedia<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;the Obama administration on Monday finalized a rule that enables health care providers to report the names of mentally ill patients to an FBI firearms background check system.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So its easy to see how Obama&#39;s new executive action can be abused in the future, especially since Obamacare was funded (underhandedly).<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Well, now some doctor, almost responsible and required to report the mentally disturbed person to the FBI.  When the government has complete control of your health care, they own you.  And that&#39;s why Obama and the left want and wanted socialized medicine.  &#39;Cause once they have that, they can control everything you do.  They can control what you eat.  They can control every aspect of your life, because they can assign a financial value to it, thereby claim that the way you live is high risk and deny you health coverage. </p>

<p>So you have to change the way you live, change the things you do in order to qualify.  They&#39;ve got you by the shorts, folks, and this is exactly why they want it.  It isn&#39;t about better health.  It isn&#39;t about treatment.  It isn&#39;t about affordable insurance.  It&#39;s about total control of the country.  So here comes an executive order empowering, requiring doctors to report mentally ill people to the FBI.  And then what?  What happens then?  Well, the FBI can do whatever they want. Whatever they come in and do, how you gonna stop &#39;em?  It&#39;s the FBI, for crying out loud.  Federal law enforcement.  What are you gonna do?  You are under their power at that point.&quot; -Rush</p>

<p>This is not about the &quot;mental illness&quot; fact ( which is still discussed and have many many levels, anyway ), it&#39;s about the &quot;mental illness&quot; label.</p>

<p>The very fact you could hold a point of view for which the government could consider you mentally ill, due to anything ( i.e. false flags belief, deep government, anything against the narrative ), make them have total power regarding the public narrative.</p>

<p>This is not about mental illness, it&#39;s about politics. Simple.</p>

<p>Democrats always use bureaucratic barriers to violate human and civil rights. It&#39;s why we had things like poll taxes, open carry was outlawed, and why only the aristocracy are allowed carry permits in NY. So on and so on...</p>

<p>The EO is purposely vague and lacking in medical detail so as to allow for illegal and unconstitutional abuses. It&#39;s what they want. Then when people fight the abuses the left declares, &quot;you support the mentality ill having access to guns? We&#39;ve got another crazy over here.&quot; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust government regimes that try to say you&#39;re crazy and they&#39;re not. It should be up to the gun dealer to determine if they will sell to someone who is clearly bonkers. And if mr. bonkers kills someone it should come back on that seller. </p>
