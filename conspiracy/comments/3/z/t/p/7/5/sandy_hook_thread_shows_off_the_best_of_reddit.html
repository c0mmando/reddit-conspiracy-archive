    <div class="md"><p>This is my first time in this subreddit, so be gentle. </p>

<p>How exactly does that thread show the best of reddit bullying and the worst of humanity? I looked at it, as this article popping up on my newsfeed piqued my interest and then saw another thread with zilch and then this one. Read the other link and its basically redditors being redditors. No one is bullying or showing the worst of humanity.  The guy wasn&#39;t doxxed, no one is bombarding his Twitter in a burst of misogynistic hate, no one is asking him to produce any credentials of any sort in the face of some sort of emotional pain he is claiming to go through. </p>

<p>Quite frankly, OP, if you think this his bullying , museum worthy or even the worst of humanity when there are far worse things to clutch your pearls over, you might want to at least consider some sort of sliding scale for the front page to work with. </p>

<p>&quot;The one ‘verifiable period of conscious awareness’ that Parnia was able to report did not relate to this objective test.

<p>We don&#39;t really know. It could be as our brain shuts down it changes how we perceive time and space into massive hallucination. That&#39;s certainly been posited. But how does not knowing equal &quot;IT MEANS WE HAVE SOULS&quot;? It just means we don&#39;t know why people sometimes perceive this. Why would a dying brain prioritize accurate tactile and visual stimuli?</p>

<p>I mean, people have paranoid breakdowns because their carbon monoxide detector died. Does that mean they were possessed?</p>

<p>Not gravity in it&#39;s entirety, just the gravity between your hand and keyboard.

<p>The mind body soul phenomenon is interesting and something I studied in school. I&#39;m no expert of course but who could be at this point?</p>

<p>As you grow older you change, your body changes, your mind as well. Does your soul? Do we even have souls? </p>

<p>Were you the same person you were when you were a child? Most people say no, with good reason, but then how do we explain being the same person is we change over time? Science has proven that your body changes as cells die and are born as you age. Does this mean the person you were 10 years ago is the same person you are today? Well of course! But how?</p>

<p>The only thing that can really tie you together through your life is a soul. Your body and mind and even you as a person change multiple times throughout your life, yet you remain, changed. </p>

<p>Either none of us are the same person we were over x time, or there is some unifying force of personhood that exists through time that is unchanging. Is that a soul? Does that change your perspective? Either way you both make compelling arguments and the only reason I personally am inclined to believe in souls is due to this series of questions, as well as science evolving constantly. What is currently considered unsolved may be solved in the future, it may not, only time will tell. </p>

<p>Either way gentlemen and/or women have a great day and thank you for your discussion.</p>

As such, to be omniscient is to also be omnipresent - i.e. to <em>be</em> everything, for you have to <em>be</em> in order to truly know.  To know all is to <em>be</em> all, and this necessarily also implies omnipotence in the process - i.e. to be all powerful.</p>

<p>To know all is to be all, and to be all is to be all powerful.  You cannot know all without being all, and you cannot be all without being all powerful in the process.  And if one is all powerful, then one <em>is</em> indeed God, for God is the word that exists in the human lexicon for “everything that is”.</p>

<p>It’s all very logical really.</p>

<p>Omniscience cannot exist without omnipresence, and omnipresence necessarily means omnipotence.</p>

<p>What all this means is that your definition of gods and demons as being “omniscient” is, necessarily, considerably erred.  Gods and demons are actually <em>finite</em> - not infinite.  They may be significantly more powerful in many ways than humans, but they are in fact finite in their knowledge and their power - hence the lower case “g” and “d”.  If we were to use a more accurate definition of gods and demons, therefore, we would say that they can be “sentient beings that posses a level of power, ability, and/or intelligence that is far greater (or is at least interpreted as being far greater) than anything a human being can actuate, understand, or grasp.”</p>

<p>It is at this point that we discover that what makes a god or a demon such may be somewhat relative to who and what is doing the defining and/or perceiving of the supposed “god” or “demon”.</p>

<p>There are many beings far, <em>far</em> stronger, more powerful, faster, more intelligent, and much more wise than homo sapiens sapien - throughout the cosmos, and right here on planet Earth.  So which ones are ultimately gods and demons as opposed to just beings that are smarter, wiser, more powerful, etc?</p>

<p>The fact that there doesn’t seem to be an easy answer to which if any of them are gods or demons as opposed to simply entities that are interpreted as such by human beholders indicates that the subject might be a <em>lot</em> more complicated than the simple manner that you seem to be interpreting it here.</p>

<p>The idea of that which is “greater than” or “greatest” or “constitutes all things” is, it seems, A) innate, and B) by extension, as “man made” as, say, gravity, electricity, or any other ubiquitous, unifying force.  God is as much as anything a <em>concept</em>, and as such, is as “man made” as any of those other cosmic phenomena.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To have a being that exists as omnipotent as well as omnipresent (which I do agree as you have stated) may be inaccessible to our mind or senses.</p>

<p>Oh this is almost <em>necessarily</em> correct, sir.  As Arthur Schopenhauer intimated in “The Mind As Will And Representation” the human mind can only grasp what it sensorily acquires and <em>then</em> logically molds through its thinking apparatus.  Given that there is <em>so</em> much that falls beyond the realm of these measly five senses, therefore, and given the great limitations of the human mind’s ability to properly organize and react to what those senses grasp (i.e. to reason), one can readily see how there are <em>vast</em> gulfs of knowledge and understanding that are as alien to us as can possibly be imagined.</p>

<p>Who says that we can’t see, feel, touch, hear, or taste God?  First and foremost, we must have a proper understanding and definition of what God is in the first place.  Given that God, as I believe I correctly defined It, is “all that is and could possibly be” (indeed, how could It be anything less?), then we ourselves - existence itself, physically and otherwise - <em>necessarily</em> constitute at least a <em>certain</em> aspect of that cosmic grandiosity.  Admittedly, we likely only have the foggiest notion of Its breadth, but even such a sliver of that grandiosity is still at least <em>that</em> much of a sliver grasped - and, therefore, constitutes <em>that</em> extent of understanding.  Infinitesimal as it very well may be, one cannot by any means say that “we can’t” provide <em>any</em> evidence for the existence of that which we ourselves are a very part of and are necessarily <em>one with.</em></p>

<p>In short, we see, feel, touch, hear, and taste God every moment of our lives whether we are aware of it or not.  It is not only closer to us than our very selves, It <em>is</em> our very selves.</p>

<p>I see your logic and respect it. It tends to gravitate towards eastern thoughts of God and oneness. These things tend to evade the minds of those that are born of western culture. Kudos to you sir for bringing logic to r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.  It made me sad today when I saw all the rude responses just because people are asking questions.  I thought reddit was supposed to be a free and open exchange of ideas, not a witch hunt where the hive mind circle jerk takes over the dialogue and stomps out any opposing ideas with nasty sarcasm, name calling, and threats of violence.  This is reddit, not communist North Korea, right?  Right?</p>

<p>It&#39;s dangerous when either by pressure of public opinion (influenced by the government and media) or unwillingness to question beliefs, opposing ideologies and theories get stamped out with such vigor and are so vehemently rejected that no dialogue or debate is respectfully able to take place without being called names and demeaned or threatened.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at the behavior of what we see in that thread, and to clarify, I&#39;m not here to debate whether or not the event itself happened.  I&#39;m saying look at the pattern of the type of behavior we saw today in that thread from those who rejected the idea that there could be questions that need to be answered about the event:</p>

<p>&quot;Children died! <em>insert guilt trip rhetoric here</em>&quot;
&quot;Could everyone really have been in on it? <em>Insert big lie fallacy here</em>&quot;</p>

<p>And the gist of some comments referring to other redditors who had questions:
&quot;If it were my kids I&#39;d turn that guy&#39;a face into a hamburger!&quot; &quot;I wish I could beat that guy up&quot;</p>

<p>There was even someone referring to a bigger friend or relative who could &quot;do a number&quot; on conspiracy theorists.  Appeal to authority maybe?  The whole thing had a folksy small town minded undertone where you had to be one of us, or we or the authority figures are going to &quot;set you straight.&quot;</p>

<p>Overall, people who believe what they are told to believe ardently defending the government and media who told them what to believe in the first place.  Not asking questions, not entertaining any opposing ideas intelligently, but drastically shutting it down with such speed it becomes apparent they&#39;re doing it to assuage some sort of cognitive dissonance.  They don&#39;t want to accept the proposition that they could be wrong and that their government could be capable of such a manipulation and doing atrocious things.  To ease this discomfort, they clump themselves together cowardly while pointing the finger and saying &quot;fuck that guy for disagreeing.  Let&#39;s beat him up!&quot; This projects out the hatred, anger, bitterness, and denial which they don&#39;t want to hold in and own, allowing them to rationalize and take the path of least resistance that everything is okay, there is no chance of a conspiracies, and that their government is good.  </p>

<p>This is almost exactly like the minutes of hate from 1984.  Which is what we are turning into if we allow this anti intellectual opposing of uncomfortable ideas to continue.  What&#39;s next?  Burning books?  Burning people at the stake?  This is America, damn it.  If we continue projecting out at these external enemies that the government and media convince us to use as a catharsis-- most notably &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;)-- we will eventually allow them to control our emotions and then our minds.  Eventually all free thought and opinion will be shut down and actively opposed, and before you know it you&#39;re living in George Orwell&#39;s book.  It&#39;s the ideas that make us free.  </p>

<p>It is easier to say that everything is okay then it is to accept the undeniable feeling that there may be something wrong.  </p>

<p>However, common people are unable to entertain any idea of a conspiracy, even in debate, without spewing out toxic hate and attacking the person who is making them think and question their established beliefs previously held.  The question is-- what&#39;s with the quick and sometimes violent rejection?  Conspiracy theorists are willing to entertain the idea of it being real given the right amount of photos, videos, records, and documents that would show what actually happened.  Yet, the people accuse conspiracy theorists of being the ones in denial, while most of the denying behavior is coming from them in this thread because they are the ones who oppose ideas so vigorously and are trying to make the most justifications.  Conspiracy theorists simply ask&quot; What if?&quot;  The people answer back &quot;Shut the fuck up and do as you&#39;re told, think same, stop questioning things you&#39;re making my head hurt.  <em>insert threats of violence here</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Pepper in some mindless appeals to authority that the government is good and wouldn&#39;t do anything like that.  We can trust the fbi and cia.  Right.</p>

<p>And apparently, you can&#39;t ask for these documents because &quot;kids died!&quot; &quot;How would you feel if you were the parents&quot; &quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe the evidence any way you people are never satisfied&quot;   All emotional appeals or personal attacks rather than a logical reason why the public is not entitled to the facts about what happened.  </p>

<p>The overall tone of righteous indignation from those commenting seemed to be nothing short of how a community gets when they persecute a perceived criminal.  Burn them at the stake!   Guilty!  Off with their heads! </p>

<p>And it&#39;s this assumed crime and vehement hatred that makes the whole thing so illuminating of current culture and the danger of free thinking in today&#39;s society.  Fit in, think same, or get violently burned at the stake by the angry mob.  How long until that is no longer figurative but becomes a physical reality?  This is literally becoming like 1984.  </p>

<p>And it is this criminalization of opposing ideas that creates most of the danger.  Why is it wrong?  Why is questioning things so violently opposed?  Besides &quot;it&#39;s wrong.  Kids died!&quot; And &quot;I knew someone who lost their kid&quot;.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the next point, how is it possible for so many people to know someone who lost a child, just so happen to be on reddit, and just so happen to chance upon a thread and comment inside of it?   I realize the news was on the front page today and comments were being shit posted to other subs, but the quantity of people today claiming they knew somebody starts to throw off the probable chance.</p>

<p>All being said, I think people really just want reinforcements and justifications to allow them to not have to think, because thinking is painful and requires you to challenge your deepest thoughts, feelings, perceptions, beliefs, and emotions.  At least conspiracy theorists are (somewhat) able to entertain the opposing view without shutting it down so forcibly and threateningly like we&#39;re not allowed to ask questions.  So because of their deep connection and identity with the structure, system, government, and common ideology  that they so avidly defend, the people will continue looking for reasons to say &quot;See?  Conspiracies don&#39;t exist!  It&#39;s all so simple and straightforward and fits in with my deepest beliefs and world view.&quot;</p>

<p>While conspiracy theorists will continue to ask the ultimate question-- what if there is something there?</p>
