       I've been watching a lot of Illuminati, NWO, satanic media, satanic agenda EXPOSED types of videos and I've heard quite a bit of theories and have seen quite a lot of proof and background that supports these theories. Which theories can you get behind, which ones do you think are total BS?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard so many theories about the depopulation agenda supported by a lot of evidence: mailbox stickers, FEMA camps, GMOs' in food, fluoride in water, support for abortion, news about possible male birth control, sudden exposure of the gays and the LGBT in the media (so called gay agenda). I saw a little glance of a stone thingy that had like rules written on it about the NWO keeping the population around half a billion controlling every aspect of the people and stuff like that (don't really remember much about it).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the whole theory about the pedophile agenda in the industry where child stars are molested as kids (sex kittens, usually symbolised with butterflies, cheetah and leopard print), aswell as the satanic industry in music and Hollywood where people sell their souls for fame and fortune usually proved by all the symbols in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really understand economy and politics that well, but I've heard theories about the agendas collapsing the US and petrodollar to cause chaos in the world for an easy takeover to complete the NWO. Also heard that the 9/11 was an inside job to justify all the attacks on Iran (???) and such, and right now, in more recent events, ISIS was created and is supported by the US to cause the refugee crisis so that people aren't united in Europe for an easy takeover aswell, and they are inducing us with fear and hatred towards muslims with all this anti muslim and ISIS overdose in the supposedly fake and overrun media and with the supposedly set up terrorist attacks. A lot of people say that the real terrorist in the world right now is the US and its secret government behind the curtains.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the theories I've heard of and have compiled to be the most popular. Personally I can get behind all of the theories I talked about all the way to the point religion and satanism ties in. I just cannot... I'm probably biased because I'm not religious, I'm an atheist, but I just cannot imagine stuff like that. I think that the NWO probably is a thing, but about the media and celebrities, I personally think that they are simply used to get our attention away from the real things happening and the truth so that they can keep deceiving us. Which theories do you believe are true?

       I guess it is. But it's kind of like an addiction. It's so interesting, but when I watch the videos I shiver and am paranoid afterwards. The videos make so much sense, but as I said the adrenaline, anxiety is pretty crazy afterwards.

       it's hard to accept, but you have it right. (actually the only part i'm not sure about is the mailbox stickers)
      </p>
      <p>
       regarding the last paragraph, think of the media and celebrities as information warfare to control what the public knows and doesn't know - and, more disturbingly, to control culture and accentuate divisions between the people. (racism, sexism, homophobia, etc., etc.) the satanism and pedophilia is part of the control network.

       Satanism is part of the control network how exactly? You mean it's real? Or is it made up (not by theorists, I mean by the people behind the curtains) to back up some things?

       well it's 'real' in terms of some very powerful people following it as a religion. whether 'satan' is a real entity or just a psychopathic frame of mind, i really can't say.

       this article explains how the control system works - it's very disturbing, but very important that people understand this:

       <a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/intel/bad-things-recommended/">
        Very, Very Bad Things
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Here is a brief description of a typical entry test or ritual to a candidate for membership in the Organized Crime Cabal. he prospect who typically has the potential to be a rising Political Star will be introduced to someone with a soiled track records but lots of money who will offer a partnership of employment to the potential recruit. If the Recruit takes the bait and allows himself to become compromised he is brought into the Organized Crime Cabal and positioned for an additional test of increasing human compromise, if passed can catapult that person all the up the Cabal’s food chain to the highest levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        This might typically be an invitation to a special party of super-elites, Top Policy-Makers who occupy very high positions in the Cartel. Drinks are provided by formally dressed butlers or waitresses and contain either a hypnotic like Placidyl, or a date rape drug like Rohypnal, Scopololine (aka Boradanga) or even a Mickey (Chloral Hydrate). Things get fuzzy and the next thing the “Rising Star” realizes is that he finds himself waking up having sex with a child of either sex.
       </p>
       <p>
        The host catches him, the “Rising Star feels intense shame and is very confused. The host tells him that things must have gotten out of hand, but not to worry, that sometimes these parties get wild and out of control. The host becomes the Rising Star’s new sponsor and explains that sometimes these parties have very young adults that look like kids to entertain the “Big Boys” and this is what happens sometimes. The Host explains that at such a high level in the power structure there is complete trust between compatriots and they cover for each others weaknesses or mistakes. Of course the episode is videoed and photographed and kept “in the can” ready to have the Cabal-owned Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) publish a story that will ruin the “Rising Star” forever within 48 hours if he strays outside his new allowed parameters. This process was featured in the movie “Eyes Wide Shut” by producer Stanley Kubric who was believed to be an “insider”.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now in order to move up to the next level of power a Rising Star must allow himself to be even more compromised, but such is always met with huge increases in rewards, perks, status and income provided (often as “set-aside allocations in foreign numbered bank accounts), so there is very high motivation to advance, especially because Rising Stars have known sociopathic tendencies or they would never have been selected in the first place or entrusted with high positions in the cabal.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Ultimately this process of incrementally increased human compromise leads to a highest level test which can include attending a pedophile party. Sometimes at the highest levels the party is at a hunting lodge and naked kids are hunted like game with high powered rifles. Sometimes babies are sacrificed and their hearts eaten. Sometimes children are sacrificed and then dismembered.
        </strong>

       Ok, that sounds like a horror story. I hope that it's not true, but if it is, then I most certainly do not want to live on this messed up planet anymore, but thank you for that. I've been trying to find some digestible articles online, but every site I come across is like a campaign for tinfoil hat men with ads and donations everywhere and the layouts are really hard to understand. This was very straight forward and understandable.

       History has taught us the world is corrupt. There has been so much greed for power and money throughout history and I don't expect it to change anytime soon. Believing we know all the facts from media and officials is naive and gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       This fact alone should make you doubtful of
       <em>
        every official narrative
       </em>
       especially those involving unlimited amounts of money and totalitarian control. Because that has been the trend for the past few thousand years and that is the trend now and I don't believe it's accidental.

       I think that the media does its thing, and in so far as it generates distraction, there's no reason for a hypothetical cabal of self-interest to involve itself. Why would they if they existed?

       If I were in charge of such a group, I don't think I'd change a thing about the Entertainment industry, and I certainly would not try to involve myself in it. Bread and Circuses works best when the Emperor builds a few colosseums and otherwise generally stays out of it.

       I can get behind that. If there is an enlightened group called the illuminati It would seem to me that they would be "good guys" it could be that there is another group that wants us to think they are the "illuminati" but are actually more like an "ignuminati"  as their ignorance is abundantly clear.

       The actual Illuminati were not "good guys". They weren't really "bad guys" either. They were, for the most part, posers in the world of fraternal societies who never really figured out what their purpose was, vacillating between an anti-monarchist political agenda, an anti-Catholic political/religious agenda and a dabbling interest in Western esotericism.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the problem with conspiracy theory around global agendas. It's hard to believe that they're secret, ultra-competent, unopposed, lucky and consistent enough to actually formulate and promote such an agenda over an extended period of time. Such groups tend to be absorbed by much less directed forces of greed and power-politics.

       I actually think it really makes sense. I don't really believe in satanism in the industry, but rather changing the current system, which back in the day was religion. And the enlightenment period (which is when the Illuminati formed from what I understand) is when people started to push religion away. Illuminati &gt; Enlightened.

       well it's 'real' in terms of some very powerful people following it as a religion. whether 'satan' is a real entity or just a psychopathic frame of mind, i really can't say.
      </p>
      <p>
       this article explains how the control system works - it's very disturbing, but very important that people understand this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.theeventchronicle.com/intel/bad-things-recommended/">
        Very, Very Bad Things
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Here is a brief description of a typical entry test or ritual to a candidate for membership in the Organized Crime Cabal. he prospect who typically has the potential to be a rising Political Star will be introduced to someone with a soiled track records but lots of money who will offer a partnership of employment to the potential recruit. If the Recruit takes the bait and allows himself to become compromised he is brought into the Organized Crime Cabal and positioned for an additional test of increasing human compromise, if passed can catapult that person all the up the Cabal’s food chain to the highest levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        This might typically be an invitation to a special party of super-elites, Top Policy-Makers who occupy very high positions in the Cartel. Drinks are provided by formally dressed butlers or waitresses and contain either a hypnotic like Placidyl, or a date rape drug like Rohypnal, Scopololine (aka Boradanga) or even a Mickey (Chloral Hydrate). Things get fuzzy and the next thing the “Rising Star” realizes is that he finds himself waking up having sex with a child of either sex.
       </p>
       <p>
        The host catches him, the “Rising Star feels intense shame and is very confused. The host tells him that things must have gotten out of hand, but not to worry, that sometimes these parties get wild and out of control. The host becomes the Rising Star’s new sponsor and explains that sometimes these parties have very young adults that look like kids to entertain the “Big Boys” and this is what happens sometimes. The Host explains that at such a high level in the power structure there is complete trust between compatriots and they cover for each others weaknesses or mistakes. Of course the episode is videoed and photographed and kept “in the can” ready to have the Cabal-owned Controlled Major Mass Media (CMMM) publish a story that will ruin the “Rising Star” forever within 48 hours if he strays outside his new allowed parameters. This process was featured in the movie “Eyes Wide Shut” by producer Stanley Kubric who was believed to be an “insider”.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now in order to move up to the next level of power a Rising Star must allow himself to be even more compromised, but such is always met with huge increases in rewards, perks, status and income provided (often as “set-aside allocations in foreign numbered bank accounts), so there is very high motivation to advance, especially because Rising Stars have known sociopathic tendencies or they would never have been selected in the first place or entrusted with high positions in the cabal.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Ultimately this process of incrementally increased human compromise leads to a highest level test which can include attending a pedophile party. Sometimes at the highest levels the party is at a hunting lodge and naked kids are hunted like game with high powered rifles. Sometimes babies are sacrificed and their hearts eaten. Sometimes children are sacrificed and then dismembered.
        </strong>
