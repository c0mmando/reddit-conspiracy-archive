    <div class="md"><p>Fluoride is a byproduct/waste from aluminum refining. Forget about teeth and just think where those trillions of gallons of water go from your drain. We have been saturating the entire ecosystem with this waste for 60+ years. Now it is found in every plant and animal we eat.  Was it there before?</p>

<p>The big question you must ask your self. Does ANY science suggest that fluoride has ANY benefit from consuming it? Do you drink sunscreen? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Harvard did a study over 22 years showing a reduction in IQ up to 7 points between children in heavily fluroidated areas.  Im on mobile so if you cant find it, let me know and i can dig it up later.</p>

<p>as for if it causes damage to people......there is a quik sewrch on youtube you can do &quot;fluoride damage cattle&quot; and &quot;fluoride kills brain cells&quot;.  Then you can search for &quot;Dr. Hirzy and the EPA&quot; for a nice video showing their concerns which went unheard.  You can also look up the &quot;chemical labotomy&quot; and see what was used for.  Also consider how many European countries fluoridate their water, I bet you can count them on one hand an tie them to the US easily.</p>

<p>Its also about consent.  I personally do not consent to this drugging of people without their approval.  I dont approve but am forced to shit shower and shave in it.  Whether people want it or not, there is a drug put in the water and i am forced to ingest it.  In my viewif you want that shit, you shoupd get a device under your sink and you can fluoridate yourself as you like AND you can pay for it all on your own.  Instead, I pay for a drug in my water that reduces the IQ of my children.  Maybe doing dmage to bones as well in adults?  Fluoride does pass the blood brain barrier and does not leave at all or easily.  It accumilates.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is another great quick interview of an author of the book &quot;the fluoride deception&quot; on youtube.  The interesting part is when they have some nice guys in white coats stand in front of a chalkboard and spell it out for you......as if to prove that zero damage can be done.  They paid men in white coats to get on camera and write it down like youre back in grade school, and convince you their science is sound.  Watch the fluoride deception and see if their propaganda still applies.</p>

<p>EDIT - also search youtube for &quot;Rock island fluoride spill&quot;, they had a spill and the chemicals ate through the road.  Ask yourself again if its dangerous or does damage to people.  I think its a simple connection no matter what concentration it&#39;s at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really? Did you even read the link? </p>

<p> &quot;In the lower doses used for water fluoridation, the only clear adverse effect is dental fluorosis, which can alter the appearance of children&#39;s teeth during tooth development; this is mostly mild and is unlikely to represent any real effect on aesthetic appearance or on public health.[37] Fluoride was known to enhance the measurement of bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, but it was not effective for vertebral fractures and provoked more non vertebral fractures.[38]&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so it&#39;s pretty easily established that at high enough doses, fluoride is harmful.  The reason I would be concerned is the unregulated amount that citizens are ingesting given that trace amounts can be found in all types of processed foods, vegetables, fruit etc, in addition to the amount that gets absorbed by your gums using highly fluoridated toothpaste, and the amount absorbed by your skin while taking hot showers (hot water makes our skin more porous) <em>AND THEN</em> we consume fluoridated water.  </p>

<p>With fluorides benefit being unsubstantiated (based on pre-1975 research which was before fluoridated toothpaste was widely adopted,) I am a bit lost as to why this practice is so highly adopted in the current times.  Please read <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010856.pub2/pdf/abstract">this paper, Water fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries (Review) (2015) </a> closely 
and this <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2011/01/an-overwhelming-number-of-scientific-studies-conclude-that-cavity-levels-are-falling-worldwide-even-in-countries-which-dont-fluoridate-water.html">article, &quot;An Overwhelming Number of Scientific Studies Conclude That Cavity Levels are Falling Worldwide … Even In Countries Which Don’t Fluoridate Water&quot;</a>   </p>

<p>Also, i haven&#39;t yet researched this, but if teeth condition is any indication of overall bone health, then dental fluorosis might suggest an individuals overall compromised bone structure.  Again, this needs some verification.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not evaluate the claim that it is helpful?  There is no chemical in the body whatsoever that requires the element fluorine.  It does cause bone and teeth malformation and alters brain function.</p>

<p>Its worth pointing out that every poison can be diluted until it is virtually harmless.  At higher levels you get symptoms of alteration of body function, temporary and/or permanent.  At even higher doses you get obvious symptoms of disease.  At yet higher doses, you get death.  </p>

<p>So why expose yourself to poison unless you get a desirable effect from it?  Even then, why use poisons that bioaccumulate?</p>

<p>If you care, here is an interview with two supporters and one objector. The supporters cite policy and the objector cites science which is not rebuffed.</p>

<p><a href="http://radio.wpsu.org/post/take-note-70-years-and-water-fluoridation-still-controversial">http://radio.wpsu.org/post/take-note-70-years-and-water-fluoridation-still-controversial</a></p>

<p>Here is a Harvard study concluding is lowering your children&#39;s IQ.
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3491930/</a></p>

<p>Science pretty clearly links fluoride with neurologic issues and calcification of your brain, losing intelligence and changing behavior.</p>

<p>At best, science indicates there is no benefit in modern society. As such, there exists no justification to ever add it to water where fluoridated products are readily available.</p>

<p>Hey dumbasspatrol, GTFO. It&#39;s you who are a waste of space. I mean, you actually took up space in this sub. People commented. Provided you with some links and their thoughts, and this is what you contribute? How old are you? Why did you post this? Is this entertainment for you? What else do you do for fun?</p>
