    <div class="md"><p>There was a good post about Wikileaks&#39; connection to russia. Something i never questioned up until the point was that wikileaks seldom (if ever) targets any non western aligned nation/corporation -- correct me if i&#39;m wrong.
Why do we never hear about china and russia&#39;s wrongdoings? </p>

<p>This was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3pobtq/is_russia_secretly_influencing_wikileaks_i_dont/">the post</a>. Lot&#39;s of links in there to investigate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure where I fall about 9/11 being an inside job, but my interest is truly piqued.  The info in there could further confirm what did and didnt happen. Coming from MA here and one of our congressmen, Stephen Lynch, has read it and has made comments that it should be released and the public should know.</p>

<p>Check it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, maybe not. To play devil&#39;s advocate, they could be holding on to it as false gambit. If enough pressure finally comes along demanding they be released, they release them, and the results are underwhelming. This would be a blow to the momentum of the truth movement, even though it did nothing to actually bolster the official narrative or disprove the allegations of the truth movement. In this scenario, it&#39;s not about what can be shown, but how perceptions can be molded. </p>

<p>My honest guess is that it shows financing from inside KSA, possibly from members of the royal family or people with very close connections to them. I don&#39;t think such revelations would be terribly surprising to many people, even those who do not believe 9/11 was an inside job, but it would make it very difficult for the US to maintain its relationship to KSA in the way they have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks Bizzy, I think it goes with their old saying &quot;If you haven&#39;t got anything to hide...&quot; I agree with that on some levels. But the point is, why is it hidden and classified if it&#39;s the truth.</p>

<p>It just smells of trying to cover up a lie.</p>

<p>seriously? dude(ette).  take a stand, mate.  it&#39;s soooooo obvious.  the ONLY thing that is holding you back is your sheer disbelief that your own government (those swines in washington, the lot of them) could possible do such a thing.  apart from that (rather ironic contradiction), it&#39;s so obvious those buildings were controlled demolitions. so obvious.  soooooo obvious omg lol i cant even believe this is still even under deliberation, it&#39;s so so sooooo seriously so obvious.</p>

<p>no, but... that may only be because no one has leaked them to wikileaks yet.  wikileaks can only release what it receives.</p>
