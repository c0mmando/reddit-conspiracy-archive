The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&quot;  --Thomas Jefferson</p>

<p>“The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of consumers.

<p>“When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes… Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.” – Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, 1815</p>

<p>“Issue of currency should be lodged with the government and be protected from domination by Wall Street. We are opposed to…provisions [which] would place our currency and credit system in private hands.” – Theodore Roosevelt</p>

<p>“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.” -Woodrow Wilson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, however, place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as the greatest of the dangers to be feared.
<strong>– Thomas Jefferson</strong></p>

<p>The refusal of King George to allow the colonies to operate an honest money system which freed the ordinary man from the clutches of the money manipulators was probably the prime cause of the Revolution.
<strong>– Benjamin Franklin</strong></p>

<p>We are told that the economic achievement of Western countries has been at the expense of the rest of the world and has impoverished them, so that what are called the ‘developed’ countries owe a duty to hand over tax-produced ‘aid’ to the governments of the undeveloped countries. It is nonsense–manifest, arrant nonsense; but it is nonsense with which the people of the Western countries, clergy and laity, but clergy especially–have been so deluged and saturated that in the end they feel ashamed of what the brains and energy of Western mankind have done, and sink on their knees to apologize for being civilized and ask to be insulted and humiliated.
<strong>– Enoch Powell</strong></p>

<p>No, it is simple historical fact. Remember when the US overthrew its colonial masters because they felt they were being pillaged by a foreign power?</p>

<p>And they were white people being pillaged by white people.</p>

<p>Imagine how the Native Americans felt. Before the white people arrived they owned the whole country. And then those white people set about killing as many of them as they could and stealing everything worth taking.</p>

The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.&quot; --Thomas Jefferson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jefferson was no huge fan of the banking system, but I&#39;ve never seen this quote actually sourced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The Government should create, issue, and circulate all the currency and credits needed to satisfy the spending power of the Government and the buying power of consumers. By the adoption of these principles, the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest. Money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity.” -Abraham Lincoln</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lincoln never said this. This quote is actually attributed to Gerald Grattan McGeer in 1935.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes… Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.” – Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France, 1815</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No primary source for this quote is known.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance.” -James Madison</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a statement by a writer named Olive Cushing Dwinell in 1946. Not James Madison.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.” -Woodrow Wilson</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first half or so of this one is completely fabricated. The last two sentences are grabbed from two of Wilson&#39;s stump speeches. Combine it all together, and you have quite the cherrypicked mound of bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Money is a new form of slavery, and distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal – that there is no human relation between master and slave.” Leo Tolstoy, Russian writer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsourced.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and money system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.” Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a paraphrasing of Ford by congressman Charles Binderup. Here is Ford&#39;s actual quote, from his 1922 book &quot;My Life and Work&quot;:</p>

<p>“The people are naturally conservative. They are more conservative than the financiers. Those who believe that the people are so easily led that they would permit the printing presses to run off money like milk tickets do not understand them. It is the innate conservation of the people that has kept our money good in spite of the fantastic tricks which financiers play–and which they cover up with high technical terms. The people are on the side of sound money. They are so unalterably on the side of sound money that it is a serious question how they would regard the system under which they live, if they once knew what the initiate can do with it.”

<p>I never claimed it proved anything, just saying that there&#39;s no source for the quote. I am certainly less likely to believe a quote is attributed correctly without citation. Especially if it&#39;s bundled with a bunch of obvious fakes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very much developed. In fact the roots of Cryptonote technology is just as much of a mystery as the roots of Bitcoin, which is exactly why Bitcoin core members such as Greg Maxwell, Peter Todd, Wladimir J. van der Laan are either supporting Monero technology or are actively contributing to its development.</p>

<p>To say it is not accepted in as many places is the same argument made by the banks against Bitcoin. There&#39;s a natural curve in terms of it&#39;s deployment.</p>

<p>The only possible technology that can trump Monero in terms of private transactions is Zerocash, and that is something that currently only exists on paper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.&quot; - Albert Einstein. </p>
