       You cannot convince me that Trump is as bad as even some of our more moderate scumbag presidents like Nixon and Kennedy two real prizes when it came to pulling dirty tricks on the public. Most people don't even believe Kennedy was a bad president. That is how much of a slime ball the guy was. The same man who shared Marilyn Monroe with his brother and tried to illegally invade Cuba is seen as a great President.

       I think the most fucked up thing you said is "You cannot convince me". Meaning regardless of what that sycophant does, no one will ever help you adjust your views. No new information, no logical action, nothing will change your mind. It's the quintessential Trump supporter.

       Everybody I've ever heard say idiotic stuff like this always just assumes that they themselves are worthy of remaining alive. Certainly not noble enough to offer themselves up for the good of all mankind.

       I don't care why, there's no logical reason for you to come to that conclusion because some girls didn't like you and you think you are a loser.  I've got my fair share of mental issues and have severe depression and anxiety and I'm not crying about how I'm an outcast and saying people deserve to die because I felt mistreated.   I'm glad you're a coward that's probably why people don't like you and you can't get laid.  Go seek help or fuck off with your attention  seeking nonsense.

       It would be a good start to kill off about 80% of the people. Not any ethical way to do it, but it is a better outcome then slowly suffering and dying anyways as our global ecosystem collapses over the next couple of generations. Don't say some shit like, " Oh well will you give up your life?" Fuck no I won't, I say give everybody guns, and enough food to feed 20% of the world, and I'm gonna kill any motherfucker who gets within 350 yards of my property.

       Did I ever say I would survive? You assumed that. Do you know what assume stands for? makes a ASS of U and Me. Genetic defects should be addressed and should people with incurable STDs diseases, like HIV,AIDS,and Herpes. If you fall into these criteria no reproduction should be allowed. I know I don't have stds and would accept a test for genetic defects. Natural selection used to weed out the weak but we've killed it. I think we should help it some.

       Err, the US pendulum has stuck on far right for so long now they redeveloped the left wing for housing - sure that it could never swing back. Here's hoping they are wrong.

       Nah, it's just that the loonies are further right. Not for nothing are people making comparisons with 1930s germany - with Trump, Carton, etc. pushing the Overton Window into fascist territory as a matter of game playing.

       Which doesn't contradict my point at all. We, as a country, are further left now than we have ever been at any point in our history. Electing Trump won't push us as far to the right as we've been in recent past, much less to anything remotely resembling 1930s Germany. If anything, the left have been the ones pushing the window into authoritarianism.

       Further
       <em>

       - so far right that you don't HAVE a left wing (which was my point).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is playing up to the mouthbreathers, the complete psychos who should have been locked up, with a diet of 'blame the minority', racism, and facism. The rest of the GOP are no better, particularly Cruz and Carson with their 'god with everything, or else' rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on the lite right, we have Clinton, so bought and paid for its not funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only centralist candidate is Sanders, who the press are trying to ignore into oblivion. Even he's not left wing in reality.

       Which is an idiotic point. We aren't discussing international politics. We aren't discussing the politics of another nation. We're discussing the politics of the United States, and within that system, the Democratic Party
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the left wing.
      </p>

       People are just tired of all the bullshit. Politicians are so full of shit, its literally a joke. People are so tired of hearing all this soft talk that is slightly different then the other side, while never touching real issues, like overly powerful militaries like the police forces and the judicial system, campaign contributions, and stazi like spying, branch's of the government engaging in shady shit like mk-ultra or the iran-contra affair, there is only one party, and that is money.

      <p>
       The best way to fuel a movement is to give it something to oppose. The old conservatives want what they want so badly regardless of logic, reason and character is because they have an equally insane opposing force. The PC culture has created things like the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal">
        Rotherham case
       </a>
       where police ignored over a decade of child abuse. Because, you know, they were afraid to be called
       <em>
        racist
       </em>
       or to
       <em>

       An army only stands if they have someone else to fight and the insane, regressive leftism is an excellent target. You've admitted as much yourself by calling it a "fox news talking point"; who do you think watches fox news?

       Honestly they knew. Not trying to come off as condescending but if you think that they went as far as to prop Trump up, but didnt know how wed react, come on now. They track your habits and know how many times you fart a day. They know public opinion of Trump, just like they knew our opinions of Romney. This shit is just a distraction to prop up Hillary or Jeb once were done laughing at Trump. Idk. Just funny to think theres people planning the worlds events having a emergency meeting like " oh no, they arent taking to Trump like we thought they would. What do we do now?"  They knew. They know. This is all part of the plan

       Nah, you give yourself too much credit.  Im not saying theyre fucking geniuses but I am saying people, myself included, are dumb enough to be fooled and manipulated, and other people are smart enough/cruel enough to manipulate and fool those people. Its been happening since the beginning of civilization. Propaganda, lies, rigged elections, etc. Youd be dumb to think that it cant happen in the U.S. when we do it to other countries

       I am relatively liberal(like to think I can separate myself from the regressive left) so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but isn't Trump still relatively establishment?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's basically if Super-Pacs were a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like his policies are weakening the establishment. In fact, I'd say they are going to strengthen it by keeping the money at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't he TPTB? What is he doing that actually fighting against propaganda and manipulation of the American people into meekly following along?
      </p>

       Isn't he progressing that narrative but getting some oohs and ahhs by saying offensive things?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even those stances are just ridiculous. Yes, Islam is a problem but his anti-Muslim rhetoric goes a little far. Yeah, maybe we should crack down on immigration but he takes that a bit far, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, is he doing anything to fight the establishment or the consistent narrative we can see manipulating us both through liberal and conservative upturns in popularity?

       No, he is a billionaire that doesnt have a problem with telling things how they are. There were never conspiracies or claims that Trump was  TPTB until he became a candidate and everyones new boogeyman, and typical the libtard boogeyman, while Hillary has CLEARLY done some extremely, heinous and illegal shit that definitely says she is poor at making decisions for the interests of other. Also, Trump is not a career politician and by proxy has been as sullied as others that have since they walked off a Yale, Harvard or Dartmouth campus

       I think he is potentially the greater good or lesser evil. Money doesn't equate to being an insider in my eyes.

       I personally dont seem him in the establishment because the party he is running with seems to try to buck him everytime he opens his mouth and i think thats because they know he wont play ball.

       Okay, I can accept that line of reasoning for sure. I do love the disruption in the GOP. The DNC maybe needs a more disruptive candidate as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think that even though Sanders is a career politician, he is the candidate willing to disrupt the system from the inside and give a little back to American citizens. I also feel the least danger from Sanders that the rich are just going to get more advantages and more power. Still, I respect where you're coming from with Trump.

       My concerns with Sanders is his socialist perspective. Government Healthcare, Gun Control, etc are all a part of that concept. I believe that agenda is to control the plebs in all aspects so you can put a financial value on "risky" behavior such as bad eating, smoking, drugging, etc and then remove any sort of welfare you are providing for force change. There has been several examples of this move in history, all under the guise of "greater social good"

       I don't think that's completely unfair. Although, he's a proponent for legalizing marijuana so he's at least undoing some past harm in that direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's actually not very strong either way on gun control, and seems to actually lean to less restrictions than his party peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, he does advocate for more government which would be more control, so it's a valid concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think there are some aspects of society the government needs to be in, and TPTB are winning when we are convinced we don't want the government to help us because they're incompetent and crooks. Then the government gets to have nothing to do with helping the people and we asked for it.

       Yes, it seems obvious, but even Trump won't acknowledge that fully. He's been better than the other republican candidates but pretty wishy-washy on the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2010, he wanted to legalize. Early 2015, he said only medical marijuana and made comments that hinted recreational was bad. Late 2015, now he's saying it should be up to the states but hasn't rescinded that it is bad. Like the federalism but he's not acknowledging the failed War on Drugs.

       I maybe a bit biased towards Trump because thats the side i lean, but i have always thought him to know where he is out of his depth and to bring those in around him that understand it. I hope that what I think is true, that he is a brain trust type, like he does with his business

       I was more disgusted by the mass organized molestation of women by foreign men..not to say it wouldn't be disgusting if it was white German native men doing this. I too would be pissed about the Christmas tree though.

       lolwut? who gives a fuck about a tree? That's the problem with you reactionaries, while this event was extremely heinous and I full condemn it, you are all really stupid and care for dumb things. A woman got raped and a bunch more got molested and you care for a christmas tree? Some of these people were probably refugees, others had been in the country for a while. The reason Trump is winning is not because people are fed up of 'cultural marxism' or whatever garbage excuse, its because for the past 8 years the right has been pumping out extremist propaganda against Obama and encouraging this sort of simplistic reactionarism. The republicans have been benefitting from racism since Nixon so its not surprisingly that eventually when you encourage it, at a certain point its going to run out of their hands. Nothing Trump says hasn't been said on fox news or Limbaugh a thousand times lol, he's just capitalizing on the fears of old white people who aren't gonna be in charge anymore. These fears have been encouraged with 8 years of encouraging extremism in response to Obama. It's very simple. "Minorities can do no wrong" is literally a meme lol, the reason why people are hesitant to make these sort of accusations is because dumb fucks like you aren't smart enough to realize that its not all refugees or Muslims or (and this is really the group you hate) non-white people so you end up stabbing Sikhs to death in retaliation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes this is horrible and hopefully those people are arrested because they RAPED A WOMAN and SEXUALLY ASSAULTED many others as well as committed some ROBBERIES which are all real crimes that have victims, not some fake bullshit like an attack on white culture.

       You are wrong in almost all accounts. To treat Obama as some innocent flower being attacked at all sides by Republicans also belies the fact that he and all his supporters have no problem playing the race card when it suits him. He makes idiotic rush to judgement statements almost any time race is the issue forcing him into things like the Beer Summit or making idiotic statements about Trayvon Martin while the investigation is still going on and indirectly eroding George Zimmerman's right to be innocent until proven guilty. Many on his side lied openly and continue to push the "Hands up don't shoot" narrative even though it's been debunked thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides have extremists, and claiming that this is the only reason Trump is just admitting your ridiculous amount of ignorance. I personally can't stand Trump, but his appeal is far more than right wing extremism. It's the willingness to completely ignore the worst elements of Political Correctness which have been seen specifically on college campuses where civil rights are a distant second to students comfort zones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I probably would detest a President Trump as much as you, but when you have the other parties frontrunner is a woman that even her supporters know would do anything and everything legal or not to get elected, there aren't exactly a lot of stellar options.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a president staging a weep-in pushing executive orders that will do nothing towards his stated goal, a Democratic front runner in hiding because the less she is seen/heard the better it is for her numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you still want to claim that it's pure stupidity and right wing extremism leading to Trump? Both parties have horrible leaders both in the highest office and running for the highest office. Trump, while uncouth, racist, and sexist does one thing that literally no other politician in the race besides maybe Bernie Sanders does: Speak his mind and genuinely seems to at least look like he believes what he says. It sickens me that he does believe some of the stupidity, but people are drawn to someone who doesn't seem to give a shit when the rest of the party establishment is pure BS. Is the excitement around Sanders because he's a socialist hard left wing idealogue or because he's a passionate guy who speaks his mind. I'd argue the latter.

       I never said this. Saying something bad about one side isn't saying something good about the other. I have endless criticisms for Obama. But the way that the right just allowed every sort of conspiracy to run wild, ie birther conspiracy, and encouraged all sorts of insanity such as that, is what lead to Trump. Their party base has been primed for this for 8 years now.

       Not really, democrats are moderate leftists or center rightists for the most part. Sanders is about the furthest left he is and I don't consider that to be 'extremist' at all, compared to the quasi-fascist trump and the other redneck fanatic candidates.

Outside of academia and other elite enclaves, Socialism has never had mass appeal here in the U.S. One might make a case that it was a realistic option with grass roots appeal during the 1930's. To that I say whatthefuckever
Another black man will be elected before a socialist inhabits the White House

       I don't think and didn't say that socialism has mass appeal amongst Americans in general but obviously there is a sizeable portion of the population who backs him, precisely for his socialist policies. The same sort of people who supported the occupy movements and such. This segment of the population is real so, idk what else to say

       I wasn't taking issue, just pointing it out. Even a great many activists I know or with who I am acquainted aren't truly down for a socialist republic. The truth is Americans hold private property sacrosanct. If Americans were told that all the wealth the "shifted" in 2008-2009 was shifted to feed clothe and house every homeless an woman and child in America, and that is he bailout would be spent on education and dismantling the military industrial complex, how many socialist or socialist leaning types would be ok with grandma's pension evaporating ? Or God forbid, their own pension.
Just sayin. American socialist love socialism until they are asked to sacrifice materially. Generalization...? Yep. Shades of truth...Boom

       Dude what? Maybe I'm just too high but no idea what you're talking about here. I've never once said most Americans support socialism but some clearly do... and Idk why pensions would evaporate. You seem to be hopelessly deluded to what socialist actually entails which is a perfect example of the average Americans attitude. But there are Americans who think differently from you, maybe that's hard to accept?

       I'm not too high, and I never said there aren't plenty of Americans that have socialist tendencies. The analogy may have been a bit tortured, but I stand by it. This country will never elect an outright socialist. I dare say Americans won't elect Bernie Sanders. Elections here are bought and paid for

       I never said Trump was ok, You conveniently excluded that I would be as unhappy or moreso about a Trump president. It's just idiotic to claim it's all stupidity and racism. It just reflects a lack of thinking critically about all the elements that go into a protest vote. Do you think France has as much or more racist elements that caused Jon Marie Le Pen to end up in a runoff with Chirac back in the late 90's early 00's? It was a protest vote against the status quo in France. Chirac won over 70% of the vote in the general election but the message was sent. It's not because 30ish% of French voters liked everything the racist Le Pen had to say. He was primarily anti-establishment, and given as you said that neither side is doing well right now, even a guy saying idiotic racist/sexist things is appealing to people because he's not willing to rollover at criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not a great man or a great candidate, but he is willing to insult the politicians that support the status quo of funneling our tax money into whatever lobbyist will help re-elect them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But just like the lie about Nixon and the Southern strategy, your view will become enshrined as the "truth" about this election and will be paraded out for decades to come on the left, because it's a hell of a lot easier then having to actually think about these issues. It's much easier to smear those you disagree with politically and probably much more gratifying. nothing like a sense of superiority over your fellow man.

       So you say, but you seem real willing to vote for him and are putting a lot effort into defending a vote for him. Seems somewhat contradictory to me. And you're a moron because you care more about Trump insulting other politicians or fox news people or whatever and think that is somehow making him worthy of support. You ignore the batshit insane thing he's proposed like stripping muslims of their civil rights or deporting them, because he's STICKIN IT TO DEM LIEBERALS!!!1 Like come on man have some perspective you're just proving exactly what I've been saying the whole time.

        You start out in 1954 by saying, "Nigger, nigger, nigger." By 1968 you can't say "nigger" — that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights and all that stuff. You're getting so abstract now [that] you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites.

       Again, you bought the Southern Strategy thing, so of course you won't think deeply about this stuff. I will not vote for Trump if he wins the nomination. I'll stay home and weep for my country if it comes down to a cad and a lying opportunist. I said his appeal is that he insults politicians who tow the line on the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not proving your point, because your point is that it's racism and stupidity that are the reason for Trump's winning, His policies are what people point to to prove his racism (along with the idiotic statements he makes)
      </p>
      <p>
       You just admitted that his insults, not his policies (which is what I said is part of his appeal) may actually be a bigger part of his appeal and then pretended that made your point when it's the exact opposite of your point, meaning a lot of people are ignoring his idiocy and racism because he's sticking it to "DEM" politicians of both stripes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there are Republicans fed up with the establishment who also like that he sticks it to the Boehner's of the world (double entendre FTW) just as much as Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you can idiotically assume that I would support him, and I don't care, because I know the truth, but again all this argumentation on your part just proves you are willing to think the absolute worst of the people who don't think like you and it's more a reflection on you then them. Lazy and weak thinkers demonize their opposition in order to dismiss them. It's endemic in both parties nowadays, so you can piss and moan about left and right, but you are no better than someone who moans about DEM LIBERALS because you make idiotic generalization instead of actually thinking critically about the ideas and principles presented. But I get it, it's a lot easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence why you idioitically reduce people to not wanting blacks in their neighborhood.

        I'm not proving your point, because your point is that it's racism and stupidity that are the reason for Trump's winning, His policies are what people point to to prove his racism (along with the idiotic statements he makes)

      <p>
       My original point was that you right wing types care about stupid shit and you prove this by defending a man who wants to strip people's civil rights because he insults other politicians and you somehow think that's 'sticking it to the system'.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You just admitted that his insults, not his policies (which is what I said is part of his appeal) may actually be a bigger part of his appeal and then pretended that made your point when it's the exact opposite of your point

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, specifically they are appealing to you. Most Americans like him because as I said earlier its the propaganda that the right wing has been pumping out for last 8 years (and they obviously did the same thing during Clinton years). The insults are just a symptom of that, other republicans are force to go against the exact same stuff they have been promoting for entirely of the Obama administration.

        I think there are Republicans fed up with the establishment who also like that he sticks it to the Boehner's of the world (double entendre FTW) just as much as Hillary.

       No they probably think they aren't real republicans

       Except for my point is backed up by evidence and I've shown you why I think I'm right while you haven't really put up much of an argument lol.

       Oh and I'm not an American, I don't like democrats either. And I don't even are if Trump wins, it'll be the end of the American empire and maybe even some civil war which for me would be fucking hilarious.

       Exactly!  If i wasn't a cheap bastard I would give you gold for this one.  Thanks for saying what needed to be said.  If these reactionary idiots would ever stop spewing racist bullshit and anti-intellectual nonsense and actually think bigger they might realize what is actually going on and fix something, instead they make everything they are trying to say and do appear to be a Clive Bundy supremacist circlejerk under a flaming cross.

       how is that? He has a point of view that opposes yours? imho you're a shitlord neckbeard c*nt because you dont use rational thinking and anyone can take your emotions for a quick spin by saying something that you dont agree with.

       ok, well still my point is, its his opinion and you dont like it because it differs from yours. You dont look at things from a rational perspective but an emotional one. "He is another idiot because he believes something i dont agree with, and by default i am more intelligent". Why dont you quit cutting corners and go get a dick extension
      </p>
      <p>
       My Opinion: All religions are evolutionary and go through periods of extremism and violence. Christians, Hindus, Jews all of em, even the smaller ones. Eventually once the religion becomes affluent enough to fear loosing that due to conflict and violence it will calm the fuck down for its own survival. Islam is not special, its going through the same throws that all religions do when they are a teenager. They will either become extinct or carve out enough resources to fear them being taken away and will calm their tits. Also, it doesnt help they have a western hating douche at the top of the food chain perverting their doctrine. You would be up in arms and having your period if the pope was indoctrinating catholics to kill Muslims and Islam is the Anti-Christ

       edit: my apologies, I don't think an arrest was made. An arrest was made for denouncing Merkel but not online, it was in public. However, they did try to propose the Facebook measures. Either way its fucked up.

       Fucking hell, I get the sentiment as much as the next realpoliticker but for fuck's sake censorship is like lying about something you know will get out anyway that will make everything worse once it does. I just think there are smarter solutions than bowing to a need to appease fear by not reporting relevant news.

       That's just silly. Everything most cultures enjoy came from another cultures. In fact, the more isolated a culture is, the more 'barbaric' they seem. Do you know why Arabic culture has been so violent for so long? they reject anything other then arabic culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Western culture isn't that. Let's take soccer. Massive around the globe, but technically a cultural british phenomenon. Yet it is massive in a) South America, B) all of europe c) parts of africa / asia.

       How about the delicious "american" hot dog? except sausages are very Central European. 99/100 things you relate to as your "cultural thing" is almost always a part or creation of another culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Societies that don't embrace and learn from other cultures die out, Look at Athens Vs Sparta. Which one of them truly had a lasting impact? (It wasn't the isolationist spartans)

       If only the societies could decide that for themselves. But these days it's decided "for" them by the  P2B in USrael and some deluded megalomaniacal  secret societies.

       If you want to live in a multi cultural society which is only glued together by a stable economy and force that's your prerogative.

       I don't want to live in such society with a higher violence level and inherent risk of a bloody tribalism backlash. I want to go through every part of country without fear which is unfortunately not the case anymore due the influx of alien cultures which follow their own moral codex.

       Well the culture doesn't explain African American crime stats. Every race has different genetics like how Africans have more testosterone which is believed to cause the higher rates of violence. It isn't racist to point that out, people just say racist when they don't want things discussed, like these mods deleting these post.

       Dude the south really isn't racist as most of the country. I've lived in the south east my entire life and people from all races pretty much get alone and work together, and be nice to each other. Yeah, people say lots of racist shit, " niggers walk so dam slow." Or " niggers are loud as fuck." But its not them trying to divide people, its just simply the truth. Like when black people say that white boys don't dance or some shit. It's just pretty much the truth. Yet everybody gets along and I would give a well dressed black man, a job before a white guy who didn't care as much. It doesn't really have anything to do with race as much as culture. People are pretty much the same, its just stupid ideas people get infected with.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that Arabs are raping, half retarded savages. It's just Islam is a raping, half retarded religion. We shouldn't hate these people but feel sorry for them, because they have been robbed of their precious gift of life. A women walking around with a towel on their heads? Lol. I still don't want them in my country because they're too stupid to live in a modern society. They literally have to have the ignorance breed out of them. In the meantime they can fix their own country, and the world can quit stealing their natural resources, and maybe things might actually change.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have our own stupid people to worry about. We got a huge group of people who have absolutely no idea how the real world works. While there out shopping on credit, listening to their 500 dollar pocket computer that cost 100 dollars to make with slave labor, they stuff their mouths with pure shit, and drive a 3000 pound machine to haul a 200 pound person around. Literally warming the earth more and more every year. Then they get pulled over by a chump in a suit who actually bullshit him into giving his people money so he don't get caged. He then leaves and for his job where he works 12 hours a day for barely enough money to survive, because you know, trickle down economics and capitalism and shit. He then goes to his wife, who is a goddamed femenist, because apparently that's a real problem in the world. Even though nobody will pay her as much as her husband because she can't do shit but answer a phone and do paper work. While her husband is quite literally working so hard that he doesn't even want to think or argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       He then talks to little Johny his kid who is extremely confused about the world because his teachers literally fill his head with pure fiction about how the world works. Completely missing the parts in history class where the US government smuggled drugs into the country, and sent guns out. Tried to mentally break down mental institution patients and turn them into killers, or the part where the allies had made agreements to fight Germany to the end in ww1 so they could decide up its empire. The don't talk about how rich families fund politicians or anything just pure propaganda bullshit.
      </p>

       Then little Johny goes out with his friends, but their all wearing fedoras and glasses and tight pants and they are trying to be cool and hip, because they are so insecure they try to change who they are to please society. Little Johny then goes and and gets on his bike but BOOM a fucking bomb kills his ass because the all wise, all knowing yanks, in Washington have no idea how reality works either because they were all from rich lawyer families and never had to deal with the real struggle of the common man. They think that no matter what, their ideals of all people being happy in a respectful, non threatening, non offensive candy land of gay ass fuckers and hippies, trumps everyone's right to not have to live by Muhammad, who probably has raped atleast a few underage kids and goats while in the taliban.

       My whole point is that there is no perfect right and wrong. There is no better way of life then another. There's just common sense and peoples right to have repugnant perspectives. People should be letting people pour in when I have 200 dollars coming out of every check for taxes, that all goto bullshit. I'm barely surviving, and its hard to find decent paying work, but yet we are worried about these fucking people who haven't even grown out of their religion yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just give it time and give people space, quit acting like you know more then someone else about anything, when you have no fucking idea. Just the fact that you immediately assume you understand things enough to tell someone else's society how to live, shows how foolish you are. Just let things work there self out and let things flow.

       He basically people are people, and in general. Nobody really knows what they're talking about. People are always trying to push their "higher" ideals on other people, but in reality. Most people are genuinely good people if a little confused. Every culture has its own problems, and multiculturalism shouldn't be forced on people.

       Hm... I wonder? OH I KNOW! It's because of EVERY SINGLE ARAB NATION on earth wants to execute every single one of them, meanwhile you white assholes sit in your houses watching bias cnn news talk about how many palestinians were killed while they were trying to blow up innocent Israelies. So while you grumble about how Israel isn't taking in refugees just think about if this is what they could do in a country that is mostly christian, imagine what they could do in a country that is mostly jewish.

       Its sad that I probably would have been one of the ones asking that had I not recently been smacked upside the head with the reality of a ban for something completely retarded.  Getting a shitty response from a mod after I asked what had happened and then still being banned after I 1) politely pointed out that they misinterpreted what I said and 2) actually
       <em>
        apologized
       </em>
       for poor wording even though it was completely unnecessary to do so was a real eye-opener.

       Considering the majority of my ~20k karma
       <em>
        each
       </em>
       in posts and comments over the last year come from my contributions to their sub and the fact that I've been called a 'libtard' or whatever more times than I can count, its pretty surreal that I'm suddenly too much to the right for them. They've totally jumped the shark.

       I agree obviously refugees are anything but infallible, but it's hard to argue that this video paints any kind of counter narrative. Maybe we watched some different video or I'm missing something, but this seems like a bunch of young men, probably drunk, deciding it would be a good idea to push a car down a stair. The young men happen to be Arab in appearance. Not are Arab's are refugees and there is no reason to think these one's are. On the other hand, small examples such as this video don't prove anything and least of all causation. First they don't establish a pattern. This was a crazy thing to do, but from one video we have no way of knowing if this is really a pattern or just an isolated indent. I'm sure I could find instances of perfectly "normal" Europeans doing the same sorts of things. We also certainly can't say this is happening because they are Arab, do I need to tell you the differences in crime rates between Black Americans and White Americans? I hope not. I also hope you would not argue that the differences are because of something to do with the African condition or that we should deny are Africans asylum because of the actions of a few.

       I find that very doubtful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please note though I was talking specifically about the video above, which only has the pushing cars down stairs and the Christmas tree. In the latter case, because you bring it up, we don't even see the race of the person doing it. Burning a Christmas tree seems like exactly the kind of juvenile thing an idiot would do. On the other hand, countries have border control for a reason and I can only hope that Europe's external borders will be strengthened, but I feel that's a very different issue from this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to nothing of this kind or thing never occurring in Germany before I can only say that a lot of things occur in countries for the first time every day and the news loves the narrative of everything going south so I tend to take it with a grain of salt when they make statements like that. Terrible shocking crime, but we're still in the early stages. Give it some time to work out the full story.

       i'm not disagreeing however why is it always muslims used as the rabid attack dog? something in islam makes its adherents easy weapons to exploit. just point them to where you want violence, make them feel angry about some slight sleight or other and off they go.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl,dr: even if it was subterfuge - islam's consensus belief that violence is an acceptable tool and that attacking women and kafir is legal is a huge problem in and of itself.

       I think it is the other way around. In the beginning you hear like a hundred people screaming and all of a sudden it is gone and there are maybe 10. Just to be clear: I am not a muslim nor afiliated... Image and sound just don't correspond

       To be clear, I don't have a hidden agenda against Muslims or anything but here's the tape:

       and to me, the sound seems appropiate for the situation. At 0:02 you hear the 'Allahu Akhbar'.

       Why would they show residence certificates while doing this shit? Unless by trying to raise hate against actual asylum seekers. This is by dividing local population and immigrants that ISIS makes most new recruits. Going all "the immigrants did this" is obviously the goal.

       Do you not think that others might be intelligent enough as to glean this for themselves in the same way that you did? Censorship is never a good thing. Assuming that someone won't think the way that you do after reading an article is no reason to censor it.

       Its funny how specific subreddits went seaking money recently and then when the parent company rightly laughed in their faces they went dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit suddenly became the reddit i remember from 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fairly certain they will never go dark again because it showed they are volunteers who have gone power crazy  and cant easily be ejected and that reddit is far better off without them.

       Completely agree, Joined Reddit in 2012 and even the comment section is different, more based on memes than quality content. There isn't one way to really pinpoint why it has happened other than reddit becoming more popular and more unintelligent users flooding in. The main viewed subreddits of this website's comment sections are literally a just lighter version of
       <a href="/r/circlejerk">
        /r/circlejerk
       </a>
       , it really is. The biggest turning point was the Boston Bombings, the whole website lost confidence in itself after that whole incident and the quality just took a plunge. Yet, I do not understand why as everyone makes mistakes, Redditors should have not let that one incident kill the confidence to make a difference. It's almost like the mods have taken advantage of this slowly and have lost the true basis of the culture that Reddit used to be. It is because the admins and mods know no matter what they do, reddit will still prevail because users aren't as serious and focused on the content anymore. All the people care about is the circlejerking meta. And what can we do about it, make a post complaining about it, that will just be downvoted because it is outside the stupid meta? No, you either leave or deal with it because there is no way to change it. The only people in power who can change it are the moderators, and they have proven that is never going to happen. I take it light heartedly but miss how things used to be, redditors were more empowered to make a difference in the world, now it's just more focused on the current "meta" of the website. Yet I can't step away...

       Damn dude, no need for such language- surely a good argument can stand on its own without needing to resort to name-calling. You're making a million assumptions about this one moderator- why? All it seems to do for you is to make you angry. For all you know this guy might completely agree with you but has to do what higher-up mods tell him. Lumping this and every other mod on that sub as against your personal beliefs? Sounds like a pretty black-and-white opinion to me

        /r/worldnews

       are pushing their agenda that everything is fine through censorship, while on the other hand there are hundreds of extremely bigoted articles that jump to conclusions that seek to undermine the entire refugee system based on a single story. Pushing an anti-Muslim agenda by making a feast out of a fucked-up sex crime without attempting to discern any details is just as stupid as desperately hiding all evidence that might harm your cause. This polarization and emotionally-charged, pre-determined argument is so fucking old.

       Not justifying the mods' view, but that clip from Brussels has nothing to do with refugees. The destruction of cars has long been a thing for NYE in this part of Europe (in France alone, around 1000 cars are burnt every year that night) and these guys are most likely french-speaking Belgium citizens. They're still assholes, though.

       This is confirmation bias though (on the Brussels incident) I'm sure there are many acts of vandalism like this, but we just see the ones where they shout "Allahu ackbar" and think to ourselves "it's those Islam again."

       Five years ago I'd browse reddit almost daily and find all the major news happenings before any other site. The last year or so, I actually find everything somewhere else. Then I click on reddit to see if it's on the frontpage. Nope nothing. Takes more than a couple of hours for the news to appear here.

      <p>
       Someone decided to use this site as their toilet paper a while ago, and I think we're caught in it.

       So I read a few of the banned posts.  This will not be popular here but the mod has a point.  All of the articles I read alluded to men who "looked" like they were of North African descent but no actual men or their backgrounds have been identified.  There was also no religious identification made against them and people seem to want to tie it to the refugees but have nothing concrete to prove it.  There's no reason this should affect the refugees at all, they are still in danger from the civil war and still need help.  Like the mod said, plenty of German citizens are of middle eastern or North African descent, its unlikely the people making the accusations know of the attackers' citizenship status so to jump to that conclusion from a computer half a world away is not only ignorant but dangerous: this is how angry mobs get started.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know World News's policy and I'm sure every mod has their biases, but that is 13 stories in a period of about 14 hours.  How many constitutes spam to you people?  Whatever your definition of spam, it seems one repost an hour probably qualifies, right?  Or maybe they were reposted as they were deleted, I don't know, I can't exactly see when the posts were deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, like the mod said, that subreddit isn't a place to post your biases.  They have to weed out stories and make sure there's a more neutral agenda.  Assume that the people who posted those stories did have an anti-immigration agenda, how would their posts look any different?  Unsubstantiated allegations of how a group of people "looked like" in the dark?  I'm sure they mods would accept a more neutral story, one that simply alleges attacks happened but make no mention of the imagined ethnicities and citizenships of those involved but each of the stories seem to want to tack on the pointless slur on where these attackers came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the full story is out later, when arrests have been made and people identified, I'm sure there will be some actual MENA men among those, but the difference is at that time, we'll know for sure.

       SJWs use Logical Fallacies to attack people until they back off because Reason isnt their tool. Do as I do, understand how they use the fallacies and then call em on it and tell them to use reason. Its like watching a seizure happen.

       I might be wrong, but didn't "incidents" happen across multiple cities? When you sum it up, you could get close to that figure.

       And the others were harassed, I don't think that makes it any less of a "violation".

       I think the 200 number comes from the number of women that have been reported to have been harassed. Not just the ones that made files or the one that was raped by penetration. I'm guessing more reports will come in.

       Sexual harassment and sexual assault (attacks) are different things though. It mentions a lot of the time it was someone harassing them whilst their friend nicks stuff. Not that, that makes it fine but it's better than groping everyone like some of them where.

       It was 1 rape, about 20 sexual assaults. Not 200. And it were about 100 people who did this who belonged to a group of thousand people. Just don't lie about these things, as it is easy to identify this lie, which results in nobody believing that anything happened. But what happened is worse enough

       Okay you are right. All of the 1.1 million immigrants raped dozens of women. Even the few women and children among them molested our girls. My girlfriend and mother were raped several times, but I'm paid by the government to defend the immigrants because I don't know. Make something up.

       If you simply make up numbers it doesn't help your argument. It's 237 sexual harassment cases till now. Okay so you say if 1000 people out of 1.1 million molest women it's logical to assume all refugees rape women? I mean this is a special kind of stupid. Are you able to use google translate?

       Is that really what happened though? All I can gather from my reading is that over 1,000 individuals were partying/going nuts in the streets on NYE and apparently men started grinding up on women as a way to distract them to be pitpocketed. Only one woman was actually raped from what I gather, the rest of the assaults are listed as "molestation" which could be any form of unwanted touching, which is basically anytime a motherfucker bumps into you. Can someone give me some better/different sources that refute this or is everyone freaking out over something that happens every god damn day.

       <p>
        One man described how his partner and 15-year-old daughter were surrounded by an enormous crowd outside the station and he was unable to help. "The attackers grabbed her and my partner's breasts and groped them between their legs."
       </p>
       <p>
        We walked through the group of men, there was a tunnel through them, we walked through … I was groped everywhere. It was a nightmare. Although we shouted and hit them, they men didn’t stop. I was horrified and I think I was touched around 100 times over the 200 metres.”

       Ever been at a frat house? Ever seen pictures of naked chicks that probably don't remember what they did the night before while your buddy brags about it like it's some fucking accomplishment?!? Rape happens every day. I'm not condoning it, I'm pointing out a fucking fact, literally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe these events happened. Why they happened is what I'm searching for? What's the motive? Why would a bunch of migrants seeking asylum do this? Wouldn't it make more sense to Isis to do this to poison us against migrants? Just thinking out loud here feel free to interject...

       If you want to argue about date-rape and drunk people fucking eachother is an overblown issue, there's a time and a place to have that discussion. That's completely irrelevant to the fact that 1000 immigrants enmasse went on a
       <strong>
        violent
       </strong>
       sexual assault spree with 100-200 victims in a single night is another beast entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be so quick to call it a political statement on part of the perpetrators, but if you do think there's a motive behind it, if you don't just think it's a mob mentality of backwards, violent, and reprehensible shitheads who think they won't get caught, then it could simply be a racist, sexist, and culturally motivated attack on western european people. Something like, teaching those women a lesson, or some horseshit.

       That's a fair assessment, and honestly, thank you for being in depth and actually answering questions (because most my inbox messages are hate mail currently) and proposing ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit, one place my mind went to, was:
What do I think would happen if I were an attractive scantily clad woman who was out that night? One thing is for sure, if I had seen what looked like a bunch of migrants crowding an alley, I would've stayed the fuck at home. But that ain't right, people shouldn't have to live in fear and be forced to use common sense in place of the rule of law, the rule of law should stand supreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summation, I hope that any and all involved parties have their day in court with justice being served. Hopefully swiftly (fat chance if their judicial system is anything like ours).

       Stop trying to justify or brush this away. This was an unprecedented, coordinated attack on women, whatever the motive, and it has been confirmed from arrest reports that the perps were of ME/NA descent. What more do you need, one of them to rape you?

       I don't condone the behavoir, it is truly reprehensible. Bad things happen every day though. What makes this any different from all the rapes, robberies, and molestations that happen every NYE or every friday night for that matter? That's all I'm asking. Why is this story so much bigger?

       Honestly, it's a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw, among others and on a case-by-case basis. I was a forum moderator when I was 15 or so, what else are you going to do all day when you're that young? I hope I wasn't a total idiot, but I'm sure some things went somewhat badly since I was pretty inept at the time.

       There's a comic that explains it much better than me, but for all movements/parties/persuasions/ideologies, there's always a fringe group of crazies that make their voices heard louder than everyone else on the team, and it's often the basis for more needless distancing between the sane members.

       If you are really not sarcastic, then depending on your location you may just need to visit the nearest university to experience modern liberalism at its "best". Be sure not to discuss what liberalism is, it's not the only word ending with -ism they misuse, and you really don't want to "trigger" anyone there with a logical question.

       Admittedly, it's been almost 10 years since I was at university, and I went to a jock school, but I recall a distinct lack of anything that smacked of censorship, PCism, etc. Just the opposite - most people seemed to want to push the envelope.

       If you have Facebook, follow Maajid Nawaz, Ali A Rizvi, and Faisal Saeed Al Mutar. They are always harping on the regressive left as secular/liberal Muslims. Maajid Nawaz was the one that coined the term.

       You're right, it's just awkward to hear because modern liberalism is supposed to be about moving forward and extending power and freedom to more people. But you can have regressive liberals just like you can have progressive conservatives.

       Here's some more proof - The mods deleted every comment chain that in any way didn't fit their position, waited until some acceptable astroturfing got upvoted enough and then locked the thread for new comments.

       I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.

       I don't know about r/Europe, but no r/worldnews does not, in any way, slant to the right. At all. It does not. It does not even consider shifting its weight to the right. Ever. I don't know what site you've been visiting but it hasn't been r/worldnews.

       It's still censoring if they do everything in their power to prevent people from seeing it. The Chinese government is still censoring the Internet there even though you can get the information they try to hide if you go somewhere else.

       Reddit isn't the Chinese or US government, it's a private business. You could easily read it on every site that's being linked to reddit. I don't understand how you can say you're being censored. A business won't let you use their platform to post something that could easily be posted elsewhere isn't censorship. Reddit isn't even preventing these discussions from taking place. There is no censorship. Grow up.

       EDIT: You people really must live sad lives if this is what's driving your day.

       I don't think I'm being censored. When an organization prevents the pervasion of a piece of information within itself, that's censorship. Size of the organization isn't part of that classification.

       Is your only frame of reference in life this website? I get the feeling it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fail to see why if you can't get something on one site you wouldn't simply look to another site to find the information, but rather spend a more significant portion of your time bitching you couldn't find the info on the first site you looked. It's a big internet. You don't need to spend all your time in one place.

       You can go somewhere else, just like you can leave China if you wanna watch YouTube. Or just VPN. By your logic it's only censorship if it's impossible to get around.

       It's being censored on Reddit by subs claiming to host world news...

       Of course it's not complete internet censorship but it give Reddit less credibility.

       The PTB run this site the way they want. It's their site. They can slant, censor or manipulate it as they see fit. We get that. What we are doing is calling them out on it. Dissent is patriotic right? We are speaking truth to power. If the PTB quash us it's all good but organizations, countries and websites are judged on how they handle dissent. Reddit has become a parody of what it was supposed to be about. Besides without a few of us to kick against the jerk this place would become an inbred, echo chamber. Is that what you want?

       Not only that, but they're only "censoring" it to prevent giving themselves a fuckton of work. Articles like this inevitably lead to massive gender war arguments in the comments and massive gender war arguments inevitably lead to people getting doxxed and harassed and shit. It's preemptive modding. That's all it is.

       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all

       and that seems to be the obvious answer. The mods suck in general and take random stuff down for whatever reason. That and the fact I saw people posting elsewhere to actually brigade those sorts of threads so I can imagine "fuck it, not dealing with it" is the likely answer and not anything political.

       Funny thing about that drama. The top mod of
       <a href="/r/subredditdrama">
        /r/subredditdrama
       </a>
       deleted the initial post and reposted it for his own karma, then he started to circlejerk inside the post while a national drama was going on (not kidding).

       for almost a decade, while the people who really care about making and tending communities get punished. That's reddit for you.

       <a href="/r/news">

       The original sub for news was being spammed with 9/11 posts. So they made
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

        . Just keep it out of worldnews.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       However, the rest of the quote, a response to a question reads as such:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       That's stupid. We've been using that error message as a joke for over two years.

       No, it was only remove from the worldnew reddit, which clearly says it is for non-US news.

       That's really not our style. Everyone has a place on reddit, even conspiracy nuts. In fact, there's a whole reddit devoted to just that:

       Is it brash and obnoxiously worded?  Absolutely.  Is it not also refuting that very claim, albeit arguably badly?

       I have no idea what the official description is, but my impression is that it would be news that would be of interest to a GLOBAL audience - that is, things of interest to humans anywhere, regardless of where they actually lived.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be the opposite to news that would be of primary interest largely to those of a specific locality.

       Mods that Systematically filter what can and can't be posted isn't moronic, it's a very smart way to control the flow of information/propaganda.
      </p>

       What's moronic are the reddit users who upvote it to the front page without checking the source and OP's post history.

       Meh while it probably isn't "jews" that are controlling reddit's narrative, the
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       mods certainly are opting to selectively enforce their rules only when posts go against the narrative, even bending or "interpreting" the rules to justify their deletions.

       Much (most?) of the blatant racism/ anti-Semitism and much of the other trash you see in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is posted by trolls seeking to defame/destroy this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people
       <strong>
        HATE
       </strong>
       this sub, not because of "racism", but because subject matter is regularly posted and discussed here that they consider TABOO, as it might tend shed light on certain aspects of news, history, etc. that they don't want publicized, lest
       <em>
        "uncomfortable questions"
       </em>
       be raised.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are entire subs devoted to smearing
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , either by mocking the sub and its members, or by pointing to instances of "RACISM", their goal being to drive people like you away out of fear that they might be smeared as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can't find enough "evidence", they create alts, and post filthy material themselves. Then they summon their Komrades to the filthy post, and upvote it. This is
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       speculation; "HATERS" have been busted on several occasions, and some have even openly admitted to their "crimes". Example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1tk4nq/in_which_ubipolarbear0_summons_his_voting_brigade/">
         In which /u/BipolarBear0 summons his voting brigade on IRC to mass-upvote one of his many "blatantly anti-semitic posts in /r/conspiracy"
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the link, here is an image of his alerting his pals via IRC so that the
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/9Iz12h2.png">
        upvote brigading can begin.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1ywspe/new_snowden_doc_reveals_how_gchqnsa_use_the/cfow0mp?context=3">
         Here is a thread where he makes a full admission
        </a>
       </strong>
       , excusing it as an "experiment" - which of course is a lie, as we saw above that he was alerting the Brigadiers.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another occasion, a notorious troll wrote an article on a neo-Nazi website, declaring that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is a "fertile ground for recruiting". It turned out that this supposed "neo-Nazi" was actually a young Jewish man by the name of Joshua Ryne Goldberg, who frequented this sub under various aliases, and was also active in the HATE subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       As it turned out, he went too far with the trolling, and wound up getting busted by the FBI for trying to incite Muslims into building bombs and killing people. Here's the expose' thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       [
       <strong>
        Racist Stormfront article declaring r/Conspiracy as a "Fertile Ground for Recruitment" for white supremacists was actually written by Joshua Ryne Goldberg - the Florida Jew recently arrested by the FBI under terrorism-related charges
       </strong>
       ](np.reddit.com
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/">
        /r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course Goldberg was something of an anomaly. Most of the HATERS that troll this sub are no where near as recklessly dangerous as that guy (at least I hope not). Here's the latest on Troll Boy:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="http://jacksonville.com/news/crime/2015-12-03/story/psychologist-finds-orange-park-man-who-plotted-terrorist-act-be-mentally">
         Psychologist finds Orange Park man who plotted terrorist act to be mentally unstable
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mentally unstable?
       <strong>
        <em>
         NO SHIT???
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the point of this rant is that when you see blatantly racist or other shitposts here, there is a VERY good chance that it was posted by trolls trying to destroy the sub, and to scare folks like you away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't fall for it.

       That people need to manipulate this sub to this extent pretty much proves the value of its content.  The signal to noise ratio is pretty fucking terrible though, has gotten worse over the years, and all of the bipolarbears and Josh Goldbergs will be replaced by automatic shill-bots any day now.   The place is just about dead, hopefully something better will come from it.

       Eh, I'm not one to buy into the global Jewish conspiracy (although a conspiracy
       <em>
        involving
       </em>
       some people who are Jews is a different story). But that was a solid pun that made me snort twice and a half times.

         The UN expert on the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories resigned Monday, complaining that Israel had never granted him access to areas he is meant to monitor.

       You misunderstand what is going on when the mods "delete" a thread. The thread itself (usually) remains intact,
       <strong>
        but disappears from the list of topics on the sub
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The tread has been "deleted". It is no longer visible to those browsing the headlines on the sub. The only way to access it is with a direct link.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods do this often, usually for topics that are deemed "inappropriate" for the sub (local news, etc), or for rule violations, such as "editorialized headlines", etc., and they are virtually always marked with the reason for removal.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, the topic was appropriate, and there were no rule violations. They just decided to "kill" the thread - as sometimes happens when CERTAIN groups of people don't like the subject matter, or they are unable to dominate the narrative of the thread by spinning it to their favor.

       Here's what a mod named Isentrope said to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Submit that story again, and you will be banned for willfully ignoring a removal. Local crimes are generally not major world news and more appropriately discussed on a national or continental subreddit. It is not our general policy to cover rapes or local crimes on this subreddit."
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy fuck. They are getting desperate with their reasoning.
      </p>

       Here's the full exchange:

       4chan initiated it initially, so now we need some twitter storm outlining the new issues on reddit censoring and standards, and maybe some facebook. not sure if snapchat &amp; co are suited for it (yet).

       To be fair, and honest, I reported the original post last night after seeing evidence that it was being heavily brigaded from the chan crowd. I feel I may have jumped the gun, regardless of where it came from or who is throwing fuel on the fire, we gotta look into this cause you bet your ass the government and various groups are already trying to spin this to fit their agendas.

       What's worse is that they don't even need the rules. The admins won't do shit, there is no review panel, no overseer. They could just add one rule "we'll delete anything we don't want in this subreddit" and would be taken just as seriously as they are now. That's what I did when I used to be a power tripping internet forum moderator. Why bother with rules when it's all down to how you feel at that moment anyway?

       Heh,  I'm pretty sure that most news begins locally and becomes national and international after the local news spreads...   I can understand not wanting to read about Roberto hurting his knee on a poorly maintained soccer pitch in Sao Paolo, but large groups of women being assaulted across western Europe is not that.

       and the response from the mayor seems like a pretty hefty dose of victim blaming.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For this purpose, there should be about "codes of conduct" for young women and girls, "so that such things do not happen to them," says Reker with respect to the sexual assaults in New Year's Eve. There were already a code catalog, which would now be updated and will soon be available online. Among the rules is to maintain an arm's length distance to strangers, to stay within their own group and can not be separated from this to ask in an emergency concretely bystanders for help and intervene as a witness or to inform the police belong.

       you can only get away with victim blaming when you have no alternative because you've lost control of the situation.

       i.e. if you've been warned multiple times that being an American wandering around Juarez Mexico alone at night is an almost guaranteed issue, then it's kind of your fault if you sneak out of the compound.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yeah, in order to successfully resort to victim blaming, you're pretty much admitting your neighborhood/city/country is shit.

       I
       <em>
        totally
       </em>
       agree. I think it's more along the lines, though, of admitting that there is nothing any authority can (or is willing to) do about it, which is kind of a cop out. Admit in Detroit that if you go out at 1AM walking around by yourself that you might get robbed? Crime is out of control in the city? Yes. Fair. But it's admitting that not
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       is the neighborhood shit, but that you're not willing to try and change that.

       You're right. Hopefully men will stop complaining about custody battles too until men in Africa stop being killed. Especially all the white males that lack perspective.

       That is literally how you just belittled this horrible even and politicized it to make a really lousy point. Perspective or not, you can fight for more than just one cause at a time.

       I'm far from a women's rights activist, I just wasn't bringing other issues into the discussion. I was comparing the issues some women face in different countries, and how some women in the US ignore more serious problems than a possible difference in wages. I'm not very good at phrasing things so they don't come off the wrong way.

       You just said the same thing though. You are basically saying any problem people have in the U.S. They shouldn't complain about or try to make right. Children in the US may go hungry, but they aren't being enlisted in armies so they must have it pretty peachy.

       I agree. The problem is that having any discussion about Islam's treatment of women and the impact it has on young muslim immigrants is met with cries of bigotry. By not discussing or even approaching the issue the voices of these victimized women are essentially being silenced.

       maybe saying to stay with your group if something happens instead of wandering off alone to find help?

       that or saying that you should stay with your group and firmly/clearly tell a specific person to get help (maybe to avoid bystander effect?)

       Holy shit, that response actually infuriates me more than I thought I could be infuriated by a foreign leader talking about something that doesn't really involve me. I used to consider myself a pretty liberal guy, but over the past couple of years, I'm really starting to swing the other way on a lot of issues.

        A policeman who was outside Cologne station during the New Year's Eve trouble told the city's Express news website that he had detained eight suspects. "They were all asylum seekers, carrying copies of their residence certificates," he said.
       </p>

        <strong>
         there was no official confirmation that asylum seekers had been involved in the violence
        </strong>

       Well I guess the 2 most "common" alternatives are that 1. It was an accident (a pretty weird one) and 2. It was in line with the widespread 9/11 conspiracy, and the BBC somehow helped the American government.

       You really are unable to see how the media is used to weave political sentiment? I don't believe every bad person is a refuge, but I'm not so blinded by the news that I think they're all innocent women and children incapable of violence. Some of the refuges are repugnant animals turning parts of Europe into no-go zones. Welcome to the real world, where it's not all unicorns and rainbows.

       So when they say these people already existed in Germany you choose not to believe them? That was my* point and nothing else. You won't buy into the media yet choose to believe in no go zones across Europe. That's pretty hilarious.

       Sure some of them already existed in Germany, but hundrends of thousands of more pouring over is worth noting. No, I won't buy into the media, but what would you consider a gauntlet of Muslims sexually assaulting women? A happy-fun time zone?

       Sure ok but that doesn't mean they weren't responsible. Couple that with the descriptions from witnesses and the fact they were described as not speaking German or English.  Oh and the fact these attacks happened after the refugees came and hasn't been reported before that.

       But hey you sitting in your chair saying don't worry it wasn't them vs several eye witnesses.... Well of course I'm gonna believe the neckbeard at home.

       Call me a conspiracy theorist but wouldn't that be a very easy way for one person to get a thread removed? Simply link to it on /pol/ and call for a raid, post a bunch of racist comments in the Reddit thread and then "expose" this raid as coming from /pol/ and demand the thread be locked/deleted?

       Edit: I wrote this for the worldnews comments, and was really frustrated with not being able to post it as the thread was locked. It is in reply to how nobody seems to want to believe that this is what status quo has come to. Here goes:
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a liberalist, and support the weak. I defended my country's decision to take in an absurd proportion of immigrants for years. But then the news started coming of young women being raped multiple times in separate incidents on a single night. News of murder with the motivation "she was Swedish." I laid in my bed when I read this, and I could not help but cry for what evils have reached us. I'm out of bed now, and I realize that the war is looming closer and closer. It is clear that these people have no respect or love for their new home. They are acting as if they're savages on a crusade, pillaging and raping our women. We can stop them. We have the firepower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psychologists are well acquainted with a process called rationalization, and this is what is keeping us from acting mercilessly. Men and women with big hearts, who are still too far removed from the problem. Hell, I had to leave the company of one of my best friends, a man with a very strong intellect, because he would not and could not accept that our country is being raped under a guise of humanitarian aid.

       Different people react differently to honesty, and I think invalidating my reaction says a lot more about you than it does about me.

      <p>
       Delusional how? Because it reminds me of when my friend was raped by a Somalian second generation immigrant, and got away with it because the police didn't want to prosecute? Because I think it's actually true that we're on the brink of vigilantism? Do you even know what the mood is like here in Sweden? Seriously, fuck off with your myopic worldview. You're just the kind of person who won't see the world for what it has become simply because that would be too painful to you.

       Intelligent people have been trying to warn you since 2009.  These people just run across the borders in hordes, that's an invasion.  What have countries done since the dawn of history when they're being invaded? They defend their lands.  The people crossing the borders should've all been shot, no matter who they are.  There's borders for a reason, but somehow these people get a free pass on everything, even raping white women.  Defend your fucking women, Europe.

       To make it an appropriate experiment, you should repost the same link with the word "cologne" replaced by "perfume" and report on the results.

       just as infrequently because I don't get breaking news before everyone else, but I wanted to let you know I messaged the mods about their censorship bot. I will not mind if they ban me after messaging the mods about this and calling the guy "numbnuts":

        This is a legitimate news story that has nothing to do with the story you are obviously trying to censor:
        <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3zlppk/scent_of_a_ruler_cologne_inspired_by_russian/">

       [mod replied that such a fluff piece has no place on worldnews and completely ignored the part about censorship robot]

        your pants are on fire as other such "fluff stories" stayed up no problem. And the fact that you have a robot deleting anything with the word "Cologne" says it all, numbnuts.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       I censored the mod's name because I don't feel like giving him the satisfaction of being talked about. He's just some anonymous loser being a loser and he'll stay that way.

      <p>
       UPDATE: comically, right after I posted this, I got this message:

       Like I give a shit. Megalomaniac thinks he's worth pestering, I guess, but I blocked him right after I called him "numbnuts" because I didn't want to hear his empty protests.

       start a subreddit called "newsuncensored" or something. Here, I just made one:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newsunfiltered/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/newsunfiltered/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any plans to mod it at all. It's pretty easy to create a sub, but if you fill it up with just conspiracy stuff, it will basically just be
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and the rest of reddit will basically ignore it if they're looking for news. So, the key to a successful news sub, I would think, is to keep it real, uncensored news. The problem is that every news sub just happens to have mods who obviously have some weird agenda and are way overreaching when it comes to censoring the subs.

       That's not making them pay, that's just creating a new sub that I don't wanna mod either. I'm talking retribution. I don't know how, but doxing sounds like an apt retaliation.

       Potential solution: Moderation should be replaced with moderation filters which can be applied at will. If you dislike a moderator, uncheck that specific moderator from your moderation filters list. You might want to add another instead. Anyone can be a moderator and share their moderation lists.

       I would never use them. What for? Personally controlling which stories or comments are allowed to be upvoted? That's what the voting system is for.  Everybody has a say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modding subverts the voting system and reverts reddit back to being a site with links that are hand-picked by one person.  By putting decision-making power into the hands of a few, you lose the collective intelligence of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       If "world news" is actually a collection of Rojer and Dave's favorite world news stories, then it should be named "Rojer and Dave's favorite world news stories".  But calling their personally-chosen links  "world news" would be misleading, because it isn't.

       The idea is to start without any moderation at all, and instead choosing your own group of moderators. Everyone would be a moderator if you so choose. If I then would use your moderation filter, and you would censor/moderate away something I was interested in, I could simply remove your filter from my "used filters" list.

       You are describing the system in place right now. Sub-reddits have owners that can choose moderators thus putting the controls in the hands of a small group of people.

       I agree your idea is better than what we have.  But why would anyone want Rojer and Dave to filter their results?  Why would anyone want a single person, or a couple of people to filter their results?

      <p>
       The only time I can ever imagine doing that would be if you clicked on some person that you like just to check out their list of selections.  It could just be a list of posts they upvoted.

       If there is a manageable amount of posts, you could leave out moderations filters altogether, nobody could stop you. Moderation filtering would only be an additional tool (to voting) to filter out things you think are irrelevant or uninteresting, to cooperatively work with people you trust to find the most relevant and interesting things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had access to all information in the world, how would you go about finding the things that you find worth your time? I would certainly use several different tools and combine them with my social trust relationships to help me out. Maybe the word "moderation" would not fit the tool here, but I thought it was close enough to convey the idea.

       But it seems like you're still thinking in terms of the moderator's point of view, and what ~he~ thinks is irrelevant or uninteresting. But if the post that he is thinking of deleting is already listed, that means he got outvoted and that most of the people disagree with him, and so deleting that post would be going against what the majority wants.

       You're right, I am. That is because there would be no "

If you choose to trust someone else you could apply their moderation in addition to you own. The result would be your personal view of what is posted, it would not have any effect on anyone else.

       But isn't moderation deleting all the links you don't want from the page?  So, each time this moderator you chose decides he doesn't like a link on the front page, he deletes it from your view. Problem is, the links he's deleting were already voted on, with the majority saying those links should be kept on the front page of the view.  So his action is going against the majority, as if he is somehow knows better than the hundreds of people who upvoted it.

       The filtering (not deleting) does not care about any majority or votes.

      <p>
       Who would care about what he filters for himself? Only if he is a respected friend who's friends use his filters, and he knowingly misuses that trust to censor something relevant, he might loose his friends. However, those friends were not coerced into applying his filters, but did so because they trusted he would do a good job. They resolve the problem by unchecking him from the applied filters, thus revealing all the messages filtered by his filter.

       Well, that would certainly be better than what we have.   What would be even better would be if the links that were filtered out would just be turned gray.  So you could glance over them in case you want to check any of them out.  As your confidence in that filter builds, you would start to pass over the grayed-out ones without looking at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the setup we have now is if someone posts an innovative idea or concept that is just beyond one of the mod's comprehension, it will be just outside of his sense of reality and so he'll think it's wrong or stupid and delete it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This effectively castrates the reddit community from developing anything novel or innovative. Everything has to fit tightly within each of the mod's limited sense of reality, so nothing is ever allowed to go beyond what they already know.
      </p>
      <p>
       And since mods nominate themselves for the position, you wind up with the 1% of the population who, more than anyone else- want to enforce their strict sense of right and wrong by controlling what can and can't be discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the one guy who is the most sick of seeing people post "dumb ideas" is the one who applies to become a mod so he can delete them and "protect" everyone else from having to read such "nonsense".

       I agree with you on every point.

      <p>
       The idea of moderation filters could absolutely be developed further. Setting confidence to a specific moderator to only gray out posts or have an threshold of
       <em>
        n
       </em>
       trusted moderators to actually hide a post would be a great idea.

       Yeah, makes you wonder when management will do something about the mod system. If this sorta censorship becomes a story in itself it's going to damage the reputation of the site.

       I'd say it's now an advertising/PR platform owned by a media company called Advance Publications (Conde Nast's parent company), and "font page of the internet" was just a convenient relic that no longer holds true.

       You cannot call someone a troll or shill in many of the default subs without getting banned. That's like, the tiniest most mundane insult in the world and the only people who would be offended by that are the people guilty of it. I've been called shill, it's funny and I certainly don't cry to mods about it. It's like proof of what this site aims to be, a safe zone for shilling, disinfo and controlling public opinion. Hey, it's almost like mainstream media!

       Has anyone considered
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       kept the story on hold just long enough until it could blow over for the majority of readers, whereby they then allowed the story in order to avoid harsh criticism of censorship etc? If so, that plan is backfiring like no other.

       Well it's nice to see that
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/">
        /r/Germany
       </a>
       isn't censoring the information at least.  This story is also being heavily censored on FB.  This is the real war on women the left always tries politically smearing on their opponents faces.

       That's not actually what they're saying.  The point is that many of the accounts posting in those subs appear to be newly created.

        "Many of those accounts are new due to the incident in cologne, many of those new accounts are only here to spread messages of hatred. This is effectively not totally within the control of the moderator ...."

       That's why Merkel just said that she is enraged about the attacks and wants a hard answer with all the force that our state and justice system has to offer. Becuase she doesn't want the people to know? I find that quite strange.

       Not to mention that also the police union, the chief of police, the Major of cologne and all major newspapers reported this.

       I feel that such actions have nothing to do with conservative Islam or conservative Christianity or any other religion. I mean both Islam and Christianity uphold such rights; In Islam for example, the woman would be legally allowed to retaliate from such an attack and would be protected. 
I feel that uncivilized Muslims basically do whatever the hell they want and then try to justify it on religion.

       That is what everyone does, it just isn't religion based. "need to invade some countries": "war on terror", "need to take over some land": "my religion says it is mine", "want to loot some stores": "racism is oppressing me", and so on.

       I think this is accurate. Another example is female genital mutilation, which many people associate with Islam, but which is actually a northern Africa and middle Eastern phenomenon. Southern and southeastern Asia doesn't have the same issue despite having the largest Muslim population in those regions. Likewise, even predominantly Christian nations in North Africa have issues with FGM, so it's not just the religion it's the surrounding culture. When someone gets displaced from a region where the actions are okay to where they are condemned, you get these clashes that we see.

       most Americans don't even realize that there are non-Arab Muslims. If you told them that Persians are pretty great and many are Muslim (maybe show them some math stuff, or pictures of the cities in Iran), or that many Indians and Bangladeshis are muslim. This is the way our rulers want us to think and they succeeded for the most part.

       For sure. I was amazed when I learned that the middle east only makes up 20% of the Muslim population and the most us by far in southern and southeastern Asia. The way we hear about it makes it sound that all Muslims are in the middle east. It truly is a regional issue.

       Exactly. They are trying so hard to be "fair"  to these animals they are overlooking their crimes and making excuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Islam is a religion of terror and violence. The people who practice are overwhelmingly horrible, uneducated, racist, violent assholes. I don't know why we feel we need to keep making excuses for them. Quit treating them with kids gloves, and if the "moderate" Muslims have a problem, tell them to actually clean up their religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I judge every person as an individual when I meet them, but that doesn't mean we should be blind to the practices and preachings of the majority of practitioners.

       I don't get it at all. Islam should be one of the main enemies of liberals. It's founder was a brutal warlord and its earliest leaders phedophiles.Tradition can't be used as an excuse, sociology professors might think so, but if tradition means supression of women, abuse of children and slavery I just can't respect it.

       There shouldn't be any tolerance for this. Everyone involved should be deported ASAP. It's the police force's fault for not being on hand to round these people up.

       I think that's a pretty solid start.  But then you couldn't just write off people who opposed accepting Syrian refugees as "racists,"

       I'm totally with you on that point.  It just frustrating to see people from both sides of the issue using inflammatory language and misinformation instead of having a real adult discussion about such a complex matter. You also have to admit that it's not that hard to figure out which side the racists are on, it's just unfortunate that people with  legitimate concerns  get unfairly mislabeled.

       I am sure that the racists are opposed to Syrian refugees emigrating to the United States.  But so are most Americans.  Are most Americans racists?  What determines a person being racist or not?  And is it racist to oppose people based on their ethnicity/country of origin, if their country of origin is located in an unstable part of the world known as a breeding ground for anti-American terrorism?

       One country, yes, but you're fucking delusional if you don't think the majority supports this kind of shit. I had a friend in college who was literally worried that if they found out he ate pork and wasn't a virgin, his dad would kill him. Literally. Not, "My dad will beat my ass." "My dad will fucking kill me and then call the cops on himself because he feels he was right."
      </p>
      <p>
       In Bum Fuck North Carolina, and my buddy was third generation American. I delivered pizzas to a lot of Muslims as well, and never once have I spoken to or interacted with a woman, they were always right over the guys shoulder with their heads down. I once saw a lady get strong armed away from the window when I knocked, and then heard her getting yelled out very loudly as I walked away. Granted, he might have been REALLY excited about the pizza, but with how angry he looked when he came to the door I doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, I'll judge a person in front of me based on their actions, but it's a pretty safe generalization to say Fuck Muslims and their shitty, backwards culture. I would never stop my daughter from marrying or falling in love with anyone, but I would honest to god be worried about her if she married a muslim. Black dude? Cool, family reunions and functions together will be awesome because of the food. Asian guy? Well, she'll probably never worry about money and have a smart, hard working husband. Latin dude? Same as black, just spicier food. Muslim guy? I'm calling her every week.

       Sorry, but some of Christianity is just as bad, it's not really the fault of the religion, it is an older culture and it clashes with our. These people might not see what they do as really bad, but they must learn that you can't behave in this way in a western society!

       No, I'm sorry. Take the worst christians from the past 100 years, and they what? Bombed a few abortion clinics? Took some girls hostage and started polygamy compounds? Had some boys blow them? Held up some offensive signs at a rally?
      </p>
      <p>
       All horrible, wretched, depraved acts that were committed by .01% of the Christian people.  The things I just described are COMMONPLACE among many Muslims in third world countries, and still alarmingly present in a lot of First World countries as well. Go read some soldiers accounts of how some of the warlords and representatives of Iraq and Afghanistan treated young boys. Go read about how commanding officers would have to forcibly hold back soldiers ready to kill some warlord, because he was leading a little boy into his tent and everyone could hear what was happening, because it's "Their culture over here and we can't mess with that." Or about the doctors in England who set up secret places for fathers to take their daughters to have their genitals mutilated, because there weren't safe places in first world nations to practice that part of their religion.

       Fuck off with apologist nonsense. We call out the shitty Christians and Jews and everyone else on their religions shitty practices and laws, and we shame the people in those religions who still practice them. The fact is, all of the horrible shit Muslims do is right there in their holy book, and sanctioned by muhammed. The moderates will try and dance around it, but it's still there, and still being practiced by many Muslims around the world. Christians don't still stone to death people who wear two different types of fabric, so why is it ok for a woman to get stoned to death in Iran for being raped?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's time Muslims started getting the same treatment. I don't think we need to kill them all, but consistently calling them out on their bullshit is a must. If it bothers the moderate Muslims so much, they should make a real effort from within their own religion to fix the fucking problem. It's not up to us to fix it for them, and it's not our place to be complacent when they inflict suffering on us.

       I was recently banned from r/europe for 'racist' comments.  They later changed it to 'hate speech' because I challenged them and then they later brought out my past posts and tried to just use that as reasoning even though I was never warned once prior, and I have never been banned or warned from any other subreddit ever.  The moderator that banned me was a new moderator, as in... he literally joined the moderation staff that day.  He/she moderated other subreddits heavily involved with refugees and Middle Eastern people, so I'm pretty sure at this point that Islamists are infiltrating and influencing the subreddits.  I doubt this guy is even European.  He also is the moderator

       Reddit has people that can moderate them. They are called admin. They are for the most part a group of social justice warriors. Reddit needs money plain and simple. Since the service is free for the user then they (users) are the product.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have to generate traffic so they (admin) allows subs like shitredditsays and subredditdrama exist. It's money plain and simple. Most people gotta have the last word so they spark drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       Others have such boring lives or just depressed they follow this shit like a soap opera. Hell even I did. Got smacked into my place (lost a username) for my fuckery.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took me a while to realize that reddit is entertainment. Sometimes people go too far on here and they think they have no fallout. Well some people are better at the game then they are.

       Good theory, you wouldn't be able to say that about every mod but I can't believe every mod of world news would be fucked in that way.

       As someone who used to be an insane controlling forum moderator of a few large forums that I won't name; for me it was about deleting opposing political views and oppressing behaviours that I disagreed with. Given that it was mostly forums about Japanese anime it turned out that a lot of the mods were hiding and protecting people I had identified as paedophiles that were trying to get involved with the younger forum members and I wanted to monitor, ban, and report them to the police. I quit at that point.

       I honestly think you're right about the fact that people who go for power are typically in it to censor/abuse things instead of to improve things.

       The widely held belief on high profile figures committing a disproportionate amount if sexual assault and the like is that in many cases, since politicians and ceos and the like are always playing a high stakes gamble with our money, the sexual assaults are often documented and used as collateral of sorts in case a deal falls through or the terms are dishonored.

       It is completely disgusting that the shills are more interested in framing the conversations relating to immigrants raping and assaulting women as "racist", to distract attention away from the underlying issue that this infiltration via refugees (who have no intention of integrating into society) is destroying their sovereign cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the plan of the global elites.  Drawing attention to the problem is the absolute last thing that TPTB want to happen.  Hence, paid shills framing the conversation as "racist" as to confuse the situation and disrupt the conversation from the actual problem that these refugees are causing.

      <p>
       Also, the censorship of the discussions here on reddit is a major red flag.

       It makes no sense banning heavily discussed threads. If you have a different opinion use logic and facts to bring people over. Banning though and conversation is fucking terrible

       The funny thing is that you got it exactly backwards. The problem isn't "paid shills", it's that they are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       paid and that they simply cannot be bothered with moderating several threads that are being spammed by a good amount of racial hatred. Not
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       racial hatred to be sure, but enough of it that it makes moderation a full time job for the few days that it takes for it to blow over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, why bother removing them? What do we have downvotes for? Stories like these don't mobilize moderate people, they fire up hatred. The wrong people become active and they vote the vile stuff up, not down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, just leave it there, censorship sucks, right? Unless you want to become a quarantined subreddit you need to keep the worst stuff in check. At this point you can start an ideological discussion about what reddit is supposed to be - again - but that's not something they can change.

       It's not global elites, man, my own fucking friends and acquaintances called me racist for ranting about this on Twitter.

       Censors don't tell you why they are censoring. They are afraid of discussion, and don't want you to know things.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they reply at all, it will be to lie or to stop censoring (wishful thinking). So of course you know they are lying about their motivations. It is obvious.

       It's obvious that people higher up on the chain have given the mods appropriate responses in order to stifle the noise. That, or the mods have been bought out to the ones who make the calls. The curtain is falling down guys, and one day the truth will be out.

       That's the story I commented on in another thread on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I go to that comment thread right now, the only comment I'll see is mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I use another browser, NO - as in ZERO - comments are shown, yet as of this writing Reddit says
       <strong>
        there are some 505 comments.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hit "Load more comments" till you're blue in the face and the only thing that happens is that the number of remaining comments gets smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it difficult to believe that EVERY ONE of those 500 comments was made by a troll or racist.

       Not sure how "dozens" become 200, but in any case according to the articles the police said sexual harassment is a common tactic to setup a pickpocket -- so they weren't exactly "sex attacks" (with one exception). The 1,000 figure doesn't seem to be based on any facts at all, it's just an assumption. But what really doesn't quite add up about this is that if that many foreigners were gathered in one place harassing people, you can be certain the police would have been there in short order.

       That one specifically is. But to say 200 people got raped, while the police chief said around 90 women were sexually assaulted, is a huge fucking difference. Sexual assault is anything from grabbing an ass, to rape.

       I was hearing that 90 people filed police claims. Among those included, robbery and sexual harrassment. It was new years eve in a major fucking city. Some people are going to get a little handsy or try to rob you. To think this was some massively organized Muslin event is ridiculous and why it keeps getting deleted from world news. It's misleading and plain wrong.

       At least 200 women reported being sexually attacked.  How is that not what the headlines make it to be.  And considering that most women probably didn't file charges, the real number is likely to be much higher than that.  I really don't understand what is difficult to understand here.  There weren't just robbed.  They reported being sexually assaulted.  Do you get it yet?

      <p>
       All I got from the video was a crowd of different races of party goers being loud and obnoxious setting off fireworks.
      </p>
      <p>
       So does this video shows 1,000+ Muslims or whatever/blacks going around raping women and looting honestly? Look like a mix of people being troublemakers with a small minority of them committing crimes against women, which isn't surprising since this was on News Years and some guys probably got very drunk and made unwanted advances, but sure as hell isn't a big deal as news stations are trying to make it.

       The difficulty with videos like this, particularly videos taken at night, is that they don't give the same experience as actually being there.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you walk through a crowd, your eyes will tend to fix momentarily on individuals, and flick from individual to individual giving your brain a collective overview.
      </p>
      <p>
       A camera can seldom capture that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, "shoved fingers in EVERY hole" and 'molesting' (aka 'copping a feel') is QUITE a bit different from 'unwanted advances'.

      <p>
       How do you feel YOU are in any position to make such a broad statement of fact? Were you present in the crowd, or making judgement from some 4,000-7,000 miles away?
      </p>

       There were large public gatherings in a great many cities around the planet on New Year's Eve, yet NO other cities reported anywhere near the number of sexual assaults being performed in public as happened in this case.

       It's  shitty reporting and sensationalizing what occurred like most news today and already been shown with exaggerated numbers of sexual attacks that happen. As was the case of the other Reddit thread about ISIS blowing up a child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did foreign man molest and sexual attack German women? Yes, but was it an organized 1,000 man group of foreign with that goal in mind? Hell no, which is what the media is trying to imply happen. Now I'm against what happen and feel pity for those woman, but let's remember to take everything we hear in news with a grain of salt

       I live in Cologne and the numbers are estimated by the police not by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       It hasn't been clear what exactly happened and the police is still investigating.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact the
       <a href="http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/12415/3214905">
        Cologne police report for the media
       </a>
       from NYE doesn't mention any of it although it actually mentions the area called "Bahnhofsvorplatz" - the place in front of the train station/dome, where everything happened:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kurz vor Mitternacht musste der Bahnhofsvorplatz im Bereich des Treppenaufgangs zum Dom durch Uniformierte geräumt werden. Um eine Massenpanik durch Zünden von pyrotechnischer Munition bei den circa 1000 Feiernden zu verhindern, begannen die Beamten kurzfristig die Platzfläche zu räumen. Trotz der ungeplanten Feierpause gestaltete sich die Einsatzlage entspannt - auch weil die Polizei sich an neuralgischen Orten gut aufgestellt und präsent zeigte. (st)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Crude translation by me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Shortly before midnight the place in front of the trainstation in the area of the stairs to the dome had to be cleared by uniformed. To prevent a mass panic from the ignition of pyro-technical explosives of the 1000 partying people, the officers cleared the area shortly. Despite the unplanned break of the party the situation remained relaxed - also because the police placed themselves in neuralgic places and demonstrated presence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It looks like the situation escalated, most probably because of alcohol and/or drugs, from some guys doing the harrassment as a distraction to pickpocket to a growing group which did it for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="http://www.presseportal.de/blaulicht/pm/12415/3217757">
        newer police report
       </a>
       explains that it was an initial group of a couple of hundreds aggressive young men who started shooting pyros directly at other people and that this group just got bigger and bigger.

       It is bullshit, but I think the way the mods are removing it (that is, saying it isn't the right subreddit instead of saying it's bullshit) leads me to believe that the mods think they're censoring something racially charged even of they aren't actually doing that in reality

       Average people don't go around in mobs. If they do, it's because they're friends having a good time and are not trying to pick a fight. I know people that would do great in basically any confrontation (guy working in personal security or competing Thai boxer for example) but I don't see them voluntarily fighting a group of Muslims. Only mob looking to pick a fight I can think of are nazis.

       that is simply not true. there was one incidence reported so far that was classified as rape, which is a pretty big accomplishment in a crowded area. all the other reported incidents had a mixed bag of theft, verbal and sexual harassment and assault.
      </p>
      <p>
       as the first statements of vicitms are surfacing you can see that clearly. "fingers in every body orifice", "ripped tights and panties", etc., all the while being called sluts.
      </p>
      <p>
       if I was a woman and had fingers stuck in places they shouldnt go while being called a slut, I'd call it a sex attack.

       I did. And so did this lovely lady who was born in the US, moved to Israel, and then on to Sweden to do her part in making sure that Europe becomes "multiculturalized":

        Meet Barbara Lerner Spectre:
       </a>
       (One minute, 17 seconds, and you'll understand)
      </p>
      <p>
       For those who can't enjoy the video, here's the transcript:

       <strong>
        <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Spectre#IBA_interview">
         Wiki -  From an interview with Israel's IBA-News in 2010
        </a>
       </strong>
       (emphasis and brackets mine)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Europe has not yet learned how to be multicultural. And I think we [Jews] are going to be part of the throes of that transformation, which must take place. Europe is not going to be the monolithic societies [sic] that they once were in the last century.
        <strong>
         Jews are going to be at the center of that
        </strong>
        . It’s a huge transformation for Europe to make. They are now going into a multicultural mode, and
        <strong>
         Jews will be resented because of our leading role.
        </strong>
        But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you know what OTHER country could REALLY use a big fat dose of "multiculturalism", Ms Spectre?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT:
       </strong>
       PS, you may just be right about Jews being resented because of your LEADING ROLE. If and when that happens, I hope you'll remember that you took on this task voluntarily. No one forced you meddle in shit and make enemies.

       That's a good question, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly Ms Spectre isn't concerned with the European
       <em>
        people
       </em>
       (race?) or their culture(s), as she is doing her best to dilute and destroy... so what does she mean when she says "
       <em>
        But without that leading role, and without that transformation, Europe will not survive
       </em>
       "?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe she's concerned about Continent? About the land mass? Could she be worried that without the added weight of immigrant Arabs and Africans, Europe might float away, and drift off into space?
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could ask her.

       Why does Israel have a

       Much of the US once had

        "dedicated

        education systems"
       </em>
       , but we decided that such separation was unfair, inequitable, and racist. There was a big row about all that back in the 1960's - they called it the
       <strong>
        CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
       </strong>
       , and interestingly, the charge to ELIMINATE segregation was
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jews-in-the-civil-rights-movement/">
         largely led by Jewish Americans

       Funny that Jews are behaving differently in Israel.

       Good point.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be little desire for a "melting pot" culture in Israel, where the lines dividing Jews and Arabs blur into obscurity. Rather, the differences between the two groups are constantly reinforced in virtually every aspect of society.

       It's quite a bilateral situation. The Arab population, for example, has half the political power it could have because of its reluctance to vote. They outright refuse to be part of any coalition, thereby foregoing any change they could bring as part of the government.

       That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. How can they expect better representation of they willfully choose to not participate in the government? That's the equivalent of blacks in the US back in the 60s saying fuck it and not doing shit about their standing in society. But because they did choose to be a part a civil movement, they've largely gained political and social standing. I mean the fucking president is a black man. Quit making excuses for these people that don't give a shit about you, let them figure out their own destiny.

       It's even worse than you think, since without them the left has an incredibly hard time forming a coalition, so by not participating in the game they basically hand the whole country to the right wing.

       Probably because if you teach shit in schools to Muslims that doesn't 100% follow the Quran, eventually some fanatic will come along and blow it up. That's just the reality in that part of the world.

       <p>
        In March 2011, Gaddafi warned that without unified and stable Libya there would be no one to control countless migrants from Africa and the Middle East from fleeing to Europe. Unlike Western leaders, he apparently understood that millions, not thousands will come, should Tripoli fall.

       I get where you're coming from. Intelligence exists on a curve, and we give equal rights to each side. Does it honestly make sense to let unintelligent people raise children? Or vote? Obviously these are impossible questions to answer or implement but I don't understand why people aren't willing to at least think about these things.

       Yes but rule by the elite is the kind of thinking that led to Nietsche, Nazism, and all sorts of evil.

      <p>
       The idea that the common man is to stupid to be left to their own devices and that the "smarter" elites should dictate his life is not new or uncommon unfortunately. It normally leads to even worse outcomes then letting "so-called idiots" fend for themselves.

       Nietzsche himself did not subscribe to a number of the tenets that were born out of his philosophies. I don't mean to necessarily cast shade on him. More like the poeple who read him and thought the idea of the ubermensch was a call to superior genetics dictating ruling class.

       Except for the fact that the german police chief said 90 women came forward with sexual assault allegations, which range from being groped to being pushed around, and 1, count it again 1 rape allegation. It was New Years Eve in a big city. People get drunk, people get robbed, people make unwanted sexual advanced. 200 women were not gang raped by 1000 people. This would be an international crisis and would be over every single major news station for weeks. Don't assume a title is true because you read it on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       -About 90 women have reported being robbed, threatened or sexually molested at New Year celebrations outside Cologne's cathedral
      </p>
      <p>
       -Cologne police chief Wolfgang Albers told a news conference officers described the men as looking as if they were from "the Arab or North African region" and mostly between 18 and 35 years old. "We have one complaint that represents a rape," he added.
      </p>
      <p>
       -One man described how his partner and 15-year-old daughter were surrounded by an enormous crowd outside the station and he was unable to help. "The attackers grabbed her and my partner's breasts and groped them between their legs."
      </p>
      <p>
       -A British woman visiting Cologne said fireworks had been thrown at her group by men who spoke neither German nor English. "They were trying to hug us, kiss us. One man stole my friend's bag," she told the BBC. "Another tried to get us into his 'private taxi'. I've been in scary and even life-threatening situations and I've never experienced anything like that."

       You assumed that I'd read the articles, when in fact all I'd done was react to a hypothetical story in a hypothetical way.
      </p>
      <p>
       My reaction wasn't to the facts or the news. My reaction was to the premise of what to do if a thousand man decided to one day go and rape a bunch of innocent people en-masse for 'shits &amp; giggles'.
      </p>

       IF one day that were to happen, the only justice I'd expect would be the daeth penalty. No less. Nowhere above am I suggesting that murdering people based on clickbait and hearsay is O.K.

       All men get those lucid moments of clairty 'post-wank'. Where emotion, passion and desire are removed and you're left with logic, reason, consequence and shame. As you might imagine, I get them a lot.

       Before you make any big decisions, especially involving women. Tug one out first. If you feel the same way afterwards, you made the right choice. This will generally stop you 'thinking with your dick'. Your dick affects your decisions all day everyday. It's the reason you cut that asshole off at the intersection, it's the reason you're contemplating sleeping with that girl with the scabs on her face.

       I'm unsubscribing from r/worldnews for this. Everyone who disagrees with the mods' deliberate censorship should do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if they see a large swath of people leaving their sub, they'll understand it doesn't matter who you are and what your agenda is: censorship is wrong and the people will not tolerate it.

       I'm also subscribing to r/conspiracy now. I would never have seen this had I not accidentally clicked on r/all instead of my front page.

       Playing devil's advocate, but there is some rationale to attempting to keep discussion civil by limiting the sub's even apparent endorsement of anti-any group submissions, as to keep it from spiraling into losing control of the sub and having it turn into another r/Europe.

       I don't agree with it, especially when it's supposed to be a news subreddit, but it's at least a reason.

      <p>
       They are designed to make women not feel safe going out and to retreat back to their homes.   It is the start of Muslims forcing an environment that is ripe to introduce radical changes to how women are treating and allowed to progress in society.

       just flat out deleted all the comments in a submission with 2000 upvotes...

       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news

       and
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       share too many mods. They are just propagandists controlling two default subreddits. Just like
       <a href="/r/history">
        /r/history

       and
       <a href="/r/askhistorians">

       have the same mods. Etc.

      <p>
       So when the "discussion" doesn't go their way, these idiot scum mods "lock" the post. Fucking scumbags.

       No doubt in my mind that many of them are selling their services to new organizations or are employees of the social media division of news organizations or PR Firms. When money is involved, you know there are plenty of sellouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that the idiot scum "founders" of reddit have now sold out too. If the mods weren't given "root" powers to delete/ban/etc, then we wouldn't have this issue. I mean, what's the point of reddit if a mod can simply lock a post because he doesn't agree with redditors?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also, the "civility" rules that worldnews, news and other subreddits adopted are also the same rules of the comment rules on news site also ( BBC, guardian, etc )... It's incredible that a "freedom of speech platform" has turned into "censorship central". The only reason is money.

       the "fun" part about this is that the people running these subreddits and always covering up anything negative about refugees etc are the same people who are absolutely outraged when police covers things up etc.

       Because sexual attack != rape. If I understand the situation correctly, the intention of those assholes was to steal phones and purses - while distracting their victims by groping them.

       You convinced me, only one rape and organized mass theft, hardly worth mentioning. Nothing to see here just move along. Does Disneyland still have the "It's a Small World" cause I could use a ride and clear my mind. Now bend over and get excited about your own personal multicultural experience.

         According to the Zero Hedge link about this story, only 1 woman reported being raped. How is that a "mass sexual attack"?

      <p>
       'Rape' and 'sexual assault/molestation' and 'groping' are all entirely different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interpretation is that one woman actually got a dick in her, whereas a lot of other women got to unwillingly enjoy the attention of a lot of hands - over AND under their clothes.

       After reading the article; it sounds like something that even Doctor Mengele would have second thoughts about. If even half of this stuff is true, then I would bet as much as 100JPY that these SISI guys have a special "think tank" that spends their whole day reviewing books, movies, and video games for divine inspiration for this sort of thing. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't have multiple groups with this job, and a kind of friendly competition whereby they try to outdo each other with the most outrageous and heinous methods for offing little boys and girls.

       It's "xenophobic" to complain when foreign men are sexually assaulting your women.
      </p>

       It's "racist" to notice this sort of thing is more common among some groups than others.

       It's "Islamophobic" to think Western culture is better than Muslims cultures.

       It's based on fear tactics (specifically, fear tactics predicated on the use of a lie)
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell people that their peers support Bernie Sanders
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, an individual will look at Bernie Sanders, see that he is a raving lunatic, and say "well, I do not support him or his policies".  However, since he's been convinced that the majority of his peers support Bernie Sanders, he will pretend to support him as well, so as not to be ostracized from the group
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason it's doomed to fail is because all it takes is a few people to think for themselves, and voice their opinion, and then everyone realizes that virtually no one
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       supports Bernie Sanders

       I don't understand how there can even be such a thing as "brigading from off site". That doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Users have to be logged in to post or vote. Thus, by definition, the people posting and upvoting are redditors.
      </p>
      <p>
       By this logic, anytime an important news storey draws new users and people from other websites, it's "brigading". How ludicrous.

       Because once people realize the truth about muslims, they'll realize the truth about black people, greenskins, indians, etc etc.  Even the most "white" reddit admin/moderator almost certainly has some greenskin blood, so to them, it is a matter of protecting themselves

       I was in the trenches in the very beginning of this. I got banned from
       <a href="/r/worldnews">

       </a>
       and subsequently got my entire account banned for 3 days.

       I guess they feel like it's their job to keep us from reading and discussing stories like these. So basically r/worldnews is really r/onlyworldnewsweapproveof. Keep up the good work OP. If it wasn't for this post I wouldn't have known about the disgusting things that happened on New Years.

       That was a very predictable response, and you overlooked my point, so let me reconstruct that basic sentance for you -- it has never been NOT A-ok to post articles that paint Arabs and/or Muslims and/or Mid-East countries in a bad light.

       The title of this post is bollocks. It reminds me of Fox News style sensationalism. From BBC, Washington Post etc, its less then 100 men that were doing this.
      </p>
      <p>
       what we have to remember is that these guys make their woman cover themselves from head to toe. Is it surprising that when they see women not covered up that they become animals. I think Merkhal needs to get her shit together and get these guys, tagged and tracked asap.

       It's not that "they became animals".  They robbed women and their favorite way to do it is to grope them until they freak out and then rob them while their hands are busy defending.  It's kind of a "2 for 1" crime.  They get some groping in with a possibility of a phone, wallet, bag, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       repressed guys standing in the shadows going crazy because of all the women.  It is thievy assholes on a mission who figure they might as well do a "grope theft" because it's an effective strategy.

       Those subs are small and this news is decidedly worldnews worthy to the readers and according to that sub's rules.

       Unfortunately it doesn't fit the 'Refugees Welcome' narrative that's backfiring so is censored.

       They claimed is was not suited for
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       because it was "local" news from Germany, but we all know this is just an excuse. Not only moderators in Reddit but also the main stream media are so deep into this "politically correctness" crap that they are afraid of any news that depicts the bad deeds done by a portion of the immigrants coming to Europe lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all of the immigrants are bad people of course, but ignoring that massive and uncontrolled immigration is causing a huge problem to Europe is just silly, and I don't even have to be European to know that this decision was bad (I'm South American by the way).

       I'm so sick of this PC culture. Offending at least opens a dialogue where you can discuss the topic. Trying to ban everything that's "offensive" just cripples free speech and discourages understanding of others.

       does the same thing if you speakup against Islam activities in India. And we have been at the receiving end of Islamic invaders for centuries now. The Islamic invasion of Europe has just begun. Prepare yourself for more bigotry by the so-called liberals cuz they have decided nothing is wrong with Islam and muslims. Its just everyone else that is forcing muslims to rape non-muslim women, keep slaves, kill homosexuals, and also kill each other. Only if somehow the world would start living under Sharia, all of this could end. Viva la Green Revolución!

       Here's an Idea.  Make a subreddit that won't delete news that the mods don't agree with.  You can even just copy everything posted in News with a bot, just don't delete any stories or comments unless they are blatant violations of reddits site wide rules.  I just made one r/unwashedNews just for you.

       Anything against leftist agenda of AwkwardDev, Fluttershy_qtest are deleted.

       Please at least get this shit right. It is 40 to 80 possible suspects out of a thousand men. 1000 men did not commit the crime. The local police are also saying most of the suspects are local.

       Maybe because you're headline is complete bullshit. It is 40-80 suspects out of a possible thousand men that were there, not 1000 men commiting the crime. It also says the local police believe most of the suspects are local. I'm a longtime r/ conspiracy supporter and you make us all look bad with this shit.

       It's a shame because I first discovered Reddit because of unbiased news threads and quick updates on important matters/issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be another site to take Reddit's place as far as uncensored news goes. Maybe the Facebook meme population will stay here and leave the people trying to have a constructive arguments alone.

       To clarify: There weren't 1,000 arabs, there were 1,000 people overall, most of them boys/men. They are looking for 20-40 suspects. There weren't 1,000 arabs and there weren't 400 assaulted women. At the moment are 90 cases at the police, more probably coming in over the next days. Those were probably not recent asylum seekers, but thieves and drug dealers (mostly north africans) known to police. But well, these are the facts so far, can obviously change over the next days.

       This is nothing new. Reddit filters a lot of things that don't support it's world view. Various subreddits do the same.

      <p>
       It's unfortunate but it's human nature.

      <p>
       Also it's not just reddit. I have read the Dailymail for years and they used to cover the Muslim male rape epidemic. Now you'll basically never see a story on Muslims raping and grooming young girls. I guess they just stopped doing it or DM got legal threats.

       They put this up as a sticky on the new thread that can't be replied to, so they can make it look like the upvotes and comments are skewed by a raid. But if you look at the 4chan thread it wasn't a raid at all, had 2 posts other than the OP and was already dead until the mod scapegoated it.

       This isn't a popular opinion but this is how many European countries maintain the illusion that they have no social problems. They bury shit and pretend it doesn't exist and then look down on countries that at least address their problems in the open.

       I was curious so I looked at the thread. It sounds like you aren't using the definition of rape culture that most people who use the term "rape culture" do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it's one thing to criticize the concept of rape culture as it is currently defined, but you can't just redefine it and then argue it no longer applies to a certain society.

       Ladies being groped and robbed on new years eve by drunk men... sounds like Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mayor doesnt want to immediately associate these attacks with refugees which is reasonable, but she also has a lot of stake in that as a mayor because apparently she let a larger amount of refugees take refuge in cologne than was advised in an attempt to win public favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       What bothers me is that the media is portraying this as a mass, organized terrorist rape of hundreds of women. There was apparently a single actual rape, and the other instances were gropings and pickpockets (or some combination of the two, grope as distraction and such).
      </p>
      <p>
       This just seems like bad reporting and statistics to me. Anyone else?

       It's actually disturbing how psychopathically insane some of these news stories are. I never imagined I'd be reading about such archaic religious violence in 2016. It's almost as if the powers that be are intentionally allowing it for some reason and I cannot figure out why.

       I find it interesting that reddit gets up and arms over things like surveillance and such and saying the term "slippery slope" and thinking this could lead to things like a government super spy list, etc. but when gun control comes up they don't see the slippery slope of having all these new gun limitations and such.  It just makes it easier for the government to take away shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun control is another slippery slope.

       When the site was taken over the algorithm was changed so that people aren't able to share news quickly.  I think the live updates from civilians on national news stories was really hampering the medias ability to fictionalize major events.  At about the same time all major news subs probably had gov't plants added to the modbase for any major news subreddit to make sure that people don't here news before it's "News".

       I'll be the first person in most cases to agree that the mass influx of people in Central Europe is nothing but trouble and legitimate refugees should be vetted, but the articles reek of reposting of bad information coupled with mass hysteria. If that truly is the case, then Reddit should be ashamed because censoring them does no more then justify and inflame people's base suspicions.

       That doesn't sound ANYTHING like the headlines claim. And go figure, some mysterious force (read: people with bots) got this post (filled with all sorts of anti muslim, anti semite, anti human-intelligence parroting) to the front page of reddit. The funniest part is how dumb this makes conspiracy redditors look, considering this story is
       <strong>
        far
       </strong>
       from censored.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure looks like someone wants this story misinterpreted and propagated to fit some sort of narrative, but that never happens.

       Is this really a conspirsory though? I mean it has been shown time and time again the mods of that sub (along with some other default sub) only allow threads about news that fits their narrative. To them, the potential that not all refugees are good people or that throwing a bunch of people from a different culture in Europe isn't a good plan are against that narrative, so they ban anything to do with that. I mean it is a joke that they don't allow threads on news that is being covered by the big news companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the real conspiracy would be how far up does this go, I mean are the admins knowingly allowing this kind of censorship to occur? I find it hard to believe they wouldn't give a shit about a default sub and just let them do whatever they wanted unchecked.

       Listening to NPR, the German government seemed to be doing everything in their power to stop the idea that these were refugees or that it was tied to the letting in of refugees. I wouldn't be surprised if the moderators were being controlled by them in some way to control panic.

       Imagine knowing your daughter, girlfriend, mother, friend, whoever, is walking around and suddenly is surrounded by 10 men, or even one is dangerous, c'mon. Imagine being in her place, seeing those men harrasing you, touching you, groping you,  almost forcing you to get in his "private taxi". Imagine the fear, how indefense can you be.
Now, imagine how pathetic, stupid and insulted would you feel social media is not doing anything about it? Imagine hie scared would you feel knowing nobody is doing shit because they are protected basically.
Now, you know reddit. A place where you can express everything you want, specially This kind of news that, let's all be honest, are WORLD NEWS. How oppressed this place can be?

       Trying to cover up what happened, or censor discussion about it, is playing straight into the hands of the far right. If you loudly insist that someone can't be believed, and it then emerges that in this case they were telling the truth and you were trying to sweep it under the rug, guess who people are going to believe next time?

       Seriously this jesus fucking christ this is absolutely fucking disgusting. WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO PEOPLE CARING ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN?? Holy shit. This is enough to make your blood fucking boil. The Paris attacks weren't covered up and they were perpetrated by Arabs. What the fuck man this is just ludicrous. Can't believe people are STILL trying to remain willfully ignorant of select atrocities like this. WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO CARING ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN?? Jesus fucking Christ man... fucking ludicrous

       Eh, I'm kind of torn.  It's wrong to censor a story for political reasons... but the thing is stories like these tend to spark an irrational fear or backlash against muslims/middle-easterners/brown-people.  These kinds of thing "inspire" people to do "useful" acts like vandalizing a Sikh indian's convenience store.

       Just wanted to say I was in Cologne Hauptbahnhof on the 31st of Dec. (only to exchange trains) and I saw a gang of these guys who were wondering around aimlessly. No luggage, no rush to get anywhere. They were analysing the area, walking very slowly and acting reallyyyy weird, I could swear they were troublemakers.  so sadly, I am not surprised to read this :( it;s terrifying

       Not surprising coming from that shitty subreddit. This applies to many in power in Europe as well. They're all openly bending over. Funny how the numerous areas in the Mid East aren't housing supposed "refugees" and it's up to deep inland Euro countries to magically ignore any realism of economics and sustainability and just take care of anyone and everyone.

        Look what I found,
       </a>
       a news piece from October talking about a spike in sex crimes and violence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sex attacks are described as an "everyday event"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I was looking for the construction companies who built the refugee camps in Germany, this and stories like it are at the top of the page on Google.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        women being sold for sex, €10 a go.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There have been reports of child abuse, sexual assault, theft and violence everyday in the refugee camps. The assaults have gotten so bad that refugee camps are now employing only male staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, just do one google search. "German refugee camps".

       Yep, that space between the eu and china is all fucked up as it has been for the rest of the last... well lets face it dawn of humanity.  Now to be fair Europe and the rest of the west took a few world wars and several genocides to reflect upon how fucked up humanity was.  Most of the far east was going through the same shit at the same time.  This all being said, at least the far east and the west are trying to unfuck things slowly by trying to treat the people who live next door to them like friends.  Get your shit together literally everything between china and poland.  India at least looks like it is trying and though China may be as misguided as the Americas, at least they can see which way the wind is blowing. Religion is no excuse.  In fact it is not an excuse for anything.  Just leave that at the entrance like your excuse about your dog and your homework you fucking children.

       There has never been a sexual mass attack by 1000 "Arab" men on 200 women!!!
There were two more or less seperate incidents in the Silvester night in Cologne. The first one was with about 1000 young men that threw fireworks at each other. The situation escalated a bit, so that the police had to remove them from the place. The second incident happend after that in the trainstation nearby. Only Some of the people from the first incident came there and commited robbery and sexual attacks on about 100 woman. About 90 criminal charges have been made but there have never been 1000 men raping 200 women like you discriped it!
It is not ok that the mods removed those posts but i think they did it because with posts like this the fear and hate for refugees just grows in the mind of people. Those young "northern afrikan" looking men are, as the police said, probably not refugees that came within the last year, but organised criminal pickpocket organisations that have been in germany for years. Those actions are cruel and disgusting and people have to know about it, but there is no reason to put up false informations or pure speculations. That makes it only worse
(Sorry for bad language, but this had to be said.)

       only found a german site discribing it right. On the press conference it was said that you can not speak of 1000 offenders, because many of them didn't actually commit a sexual assault.

       And it's actually only 15 sexual assaults.  The rest were just "normal theft/pickpocketing".
      </p>

       And the molestings were part of the thefts.  It's how they distract the women.  I'm sure the assholes enjoyed their grabbing, but it is inaccurate to present it like it was a goal in itself.

       What you had was a bunch of Arab, Gypsy, North African, etc  thieves and pickpockets (with
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       refugees mixed in) who said "lets all just hang out at the main train station and rob partiers as they come through".  They robbed men as well (with the old "hey let me put my arm around you and be friends" kind of scam) .. and they robbed women by circling them and groping them and then grabbing their stuff when they freaked out.
      </p>
      <p>
       90 people filed reports.  15 of those had a sexual component.

       good point sir. what is the true number? maybe it's zero and never happened at all! Is that why this is being covered up on reddit, if so let's hear the reason!

       Of course two wrong doesn't make a right. But neither does needlessly inflating numbers. As if that would have made this terrible incident more severe.

       If OP really wanted to inform the readers here he should have stuck to the original numbers. Take

       I don't know what the correct numbers, google around, looks like MSM is not mentioning this. It's dumb to nitpick on incorrect numbers when main problem is the coverup not the actual story. One way to get to the correct number is to not censor and let us discuss this, compare sources etc.

       No, this isn't nitpicking. The only way to retain moral superiority is to present the facts as accurately as possible.

      <p>
       Handing a censor a way to rationalise their behaviour on a silver platter isn't a very constructive way  to go about this.

       Unfortunately Germany is a so full of cucks that nothing will come of this. Refugees can rape and steal all they want. Germany did something bad 70+ years ago, so now they have to suck every nigger Muslim Arab refugee cock they see. a sad state to see Germany like this, love or hate the neo Nazis at least they don't put up with refugees raping and stealing - unlike Merkel and the German government who in their infinitesimal cuckness just go with it.. "don't get mad at them, they are refugees, they can rape whoever they want. You are so racist to judge them".. holy shit Germany just sounds like tumblr.

       I think it' shouldn't be censored, but don't over-sensationalise. One woman was raped, and maybe 100 women were reportedly harassed, that's not a sex attack on 200 women, heck, it might just have been leering and rude comments.

       All those details change all the time during terrorist attacks, or natural disasters, or really any "developing" story.
      </p>
      <p>
       We put a certain amount of trust in NYT, The Independent, Der Spiegel, etc. to report as much as they know, as soon as they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       The details might change, but that is considered normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only question is why should
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       literally block one story that's all over world-news sources outside of reddit.... and not others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods and admins should simply not have that power. If it's a front-page story on Der Spiegel itself, who are they or you or anyone to say the "story" has a racist undertone??
      </p>
      <p>
       As you quoted, the papers themselves printed statements of balance, appeals for calm, in the body stories. If that's good enough for a goddam international newspaper of repute, it's good enough for
       <a href="/r/worldews">

       Isn't that what the mods are for to begin with, to remove the xenophobic comments?  Are you really inferring that any subject which MIGHT bring some bad comments, shouldn't even be shared or discussed by ANYONE?

       I can agree that these stories are important and the mods need to prevent the topic from derailing, by blaming an entire minority in place of the criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if  the mods start deleting top  comments, you may then get people complaining about how its a conspiracy that the mods are deleting their comments.

       Ok this is being plastered all over reddit with a very heavy racist undertone and the NY Times article (which i actually bothered to read) spoke of 1 rape allegation. Black men lusting after and raping white women is one of the oldest racist tropes in the book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i read comments about hundreds of women being raped and SJW's covering everything up on the other post. You idiots should try to wise up to the real conspiracy instead of trying to convince yourselves that Left wing SJW's are running things behind the scenes.

       It's actually at least 90 woman who have come forward with criminal complaints, which range from robbery to rape.  There's no racist undertones, especially from the NY times article, or any other article I've read.

       Is it racist to repeat the victims story's of their assailants not speaking German, and resembling Arab or African men?

       By saying this, you are inferring that these Arab and African men have more of a right to be protected from "racist undertones" then the woman who were sexually assaulted, raped or robbed.  That's INSANE.

       It's not racist to report on this you're just making it sound like this was way way worse than the article itself claims. You make it sound like there must have been dozens of rapes because of 90 criminal complaints 'which range from robbery to rape'. The article lists ONE rape allegation. How about you just admit that, let's discuss the facts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are so obsessed with political correctness destroying society, this news article was being spun from the very beginning by people who hear '1000 african men' 'dozens of women raped and assaulted on New Years eve' being circled around by people who only read headlines. Yeah there was rioting and robberies and whatnot but this is being immediately spun into sounding like it was 10 times worse than it really was.
      </p>
      <p>
       They censored this shit on reddit because it was brigaded with misleading headlines, it's not like the establishment itself was censoring this. NYTimes hasn't removed the story, just a bunch of reddit mods. You assholes think reddit is a free libertarian republic spanning the whole world but look: If someone posts articles with misleading headlines painting immigrants as a rapist horde then it's going to get deleted. I'm not sponsoring reddit censorship. You losers just can't take life straight whining about how reddit has gone to hell but yet you stay here whining and complaining. Reddit is a company with private not public interests and if they remove posts it's only censorship for neckbeard greaseballs like you who get their newsfeed from fucking reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you're calling me a shill even though my account is 3 years old and i've got nothing to do with defaming people with legitimate complaints about censorship and unjustified authoritarianism.

      <p>
       Ok, you're correct, there has only been 1 rape allegation, but also reported is that 1/3 of the 90 police reports, or at least 30 sexual assaults have been reported also.  Groping is certainly not on the same level as rape is, but still it's a pretty serious crime, which is a felony here in the United States.

      <p>
       Sexual assaults on over 30 women, robberies of at least 60 women, which is what the German authorities are reporting (which likely means the number is significantly higher) is a pretty serious situation.  There's a huge difference in censoring misleading headlines, and censoring the entire story completely, which is what
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews

       is doing.

      <p>
       Again, they are not just censoring the misleading headlines, they are censoring ALL POSTS AND COMMENTS about it, regardless of whether the headline matches the story or not, in the largest subs.  It would be completely different if they selectively censored the misleading titles, but are you really inferring that the BBC, Telegraph, Daily Mail, and NYTimes have all made their titles misleading?  Because that's what's being censored.

       White women are much more likely to be raped by black men, than the reverse. Stereotypes exist for a reason.

       Maybe that reason being you unable to understand statistics albeit you can read them. So congratulations on your username and being able to read.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Whites are 9 times more numerous than blacks. This means white victims are so many because they're the largest demographic. Same reason for whites raping less black women(according to official crime statistics) because they are a smaller demographic.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         What should be really ringing some alarm bells is how often you see 0 black women reporting being raped by white guys in the statistics. Well it's established that whites rape a lot of whites by the statistics, so why the HUGE discrepency. Well maybe because the justice system is biased against minorities and it's more likely to have black women cite proof in order to even get a case going.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       It works both ways it may be the fault of black women to an extent due to a culture of isolation where talking to cops makes you a pariah but the police is always harassing blacks anyways
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey let's just go with your precious statistics and say that no white man has raped a black woman in the last 4 years and government statistics are the truth so long as they support your narrative.

       It's not racist to report on this you're just making it sound like this was way way worse than the article itself claims. You make it sound like there must have been dozens of rapes because of 90 criminal complaints 'which range from robbery to rape'. The article lists ONE rape allegation. How about you just admit that, let's discuss the facts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are so obsessed with political correctness destroying society, this news article was being spun from the very beginning by people who hear '1000 african men' 'dozens of women raped and assaulted on New Years eve' being circled around by people who only read headlines. Yeah there was rioting and robberies and whatnot but this is being immediately spun into sounding like it was 10 times worse than it really was.
      </p>
      <p>
       They censored this shit on reddit because it was brigaded with misleading headlines, it's not like the establishment itself was censoring this. NYTimes hasn't removed the story, just a bunch of reddit mods. You assholes think reddit is a free libertarian republic spanning the whole world but look: If someone posts articles with misleading headlines painting immigrants as a rapist horde then it's going to get deleted. I'm not sponsoring reddit censorship. You losers just can't take life straight whining about how reddit has gone to hell but yet you stay here whining and complaining. Reddit is a company with private not public interests and if they remove posts it's only censorship for neckbeard greaseballs like you who get their newsfeed from fucking reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you're calling me a shill even though my account is 3 years old and i've got nothing to do with defaming people with legitimate complaints about censorship and unjustified authoritarianism.

       I feel that such actions have nothing to do with conservative Islam or conservative Christianity or any other religion. I mean both Islam and Christianity uphold such rights; In Islam for example, the woman would be legally allowed to retaliate from such an attack and would be protected. 
I feel that uncivilized Muslims basically do whatever the hell they want and then try to justify it on religion.

       If you are really not sarcastic, then depending on your location you may just need to visit the nearest university to experience modern liberalism at its "best". Be sure not to discuss what liberalism is, it's not the only word ending with -ism they misuse, and you really don't want to "trigger" anyone there with a logical question.

       Koch funding, media obsession, ignorance. No one is wondering why Trump is doing well. The media is promoting Trump to an obsessive degree and then pretending to wonder why the candidate they're promoting is also doing well.

       If you aren't voting for the candidate that the media is ignoring, you're voting against your self interest every time.

       If your local news station reported a tanker truck explosion in front of your house 20 minutes prior to it actually happening... you wouldn't be so accepting of clear and present fuckery.

       You look out your window and say wtf... there is no crash out front... then it happens in front of your eyes... did the BBC get it wrong or is something else going on?

       I would never use them. What for? Personally controlling which stories or comments are allowed to be upvoted? That's what the voting system is for.  Everybody has a say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modding subverts the voting system and reverts reddit back to being a site with links that are hand-picked by one person.  By putting decision-making power into the hands of a few, you lose the collective intelligence of the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       If "world news" is actually a collection of Rojer and Dave's favorite world news stories, then it should be named "Rojer and Dave's favorite world news stories".  But calling their personally-chosen links  "world news" would be misleading, because it isn't.

       Well the culture doesn't explain African American crime stats. Every race has different genetics like how Africans have more testosterone which is believed to cause the higher rates of violence. It isn't racist to point that out, people just say racist when they don't want things discussed, like these mods deleting these post.

       I don't know what the correct numbers, google around, looks like MSM is not mentioning this. It's dumb to nitpick on incorrect numbers when main problem is the coverup not the actual story. One way to get to the correct number is to not censor and let us discuss this, compare sources etc.

       Okay, I can accept that line of reasoning for sure. I do love the disruption in the GOP. The DNC maybe needs a more disruptive candidate as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think that even though Sanders is a career politician, he is the candidate willing to disrupt the system from the inside and give a little back to American citizens. I also feel the least danger from Sanders that the rich are just going to get more advantages and more power. Still, I respect where you're coming from with Trump.

       Sexual harassment and sexual assault (attacks) are different things though. It mentions a lot of the time it was someone harassing them whilst their friend nicks stuff. Not that, that makes it fine but it's better than groping everyone like some of them where.

       A fluff piece? That is an unacceptable bullshit lie and it speaks volumes about what this site has become. Chock full of liars who control/censor the flow of information and opinions of other users.

       IMO the only legitimate explanation should have been "we're being brigaded with this topic so we are directing everyone to one thread about it here ----&gt;".

       I agree your idea is better than what we have.  But why would anyone want Rojer and Dave to filter their results?  Why would anyone want a single person, or a couple of people to filter their results?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time I can ever imagine doing that would be if you clicked on some person that you like just to check out their list of selections.  It could just be a list of posts they upvoted.
