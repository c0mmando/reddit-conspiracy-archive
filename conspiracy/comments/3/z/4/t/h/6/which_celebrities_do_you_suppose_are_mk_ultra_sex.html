       That's what the movie Eye's Wide Shut is subtly trying to portray. How couples will give their daughters to a secret society in return for power and inclusion. Then their children become sex slaves. Once they have matured into adults they become famous models or movie stars due to the secret societies connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some speculate Stanley Kubrick was murdered by a secret society for attempting to expose this pedophile ring within Hollywood. He died while editing Eyes Wide Shut, some speculate this society altered the movie to fit a different story (couple trying to keep their marriage together). When in fact there was a much darker truth to the potential real movie Kubrick intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I find it tough to fathom this being 100% accurate. But even if a fraction of all this were true, the implications are enormous and almost too insane for the public to calmly conceive. The back lash would almost be revolutionary. If the public cannot trust their most popular celebrities credibility, what makes you think they'd continue trusting the regulators (governments) credibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why Kubrick died of a sudden heart attack. To limit public reaction to secret societies, downplay their deep connections with celebrities, and keep the American government credible.

       I think you over estimate the American public. This is the same group sitting idly by while their constitutional rights are being stripped away at an astounding pace, yet no sound issues forth from the masses.

       The "shock and awe" would be start-to-finish complete in about two weeks using today's 'flash' influence "information exchange".

       Three weeks and no one will know what you're talking about, all previous concern and determination having fallen neatly into the bit bucket of societal awareness.

       American youth are probably the least revolutionary, least informed, and least able portion of the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coddled by the state and their parents all you hear from young people are cries for more government, more taxes, and a more "level playing field".
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of leaning towards a more libertarian mindset, which eschews a nanny government, you have the younger generation electing authoritarians like Obama and Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of lining up behind a Ron Paul mindset young people by and large vote for big government to give them more. It's disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most young people vote Democrat or Republican and call libertarians "conspiracy theorists". They deserve to reap their harvest, which is an encroaching police state.

       Please stop. Libertarianism is the last thing the youth need to get behind. And yeah, we do need a more level playing field.  We do need to stop the wealthy from unfairly influencing our politic, policies, power structures, and privacy.  We don't need every man for himself, crush the unions, let the poor rot in poverty, tea party politics. We need to reverse decades of class war waged on the poor and middle class.  If anything we need the youth to become ultra leftist, to the point where the 60s come back, along with the anti war movement, calls for socialism/communism, and unity. There's nothing to lose from socialism and a massive INCREASE to the "welfare" state, funded by the wealthy, who have sucked up OUR resources and wealth. Keep that "libertarian" shit to the rich/happy neighborhoods and enjoy what you have instead of advocating for austerity from the sunshine.  I like some aspects of libertarian ideology, and I supported Ron Paul.. Like on foreign policy and common sense finance.. But I'm sorry, "liberalism" isn't hurting anyone.   only the fake liberalism that the media/ right/ libertarians love hyping up, like the soft PC safe space people. You all love talking about that.   the left isn't the safe space crowd, the left is the bandana over the face, Molotov cocktail, anti war anti fascism crowd.. And we are beast. Peace and love can still be tough..

       Your cure for a corrupt government is doubling down and making it even larger... You'd replace an already intrusive, large government with an even larger and more intrusive one.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the perfect example of why the government is able to grow so large and become so corrupt. People with ideas like yours enable the ruling class to become even more powerful and elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to limit corruption in government is by shrinking the scope of government. You shrink the size and responsibilities of government and by doing so you shrink the possibilities for graft and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason corporations have so much power is because they use the large government to enforce their will. Large corporations LIKE large government, and vice versa. Gov. enacts laws and regulations that benefit the ruling class. Don't be foolish. You've seen the evidence in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ideas are half-baked, illogical, and used by the ruling class to maintain their iron grip. It's a shame so many people have fallen for corporatist ideas like yours.

       What you fail to understand is that corporations have overthrown the US government. They literally write the laws. This system has been in place since the early 80s and has led to the complete deregulation of corporate malfeasance; the busting of American unions; "free trade" deals that has destroyed American manufacturing; and the destruction of the environment and the middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left wing pillars that once held up this society and made it into a great country has been whittled away to toothpicks. For you to think that destroying whats left of these pillars is going to curtail corporate power is delusional. Do you think corporations are just going to dissolve without "big government"? No, they will operate even more brazenly and abolish any regulation placed on them including whats left of safety, environmental and work regulations. We would be reduced to third world slavery conditions where children work for under a dollar a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we need to do is take back OUR government. Not abolish it and let corporations run wild.

       He's just trying to blame everyone besides himself for the problems we face.  All that is needed for evil to flourish is for the good to do nothing.  We created this monster by doing nothing, and the older you are, the more responsibility is on your shoulders.

       Falling prey to 'divide and conquer' will not solve anything my friends.  We're 99% on the same page, finding common ground and uniting to cause change is what we need.  Not an unfocused movement like OWS, but focused with clear things we can all agree on, such as campaign finance reform.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important thing in all of this is civilized discussion.  Never talk down to each other if it can be avoided.  We are derailing ourselves and that's exactly what they want.  They'll send in shills to post clear BS to try to rile us up.  Keep calm and cool, there's more of us every day.  The best we can do is ensure that there are more of us every day, kick back and wait for critical mass.

       You know here's an idea.  There's the government and then there's big businesses that are constantly subverting it.  And then there's people who go in and out of these spheres screwing both sides as they jump back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what's going on.  So all this ideology is just unproductive conjecture.  We need to demand justice for these individuals who engage in this activity and when they are caught it's not a catch-and-release like it traditionally is.  We need to hold their feet to the fire.  We know who these people are.  We know exactly.  I'll give an example.  David Rockefeller.  Henry Kissinger.  Cheney.  Every Bush.  Rummsfeld.

       That's meanness that really doesn't understand the world today.  They are not coddled, they had the same stuff you had growing up, it's only more advanced.  The difference though is your education cost 1/10th of theirs.  Which means their folks can't just pay for their education like they could in your generation.  Instead they can pay for 1/4 of it and the rest is student loans which--surprise--now follow you around for the rest of your life unlike other 'adult loans' for which you can declare bankrupcy.  And yes, the youth know that you need an education to get a really good job, but they also know which vocational jobs are the best paying and easiest so they are going for those also and there's nothing wrong with trying to maximize your life comfort. That's not priviledge or affluenza, that's just common sense. It's not even the american dream, it's a dream of the american dream, a pale, diluted comparison, the 'just get by', the apartment versus the home, the just please leave me alone.

       It sucks to be a person getting a start in the world today. The big money interests read our ideas online and profit off them. Say you are inventing something and you just need to bounce some ideas off someone.  Well too bad, now it's being shunted off to the R&amp;D dept of one of many constellations in the private galaxy of companies that run the forums we rely on just to talk. (specifically facebook).

       It's a deep harvest and commodification of our very thoughts, hopes, and dreams.

       When it all collapses many of us will cheer because its been illegitimate for too long.

       I agree on Spears and Aguilera but I also suspect fellow mouseketeer Justin Timberlake.  There are numerous accounts of homosexual pedophilia in Hollywood.  Add to that Walt Disney's Nazi sympathy and a suspicious amount of subliminal sexual imagery in Disney movies and that's a pretty likely group of victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would add Michael Jackson.  Aside from a professional relationship with Disney and the allegations against him Latoya said in an interview (I think for Penthouse) that she suspected that their father had pimped him out to business acquaintances.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sexualization of youth by Cyrus and Spears is telling also.  Lady Gaga does not seem to be a victim (though she has discussed having been raped in the business) but rather someone who is a product of a culture of sexualizing children.

       There's this whole other conspiracy where Michael Jackson told his family that the

        Illuminati was trying to kill him
       </a>
       for speaking out against them; part of the conspiracy was that the people at the top assisted in trashing his reputation via accusations of child molestation to discredit pretty much anything he said. I have no idea how much of it is true. It's one of those low hanging fruits that his hardcore fans can't resist to pick at because it might vindicate him, but no doubt about it, the dude was really strange.

       I actually kind of suspected he was guilty partly because of Latoya's statement.  However, just after his death his original accuser basically recanted and recounted his father telling him to make the accusation for financial reasons.  That was long speculated about but this was a first hand account from one of the two central figures.

       But Jackson did admit that he had kids over at his house who he wasn't related to and felt that it was totally normal for them to sleep in his bed with him.  Just doing that alone is enough to trigger some accusations.  I don't think people had to "invent" the child molestation thing.  He put himself in a position to be accused for something like that whether he did it or not.  You shouldn't sleep with little kids in your bed.

       Say what now? Let's just replace the child molestation part with rape of an adult woman. Are you saying that if MJ asks an adult woman to sleep in his bed then he is inviting an accusation of rape?

       I don't know if he was falsely accused or not but as an adult man you really can't sleep with kids you aren't related to.  It's fucked up.  Even if he never touched those kids it looked bad enough for charges to be filed.  You have to at least have enough sense to recognize that you are putting yourself in danger of being accused of something.  If you had a 10 year old and you let him sleep over a friends house and you found out he slept in bed with the father because the father made him sleep there would you not be disturbed and assume the worst?  Sleeping with an adult woman is nowhere near comparable.

       I once passed a homeless guy who saw me and spurted out, 'justin timberlake...a kitten on a plane!'.  It scared the shit out of my girlfriend but I thought it was hilarious.  That's what I think of everytime I see timberlake.

       Thank you for bringing that up. We can't ignore the market for young men. As the parent of daughters, I'll get people saying "oh I feel sorry for YOU!" As if parents of boys don't have to worry about them being targeted by pedophiles.

       It's a product of our hyper-sensitivity to the safety of girls.  As a society we freak out over the mere thought of women or young girls being in danger, but indifferent to men and young boys who are in significantly more danger.

       it may have been on the Jimmy Kimmel show, some pretty boy actor talking to the pretty boy host... gives out 'his story' of how he met a photographer at a gym, got a free black&amp;white portfolio from the encounter...

       basically tells everybody in not so many words about the gay Hollywood casting couch system.

       I agree with the above mentioned female pop stars but I wonder what the crossover between MK Ultra and Luciferian cult is. Are they all the same thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's more likely they are not official program participants but part of a Luciferian cult that uses mind control techniques.

       Hi there. I'm 33, I lost my virginity at the age of 30. I've had sex 4 times in my life. When I get older, I might have a lot of sex. I might even find a woman that could be described as a sex kitten.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if women don't need to be programmed to be sex kittens then I think I would have been having a lot more sex in my 20's.

       One of the funniest things I've ever read. MKUltra is a CIA mind-control program that got shut down, then a bunch of ultra conservative Christians came up with a theory that the program continued with the express intention to turn good girls bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA apparently uses their mind-control along with occult magic to make people sexually active and commit "immoral" acts. Victims of this program are apparently identified as ANYONE wearing ANY animal print clothing.

       It no doubt has a formal name (a leap of logic perhaps?), but I've noticed this happening for a long time. It is especially common now among the religious, but I've seen others do it, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The writer starts with an established fact, in this case MKUltra, then moves onto presenting evidence, and making arguments, that lead the reader (or viewer) into thinking the article is going in a particular direction. Then at the last minute they turn it all around and make all the credible evidence they just presented about something ridiculous like alien Satanists who are doing it to tempt us away from God's path.

       What? It's not "ultra conservative Christians" that came up with the "sex kitten" thing - it's a bunch of young progressive Bernie Sanders types - you know, like on reddit.
