<p>Edit: I&#39;m a 21 year old married female who never had issues producing my own lubrication (in copious amounts) until I started using artificial lube - which I began using to experience new sensations. Since using artificial lube, I can&#39;t produce my own anymore. This happened within months. It has nothing to do with arousal, age, diet, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now if you couldn&#39;t produce any moisture, the product would be a life saver, like when a doctor has to enter a patient and the patient isn&#39;t exactly excited about it. However, if somebody who has no real issues uses this product constantly, their body may scale back moisture product leading to complications should the lube run dry.</p>

<p>This is a simple observation from years of eye drop use. My eyes used to water just fine, used eye drops for years and now they don&#39;t produce moisture near as frequently on their own which is a bitch in the wind or sun.</p>

<p>This is no conspiracy though. This is simple cause and effect. It&#39;s just kept off the packages for the most part cause of corporatism. If every product informed you how it would be robbing you of a tangible skill or crucial bodily reaction, you may not take it. Just like headache medicine, I love the stuff, but it tends to allow one to ignore the reason they are getting headaches in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignore u/oglog&#39;s useless insult.  Taken like any other medication or pharmeceutical, your thesis is correct.  Take statins* for a year of life, and doctors advise correctly that one should refrain from stopping medication and consult them first (to slowly lower dose; usually one is on statins for the rest of their life.)  Why?  Our bodies reach a homeostasis which allows it to not deal with an unnatural condition through it&#39;s own methods, and simply come to rely on external aid.  The same with depression medication, stimulants, ADHD meds etc.    </p>

<p>In order to find a logical syllogism between vaginal lubrication and manufactured dependency, we simply have to find or fund a study which figures out whether or not women who use artificial lubrication are less apt to naturally produce lubrication.  The case of statins and many other drugs and external aids are proven but I am unaware (haven&#39;t researched) vaginal lubrication.  If this interests you, I&#39;d suggest you look into this. </p>

<p>* I don&#39;t support most, if not all, of doctor&#39;s medications which veil the true cause behind disorder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why am I being such a dick? You&#39;re right. It&#39;s probably misplaced onto you. I&#39;m sorry. </p>

<p>That said, since you asked, I&#39;m being a dick because I am SO TIRED of Internet and Facebook science, in which people post nonsense theories they&#39;ve claimed to have &#39;researched&#39; under the guise of science. </p>

<p>This is most often done by people with no scientific background but with a inflated sense of intelligence (see Dunning-Kruger Effect). I mistakenly put you in this class. I&#39;m sorry. </p>

<p>That said, I think an even more dangerous group of pseudo-science exponents are those (like you) with a little training in science. These folks have the vocabulary to be convincing and sound authoritative to the layperson but lack the judgement and training on when to speak up. </p>

<p>I guess at core, my problem is this: every time &#39;science&#39; is invoked to support some crackpot theory (e.g. anti-vaccines, Sandy Hook truthers, etc.), the public respect for science dips just a tiny bit. This simply cannot happen, since we absolutely need the public to trust scientists going forward. So ... Please leave the science to actual, trained scientists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s almost all OK with me.  It seems you still think I&#39;m rolling with pseudo-science.  So maybe i can explain and you can clarify where exactly you get this idea from?</p>

<p>The base supposition I sought to invoke was that our body is a complex regulating system, and in some cases, pharmaceuticals and medicines throw off it&#39;s homeostasis.  This is, after all, why drug (and not even all of them!) users go through withdrawals, why antibiotics throw off the immune system of the digestive tract, why abruptly stopping anti-depressent regimen often causes ill-received side effects, no?  What followed was not even a concrete answer to the OP; I just suggested that if it&#39;s anything like the instances of homeostasis above, then it makes sense (but would require real research) to confirm whether or not our lubrication systems might be affected by applying artificial lube.  </p>

<p>These statements are not nearly as complicated as you apparently first made them out to be.  Are you suggesting they are crack-pot theories (akin to anti-vaccine or *<em>gasp</em>* Sandy Hook Truthers)? Not true? Or you just needed to explain why you first responded that way to my post? (A general hatred of pseudo-science)</p>

<p>An example that I would have suggested to OP anecdotally (if I had to) is that of our lips (I guess we can consider that an erogenous zone?) </p>

<p>I have some friends and personal experience which tend to agree that although applying lip balm makes them feel better at the moment of application, it seems they just become drier as a result (once the lip balm dissipates)</p>

<p>But I didn&#39;t feel like rolling with the potential false equivalence.  Again, I&#39;m not up on the science of vaginal lube, just thought I&#39;d offer my knowledge on homeostasis and suggesting next steps if he/she was legitimately curious about this.  </p>

<p>If your entire comment revolved around statins and my footnote claim that I don&#39;t personally support them and the science behind them, then let me know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer (but PLEASE read long answer): I definitely over-reacted a little bit because I am SOOOOOO tired of internet pseudo-science, especially on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and similar subreddits. </p>

<p>Long answer: Some of your statements (e.g. &quot;our bodies reach a homeostasis&quot;) are based in truth. However, where I object to what you wrote is that you are way too firm in some of your statements.  Let&#39;s take two examples: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>&quot;Taken like ANY other medication&quot;. This is not how ANY other medication works; this is how SOME other medications work. I think it&#39;s irresponsible to say &quot;any&quot;. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The same with depression medication, stimulants, ADHD meds etc.&quot; These other cases are not THE SAME. They may be SIMILAR, but without a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these drugs, I think it&#39;s irresponsible to say &quot;The same&quot;. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, you are obviously smart, and you use very scientific vocabulary (e.g. &#39;statins&#39;, &#39;homeostasis&#39;, &#39;logical syllogism&#39;). As a result, I think that the layman (or the average redditor) is likely to consider you an informed source. I believe there&#39;s a responsibility that goes along with being (or acting like) an informed source, and that responsibility means that you shouldn&#39;t use broad terms like &quot;ANY&quot; and &quot;The SAME&quot; when they don&#39;t apply. </p>
