    <div class="md"><p>Above,  I said there <em>were</em> planes,  but that the networks might have also altered their video:   <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3zfmwy/if_911_planes_that_crashed_into_the_wtc_towers/cylpjwc?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3zfmwy/if_911_planes_that_crashed_into_the_wtc_towers/cylpjwc?context=3</a></p>

<p>I am not taking sides,  I am saying that the witness testimony makes it clear there were planes.    But video experts also think the plane images had been altered on certain of the network versions.    This would mean that any altered video might not be the best evidence.    You might want to re read this until you have some comprehension of what I am saying.</p>

<p>Also,   I do not endorse this analysis,  but it does raise questions:   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rml2TL5N8ds">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rml2TL5N8ds</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they may have altered the footage based on what I have seen.   Also,  I am sure they have been managing the information in other ways as well,   the narrative was laid out on the American people in the form of a psy op,   and was more than likely a false flag as far as I can tell.    What do you think,  the media has been forthright?   The media seems to me to have been collaborating with an agenda,  on the government has been manipulating for a purpose.    The purpose?

    <div class="md"><p>Look dude,   experts are saying certain videos show signs of having been  manipulated.   There are good technical reasons to suspect that.    We already know officials lied about telephone calls from the planes,  and media reported these as fact originally.</p>

<p>We already have a lot of evidence that &quot;the story&quot; to be told/shown to the public was planned from the start.    We already know that what really happened is different than the story we were told.</p>

<p>If it turns out that the video shown to the public was edited in the first day of 9/11,   that would be more evidence that the media was knowingly participating in a fraud.    Its not that big a deal to me personally,   but I am curious if on top of all the other manipulation,  they even manipulated the video in order to make a better presentation to the public on that day.    Some experts see teltale signs that certain of the video images were manipulated,  which means that the manipulated version was worth manipulating compared to what would have been the version without the manipulation.</p>

<p>In other words,   I am commenting on an aspect of what this post is addressing.    </p>

<p>Cheney had worked for Halliburton.   Halliburton was going to make billions out of this event.    But only if the public took it the way the public was intended to take it.    The media presentation was essential.    A dramatic shot of a plane hitting would have been worth a lot to anyone who had planned 9/11.    </p>

<p>There were not that many different shots.     There were some shots that did not show much.    A good shot was worth a little extra video work.</p>

<p>Besides,   I don&#39;t really care why.    Its part of any proper investigation that every aspect of the crime of the century should have been investigated by people expert in that field.    Video experts,   explosive experts,  physics experts.     They should all have been doing their job.    We should all know what they found when they examined the evidence.</p>

<p>Kind of weird that you are asking me.    It should be pretty obvious to anyone who thought about it or looked into it.   </p>

<p>Why do you think that anyone would manipulate video,   if there is proof they did?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This problem is still there if there were planes <em>and</em> CGI,   which should not be ruled out.     The planes could have been drones,   modified,   etc.</p>

<p>There are a lot of tough questions:   although its obvious that explosives were in the tree exploded buildings,   we do not know how the explosives got there,    who did it,   etc.</p>

<p>Also,  there were 19 who were claimed as hijackers.    The funding,   visas,   training etc.   for these was at the minimum a diversion,   and those responsible for the cover up regarding the tracking of these individuals and the &quot;confusion&quot; between the FBI ,  CIA etc.  is still being covered up.</p>

<p>The stand down of military air defense</p>

<p>The confusion over phone calls &quot;from&quot; the planes</p>

<p>The dubious connection to bin Laden</p>

<p>The destroyed connection to the antrax murders and failure to properly investigate same when it would have required a team effort to perform the anthrax attack and the previous suspects were unlikely even involved.</p>

<p>You are demanding some kind of theory.    We don&#39;t need another conspiracy theory.    We need a criminal investigation.</p>
