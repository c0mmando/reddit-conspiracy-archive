Enough of us have been awoken to stand a chance, as we try to reverse the storyline here on Earth. Sadly, the positive spiritual nature of humanity still hasn&#39;t fully manifested. I&#39;m living in the twilight zone wth religious people; they are deceived. Your cultural, spiritual stories are more important than mine? No one wants to here that; with that kind of mindset, no wonder we&#39;ve had so many wars. We need to approach any event in life as a challenge and a blessing. You are living, eating, breathing right now! Your body is doing a million things you can&#39;t even understand, your mind is expanding beyond the physical, and your soul is being nourished by the ever encroaching TRUTH of the universe; that we are all the same being. Have no fear brothers, sisters; friends and family. We will rise above our own selfishness, and it will be beautiful. When they flip the switch, be ready. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually have recently (just a thought experiment) tried to shy away from the news. I work a lot and I spend time with a lot of people. I don&#39;t watch tv or play video games (i do listen to a lot of music, I&#39;m addicted). However, the years of 2013-2016 have seen me do a lot of soul searching, a lot of learning. I believe that there are at least dozens of outcomes that are still possible, in reference to our civilization. I believe we as human beings are a lot more powerful than they allow us to think, growing up. As far as your question goes, I really feel like I can sum it up in short by saying, take a look at what&#39;s going on in politics.. Donald Trump or Hillary or Ted Cruz.. Those are our possible future leaders of the &quot;free&quot; world. I mean look at ISIS, the whole freaking world knows who created them, who still funds and supports them despite being caught. The people are being dumbed down and forced to accept more subtle authoritarianism every day. It&#39;s only a matter of time before the rock enters the hard place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No positive nature to humanity? I think that&#39;s the only sentiment I disagree with my friend, it seems to go against even all the things I just read; there&#39;s plenty of good within us. However, the physical world itself is indeed evil; there is no escaping that fact. We are in the Kali Yuga (if you believe in such things). This is the darkest before the dawn, when creation will truly experience harmony, post the destruction and passing through fire of everything negative on this planet. Rest assured, the evil in the world does not scare me, it enlivens me, reminds me that we ARE still alive, still kicking; still trying to figure this puzzle out. The game isn&#39;t over yet. You can make it serious, or you can make it into a joke; that is for you to decide; personally I have to laugh to keep from crying. Godspeed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I resonate completely with what you are saying; thank you. It&#39;s good to know there are others out there who can bare this burden. It truly is quite an exciting spectacle to me. One thing though, my friend; have a little faith. Maybe there is a scenario where we actually DO make this hell into a paradise one day. It could happen. Anything could. I&#39;m not saying that it even matters, there could be endless universes out there right now in which we&#39;re experiencing all of the possibilities and polarities of life. Or, it really could be a bleak, temporal, celestial joke being played on our souls; either way we&#39;re trapped here on Earth and environment isn&#39;t friendly. I really wish we could work together but it&#39;ll never happen; people just don&#39;t care. We have to, like your saying, let all this evil shit come out of us and be addressed (I.e. Let the wars, chaos, death, disease, bigotry, selfishness, and fear come forth) and be disposed of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all let me start by saying you are an incredibly intelligent, well grammared, forward thinking...prick. You don&#39;t know anything. War, famine, disease, rape, pillage, etc HAVE been around forever and always will be around. On Earth, and likely many other places. You are so caught up in being small and insignificant that you actually have become such. By all means, have a beer with your friends, spend $12 on a margarita at Tomorrowland or whatever. I could care less. For me, I live a life of moderation and servitutude to my fellow man, at least my fellow men who give a shit. Men like you can fade away from memory. So many fucking people have given their lives throughout history to see this thing out and you just spit on their graves. You give up, you consent. You swallow the pill of existentialism as if it were the oxygen you breathe. Your materialist, atheist, Lazaie-faire attitude towards suffering disgusts me. I was hoping you had soul, you are intelligent. Think again about your bold claims to their being no boogeymen, they&#39;ll be on your doorstep before you can say, &quot;told ya so&quot; </p>

Keep having the time of your life because it is important to be happy; but I really doubt you are gonna be willing to lay down your precious life for truth. Sounds like your perfectly content with the way things are. If you haven&#39;t been able to tell by now, I&#39;m not.

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s what you need to know, in my opinion.  Regarding the truth.</p>

<p>Truth is ther&#39;es a holy battle going on.  Between all major religions and between the areligious/gnostics  who riled them up....and who are waiting for the major religions to tear themselves (and us) apart.  There&#39;s another way.  And it&#39;s for everyone to settle, at least philosophically on atheism and for them to do their pretending on their own time, with their own energy.  I&#39;m talking about secular humanism, generally.</p>

<p>Atheists are smarter and more honest people.  Because despite having the &#39;moral compass&#39; given to them by religion, they generally rise to the altruistic expectations and philanthropic aims of society, participating fully despite being derided, excluded, squelched and dismissed, insultingly.  Most importantly, they don&#39;t push their agenda.  I am not atheist I am a buddhist.  Some say they are similar and that i suppose is fair.</p>

<p>Religious people the world over have one common trait: they think they are right about their religion.  They have this thing called &#39;faith&#39; which they would have us believe is the conviction that they are right without any evidence.  They say things like &#39;God talks to me&#39;, etc and they battle each other even within their own ranks on &#39;who is holier&#39;.  It&#39;s a form of competition, to see who Daddy God likes more.  See how this behavior creates pecking order, hierarchies and class division?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You dont&#39; see atheists competing on who doesn&#39;t believe God more!  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, they implicitly believe in egalitarianism, a trait which is not only evolutionarily productive, it&#39;s fair and just and certainly more <em>empathetic to each other as they see each other as being on the same footing, in the same situation, sharing the same successes, failures, and sufferings</em>.  Furthermore, under egalitarianism, everyone has these things we call &#39;opportunity&#39; and &#39;choices&#39;, irrespective of &#39;consequences&#39;. </p>

<p>Furthermore, Atheists are infinitely tolerant far more than religious people are to them.  They have to tolerate religious people saying &quot;God talks to me&quot; and this kind of thing.  Yet they know they&#39;ve never, ever heard God talking to them.  And so the wisdom derived from not ever hearing divine voices goes like this:</p>

<li>) Someone else says God talks to them, but doesn&#39;t to me.<br/></li>
<li>) That&#39;s not fair, why has God never even tried once to talk to me.</li>
<li>) What did I do for God to not ever talk to me?  Am I defective?  Why am I being exlcuded.</li>
<li>) Ok well I will just ask them.<br/></li>
<li>) Hmm.  It sounds like they are just making this up.</li>
<li>) Oh I get it, these fuckers <strong><em>are</em></strong> <em>making it up</em>.</li>
<li>) Well isn&#39;t that rotten?  They are lying.  All the time.  These religious people are lying all the time.  Even to themselves and calling it &quot;Faith&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<p>So to the atheist, you have religious people who are lying all the time to themselves and others fighting other people who lie all the time to themselves and others; and one liar thinks the other liar is wrong to worship his gods, etc.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Atheist then live in a perpetual state of eyeroll.  Because they know that they can&#39;t possibly believe in a God that&#39;s is supposed to be all powerful but with all his power would select out a few people to talk to so that they can then feel special and wage class war and religious wars on people as a result.  <em>Atheists can&#39;t get behind that!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this isn&#39;t the end of the story.  This is just a wake-up call. It&#39;s time for religious people around the world to ADMIT.  That they are faking their faith, that it&#39;s all a big live-action-role-playing game, and that they will be allowed and encouraged to continue their brand of &#39;pretend&#39; so long as they stop battling others over their version of &#39;pretending&#39;.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this pisses people off, but we don&#39;t have time anymore for this god damed foolishness.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Atheism isn&#39;t the end, nor is it a religion or philosophy in my book.  I&#39;m a buddhist by choice and not the rub the tummy kind or burn incense or leave fruit kind.  I&#39;m someone who believes in the philosophy of it.  To be good to people and help them achieve higher states of consciousness.  I believe it&#39;s time to legalize all drugs, take drug offenders out of jail and give them jobs working on sustainable solutions for everyone to enjoy, not just the 1% or the privileged, entitelment working americans who don&#39;t want to share because they earned it without thinking about what they earned.  I think our solution is for everyone to garden and take psychedelics once they are legal and give up this rap about us versus them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am literally reeling. Truth bomb! Haha! My dad&#39;s actually a pastor and I&#39;ve been trying for years to reason with him. It&#39;s very difficult and I feel like the universe is putting me through a real test because the people I love are engaged in nonsense and will likely continue till they pass on doing so. My father, while being very close to me and respecting me the most of his children (seeing as how I&#39;m the only one with his own living situation and jobs and schooling) looks down on me sometimes because of my openness to the rest of the world. He does great things; he moved to a po-dunk town in the middle of nowhere and is single handlely saving lives out there. He does a lot of good. But his hubris, his devotion to Jesus, and his arrogance in his own teachings&#39;s morality in the place of other&#39;s, while subtle, is very disturbing to me. To put it in perspective; I have a brother who has literally done nothing but squander our familiy&#39;s time and money with drugs and theft. My dad, the big ol&#39; preacher, decides to give him a house, a truck, a job, etc in his town with him...because he totally vibes with Christainity (I&#39;ve taken psychedelic drugs with my brother, he literally is caught in between the dichotomy of &quot;either it&#39;s the Christian God, or its Nietchze&#39;s way of thinking and NOTHING matters, so we&#39;re in hell..talk about the worst night of my life). My father, when I mentioned just moving out there, on my dime, just in passing, had all kinds of reasons and excuses why I need to change before I do anything like that. The people down there hate Obama, but thy just LOVE America. So he thinks I won&#39;t fit in (I won&#39;t). I&#39;m not even trying to move there is the funny part, I was saying it to make my dad feel closer to me because we live hours away from each other for the first time in my life. It was hurtful to dig that deep into his mind about God, and always will be because he is so set in his trust in Jesus. Anyway, I&#39;ll stop blabbing. Keep up the good work man, but realize that it may not be up to us to change these people&#39;s hearts and minds. You are the subject of your life. Change yourself and change will spread. Godspeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a metaphor. I mean.. It&#39;s 2016. I&#39;m surprised to be alive.. Happy, but surprised. There is hope. The &quot;switch&quot; is change. It&#39;s the growing sense that something isn&#39;t right. </p>
