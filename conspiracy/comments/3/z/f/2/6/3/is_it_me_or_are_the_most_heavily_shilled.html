        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In my years of experience in this sub I have just noticed that these topics, more than any of the others commonly discussed here, seem to always attract a particularly intractable species of shill. The kind of shill that simply cannot be reasoned with no matter how many facts you present them.</p>

<p>I guess it just occurred to me, as I was linking a recent study on the ineffectiveness of puttingFluoride in water as a means of preventing tooth decay. I just thought, &quot;I know the guy is not going to read the study I linked, why am I wasting my time?&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe it is because I spend a lot of time in the GMOandFluoride topics, but it seems to me that defender shills appear in these topics <em>every time</em>, and it is uncanny that they always seem to be people who, looking in the post history, are on reddit for the sole purpose of the topic they are shilling for. Is it just confirmation bias, or are these the most heavily shilled topics outside of 9/11 and politics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is a sore spot for me als, but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s not as simple as &quot;let&#39;s just take this excess over here and put it in this deficit over there&quot;. Having worked in food service and knowing a few in the grocery and deli business, the amount of waste is unreal. Not just &quot; gee, these things didn&#39;t sell and now they are spoiled&quot;. There is so much waste of good edible food. </p>

<p>For instance, the deli of my local Kroger throws out everything that they do not sell rather than donating it to a shelter or food bank because the shelters become reliant on their waste. If local deli has a good day of sales and doesn&#39;t give anything to the shelter, they pitch a fit because they don&#39;t have another source of food for that day. Honestly, that&#39;s why they just throw it out. </p>

<p>There are other reasons food is wasted that are monetary; a cafe I worked years ago would not let us eat expired food because then we wouldn&#39;t buy a lunch or dinner from them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s true that the numbers for the amount of waste and hunger are appalling, but the solution is not trivial, possibly dangerous (due to food borne pathogens), and probably wasteful in other measurable ways, such as transportation and man-hours. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I always expect the Vitamin A rice argument to be brought up by a pro-GMO advocate, because it&#39;s the most used argument. It has been proven ineffective, but since I&#39;m not in a position to dig up the articles to prove that, I&#39;ll leave that topic there.</p>

<p>My whole point is that GMOs are unnecessary, and cause more overall damage to the planet than good. We simply don&#39;t NEED them, despite some people try arguing that we do. It&#39;s as if some people ignore all other solutions for feeding the world except for GMOs. We have dozens of better solutions that just aren&#39;t being tried, because there aren&#39;t millions of dollars to be made there unlike in GMOs.

<p>They don&#39;t cause more damage relative to non-GMO crops, and by increasing yield they decrease emissions/farmland/water and pesticide use. </p>

<p>There are plenty of organic and progressive agricultural practices that take care of all of those issues anyway. I&#39;m not going to go dig up each and every one because this has dragged out quite a bit. But again, no need for GMOs. My guess is that you subscribe to news sources with a mainstream pro-GMO stance rather than any of the many alternative sources which discuss progressive agriculture and ancient effective agricultural techniques. Look into it, you might be pleasently surprised. It&#39;s sad that in today&#39;s North American market, Monsanto is part of a system that pushes common farmers into buying into their set of products due to primarily financial reasons. Our current system makes it very difficult to make any major progress in terms of farming methods in North America. </p>

<p>Food production has always been linear, while population growth has always been exponential. So we might have enough food for now, but what happens in 100 years?</p>

<p>Also no one seems to know exactly wtf is going on with the climate. We cannon assume we will always have the same amount of temperate landmass from which to farm.</p>

<p>Lets not foget about the bees either! we need to reduce our dependency on pesticides; genetically modifying crops is the best way of going about this.</p>

<p>I would agree that GM crops are more important for the future than the present. But the future is what scientific experiment is all about.</p>

<p>Propaganda online is pretty cheap. Many people don&#39;t watch TV anymore. Even if it was really expensive, why do you think the government wouldn&#39;t waste money? I normally see people claiming the government wastes money. Now, since it is convenient for your argument, suddenly the government tightens up the budget? Besides that, you seem to have never even attempted to google this. I&#39;ll do it for you. </p>

<p>Top post on this sub is on the front page of 350,000 people. This sub, as well as many others probably has a few different groups manipulating the discussion. It would cost 100 bucks or so to spread propaganda to many thousands of people, assuming you paid them for a few hours during peak traffic with 20 accounts or whatever. Worth it? Maybe. If it&#39;s a government, they are known for wasting money. The more shilling organizations out there, the more likely that one of them will be interested in this subreddit. </p>

<p>If I ran a shilling organization, I&#39;d run it efficiently. The <em>only</em> thing that I would care about is the top post in the hot queue, and possibly any posts that will make their way to the hot queue. Why? Compare the votes. Many posts on here will hit 5-6000 upvotes. The second to the top post will normally be around 100-200 upvotes. Today is a bad example because of the time the posts were displaced, but I want you to keep an eye on this difference from now on. That is only counting the people who vote. I&#39;ll estimate how many actual people will see a post. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/traffic">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/traffic</a></p>

<p>25,000 unique IP addresses (unique people) per day actually go into <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, mostly from their front page into the comments section of only the top submission. There are a very small number of people who venture further into the subreddit. This is not counting how many people see the top post without looking at the comments. That would be significantly more. I&#39;ll be conservative and estimate that 50,000 people see the top post. That is 50,000 people who may want to spread this information to other areas of Reddit, facebook, twitter, etc. It could end up being hundreds of thousands of people who see a piece of content because one crazy conspiracy nut posted it on here. </p>

<p>Are you beginning to see why the plethora of organizations out there could be interested in what is posted to this sub and Reddit in general? Maybe they don&#39;t focus tons of time on this subreddit, but they focus on other subs and to justify a paycheck, shills will mess with this subreddit as well when there isn&#39;t much going on elsewhere. There are tons of possibilities. </p>

<p>Also, I organized tons of relevant information on <a href="/r/shills">/r/shills</a>. Have you browsed the content there? </p>

<p>As for the AIPAC post, that one was actually number 1 at 6:45 pm EST, then another post skyrocketed within an hour and took it&#39;s place. On the link above, you will notice that peak traffic is about 7:00 to 9:00 pm EST. If they only care about the top post and only care about peak traffic (remember- efficiency), then this makes sense. </p>

<p>Are you a gambler? </p>

<p>GMO&#39;s are a Pandora&#39;s box. Even the best scientists with the best intentions taking precautions to mitigate any <em>foreseeable</em> consequences have a major problem: The effects of genetic modification on the target organisms and on other interacting organisms CANNOT be reliably foreseen. To say otherwise is sheer hubris.</p>

<p><strong>And these organisms reproduce.</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about cross-breeding dogs or apples, or grafting one kind of fruit tree into another, we are talking about introducing genetic material from one species into another - like incorporating genetics from bacteria into corn, potatoes and other crops, or adding genes from one type of animal to another to enhance certain traits, protect from pests and diseases, etc. </p>

<p>Again, these organism reproduce in the wild, and when they do, the traits of the offspring often shock the GMO scientists themselves.</p>

<p><strong>GM canola plant refugees from farms in North Dakota bear multiple transgenic traits</strong></p>

<p>Excerpt: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We found transgenic plants growing in the middle of nowhere, far from fields,&quot; says ecologist Cindy Sagers of the University of Arkansas (U.A.) in Fayetteville, who presented the findings August 6 at the Ecological Society of America meeting in Pittsburgh. <strong>Most intriguingly, two of the 288 tested plants showed man-made genes for resistance to multiple pesticides—so-called &quot;stacked traits,&quot; and a type of seed that biotechnology companies like Monsanto have long sought to develop and market. As it seems, Mother Nature beat biotech to it.</strong> &quot;One of the ones with multiple traits was [in the middle of] nowhere, and believe me, there&#39;s a lot of nowhere in North Dakota—nowhere near a canola field,&quot; she adds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, through natural crossbreeding - in the wild - the Canola did what Monsanto had TRIED to do with all of their resources - and failed. </p>

<p>So then, if nature can, on its own, create totally unpredicted traits that are see as FAVORABLE to short-sighted humans, what traits and changes are likely to occur that are unpredictable and UNFAVORABLE? </p>

<p>Do we really want to know?</p>

<p>Human nature is such that if we can do something, we almost always WILL do it, because, well, <strong><em>why the fuck not?</em></strong></p>

<p>If they can weaponize genetic modifications, they will. If they can genetically modify humans to create a hard-working obedient and docile slave-worker class, they fucking will.</p>

<p>Science fiction? Not even. And once loose in the wild, these changes are irreversible, potentially permanently changing entire species, as well as other species that feed on and interact with them - FOREVER.</p>

<p>Yay GMO&#39;s?</p>

<p>Ok, on to GMOs! The term GMO covers a huge range. I was referring to GM crops. I am not an expert, but I have done some personal research and had several conversations with my roommate, who is working on his phd in biology with a specialization in botany. He is currently working on what I am about to outline below. </p>

<p>GM crops are safe for humans. We already eat them all the time. Since the dawn of civilization we have been selectively planting crops that: produce a favorable yield,are disease resistant, are pest resistant, ect. This IS genetic modifying, it quite literally changes the genetic code, its just quite slow. What they are working on now is essentially the same thing. Except they go in at the molecular level and manually alter the dna code to produce the same outcome. Its the same thing, it just doesnt take generations to succeed. </p>

<p>Edit: And also almost every single thing humans have done since the industrial revolution has destroyed ecosystems.</p>

<p>High Fructose Corn Syrup - a gmo</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one google search about it:</p>

<p>Without knowing it, the HFCS in your body may be setting the stage for health problems including:
Diabetes. Know how HFCS worsens diabetes, which is mainly rooted in insulin problems.
Metabolic syndrome. ...
Damage to your immune system. ...
Speed-up aging process. ...
A load of dangerous mercury poisons.</p>

<p>(IS FUCKING TERRIBLE FOR YOU AND HIGHLY ADDICTIVE)</p>

<p>Corn Starches and Corn Syrups (WHICH ARE BAD FOR YOU)</p>

<p>ARE IN ALMOST EVERY PROCESSED FOOD IN NORTH AMERICA EVEN CANS OF SOUP</p>

<p>Have that healthy Yogurt with your immune damaging HFCS!

<p>Please, I&#39;d love to hear how a Coca Cola (not really a food just a bunch of chemicals) is good for you. That high fructose corn cancer sure is delicious.</p>

<p>The same people that allow you to buy BATTERY ACID IN A BOTTLE, tell you it is okay to eat Genetically FUCKING MUTATED food.</p>

<p>Tell me what do these three things have in common? REFINED SUGAR, WHEAT, COCAINE.</p>

<p>(The answer is that all three are chemically treated plants that are highly addictive in nature, all of which have obvious negative health effects.)</p>

<p>Why are all the bees dying?</p>

<p>I could go on forever, honestly. Congrats on your friend with the institutionalized education that was probably funded in part or all by corporations/corrupt government. </p>

<p>Every single thing I said here is true. Please tell me more about these GMOs. Gluten has done exceptionally well over the years at making hundreds of thousands of people intolerant to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://paleoleap.com/11-ways-gluten-and-wheat-can-damage-your-health/">http://paleoleap.com/11-ways-gluten-and-wheat-can-damage-your-health/</a></p>

<p>Did you know cigarettes are not as bad for you in countries that aren&#39;t in North America? Do you know why? The CHEMICALS THEY SPRAY ON THE TOBACCO PLANTS. Compare a pack of cigarettes like Indonesia&#39;s for tar, nicotine, etc. ALL READINGS ARE LOWER. Your tobacco providers do not care because they are in it to PROFIT FROM YOU. </p>

<p>There is not 1 legitimate reason we need to modify our food the same reason there is not 1 legitimate reason we need to fluoridate our water, we have more than enough space on this planet to yield normal crops for every single person. Making the plants immune to bugs that our ecosystem needs to thrive isn&#39;t exactly ideal, actually it&#39;s beyond stupid. Kind of like all the other reasons to GENETICALLY MODIFY AN ORGANISM ON OUR PLANET. Please understand the domino effect this type of ideology creates long term. Science is like a religion, don&#39;t blindly follow it. You can&#39;t use &quot;but science&quot; as an argument and provide no other evidence of your claims. GMOs are clearly NOT good for you.</p>

<p>The fact that people don&#39;t understand how Fluoride affects PH balance is foolish. Old women realize they shouldn&#39;t feed their plants tap water because its too acidic (causes cancer because negative ph balance is carcinogenic) and then they turn around and down a glass of it themselves into their own body.</p>

<p>Talk about denial.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Every crop you eat has been heavily modified. Think about how Shih Tzus and Dobermans come from the same early canines... we have caused massive genetic changes to the crops we eat. Corn used to be the size of your thumb, bananas used to be inedible, watermelon used to resemble a nut.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They use the same pesticides they put on your potatoes as chemical warfare. AND THEY ADMIT IT. Monsanto MANUFACTURED AGENT ORANGE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, the chemical division of the company formerly known as Monsanto is now owned by Pfizer, not the seed biotech company formed in ~2002 now known as Monsanto. But we&#39;ll ignore that with a handwavy &quot;well they profited off of it&quot;.</p>

<p>There are no employees of the seed biotech company that worked for the chemical division which produced Agent Orange. The US government <em>forced</em> Monsanto, along with a handful of other companies, to produce AO by enacting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Act_of_1941">The War Measures Act</a>, and Monsanto <a href="https://books.google.pl/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;amp;amp;pg=PA17&amp;amp;amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;amp;amp;q&amp;amp;amp;f=false"><strong>warned the government</strong> that shoddy manufacturing would result in toxic contaminants</a>. </p>

<p>Check out this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When we (military scientists) initiated the herbicide program in the 1960s, we were aware of the potential for damage due to dioxin contamination in the herbicide. We were even aware that the &#39;military&#39; formulation had a higher dioxin concentration than the &#39;civilian&#39; version due to the lower cost and speed of manufacture. However, because the material was to be used on the &#39;enemy,&#39; none of us were overly concerned. We never considered a scenario in which our own personnel would become contaminated with the herbicide.&quot;   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did some research into Iodine recently.  From what I&#39;ve read it lets the body excrete fluoride and bromide, and helps with metabolism.  </p>

<p>Its natural in our bodies and I have also read that a lot of people in the west have an Iodine deficiency so the body cant combat fluoride as well, it&#39;s our diet I think.  </p>

<p>Japanese people eat lots of seafood (naturally high in Iodine - especially seaweed like Kelp) and they have very low cancer rates, which is another benefit of Iodine, it has anti-carcinogenic properties.  </p>

<p>There is a world of research only a google away, here&#39;s the first one on duck duck go - <a href="https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/minerals/health-benefits-of-iodine.html">https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/minerals/health-benefits-of-iodine.html</a></p>

<p>edit: Also Japanese men have less lung cancer even though they smoke more, this is a possible reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Skepticism is the umbrella term for this kind of religion.</p>

<p>Like DrSultanPhDD said, you just need to get other people to champion their knowledge by feeding them the knowledge you want to perpetuate. Skeptic websites fulfill this goal by arming people with talking points which they never had to research or verify themselves.</p>

<p>It&#39;s bothersome because I consider myself a skeptic, but I have a very hard time relating to most of these &quot;skeptic&quot; folks or their agendas. Reading a blog article which claims to be skeptical or claims to debunk a myth, and then making an assumption the article was correct, is not how one practices skepticism.</p>

<p>This new form of skepticism is a way of saying <em>&quot;other people questioned this before and luckily we already have the answers you need, there is no reason to question any further you silly human we&#39;ve already done all the work!&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the official story doesn&#39;t make sense, you start looking around and find stuff like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zerowasteamerica.org/fluoridechronology.htm">How We Got Fluoridated</a> (1999)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Along with the shaping of public attitudes, industry influenced key government agencies. The US Public Health Service (USPHS), and later, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cooperated, to a surprising degree, in the economical disposal of industry&#39;s toxic fluoride waste materials. As a result of agency appointments and hiring of industry-funded scientists, these government agencies became closely identified with the motivations of industry. In the process, they have had to ignore serious adverse effects on human health - from fluoride as well as a number of other toxic chemical compounds. In the easy choice of catering to industry, these Agencies incrementally abandoned their own basic charge of promoting human and environmental health.</p>

<p>This identification with industry was true regarding air pollution, and later epitomized in water fluoridation, with the USPHS eventually setting the goal of mandatory national fluoridation by the turn of the century. EPA later rationalized this goal by calling it an efficient way to recycle waste.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the realignment of the Public Health Service into a strong supporter of fluoridation, research in academic institutions also came under the control of big industry on this feared pollution issue. Control over research in academic institutions was brought about through the giving and withholding of government grants and research contracts. All government support of academic institutions was channeled through the industry biased Public Health Service. These pressures and incentives grew as industry grew. Applied relentlessly over the years and decades, the fluoride industry&#39;s influence on academia has now spanned most of the 20th century.</p>

<p>By way of economic incentives the American Dental Association (ADA) also became a prominent and active promoter of fluoridation. This came about through the influence of a small clique pretending to speak for all dentists. While the public has tended to see ADA as an unbiased professional organization, it is, in fact, a trade group, with predictable motivations. The role of ADA in fluoridation has been that of an opportunist. It has received ongoing financial support from the USPHS, itself a virtual arm of big industry. ADA alleged an ethical role on the part of dentists based on their claim that fluoridation would reduce dentists&#39; income. But expensive cosmetic dentistry required to hide the effects of fluorosis actually increased the incomes of dentists. As a result, the dental trade association has become an ideal front for big industry in their scheme to dump fluoride waste products at a profit.</p>

<p>Influencing the US medical community was also of crucial importance to the success of the fluoridation scheme. Thousands of American Medical Association members came to be dependent on grants from the National Institutes of Health (a part of the USPHS) for most of their support. A majority of medical schools also came to recognize their increasing dependence on government grants via USPHS. One effect of this influence was minimizing the subject of fluorosis in medical texts. Consequently, the majority of dentists and physicians know very little about chronic fluoride poisoning.</p>

<p>Industry&#39;s unstated motivation behind water fluoridation was to find an economical means for disposal of their accumulating fluoride waste products, and to avoid claims for compensation by workers harmed by airborne fluoride on the job. USPHS supports this industrial strategy while at the same time actively assisting industry in a cover-up of their fluoride air pollution problems. Today, through regional and county health offices, USPHS influences city councils to override previous ballot decisions against fluoridating public water, thereby subverting the basic principles of democratic government, as well as compromising public health.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I deleted my post so I could add more to it without the edit showing up.  You&#39;re a fast one.</p>

<p>ORIGINAL: There is a concentration of lead and mercury at which you wouldn&#39;t notice ill effects.  You may be experiencing them without knowing it.  At higher concentrations, problems become evident.  At even higher concentrations, diseases emerge.  Go even higher and you die.  What is this?  A poison.  How much poison is good for you?  It depends on why you are taking it.  Is the benefit of it greater than the side effects of it?</p>

<p>EDIT: It is worth noting that lead was once added as a sweetener and people used it for a time before realizing it was so harmful.  Mercury was used as a medicine, but again, observation of ill effects caused that to end too.</p>

<p>We are stupid monkeys that usually follow the leader, perceived authority.  Only a small minority <em>actually</em> questions authority, even though proclaiming that oneself does is a popular thing to do.</p>

<p>There is plenty of evidence that fluorine is poisonous to life.  Low concentrations are safer, but the safest dose of any poison is zero.  So what if the level of poison we are subjected to causes few visible effects other than perhaps arthritis, dental fluorosis or somewhat rare kidney issues?  Aside from the dental fluorosis, we just don&#39;t make the connections, just like those in the past failed to do over things we now see as obvious.  Have some mercury.  It will cure what ails you?  It&#39;s shiny I guess.</p>

<p>Also, the reason why we don&#39;t put any other poisonous substances (aka drugs) into the water supply is because we cannot control dosage.  The follow the leader effect keeps us supporting fluoride, because to question adding it to the water supply means that we have to question authority, which currently strongly supports adding it.</p>

But there are hundreds of studies, many of which are side by side case studies of communities with and without fluoridated water.

    <div class="md"><p>The concentration is &quot;low,&quot; but it becomes high if you look at aggregate fluoride exposure (1 + 1 = 2, very simple math), which causes dental and skeletal fluorosis in certain groups because of the amount of water needed per day, specific foods eaten that contain fluoride pesticides, amount of toothpaste absorbed, and possible genetic sensitivity to fluoride. At best, you could say that we are preventing cavities while increasing dental and skeletal fluorosis. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few examples: </p>

<p>The fluoride in green/black tea was not measured accurately. Now we know it can be up to 9ppm, which is more than twice the maximum contaminant level for drinking water. <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100714104059.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100714104059.htm</a></p>

<p>African Americans are twice as sensitive to fluoride. This was known all the way back in 1962. <a href="http://fluoridealert.org/wp-content/uploads/1962_01_10_Blacks_Fluorosis.pdf">1962 internal memo, PDF</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/11559124/">Chicken nuggets have high fluoride content because of the deboning process</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In its proposed prohibition on sulfuryl fluoride, EPA acknowledged that the pesticide&#39;s residues on food are &quot;responsible for a tiny fraction of aggregate fluoride exposure&quot; but deemed that children&#39;s total contact with fluoride in the environment -- through drinking water as well as toothpaste -- posed an excess risk of tooth and bone damage.</p>

<p>This week&#39;s twin fluoride restrictions reflect &quot;a growing consensus that Americans are exposed to too much fluoride,&quot; EWG senior vice president for research, Jane Houlihan, said today. &quot;It raises the concern that, for many decades now, the public has been overexposed.&quot;</p>

<p>First approved for use as an anti-termite insecticide more than 50 years ago, sulfuryl fluoride was federally registered for use on food in 2004 and 2005 by Dow AgroSciences</p>

<p>If the math is so simple perhaps you could get it right? You are neglecting excretion <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/opinions_layman/fluoridation/en/l-3/2.htm">(plasma half life of 3-10 hours)</a>. Also, fluoride does not build up in soft tissues, only in the bones and teeth (same ref). Is that really a problem? Because AFAIK dental fluorosis is an aesthetic issue only, and most of the time it is<a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD010856/ORAL_water-fluoridation-prevent-tooth-decay"> only visible with excellent lighting and magnification (by the dentist).</a> Indeed, except for the most severe cases, teeth with fluorosis are <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Qs-JCgAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA52">more resistant to cavities.</a></p>

<p>Given that fluoride is naturally occurring, is present in a lot of water naturally and in tea apparently, would you not think if it were so harmful the body would have evolved some active excretion or defense? (There is passive excretion in kidneys by the glomerulus but not active in the tubules like sodium for example.)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slweb.org/CEN.skeletal-fluorosis.html">Here is a breakdown of the mathematical failure of fluoride regulations.</a> You may also be surprised to find out that certain people will coincidentally consume high fluoride foods, and so we need to do something either about the water or the food to avoid risks to subpopulations. Fluorosis is also affected by nutritional status. Moderate and severe fluorosis also exist. </p>

<p>This is a severely flawed argument. Arsenic is also naturally present in some water supplies and we are able to comprehend that it is beneficial to avoid it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An enemy of the state is not automatically YOUR enemy. Fact. </p>

<p>NLP is part of it, yes. Medium of delivery counts as well. It&#39;s said that watching television for as little as 60 seconds makes one&#39;s brain move into what is called a &quot;low alpha wave&quot; state. Which is a way of saying that television opens you up to suggestion. Deep, subconscious suggestion. </p>

<p>We already know that advertising is designed to appeal to your core subconscious so that you feel good when you see Brand X in the store and buy it. Once you unlock that knowledge of how to program the human mind, a lot of things become possible. You have a direct pipeline for your messaging, delivered straight to your target audience in a way that makes compliance not only probable, but likely in a sizable segment of the population. Anyone that doesn&#39;t comply or resists can easily be earmarked as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; and society will do the work of shutting them down, shutting them up, and otherwise marginalizing that person. And thus, any competing messaging is lost to peer pressure and the ingrained drive to conform.</p>

<p>Cited out of order for relevancy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fluoride does not accumulate in brain. Of all tissues, brain has the lowest fluoride concentration [Jenkins, 1991; Whitford, 1996; Ekstrand, 1996]. It is generally agreed that the blood-brain barrier restricts the passage of fluoride into the central nervous system. The human pineal gland is outside the blood-brain barrier [Arendt, 1995]. It is one of a few unique regions in the brain (all midline structures bordering the third and fourth ventricles) where the blood-brain barrier is weak. Cells in these regions require direct and unimpeded contact with blood [Rapoport, 1976]. Therefore, pinealocytes have free access to fluoride in the bloodstream. This fact, coupled with the presence of HA, suggest that the pineal gland may sequester fluoride from the bloodstream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>{...}</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The purpose was to discover whether fluoride (F) accumulates in the aged human pineal gland. The aims were to determine (a) F-concentrations of the pineal gland (wet), corresponding muscle (wet) and bone (ash); (b) calcium-concentration of the pineal. Pineal, muscle and bone were dissected from 11 aged cadavers and assayed for F using the HMDS-facilitated diffusion, F-ionspecific electrode method. Pineal calcium was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Pineal and muscle contained 297±257 and 0.5±0.4 mg F/kg wet weight, respectively; bone contained 2,037±1,095 mg F/kg ash weight. The pineal contained 16,000±11,070 mg Ca/kg wet weight. There was a positive correlation between pineal F and pineal Ca (r = 0.73, p&lt;0.02) but no correlation between pineal F and bone F. By old age, the pineal gland has readily accumulated F and its F/Ca ratio is higher than bone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned that &quot;phosphate mines as well as mind control industries&quot; are pro-fluoridation. I asked you for a source for those claims, you retorted that I need a source for claims that fluoridation is needed in water at all, so I cited that it&#39;s good for dental decay. So I&#39;ve proven my point. Now either you can refute my point by either citing another paper claiming otherwise, prove that my citation is invalid, or we go back to the main issue - me asking you for a citation that &quot;phosphate mines as well as mind control industries&quot; are pro-fluoridation.</p>

Other countries are strongly against <em>medication of any kind</em> being added to a drinking supply, which happens to cover fluoride as well. Probably because their government represents the wishes of the people who just want clean unadulterated water as a basic necessity of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Outside of 9/11 and politics, these are the next 2 most popular conspiracies.</p>

<p>Ok... Im going to be called a shill, but let me give you the opinion of somebody who understands these topics, and has done research on both sides.</p>

<p>Let me start with GMO. Im a Biology major, I worked in a university research laboratory for 2 years in college. Personally, I feel like people who oppose GMO just don&#39;t know any better. GMO and genetic technology has been slandered and demonized in the media, thanks to Monsanto. This technology is amazing, we have discovered a way to identify what parts of DNA are responsible for a specific function of an organism (plants, animals, fungi..). We know what part of a plant&#39;s DNA codes the enzyme that is responsible for &#39;Vitamin A&#39; synthesis. This knowledge is applied to humans. We can identify the error in your DNA will cause diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and even cancers. However, sometimes there are mistakes, and a modification can have an unintended outcome. These are impossible to predict. It&#39;s like knowing the final outcome of a chess game based on the first move. But these mistakes are not a conspiracy to make people sensitive to gluten, or autistic. Its simply a new technology taking its course and finding its place in the world.</p>

<p>Fluoride on the other hand... I believe it has no purpose in our water supply other than keeping rich people rich. I believe it once had a positive effect, before oral hygiene was common, but now it&#39;s just a relic. I don&#39;t believe it has any effect now. It might not have even been effective to begin with, it just strikes me as something a lobbyist would try to sell to the government to make money.</p>

Not to mention seeing strawberries the size of tangerines is just scary when the ones I grow are the same size as raspberries. I like things natural because natural has a proven track record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im just a skeptic. Personally I don&#39;t care one way or the other about fluoridation. I don&#39;t believe it causes harm, not enough evidence to support it.  </p>

<p>Like I said above, I feel like with oral hygiene becoming more common, fluoridation is less necessary. However, that article made me think.. how many 10 year olds brush their teeth daily? I know I didn&#39;t. Ive never had a cavity, maybe fluoride is to thank.</p>

<p>Interesting study. Especially the part it takes 2.5-3 years for the trend to appear. I never really meant it was not effective to begin with, just its not needed anymore. I was wrong about that too! It makes sense though, maybe as an adult you take better care of you teeth than children, so fluoridated water is needed for children&#39;s health. I would like to see a study on adults without fluoridated water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that parents take care of their kids&#39; teeth... for every kid with bad dental hygiene, there must be a parent with bad dental hygiene. </p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t follow the recommended practices of brushing at least twice a day (or after every meal) and flossing every day. I hate flossing, but those newer plastic floss holders are better... I just brush once a day, or skip it if I&#39;m super tired. I have had 1 cavity my whole life (in a tooth flaw?). But my wife, who brushes more consistently than me has had lots of cavities. She also grew up on reverse osmosis water, which could be a factor, but I think she also is unlucky in her genes. Anyway, my point is that some people are lucky with a genetic resistance to cavities. So those kinds of people might think it&#39;s less of a problem than it is. </p>

<p>My impression is that the dental medical world also thinks fluoridation is still helpful. </p>

<p>So he has an interest or enjoys arguing or vehemently disagrees with people, etc. etc. etc.. You still have LITERALLY NO PROOF that he&#39;s paid to do so. Literally none. Maybe it is his hobby. &quot;Naw. I doubt it.&quot; What a strong argument. You sure removed that possibility!</p>

<p>So for all your rambling all you managed to say was &quot;I don&#39;t have proof, actually, but it&#39;s there, I swear, and people have literally no reason to regularly disagree with me unless they&#39;re paid.&quot; </p>

<p>I also agree that most flat Earthers are genuine, but I think the idea was propagated as a psi-ops as per the methods recommended by <a href="http://sometimesagreatmotion.blogspot.com/2014/01/just-ask-native-american-about-it.html">Cass Sunstein</a>.  The link is to a bit I wrote about his paper on how to destroy conspiracy communities.  It doesn&#39;t go all-out in suggesting that false conspiracies should be propagated by infiltrators, but it does talk about how to infiltrate groups.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. The technology behind &#39;GMO&#39; has the potential to really change the world for good. It has the potential to cure degenerative disease, cancer, and other terminal illness. 90% of people hear &#39;genetically modified&#39; and immediately think its bad, and honestly I believe this is intentional. GMO is always portrayed negatively by the media. I was in biology research in college and trust me, these people (scientists) are just like you and I.</p>

<p>Fluoride im on the fence about. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s a mind control conspiracy, but I do think it&#39;s not needed in our water supply and the only reason it still exists is because of lobbyists. Its like circumcision, it once had a medical benefit, but now it is just done because, why not?</p>

<p>I dislike loaded nature of that statement. There are plenty of products that are from at least one point of view waste products of other processes. We put chlorine in water to prevent bacterial contamination but chlorine is a waste product from some perspectives, and it was a chemical weapon in WW1. Sausages could be thought of as a waste product of pig breeding. And the soil we grow vegetables in is a waste product of geological weathering of rocks. Are they therefore bad?</p>

<p>A molecule made by natural means is exactly the same as one made by a nuclear reactor.  </p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t.  Sodium fluoride and hydrofluorosilicic acid are literally toxic byproducts of the phosphate fertilizer and nuclear industries, among others.  This is where these compounds came from historically.  Now most of our &quot;fluoride&quot; comes from China, so who the fuck really knows what&#39;s in it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about the fluoride.  I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s horseapples, but I do tend to rely on <strong><em>my own first-hand experience as truth</em></strong>, which means that I feel every bit as anti-authoritarian, anti-government and pro-truth drinking the fluoridated municipal tap while watching in disbelief of the WTC7 tower falling in video, the burned cars and molten steel hemmoraging from the building....as I am now, on well water with zero fluoride.  My point is, I&#39;ve not seen a difference in my mind, ergo nothings wrong with fluoride as far as I am concerned.  Other effects, perhaps but I couldn&#39;t detect them so they must have been sufficiently subtle for me to say I don&#39;t believe in the fluoride deception.  </p>

<p>That said, if enough people don&#39;t want it in their water, well goddammit take it out.  And it&#39;s clear enough people don&#39;t want it in our water!  This is what makes me mad.  They won&#39;t act democratically or listen to the will of the people. They&#39;ve spoken.  They want it gone.</p>

<p>Now what&#39;s happened between 2002 and now is anyones guess.  I&#39;ve only been off the fluoride for 3 yrs now so it&#39;s not that.  Or maybe I&#39;m resistant because I did LSD.  Or maybe it&#39;s ELF waves or lilly wave induction from cellphones.  Or doritos.  Or fox news.  It&#39;s anyones&#39; guess.  (my money&#39;s on fear, anger and fox)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had the exact opposite experience since I&#39;ve stopped drinking fluoridated tap water.</p>

<p>Historically, what they were adding to water was literally <em>highly toxic</em> waste products from the nuclear and phosphate fertilizer industries, among others.  These substances are so toxic that they require hazmat suits to handle and if they were to spill on a road somewhere it would be a public emergency.  Now we import most of it from China so there&#39;s really no telling what is or isn&#39;t in it considering China&#39;s horrible history of regulating pollution and industrial corruption.</p>

<p>Also consider that if you live in the US you&#39;re still getting your daily dose of flouride every time you take a shower, every time you wash your dishes/utensils and then use them, every time you drink a soda, every time you eat out at a restaurant, most times you eat something made in a grocery (fruits and vegetables were likely washed in fluoride water), etc.  It isn&#39;t easy to eliminate completely by any means.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Vertical farming is an incredibly efficient way to grow food and is starting to gain some traction.  Some operations recycle 100% of the water they use!  Not to mention it takes a fraction of the land, growing cycles are independent of weather variables, and LED lightning is helping reduce the overall energy load.  I&#39;m very optimistic in this regard.</p>

<p>A good chunk of the people on those countries would probably like access to clean drinking water as a start:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the way you&#39;re thinking, don&#39;t think I&#39;m a shill or anything lol. But there are hundreds of studies, many of which are side by side case studies of communities with and without fluoridated water. I concede they may not have found some weird effects if they were not thinking to measure, but I mean people have been crying foul on fluoride for a long time so I really just find it hard to believe these connections wouldn&#39;t turn up over the years.</p>

<p>No it hasn&#39;t. It&#39;s barely been given a chance, though. I have rebuttals if you actually want to dig up your sources.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t cause more damage relative to non-GMO crops, and by increasing yield they decrease emissions/farmland/water and pesticide use. </p>

<p>We have dozens of better solutions that just aren&#39;t being tried, because there aren&#39;t millions of dollars to be made there unlike in GMOs.</p>

<p>Why would a company spend money on a non-optimal approach?</p>

<p>Monsanto <a href="https://i.imgur.com/VVpF3go.jpg">doesn&#39;t have a monopoly</a> and there are <a href="http://fdzeta.com/subir/images/ZXRYf.png">plenty of independents</a>.</p>
