    <div class="md"><p>Proof that they don&#39;t have an interest in people&#39;s health.  CBD is the next ibuprofen and many orders of magnitude better, but it&#39;s also better than epilepsy meds.  It&#39;s an antiinflammatory that doesn&#39;t give you ulcers.  So it competes in a mild way...with ....
....opiate painkillers</p>

<p>OH.  I get it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a huge heroin problem in my area. People I know and care about are addicts and it&#39;s been seeming more and more real lately, but it wasn&#39;t until the other day when a father brought his 11 year old kid to get ice cream where I work and had the kid eat the ice cream outside in the car while he shot up and od&#39;d that it really turned my stomach the most. The kid went back to the car and found him and couldn&#39;t wake him up. I&#39;m on the phone with 911 trying to get this guy to snap out of it because he was still breathing and looking at the innocent face of a child and thinking what is this country doing??? Almost all of these people start on prescription pain killers. If only we treated pain in a better way to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is that depressing? You don&#39;t HAVE to get high for it to be an effective medicine. Cannabis itself is helpful, however the side effects can be a turn off for some people. Why not have both available, is more what you should be stating, rather than: aww, but you can&#39;t use it recreationally as well!.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are any of you surprised they were stopped? The state has agreed that there are medicinal properties to weed, that doesn&#39;t mean that anyone can just make their own. What do you think would happen if i made some homemade paracetamol? Or opioid medications? Do you think i might get raided?</p>

<p>Why should canaboids be any different</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many questions, for one, no I&#39;m not surprised at all, but am saddened. Two and three, maybe, it depends on if you raised any flags, gave any probable cause or reasonable suspicion. </p>

<p>Why should CBD be different? Because study upon study shows it has great potential benefit and relatively little to no risk. It&#39;d be akin to making some homebrew beer in that sense, except WAYYYY less deadly, WAYYYY more beneficial. Is home brewing beer illegal? (happens 24/7 in this country). Why do you think CBD should be lumped in with obviously dangerous drugs?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>people make homemade herbal things all the time, people brew beer and wines, some distill spirits.</p>

<p>making is never the problem, false advertising will get you a lawsuit, raid or court appearance.</p>

<p>if this is marketed as a general &#39;health tonic&#39; or as a food supplement, no harm no police or govt interference. at least not legal ones.</p>
