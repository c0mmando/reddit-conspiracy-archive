       Proof that they don't have an interest in people's health.  CBD is the next ibuprofen and many orders of magnitude better, but it's also better than epilepsy meds.  It's an antiinflammatory that doesn't give you ulcers.  So it competes in a mild way...with ....
....opiate painkillers

       We have a huge heroin problem in my area. People I know and care about are addicts and it's been seeming more and more real lately, but it wasn't until the other day when a father brought his 11 year old kid to get ice cream where I work and had the kid eat the ice cream outside in the car while he shot up and od'd that it really turned my stomach the most. The kid went back to the car and found him and couldn't wake him up. I'm on the phone with 911 trying to get this guy to snap out of it because he was still breathing and looking at the innocent face of a child and thinking what is this country doing??? Almost all of these people start on prescription pain killers. If only we treated pain in a better way to begin with.

       Why is that depressing? You don't HAVE to get high for it to be an effective medicine. Cannabis itself is helpful, however the side effects can be a turn off for some people. Why not have both available, is more what you should be stating, rather than: aww, but you can't use it recreationally as well!.

       Why are any of you surprised they were stopped? The state has agreed that there are medicinal properties to weed, that doesn't mean that anyone can just make their own. What do you think would happen if i made some homemade paracetamol? Or opioid medications? Do you think i might get raided?

       So many questions, for one, no I'm not surprised at all, but am saddened. Two and three, maybe, it depends on if you raised any flags, gave any probable cause or reasonable suspicion.

       Why should CBD be different? Because study upon study shows it has great potential benefit and relatively little to no risk. It'd be akin to making some homebrew beer in that sense, except WAYYYY less deadly, WAYYYY more beneficial. Is home brewing beer illegal? (happens 24/7 in this country). Why do you think CBD should be lumped in with obviously dangerous drugs?

       Fuck off with your "why is anyone surprised" bullshit. Can you point to anyone who is surprised? Is this just an attempt to stroke your ego because you know better than everyone else? Or are you just here to suggest that indifference is the way to go?
