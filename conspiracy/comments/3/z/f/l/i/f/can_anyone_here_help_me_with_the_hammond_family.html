I need help with sources on the back story. If any of what I say is wrong, tell me and please provide a source of with the . </p>

<p>The according to a rancher I know who&#39;s been following the story of the Hammonds for 4 months now, the government has contacted out the mineral rights on the Hammond ranch land and the Malheur refuge. According to him, there&#39;s huge amounts of uranium and natural gas.</p>

<p>The Hammonds have had issues with the government over this land for quit a while and at some point the Hammonds had to burn the area around a hay stack and a small part of federal land was burned by accident. The feds used that as an excuse to try to bring the heads of the Hammond family up on charges of domestic terrorism where the minimum sentence is 5 years. They were headed to jail willingly when this militia business began, and I believe they are still headed to jail and have nothing to do with the militia. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a conspiracy around Obama in all of this. It appears he has been pushing to shut out oil companies around the world and trying to switch the US over to natural gas. He&#39;s contacting the rights to natural gas off of federal land (like in this case) to companies that have supported him before and during his presidency. I know that that&#39;s not a very sinister conspiracy, but if he and other government officials are using foul play to get land owners to give up their land (like with the Hammonds) it becomes a bit more terrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a response I made in another thread. Long enough that I thought I&#39;d share.</p>

<p>A long time ago, ranchers in the area gifted land to the federal government to ensure grazing rights to all ranchers in perpetuity. This is before BLM even existed. The government&#39;s job was simply to manage the land and ensure free access to all area ranchers. The families in the area all have very old contracts stating this.</p>

<p>Later, the BLM was formed which then received stewardship of the land. The BLM stated they are a new department so they get to dictate new contracts, invalidating the original contacts. Not legal of course, but they are the feds. Understandably this caused problems.</p>

<p>The original families were all grandfathered and can legally ignore the BLM&#39;s unlawful demands. Part of the new demand are new grazing fees. The family pays the new fees to stop illegal harassment by the feds. The fees continue to increase over time, forcing some families to stop using the land, which is what the BLM actually wants.</p>

<p>The Hammonds stop paying their fees as they are not obligated and paying them isn&#39;t stopping the feds from harassing them. The feds now claim millions due in back taxes and fees.</p>

<p>Next BLM says they can no longer use the lands since they&#39;ve stopped paying and because there is a protected turtle which is being horribly harmed by their grazing cattle. Meaning even if they were to start paying again the Fed&#39;s position is that they can no longer use the land because it&#39;s killing protected turtles.</p>

<p>Shortly after this things start getting ramped up for the infamous standoff. Meanwhile the BLM starts stealing and killing the Hammond&#39;s cattle and at the same time start killing thousands of the protected turtles because of rampant over population; clearly invalidating the fed&#39;s claims that grazing castle was destroying habitat and killing turtles.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we find out the head of the BLM is well connected with the oil and gas industry and illegally they are moving people off the lands to allow illegal oil/gas access in violation of the original contracts which eventually allowed stewardship of the land in the first place. Which is why BLM was pushing so hard to invalidate the original, grandfathered contracts. Which for the most part has successfully worked.</p>

<p>Apparently along the lines some illegal deer poaching took place; says the feds. I&#39;m inclined to believe it. To hide the poaching a controlled burn was started, supposedly to destroy evidence, which burned into federal land. This was used to claim arson. Threats against firemen also come into play and claims that the Hammond tried to mass murder fireman via arson are leveled by the feds.</p>

<p>The arson trial resulted in a sentence of one year. Seems to imply the courts did not believe the government&#39;s claims. The minimum sentence is five years. The problem is, once the sentence begins to be served the state can not legally change the sentence. The BLM pointed out the sentence was too short and forced the sentence to be changed to the minimum even though it&#39;s illegal to do so at this point.</p>

<p>The militia comes in because they see this as a continued attack on rights and violation of federal law by the feds.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I know. Or at least think I know.</p>

<p>Can we get a source on this please? IT would really help turn this argument around of people saying that they shouldn&#39;t have access to land if they dont pay grazing feeds if we can get some legit sources.
If nothing shows up I guess I will look into it. We probably need to start taking the initiative on these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What bothers me most about this whole ordeal is that a judge can say that a sentence is not enough and pluck a man who has been released. Hell, that&#39;s almost a violation of double jeopardy, or at least it should be. </p>

<p>And I want to ask that judge who thinks this is such a serious crime, if he even knows anything about farming. You burn the land, you create ash and potassium and other minerals which are essential to a healthy ecosystem. Part of the reason why the land isn&#39;t doing so well lately is because these judges think they&#39;re land stewards, when they have never left the safety of their ivory towers and secure courts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not pulling this out of my ass, I burn my leftover plant matter and use the ash as fertilizer, I don&#39;t use any of that artificial crap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that judges don&#39;t have the power to determine sentences is a direct assault on the Judicial branch by the Legislative and a direct attack on the Constitution&#39;s separation of powers.

    <div class="md"><p>Mandatory minimums are an example of good intentions gone awry.  It would be great if a local judge&#39;s ruling that they&#39;re cruel and unusual could spark a public examination of the flaws in the system, but the Bundys would be the last people to incite an objective and reasonable debate of the pros and cons of mandatory minimums--at least not any debate that would actually get anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but I think the conversation would have much more potential viability if it had started with, for example, the Hammonds. Unless Hammond Sr. is a real asshole, I would imagine a 74-year-old man facing four years in prison for an out-of-control burn would make a great poster child for judicial discretion of cruel and unusual punishment. Unless some dick came along and hijacked his publicity...</p>

And this is the first I&#39;ve heard about the poaching part, although the mineral and gas part makes sense that it could be the underlying reason for this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially yes.  They are not going through another trial process though.  The federal government just over turned the local judges decision and making them serve the minimum of 5 years.  There is no precedent for this. This is why the militia feels the government has gone to far.  Only stuff flying around right now is from conspiracy websites and such.  Hopefully mainstream media picks it up and we can get better information. </p>

<p>The local judge ruled the mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years in prison unconstitutional under the 8th amendment, the Hammonds served there time (3 months for the old guy and 1 year for his son) and now the feds came in and said they have to serve 5 years each even though the Hammonds already served their sentence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop being misleading. They were sentenced in late 2012 and the government filed their appeal about the under-sentencing (in their view) to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2013. This did not all happen in 2015 because someone decided they had a personal vendetta. The 9th Circuit agreed with the government and sent the case back to district court for resentencing. The resentencing ended up happening in 2015, as appeals tend to take a while, and the Hammonds were ordered to return to prison by January 4th, 2016 to serve the rest of their sentence with credit for time served.</p>

<p>First, yes, it can take that long to complete a case if an appeal is involved. The original trial was a matter of months. I highly encourage you to lead the link I gave above since it goes through the trial/appeal and even gives the brief for the resentencing that goes into detail. Unfortunately, I am afraid I can&#39;t answer why they weren&#39;t charged immediately, nothing I have found has explained that. Lastly, no, the statute of limitations did not run out. As far as I can find, Oregon doesn&#39;t have one and the federal statute for arson is 10 years. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently they were not allowed to present certain evidence at trial, etc etc.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? Nothing I have read has mentioned that at all. But to be honest, I can&#39;t think of any evidence, short of them having video or pictures of someone else starting the fire, that would have changed the verdict.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The only places I can find that have anything about them signing away rights to first refusal is from InfoWars and their ilk who comveniently don&#39;t provide any further sources for that claim. InfoWars also states it was a part of the original plea deal, not something new. So, do you have anything else that corroborates that claim? One issue I see is that the resentencing brief in the link I gave does not mention that as being part of the plea deal they were offered in the listed conditions, so the only option I can see is if it was done separately.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read the 2001 fire is the most serious charge and the 2006 one was apparently minor and just made to be a big to do because of a burn ban.... The 2001 appears to have been far outside of the statute of limitations.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Constitution isn&#39;t being ignored, but it can be interpreted differently.  </p>

<p>The &#39;right to bear arms&#39; is a good example.  Firstly, the government isn&#39;t giving permission to own guns, the People are already born with the right.  The People can choose to give up the right or put on reasonable limitations (no guns for felons or mentally challenged) and regulations (no open carry).  </p>

<p>The government often ignores (differently interprets) the Constitution, but may end up losing when the court case is settled by the Supreme Court (long, expensive, and most people give up), and losing in court creates precedence.  That is bad, in the long run, for the government.</p>

<p>As for the Hammond family, they are just another group being screwed by bad laws and a political agendas.  Drug laws do this to poor inner-city kids all the time, but drugs = bad, and they are poor, so fuck &#39;em.  </p>

<p>The Federal government wants the land, and the family has had some run ins with Federal Agencies.  The Hammonds burnt down 1/2 a square kilometer of Federal land, and appellate judges overruled the sentences the original judge gave.  They were already warned to not let fires go onto public land and the government accused them of slaughtering deer in an illegal hunt.  The fires were set during a burn-ban (the American West is very sensitive about fires getting out of control) and part-time firefighters were nearby.</p>

<p>The Federal government wanted the 5 year sentence because it&#39;s a mandatory sentence for arson on Federal land, if they didn&#39;t pursue it, then it would set precedence which would weaken future cases.  </p>

<p>There is a mix of politics going on.  Environmentalists, hunters, mineral and fuel extraction corporations, ranchers (who graze cattle on public land), Federal, State, and local agencies and bureaus are the players.  </p>

<p>So, they are guilty of a crime which the first time they did it they were given a pass.  They were warned not to do it again.  They did it during a dangerous time of year.  They have a business that&#39;s partly dependent upon using public land (for a fee),  and the law is overly harsh and doesn&#39;t allow for judges to use common sense (almost all of the anti-terror and anti-drug laws are like this).</p>

<p>But this is what happens when the police are militarized, $1.1 trillion spend a year on national defense and surveillance, and 40 years of the War on Drugs and 15 years of the War on Terror.  The Constitution isn&#39;t perfect, but the problem is society has slowly decided safety and regulations are more important than freedom and personal responsibility.</p>

<p>The issue is:  few months in jail verses 5 years.  Is it cruel and unusual to put someone in jail for 5 years for what they did?  I would say yes, but the law is used to punish <em>and</em> prevent others from doing future illegal behavior.  5 years is the government telling local yahoo rednecks they can&#39;t do whatever they want with no consequences.  There is a lot of &#39;us verses them&#39; mentality in rural America.  Using a hammer when a screwdriver is more appropriate sends the message the government will go after you, too, if you get out of line too much.  I just finished a History of English podcast, interesting how William the Conqueror executed the Harrying of the North.  Governments are always trying to send a message to the plebs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what doesn&#39;t get addressed here are the allegations by a Hammond family member that the 2001 fire was set intentionally to cover up poaching activity.  Also, the &quot;small amount of land&quot; was something in the 125-137 acre range on govt property, without permission or notification. It was not some small piece of grass.  I would like to see the whole picture before deciding, but the details of the trial and poaching seem to be totally disregarded on many pro-Hammond accounts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That fire did happen yes in 2001, but i think that the poaching accusations were fabricated to make them look even worse in the public eye. The BLM wants control of their land and the media is there to spread their propaganda.  </p>

<p>(i) In the early fall of 2001, Steven Hammond (Son) called the fire department , informing them that he was going to be performing a routine prescribed burn on their ranch. Later that day he started a prescribed fire on their private property. The fire went onto public land and burned 127 acres of grass. The Hammonds put the fire out themselves. There was no communication about the burn from the federal government to the Hammonds at that time. Prescribed fires are a common method that Native Americans and ranchers have used in the area to increase the health &amp; productivity of the land for many centuries.</p>

<p>(j) In 2006 a massive lightning storm started multiple fires that joined together inflaming the countryside. To prevent the fire from destroying their winter range and possibly their home, Steven Hammond (Son) started a backfire on their private property. The backfire was successful in putting out the lightning fires that had covered thousands of acres within a short period of time. The backfire saved much of the range and vegetation needed to feed the cattle through the winter. Steven’s mother, Susan Hammond said: “The backfire worked perfectly, it put out the fire, saved the range and possibly our home”.</p>

<p>k) In 2011, 5 years after the police report was taken, the U.S. Attorney Office accused Dwight and Steven Hammond of completely different charges; they accused them of being “Terrorists” under the Federal Anti terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. This act carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum sentence of death...
(n) During the trial proceedings, Federal Court Judge Michael Hogan did not allow time for certain testimonies and evidence into the trail which would exonerate the Hammonds. Federal prosecuting attorney, Frank Papagni, was given full access for six days. He had ample time to use any evidence or testimony that strengthened the demonization of the Hammonds. The Hammonds attorney was only allowed 1 day. Many of the facts about the fires, land and why the Hammonds acted the way they did was not allowed into the proceedings and was not heard by the jury. Example: Judge Hogan did not allow time for the jury to hear or review certified scientific findings the fires improved the health and productivity of the land. Or, that the Hammonds had been subject to vindictive behavior by multiple federal agencies for years.</p>

<p>(o) Federal attorneys, Frank Papagni, hunted down a witness who was not mentally capable to be credible. Dusty Hammond (grandson and nephew) testified that Steven told him to start a fire. He was 13-years-old at the time, and 24-years-old when he testified (11 years later). At 24 Dusty had been suffering with mental problems for many years. He had estranged his family including his mother. Judge Hogan noted that Dusty’s memories as a 13-year-old boy were not clear or credible. However, Judge Hogan allowed the prosecution to continually use Dusty’s testimony. When speaking to the Hammonds about this testimony, they understood Dusty was manipulated and expressed nothing but love for their troubled grandson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>small is a matter of semantics when talking about ranches. To me, 125 acres is a lot of land. But if those 125 acres were part of a 10,000 acre ranch, then it was indeed a &quot;small&quot; amount of land compared to the whole. Idk how much land the BLM area consisted of, but it&#39;s probably a safe bet that it was several thousand acres at least. </p>

<p>Since you think the charges are bogus, do you not believe the Hammonds really lit a fire that burned onto federal land? Also the fact that they already spent time in prison doesn&#39;t mean much. If I were to spend a week in prison for murder, does that mean I shouldn&#39;t have to serve any more time? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The charges in question are &quot;Terrorism&quot; charges</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t &quot;terrorism&quot; charges though. They were charged with arson. The mandatory minimum of five years for arson on federal land comes from the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. That doesn&#39;t mean they were charged with terrorism.</p>

<p>Yes it does.  If a judge rules that you only spend one week, then that is what you serve.  The 5th amendment protects you against the government double-dipping like this.  You cannot be tried twice for the same crime, and by extension cannot be punished multiple times for the same crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s also a conspiracy around Obama in all of this.  It appears he has been pushing to shut out oil companies around the world and trying to switch the US over to natural gas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One important division in geo-strategic thinking in the west is neo-liberals versus neo-cons.</p>

<p>Before going into too much detail, we&#39;re giving the benefit of the doubt already calling it geo-strategic thinking.  It&#39;s more like self-interested crony capitalism under the guise of do-gooding.  But anyway....</p>

<p>There is a very sharp distinction in ownership of energy reserves in the US.  Much of the petroleum is in the hands of right-leaning individuals and companies.  Old Texas oilmen and such.  Everyone pretty much knows this.  On the other hand, natural gas is primarily available off the coasts (under Federal control) and in the northeast (liberal) areas.</p>

<p>Neo-liberals, not neo-cons, have always been the ones preoccupied with a unipolar world.  To put a face to this, think of someone like Brzezinski (Obama&#39;s mentor all the way back to Columbia).  Brzezinski ran the heroin trafficking in Vietnam with Kissinger, then they moved on to Afghanistan in the 80s before arriving in the modern era that you may be more familiar with.  On the other hand, neo-cons control the cocaine business and most of you are probably more aware of this.</p>

<p>Neo-cons have more of a containment orientation than a unipolar orientation.  You never saw them actually build pipelines through Afghanistan from the central asiatic states even though we heard about it nonstop, nor did we seize the Iraqi oil supplies, etc.  Iraq from a neo-con perspective is the tipping point between Shiite/Sunni factions and a place where you want a semi-chaotic state that can be pushed one way or the other overtime.  A managed chaos to manage oil prices.  Plus they own the companies that do the (re-re-re-)rebuilding, military subcontract work, etc.  Right leaning individuals prefer military prowess and tend to dominate the companies that work in this area.  No surprises here.</p>

<p>Neo-liberals, particularly Brzezinski and Obama by extension, do actually retain policy goals often ascribed to neo-cons.  The war in Syria for example to get a pipeline of natural gas through to Europe.  You can tell Russia shares my assessment through their non-intervention in Afghanistan/Iraq but foot down on Syria.  On the domestic front, neo-liberals have set in motion a massive expansion of natural gas production including LNG export terminals.  This is meant to, in combination with other projects like the (failed but attempted) pipeline through Syria, to provide sufficient natural gas supplies to Europe that Russia is no longer needed.  Rather than a bi-polar influence in Europe, the US gets unipolar domination of the west if the natural gas play panned out.  Think about something like the Koch brothers and the pipeline to the Canadian tar sands.  Did it ever occur to you that the demonization here was a bit excessive or over the top?  Well, sure, there are some environmental extremists and such, but we know major public movements that make it to TV are top-down pushed and not grassroots.  The real play here is that processing of Canadian tar sands burns lots of natural gas, which runs counter to the neo-liberal geo-strategic play in motion.  Working against the pipeline is a national security thing to neo-liberals, but for reasons and concerns that neo-cons do not share.  So now it makes sense why they are so over-the-top on Keystone or whatever.  Neo-liberals are more fond of utilizing companies they tend to run/own just like neo-cons: you get Google led Arab Springs and Facebook paid to indoctrinate/censor views that go against neo-liberal policies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to say one group is better than the other or anything.  They both mostly just hurt average Americans and are enriching themselves in different ways via the government with national security as an excuse.  You&#39;ll find &quot;mainstream&quot; TV opposition to either policy in a limited fashion because there are large, wealthy, vested interests in different national policies.  The policies also negatively impact smaller, less influential individuals to a different degree as well, which goes a long way towards explaining bias you see at a more grassroots level.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s pretty easy to see that the US has become intellectually incompetent and devoid of statesmanship.  Things swing back and forth at a national security level on the basis of making money rather than sound ideas.  Truly a fallen nation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual situation of the Hammonds?  They&#39;re going to prison for 5 years for a crime they already did time for.  </p>

<p>For alleged crimes it took 5&amp;10 years for the charges to come to trial.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s definately a legit story for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> given these facts and the fact that at their latest court room endeavor, they were not just sentenced but also bound to sell their land to the government before anybody else.  </p>

<p>How could anybody look at all of that and think it&#39;s anything other than a land grab?  </p>

<p>People don&#39;t just go to prison and then years later get told to go back to prison because the previous judge sentenced them too leniently.  </p>

<p>They weren&#39;t terrorists then and they aren&#39;t now.  The propaganda msm is running is absurd.</p>

<p>The government is pursuing charges of terrorism for burning government land?</p>

<p>The Bundys are extremists, but the Hammonds haven&#39;t poached anything (can you give a source?). They were burning their own land to eliminate an invasive species the first time and accidentally burnt 139 acres of government land. The second time they only burnt an acre of gov land, and that was when they were doing a controlled burn around a haystack to keep it safe from a wildfire sparked by lightning. <a href="https://reason.com/blog/2016/01/04/rancher-arson-case-that-inspired-oregon">Source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I spoke with several militia leaders from around the states yesterday after I got wind of what&#39;s going on in Oregon. None of them agree with what&#39;s taking place out there, more especially how they are doing it not so much as to the why they are all there. I have solid intel that there is at least one or more double agents in this &quot;militia&quot; group that has taken over the federal building. </p>

<p>The fact that FBI is out there first kind of gives the false flag narrative an ace in the hole. This is not how we win the freedom movement. Now the National Guard is being sent out there. These guys who took over the federal building are not true militia, this is a rogue group of extremely dangerous people that are being herded to one spot, away from people, maybe for their promised gun battle. It&#39;s all too convenient for me to believe. </p>

<p>This group claims they are going to occupy this place for years, and logistically that will never happen once the power, water, and food supply are cut off. This group out there wants a gun battle with the feds...they are openly stating this. They may just get their chance. This plays exactly into what Obama wants.Dot you think it&#39;s interesting that this happened the last year of Obama&#39;s reign? </p>

<p>MARINE/ACTIVE-LEO--(UPDATE 8:00 AM--Two things about this story, first the 41st infantry brigade of the Oregon National Guard was sent to help the FBI deal with this threat from this faux militia. They sent the infantry, not negotiation specialist. They know a fight is coming. </p>

<p>That tells me this is a staged event. Second thing is that the &quot;militia&quot; is being portrayed as all &quot;white men&quot;... who I&#39;m sure are &quot;Christian&quot;...so there you have it. White Christian Men Armed with military style assault rifles are attempting to over throw the federal government. What???? Did some one just combine all the talking points on CNN, Salon and the White House and decide to make a play? Sure seems like someone is pulling the strings here and it isn&#39;t these so called “patriots)&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By law, arson on federal land carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence.  When the Hammonds were originally sentenced, they argued that the five-year mandatory minimum terms were unconstitutional and the trial court agreed and imposed sentences well below what the law required based upon the jury’s verdicts.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, however, upheld the federal law, reasoning that “given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.”  The court vacated the original, unlawful sentences and ordered that the Hammonds be re-sentenced “in compliance with the law.”  In March 2015, the Supreme Court rejected the Hammonds’ petitions for certiorari.You can read the entire transcript for the 2012 US v Dwight and Steve Hammond here. Dwight served 3 months and his son Steven served a full year.

    <div class="md"><p>this is the first ive heard about uranium or natural gas.  can anyone provide me a credible link to this?  everything i can find on it is so obviously pro militia as to be propaganda.  also this whole thing appears to me to just be the bundys sticking their noses where it doesnt belong.  as if they were just itching to get involved with taking on the government and this whole story provided them the opportunity.  nobody asked them to.  the locals dont like these guys.  theyre like the redneck version of SJW retards.</p>

<p>SJW is a good comparison for the Bundy bunch, the Bundys are taking things a bit farther though.</p>

<p>Granted, it&#39;s only one side of the story, but to me it sounds more likely than they poached an entire herd of elk and burned the area to destroy evidence, which the wildfires in the area would have spread to eventually anyway, which is what the Bureau of Land Management is supposedly trying to claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That fire did happen yes in 2001, but i think that the poaching accusations were fabricated to make them look even worse in the public eye. The BLM wants control of their land and the media is there to spread their propaganda.  </p>

<p>(i) In the early fall of 2001, Steven Hammond (Son) called the fire department , informing them that he was going to be performing a routine prescribed burn on their ranch. Later that day he started a prescribed fire on their private property. The fire went onto public land and burned 127 acres of grass. The Hammonds put the fire out themselves. There was no communication about the burn from the federal government to the Hammonds at that time. Prescribed fires are a common method that Native Americans and ranchers have used in the area to increase the health &amp; productivity of the land for many centuries.</p>

<p>(j) In 2006 a massive lightning storm started multiple fires that joined together inflaming the countryside. To prevent the fire from destroying their winter range and possibly their home, Steven Hammond (Son) started a backfire on their private property. The backfire was successful in putting out the lightning fires that had covered thousands of acres within a short period of time. The backfire saved much of the range and vegetation needed to feed the cattle through the winter. Steven’s mother, Susan Hammond said: “The backfire worked perfectly, it put out the fire, saved the range and possibly our home”.</p>

<p>k) In 2011, 5 years after the police report was taken, the U.S. Attorney Office accused Dwight and Steven Hammond of completely different charges; they accused them of being “Terrorists” under the Federal Anti terrorism Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. This act carries a minimum sentence of five years in prison and a maximum sentence of death...
(n) During the trial proceedings, Federal Court Judge Michael Hogan did not allow time for certain testimonies and evidence into the trail which would exonerate the Hammonds. Federal prosecuting attorney, Frank Papagni, was given full access for six days. He had ample time to use any evidence or testimony that strengthened the demonization of the Hammonds. The Hammonds attorney was only allowed 1 day. Many of the facts about the fires, land and why the Hammonds acted the way they did was not allowed into the proceedings and was not heard by the jury. Example: Judge Hogan did not allow time for the jury to hear or review certified scientific findings the fires improved the health and productivity of the land. Or, that the Hammonds had been subject to vindictive behavior by multiple federal agencies for years.</p>

<p>(o) Federal attorneys, Frank Papagni, hunted down a witness who was not mentally capable to be credible. Dusty Hammond (grandson and nephew) testified that Steven told him to start a fire. He was 13-years-old at the time, and 24-years-old when he testified (11 years later). At 24 Dusty had been suffering with mental problems for many years. He had estranged his family including his mother. Judge Hogan noted that Dusty’s memories as a 13-year-old boy were not clear or credible. However, Judge Hogan allowed the prosecution to continually use Dusty’s testimony. When speaking to the Hammonds about this testimony, they understood Dusty was manipulated and expressed nothing but love for their troubled grandson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find any information about a 2006 trial.  I&#39;d already seen the link you posted.  It says &#39;5 years later...&#39; with nothing about a 2006 trial.  Because apparently there was nothing until 2011.  </p>

<p>And apparently their star witness had been 13 at the time of the 2001 incident and was deemed to be a completely unreliable witness, but the court still allowed his testimony.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>small is a matter of semantics when talking about ranches. To me, 125 acres is a lot of land. But if those 125 acres were part of a 10,000 acre ranch, then it was indeed a &quot;small&quot; amount of land compared to the whole. Idk how much land the BLM area consisted of, but it&#39;s probably a safe bet that it was several thousand acres at least. </p>
