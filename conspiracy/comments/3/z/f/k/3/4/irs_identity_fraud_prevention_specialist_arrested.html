    <div class="md"><p>In late spring of last year, more than 100,000 taxpayers had their personally-identifiable information <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150526/15302231120/financial-info-100000-taxpayers-now-hands-criminals-thanks-to-irss-weak-authentication-processes.shtml">accessed by criminals</a>. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a security breach, nor was it accomplished by &quot;hacking.&quot; Instead, it was the result of the IRS using common static identifiers to verify accounts -- information that could easily be found elsewhere. These were deployed to access transcripts of taxpayers&#39; filing histories. The transcripts gave criminals the information they were actually seeking: Social Security numbers, birth dates and current addresses.</p>

<p>The IRS promised to be less easily &quot;hacked&quot; going forward. It didn&#39;t mention any specific steps it would take. &quot;Protocols&quot; would be &quot;strengthened&quot; and taxpayers known to be compromised (likely a smaller number than those actually compromised) were given the consolation prize of free credit monitoring and a &quot;Sorry about that&quot; letter from the IRS.</p>

<p>In addition, efforts were mounted to further protect taxpayers from identity fraud, which, to date, has produced a study, a &quot;working group&quot; and a <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS,-States-and-Industry-Partners-Provide-Update-on-Collaborative-Fight-Against-Tax-Related-Identity-Theft">press release</a>. This may prove fruitful in the future (actual implementation date still TBA...), but it&#39;s too bad the agency couldn&#39;t be bothered to escalate its defensive efforts until after catastrophe had already struck. And it does nothing at all for <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao-ndal/pr/irs-employee-charged-1-million-id-theft-tax-fraud-scheme-0">past hurtful efforts made by &quot;helpful&quot; government employees</a>. (via <a href="http://overlawyered.com/2016/01/great-moments-in-being-from-the-government-and-here-to-help-you/">Overlawyered</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal officials today announced arrests and charges in a stolen identity tax-refund scheme believed to involve more than $1 million in false claims and run by an IRS employee who was supposed to be assisting taxpayers experiencing problems resulting from identity theft.</p>

<p>A federal grand jury earlier this month indicted NAKEISHA HALL, JIMMIE GOODMAN and ABDULLA COLEMAN for their involvement in a 2008 to 2011 scheme operated out of Birmingham that involved stealing personal identity information from the Internal Revenue Service to create fraudulent tax returns and collecting the stolen refundsâ€¦</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hall, having access to taxpayer information as an IRS employee, apparently orchestrated the scheme. Fraudulent tax refunds were routed to prepaid debit cards. These cards were then sent to a variety of fake home addresses set up by the three conspirators -- one of which is already doing time on an unrelated charge.</p>

<p>There you have it. The IRS is unable to protect you from outside threats or inside threats. It&#39;s still generally satisfactory when it comes to closing doors on empty barns, though. And, Nakeisha Hall -- tasked with preventing ID theft but instead engaging in it -- transfers to the US Dept. of Irony, joining such luminaries as Air Force chief of Sexual Assault Prevention (<a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2013/05/06/air-force-officer-accused-of-sexual-battery/">arrested for sexual assault</a>) and the Obama administration (whose open government workshop <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091207/1412137237.shtml">was closed</a> to the public). </p>
