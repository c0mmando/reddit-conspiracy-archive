<p>I haven&#39;t really dug into Sandy Hook but can somebody give me a proper link where they explain what exactly happened and what was staged. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised in the least, but so far I&#39;ve only seen some claims about crisis-actors being recognized as such. Nothing more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hardly ever participate anymore. I never really posted much but I enjoyed commenting and learning others perspectives through reading comments. Not anymore though. </p>

<p>Sandy hook was all bullshit and is incredibly well documented. The downvotes serve to keep this obviously false event out of view. </p>

<p>I only read the new queue and ignore the votes and comments until reading any linked info or articles.</p>

<p>I&#39;m only one user but I&#39;ve been on this sub long enough to spot brigades and useful idiots. It&#39;s not much but it&#39;s something... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple downvotes in minutes, 0 upvotes.</p>

<p>I <em>dare</em> any of you drive-by downvoters to refute the claims in this article.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to be proven wrong about Sandy Hook being a complete hoax!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is one of the most important topics for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to discuss, yet any submissions are soundly buried (without discussion) before they even have a chance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, let&#39;s just take this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sandy Hook Elementary School was not an active school because its Internet site had zero activity from 2008 to 2012 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Just because the Wayback Machine can&#39;t crawl a site doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.  At that time in 2008, the robots.txt file was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080604014943/http://www.newtown.k12.ct.us/robots.txt">changed to</a>:</p>

<pre><code>User-agent: *
Disallow: /
</code></pre>

<p>Which prevented Archive.org from archiving it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of easily-debunked and/or irrelevant nonsense Halbig - a man whose credentials are dubious and who seems to spends more time pleading for funds or grandstanding about permission slips - can provide. </p>

<p>The rest of his stuff is no better i.e. dismissing Noah Pozner&#39;s death certificate, without grounds, as a &quot;crude forgery&quot;, while also gullibly accepting the supposed &quot;FEMA manual&quot; which has actually been <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-sandy-hook-fema-drill-pdf.t4656/">thoroughly debunked</a>.</p>

<p>So, yeah. Fully deserving of any and all downvotes it received. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the website/webpage for the school that was circulating in december 2012 and into 2013 was classic geocities standard.</p>

<p>almost insulting to think somebody made that hilarious parody of a state school website and tried to pass it off as.</p>

<p>one very interesting factoid was the staff webpage, 80+ staff members (for 600/480/350 kiddies) including all the favourites, including the ones whose presence was impossible.</p>

<p>it worked out as two teachers per fifteen children (twenty classrooms) , an absolutely comical level of staffing for resource and money strapped state schools in 2012. </p>

<p>ahh &#39;metabunk&#39; or moronville as we fondly like to think of them here.</p>

<p>metabunk the people who think because iron has a higher melting temparature point than steel, <strong>steel cannot melt at iron melting temparatures</strong></p>

<p>metabunk perps are non technical morons, marketing peoples who dabble in their own BS.</p>

<p>The staff webpage listing <a href="http://nodisinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/james.png">36 teachers</a> and <a href="http://nodisinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/faketeach12.png">14 support staff</a>? So, actually 50, not the &quot;80+&quot; claimed, and right in line with the <a href="http://newtown.sandyhook.schooldesk.net/Staff/StaffDirectory/tabid/17319/Default.aspx">49 current staff</a>?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they use very obvious disturbing clever embarrassing psychological tactic.</p>

<p>some anon or persona in a forum will declare kids died, they knew a family, how dare you.</p>

<p>most people will quickly backtrack and distance themselves from death and horror and sadness.</p>

<p>nobody wants to be seen to upset a sad person.</p>

<p>no matter the persons are psychopathic liars for money.</p>

<p>the highly amusing and odd things is how in a country of 330 million, how multiple victims or family members of victims find themselves on a website and in a particular thread about a shooting/subject.</p>

<p>the probability against, or chances of three Newtown/CT people being on the same obscure conspiracy forum is astronomical (or a Youtube video calling BS). yet they magically appear to pretend cry, and scream at dissenters.</p>

<p>theres money being spent to put people (real or pretend ones aka AI bots) on forums.</p>
