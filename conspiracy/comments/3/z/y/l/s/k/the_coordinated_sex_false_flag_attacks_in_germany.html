        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was suspicious from the start.</p>

<p>100&#39;s of refugees... go have a rape party??</p>

<p>I mean sure, it could have been some, sick Illuminati-style sex ritual that the crarzay mooozlimz do.  But.... hahaha... I play the odds... and w/ apologies to the bigots, that shit really just doesn&#39;t happen &quot;naturally&quot; very often -- certainly not MORE often than &quot;false flags&quot; happen.</p>

<p>I chose to keep my mouth shut, and simply began downvoting the &quot;Mooooozlims Rape Attack!!&quot; headlines... </p>

<p>... not because I didn&#39;t believe it happened.  Yes, they (probably) happened.</p>

<p>... and unlike Sandy Hook, actual people were <del>killed</del> raped -- I fully suspect.</p>

<p>... but similar to Charlie Hedbo / Paris attacks: entirely CIA/Mossad-sponsored.</p>

<p>The &quot;tip off&quot; for me... when I learned that this was actually a &quot;coordinated attack&quot; -- i.e., not a sex party for sick pleasure.  <strong>This was a coordinated terrorist attack -- intended to terrorize.</strong></p>

<p>Begs the question: </p>

<p>Who benefits from a terrorizing Germans (i.e., and a destabilized EURO) and fevered anti-muslim rhetoric ?? </p>

<p>Do the refugees benefit ?? </p>

<p>No, I think not.</p>

<p>Does the US dollar benefit? Definitely. </p>

<p>Does Israel benefit? (Obviously, Netanyahu&#39;s apartheid regime ALWAYS benefits when the world hates on the mooooooozlimz.)</p>

<p>Who else?</p>

<p>China doesn&#39;t -- just loses a market. Maybe Russia benefits, but... there is a precedent for these kinds of coordinated, &quot;blame it on the mooozlimz&quot; terrorist attacks -- noting Paris &amp; Charlie Hedbo, most recently.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really think of anything/one else who benefits from these planned, false-flag terrorist attacks. </p>

<p>Can you ?</p>

<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE:  The Germany Rape Attacks were US/Israeli-sponsored false-flag terrorism.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>People who are reacting with their gut with &#39;kill the stone age fuckers!&quot; are playing into the hands of whatever this is, which is most likely the creation of a cultural boogieman like the early 20th century, except coked out weed smoking black dudes have been replaced by barbarous Muslims. I posted this on the other page but I&#39;ll copy it here.</p>

<p>I think there was a reason we had Trump being so obviously anti-immigrant right off the bat with no real immigration problem here at home, he was just setting the stage.</p>

<p>His rhetoric combined with the nightly news initially praising the German immigration response was to win over the liberals who were disgusted by Trump&#39;s claims and to act as a model for them. The news played into the hands of liberals demonstrating how kindness is a good quality when it comes to immigrants, of course before it all turns bad in a sequence of psy-ops that makes the average liberal think,</p>

<p>&quot;maybe letting in all the poor brown people isn&#39;t such a good idea, and maybe Trump had a point?&quot;</p>

<p>Does it strike anyone as odd that there would be synchronized cross-continental rape attacks on NYE? </p>

<p>Everyone saying that they&#39;re from a fucked up culture yes we all understand they&#39;re not from a place with modern western values, but please explain why there is this weird sense of organization. </p>

<p>For some reason I find it very bizarre to think they were texting each other across the continent planning their rape party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the press in Germany has been told by the government to cover up crimes by migrants.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3429621/German-journalist-claims-government-tells-media-t-report-following-outcry-Cologne-sex-attack-news-blackout.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3429621/German-journalist-claims-government-tells-media-t-report-following-outcry-Cologne-sex-attack-news-blackout.html</a></p>

<p>In Belgium Turks and Moroccans are 2% of the population and 16% of prisoners. In England and Wales Muslims are &gt;5% of the population and 12% of prisoners. In the Netherlands Muslims are 5.5% of the population and 20% of prisoners. Right now you&#39;re thinking well, that&#39;s Muslims, not migrants! Well in Denmark immigrants are 6% of the youth population and 70% of all youth prisoners (their descendants, coupled with immigrants, make up 12% of the population and 52% of all rape cases). Muslims in France are 12% of the population and 65% of the prison population. In Oslo non-Western people are 18% of the population and make up 46% of all rapes. Same thing for foreign born in Finland and Sweden, 5.5 + 15.9% of population and 41 + 50% of all rapes respectively. You can find all these facts sourced here in sources as diverse as the Washington Post, the Guardian, and many European news outlets. I know many of these facts are not migrant specific but as almost all are Muslim there is no reason to suspect that they wouldn&#39;t at least follow these trends, if not be even more prone to crime for a diverse number of reasons.</p>

<p><a href="http://fishything.com/truth-migrant-crisis-affects-europe/">http://fishything.com/truth-migrant-crisis-affects-europe/</a></p>

<p>This report, presented by the Gatestone Institute (currently headed by a former US ambassador to the United Nations, Elie Wiesel and a former CIA director now sit on the board) describes how immigrants and migrants have affected Sweden:</p>

<p>&quot;Forty years after the Swedish parliament unanimously decided to change the formerly homogenous Sweden into a multicultural country, violent crime has increased by 300% and rapes by 1,472%. Sweden is now number two on the list of rape countries, surpassed only by Lesotho in Southern Africa.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape">http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape</a></p>

<p>My mind is just blown that people like you can say, oh people are just being racist, it&#39;s just the media etc. Do you think the media is the reason why Swedish men risked everything, jobs, status, social standing, etc. to go out on the streets and rid their formerly crime free train station of criminals? I don&#39;t condone violence but in a pamphlet they distributed they just said they are sick of the rise in crime in their formerly safe city and the fact that police won&#39;t do anything about it - are they just imagining this? (P.S. this article says they &quot;beat children&quot;, and this is a lie, the police thankfully stopped them before anyone was injured):</p>

<p>Is the media the reason why men in Finland have been compelled to do the same? Are they suffering from the same delusions?</p>

<p>Did I say anything about racism anywhere in my post? I was responding to your assertion that &quot;they raise the crime rate a heinous percentage everywhere they go, in direct proportion to their numbers&quot;, by trying to provide a single counter-example (downgrading &quot;everywhere&quot; to &quot;nearly everywhere.&quot;)</p>

<p>Your response could have been a lot shorter - you only needed to cast doubt on the report I linked.</p>

<p>that depends on how you define &quot;evidence&quot;.  i clearly referenced the Paris and Charlie Hedbo &quot;attacks&quot; as precedent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally someone talks about it.<br/>
I totally agree,  we should expect an avalanche of false flag attacks this year ( especially in Europe) . 
I believe they won&#39;t be as big as Charlie hebdo 11/13 attacks because these had a more particular goal : 
Charlie hebdo : condition French public opinion . 
11/13 : Causus bellum for France to attack syria , and UK/US to join along. 
But we should definitely expect many of them,  because they will allow to &quot; shift the burden &quot; on muslims in order to justify things to come . </p>

She basically said that Muslims don&#39;t give a fuck about the rules of the native population and there are whole swaths of ethnic Germans that have simply gotten up and moved away from areas of the city where the Muslims suddenly became a majority. She said this is since Muslims keep blasting music late at night in the apartment complexes etc.  </p>

<p>She also said that there are empty apartments that the owners are basically giving out rent-free, but nobody sane wants to live in them since - you guessed it! - they are in the middle of these Muslim quarters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I currently live in Germany and I&#39;d say that&#39;s mostly bullshit.</p>

<p>Most of such claims are made up and/or only stated as something that happens more with muslims/immigrants because it&#39;s what&#39;s reported on more often, or just told more often, and â€” like red lights â€” what sticks more. There are, of course, cases where immigrants/muslims do such things, but no more than others* â€” regardless of religion or country of origin.
There are assholes everywhere, it&#39;s only that many people only remember/register/whine about those who fit in their views or the views papers like the BILD try to fuel.</p>

<p>*There is more violence and there are more issues in the &quot;Unterschicht&quot; (low class), which actually is where there&#39;s a larger part of immigrants: But it&#39;s not the immigrants who cause the Unterschicht-violence, but the Unterschicht is where unfortunately many immigrants are forced in. And once there, it&#39;s harder to integrate with the rest of the society, to get a proper job, and so on â€” which probably is a key factor in violence there. Plus, police will probably pick or invistigate someone with &quot;immigrant looks&quot; (or status) much more quickly than your average white German, which skews statistics even more. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>It&#39;s a pity no one even tries to get numbers when complaining about all the violence supposedly caused by the immigrants, or waits until there are some actual facts about a crime (like in Cologne), instead heresay and &quot;some of them maybe looked immigrantish&quot;-quotes are taken as truth about the &quot;animal-like hordes of raping immigrants.&quot; </p>

<p>Seriously, on new years eve there are so many drunk, massively stupid people on the streets doing all kinds of crimes, it&#39;s a thing independent of wether there are more immigrants or not.</p>

<p>People are, unfortunately, very quick to throw aboard their ability to think and their morality as soon as it&#39;s about pedophilia, or immigrants, or rape, or basically just &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;, differentiating as if a group of people were worth less (hey, you might remember some parts of history here, just a few decades ago..), wether those are the unemployed, the immigrants or whatever, and just run on assumptions. And once a group, or a person is publicly called a rapist, for example, he&#39;ll be screwed â€” even if he&#39;s later to be found innocent.</p>

<p>Here are just two examples of how wrong you are.
I can post plenty more.
Crime statistics speak volumes about ethnicity/religion of the great majority of perpetrators.
You are seriously deluded if you think this sort of behavior is just as common in native Europeans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are not something one could call a &quot;source&quot;:</p>

<p>The Gatestone Institute seems to be blindly anti-Muslim (there are proper reasons to criticise organized religion, and it&#39;s of course necessary to call a crime a crime), and one of the current article even starts with</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a response to a gang of a thousand migrant men sexually assaulting women in Cologne on New Year&#39;s Eve, the mayor suggested a &quot;code of conduct&quot; for German girls and women, as a measure to &quot;prevent such things from ever happening again.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is just plain wrong. There&#39;ve been a thousand men, of which some have been immigrants. There are some suspects, including immigrant suspects, but no convicts yet.
Everything else is speculation and right-winged manipulation. </p>

<p>The issue here are many drunk men on nye, and not &quot;hordes of immigrants&quot;. Abusing the horrible situation of people being raped to spread your own agenda is plain disgusting. (not only from the gatestone institute, but from many newspapers and -outlets, the AfD, all the Facebook-&quot;besorgte BÃ¼rger&quot; and so on)
As long as the people responsible here get the same just trial as anyone else in this democratic stat would everything is as it should be, and &quot;convicting&quot; people without a proper trial would be anti-democratic and what a lawless state, a fascist or dictator state or an above-the-law agency would do.</p>

<p>And a youtube channel called &quot;Mohammed Wasachildmolester&quot; shows its intentions immediately as well.</p>

<p>What&#39;s needed are facts and numbers, and not numbers like &quot;thousands of more rapes in Sweden since the &quot;immigration crisis&quot; started&quot; â€” because those were a result from a change in law in what constitutes as a rape in Sweden, not from an actual increase in rapes.</p>

<p>Without a proper source, it&#39;s all heresay, fearmongering and even more bullshit.
If crime statistics actually speak volumes, and those crime statistics can explicitly show a relation between ethnicity/religion and crime and not class, wealth etc, then I&#39;d be the first to challenge my own view.</p>

<p>You are so cucked and guilable its sickening.
All of this is well documented by now. &quot;right wing manipulation&quot; where? When the MSM tries hard to keep a lid on the facts and only alternative media first exposed this. 
Here have some more right wing manipulation from Emma <a href="http://www.emma.de/artikel/drei-stunden-koelner-hauptbahnhof-331147">http://www.emma.de/artikel/drei-stunden-koelner-hauptbahnhof-331147</a></p>

<p>Your pathetic attempts to relativate the facts show us that you are a hopeless commie. What is &quot;plain disgusting&quot; is that you try to twist the facts and claim that native Europeans behave like these savages. The facts don&#39;t match your lefty narrative so you twist them. Typical. The truth will catch up with you sooner than you will be able to stomach. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. even if Emma actually <em>was</em> a reliable source, nothing in that article refutes my claim that (almost) nothing about the &quot;thousands of immigrants&quot; is known yet, and more than speculation. I don&#39;t doubt there was a large group of men, of which many did (very) bad things â€” and if a large part of those were indeed immigrants then that&#39;s a thing one has to think about and ask questions â€” but everything else is not known, and unless &quot;alternative media&quot; actually gets its shit together and sources its claims it&#39;s as useless as &quot;the mainstream media&quot;. The way it is right now, answers are delivered without sources, before a proper analysis of the situation could&#39;ve taken place, to push one&#39;s agenda. That&#39;s an obvious issues with right-winged voices, as with (pseudo-)feminist voices â€” but left-winged voices are quick to deny things before anything is known as well, so they&#39;re not necessarily &quot;better&quot; in their way they work with media input here as well.</p>

<p>And until then, instead of wildly speculating from afar without any substantial source, shutting the fuck up until there&#39;s something to actually work with would help a lot. It would help <em>all</em> sides of the discussion,  be it the so-called &quot;savages&quot;, the people actually daring to call people savages from afar (yes, I&#39;m judging here, instead of trying to be neutral.. dehumanizing people and/or making them worth less than oneself is the first step to starting a genocide..), the Pro-Asyl-side or whoever..</p>

<p>I really liked this article about the KÃ¶ln-situation:
<a href="http://blog.zeit.de/radikale-ansichten/2016/01/08/drei-vorschlage-wie-man-uber-koln-reden-kann/">http://blog.zeit.de/radikale-ansichten/2016/01/08/drei-vorschlage-wie-man-uber-koln-reden-kann/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s neither left, nor right, but tries to get people to stop, think and evaluate instead of wildly throwing around facts. You know, for thinking before acting â€” I heard that helps, as well as actually challenging ones engrained beliefs. I do that very often, and sometimes I even change my view about things or â€” shocker! â€” admit mistakes. More people should do that.</p>

<p>Also of potential interest, although slightly unrelated (from a few months ago):

<p>Literally every article by now states that they where north african and Arabs. All the eyewitnesses, the victims and the police have confirmed this. So does the video and picture evidence. Not only this, but the police report also states that many where recent arrivals, who even mocked the police for being invited by merkel.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gone give you two of the most lefty sources so you don&#39;t go of bashing sources again:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.ie/world-news/mrs-merkel-invited-me-leaked-police-report-says-some-suspected-cologne-sex-attackers-claimed-to-be-refugees-34344044.html">http://www.independent.ie/world-news/mrs-merkel-invited-me-leaked-police-report-says-some-suspected-cologne-sex-attackers-claimed-to-be-refugees-34344044.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tvsx0">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06tvsx0</a></p>

<p>starting @ around 11 Mins you have a Female syrian &quot;refugee&quot; identify the &quot;hundreds and hundreds&quot; of perpetrators as north Africans and Arabs (not that we don&#39;t know this already, but since you still deny it or downplay it as &quot;right wing propaganda&quot;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give it a try:</p>

<p>Source 1: Definitely not &quot;lefty&quot;, and the repeat claims made by the BILD. The BILD is pretty much the worst thing Germany has in regards to journalism â€” they print whatever sells the best, seldom having any sources for their claims. It&#39;s pretty much exactly what you could call &quot;LÃ¼genpresse&quot; or &quot;the big evil media paid for by the state/companies/whatever&quot;.</p>

<p>Plus: There&#39;s a lot of criticism regarding the Polizeibericht it&#39;s related to:
<a href="http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/koelner-polizei-die-regeln-der-aussage-14004599.html">http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/debatten/koelner-polizei-die-regeln-der-aussage-14004599.html</a></p>

<p>Source 2: One person identiying hundreds of hundreds of people as such and such is not something that would hold up in court. It&#39;s a shred that might be useful, but it&#39;s nothing more than that, sorry.</p>

<p>Ok, let&#39;s take the new Polizeibericht (police report): I don&#39;t like the Polizei very much, for I have enough experience with them to know that they&#39;re often racist themselves, but a huge, official Polizeibericht is a start:
<a href="http://www.mik.nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Redakteure/Dokumente/Themen_und_Aufgaben/Schutz_und_Sicherheit/160111ssia/160111berichtppkoeln.pdf">http://www.mik.nrw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Redakteure/Dokumente/Themen_und_Aufgaben/Schutz_und_Sicherheit/160111ssia/160111berichtppkoeln.pdf</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s start on page 14: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Die Opfer sprachen auch hier von einer 30 bis 50 kÃ¶pfigen
TÃ¤tergruppe bestehend aus jungen nordafrikanischen MÃ¤nnern</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A group of 30-50 young, north-african men.</p>

<p>Page 21 onwards:  Statistics about pickpocketing in Cologne in the last years: 
Of 210 suspects (<em>suspects</em>) only 8 were German.</p>

<p>The last page also lists data about the (immigrant) suspects of the evening.</p>

<p>So we have a few facts, some of them quite worrying, but none of them pointing towards hundreds/thousands of pillaging and raping immigrants, which are immune to the law.</p>

<p>Plus: A constitutional democracy has the whole &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; thing, which is quite important, as otherwise we could just give up the whole state thing and kill each other whenever we please.
Of course the evidence here points towards things rather obviously (we had a group / several groups of men, many of them seeming to be immigrants), I&#39;m not denying that, but no one is convicted yet, and even if all of the suspects were it would still be a farfetched thing to talk of thousands of immigrants[...] and to say &quot;it&#39;s the evil immigrants/muslims/communists/[insertthingyoudon&#39;tlike], they are all/mostly savage/criminal/...
There are assholes in all countries and all religions. Some groups might attract more assholes than other groups, but that does not allow you to condemn everyone else, especially if you only get a certain picture of events on the &quot;big media outlets&quot; and the internet from afar.</p>

<p>We have one rape (which is very bad), a lot of groping (which is also bad), but that&#39;s not enough to say a whole group of people is inherently evil/savages/..</p>

<p>You know, Germans do evil things as well, all the time â€” it just doesn&#39;t get such a lot of media attention because it&#39;s nothing special. This situation is not really special, too â€” you have drunk and violent groups on every nye. It&#39;s only more of an issue because the whole FlÃ¼chtlingskrise is a hot topic all around.</p>

<p>And when a German does something like groping on the Oktoberfest, the police might not even give a shit, instead it was a crime of the women to defend herself:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Erst Griff unter den Rock, danach Bierkrug auf den Kopf
Der Vorfall ereignete sich am gestrigen Donnerstag, 24.09.2015, gegen 19.20 Uhr, in einem groÃŸen Wiesnzelt. Ein Griff unter den Rock seiner amerikanischen Wiesn-Bekanntschaft endete fÃ¼r einen 20-jÃ¤hrigen Deggendorfer Ã¤uÃŸerst schmerzhaft. </p>

<p>Die â€žRockbesitzerinâ€œ drehte sich mit samt MaÃŸkrug um und das TrinkgefÃ¤ÃŸ landete wuchtig auf den Kopf des 20-JÃ¤hrigen. Die Amerikanerin hatte bei der Drehung so viel Schwung, dass auch noch ein unbeteiligter Dritter einen Schlag auf die Wange abbekam. </p>

<p>NatÃ¼rlich handelt es sich hierbei um eine Straftat der gefÃ¤hrlichen KÃ¶rperverletzung. Nach Zahlung einer vierstelligen Eurosumme konnte die Amerikanerin die Wiesnwache wieder verlassen. </p>

<p>Bei der Amerikanerin handelt es sich um eine 24-jÃ¤hrige Frau, die derzeit im Landkreis Freising wohnt. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only when a group you&#39;re already thinking of as inherently worse does something people start to open their mouths. Before, most people being the loudest right now didn&#39;t give a shit about womens rights, groping was never taken seriously as an issue and rape victims &quot;shouldn&#39;t have dressed so sexy&quot;. Yeah, right.</p>

<p>(Just to make sure you don&#39;t misunderstand: No, I don&#39;t want to say groping is like the rape that happened. There have also been rapes by Germans during Oktoberfests or other celebrations, and those are as bad as any other rape by whomever. This was just about the &quot;western&quot; culture, which is often said to be  oh-so-different to whichever culture is critizised at that time).</p>

<p>You know, I&#39;m writing all this not to force you to accept my leftish-view of the world, but to stop demonizing people/groups/countries from afar without any proper knowledge about them or the situations. You might even be right with everything you think, but you can not claim this with the facts you seem to have about this particular situation.
I&#39;m sorry to say, but you don&#39;t know shit about all this.
I don&#39;t know shit about many, many things too â€” but at least I try to resarch, and sometimes I have to change my view, or even some deeper beliefs to adjust for new knowledge. That&#39;s how it should work, everything else is close-mindedness and, to put it frankly, stupid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This actually started in &#39;99 with the illegal bombing of Serbia. Albanian terrorists known as the KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) entered Kosovo, a Serbian province. Serbian police responded and got involved militarily. Of course, US that was behind KLA manufactured an outrage (civilian massacre) and promptly bombed Serbia back to the stone age. After Germany agreed and actually carried out air raids against Serbia under the pressure of US, they did the same thing in the Middle East. There you go, it&#39;s called karma.  </p>

<p>Today, Kosovo is in shambles and its main export is Albanian terrorists who are now attempting to replicate the same recipe in Macedonia - cause trouble in cities with significant Muslim population in order to provoke the police into brutalizing the population. Then, the almighty protector of human rights, the US, will intervene and grant the <del>terrorists</del> freedom fighters their own piece of land where they can set up training camps and start raiding another country.</p>

<li><p>The implosion of the USD is close. To make an alliance between Russia/Germany impossible/unattractive it&#39;s necessary to weaken Germany and install a wall of alienated nations between them. Fits with the US politics in Eastern Europe(Mostly Ukraine and Poland).</p></li>
<li><p>Influx of foreign mercenaries between these &quot;immigrants&quot; to use as a threat against Germany related to 4. and keep further control over their vassal. If the US aggression against Russia goes really hot they could be the 5th column.</p></li>
<li><p>Weaken the economical power of Germany and also the EU for the benefit of the US&#39;s national economy. Their attack on Volkswagen would fit into that picture.</p></li>
<li><p>The oligarchs/political elite plans to use elements of these immigrants as a private thug force to protect themselves when the economy crashes. Regimes with no backing in their population like to use foreign mercenaries. Hard to believe now but we can&#39;t really imagine/want to think about the social consequences of a system crisis. Most of these immigrants are young males from a violent environment looking for &quot;opportunities&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>The global elite has decided to use islam as their new control mechanism and speeds up the process as their media control gets more and more ineffective.</p></li>
<li><p>Create sympathy for Israel&#39;s &quot;struggle&quot; against the &quot;islamic ideology&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Create a negative climate for the european jews and motivate them to immigrate to Israel for their Great Israel project. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>The national identities of the west european nations have been intentionally eroded by immigration over the last 50 years. That they speed up this process in such an aggressive fashion and cause the host population to wake up requires some really powerful motivation.</p>

<p>Any explanation about needing these immigrants for economical reasons makes no sense to me. If that would be the case they could easily get more people from Spain/Portugal/Greece where enough people are unemployed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The picture at the bottom of this article was the nail in the coffin for me.  I&#39;m a woman and an armature make-up artist.  The first thing I noticed (besides the blood) was that she did not appear to be scratched, bruised, swollen, or otherwise injured.  Then I looked at her eyes - and her perfectly un-smudged eye shadow and mascara.  No tear streaks, no runny makeup, no puffy red eyes.  As a female, I can&#39;t even imagine being brutally raped and beaten and NOT CRYING.  Either this one chick is faking it to get attention, or the whole thing is a sham.  </p>

<p>Your own source says nothing about her being raped.
Its not a great article, but shows how some of you cant even read and jump quickly to conclusions to fit your own narrative. Even if, and thats a big if, some intelligence plot was involved here, it still happened as reported and these people actually attacked women en mass, so if this was the case this doesn&#39;t make them any less guilty. Not to mention the fact that this is happening daily all over Europe on a smaller scale, but they don&#39;t get any media attention. Only this time it was to big to keep a lid on it despite MSM and especially state medias attempts to do so. Politicians and cucks of course don&#39;t stop downplaying and twisting this any way they can conceive of. But this doesn&#39;t change the very well documented facts!</p>

<p>Seriously. My grandfather has been searching for oil (as a geologist) all over the world a few decades ago, and even though he has some definitely-racist-tendencies in his general political views, his stories of people from many middle eastern countries are of warm, kind and welcoming people (well.. mostly. some stories are about some violent tribes you had to be reaaally careful around, but it&#39;s not something that you could apply to whole countries). Things seem to have been fucked up only recently, due to oppressive groups using religion as a justification for their deeds, due to regimes tearing down all the modern achievements and liberties reached in years before, and of course due to wars for oil, opium or whatever which, of course, fuck up countries.</p>

<p>It&#39;s got nothing to do with &quot;the middle easterners&quot;, and their &quot;angry emotions toward the west&quot; might be somewhat.. understandable.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t. There was one case of rape and lots of cases of unruly behavior that involved things like hugging and groping. This is as far as I know from what little I&#39;ve read.</p>

<p>So, I have a sincere and honest question, and I&#39;d appreciate a sincere and honest answer.</p>

<p>There is only one constant in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>: if it makes the news, it&#39;s a false flag. So are TPTB suppressing all real violent events everywhere or are people just not capable of major violent acts? ... or are most of the claims of &quot;false flag&quot; just a kneejerk reaction that&#39;s wrong more often than right?</p>

<p>I&#39;m SO DISSAPOINTED in this sub. You&#39;re all suggesting someone somehow got these upstanding young men to gather and gang rape and assault women against their will? Can one person even explain to me how that would be possible in any capacity?</p>

<p>Yes, technically rape per the Koran is supposedly treated by death, but that&#39;s not the case in places like Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p>In Saudi Arabia, the female usually ends with the same or sometimes worse punishment than the male in a rape because what was she doing alone with a male to get raped to begin with?</p>

<p>So, if Saudi Arabia is like this, which is one of the most restrictive Islamic countries on the planet, imagine Pakistan, or Afghanistan which a lot of these economic migrants are coming from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it should say Satanic ritual child abuse (as it does in the link itself...why change it?), Christianity (catholicism/vatican is the main culprit in my opinion) is only a front for what is carried out.</p>

<p>IMO, I think we should abandon all religious books and just worship God/Allah/Creator/Oneness/universal conciousness, because I have come to believe that every one of those origin stories have been manipulated/purposefully crafted to divide and conquer the human spirit and preventing it/us from reaching higher consciousness.</p>

<p>This is an excerpt from the wikipedia page about astrolatry/astro-theology: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolatry">Wikipedia Astrolatry</a></p>

<p>Manly P Hall (1901â€“1990), mystic and a 33rd degree mason, taught that each of the three Abrahamic faiths has a planet that governs that religion. Judaism is Saturn: the symbol of Judaism is a hexagram symbol of Saturn, and the day of worship is on Saturday, day of Saturn. Christianity is the Sun: the symbol of Christianity is the cross symbol of the Sun, and the day of worship is Sunday, day of the Sun. Islam is Venus: the symbol of Islam is the star and crescent (the star commonly thought to represent Venus), and the day of worship is on Friday.</p>

<p>Dorothy M. Murdock [4] a proponent of the study, has released books on the subject and teaches the connections between the solar allegory and the life of Christ. She also goes beyond the astronomical comparisons and postulates ties between the origins of many of the early Abrahamic religions to ancient mythologies of that in Egypt, Rome, and Greece.</p>

<p>You will probably mentally block this out as a Muslim, because this completely contradicts your current dogma, but please keep it in the back of your head for when you want to learn the real truth about history and &quot;modern&quot; religion and how it is used to play us all against each other.</p>

<p>ONE LOVE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly this.  Ultimately, however, it&#39;s all about dividing and conquering the masses, unfortunately.  Religion in general - whether Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, etc - all tend to be greatly used to, again, divide the masses, pit them (us) against one another, and subsequently conquer us through the discord that&#39;s created.</p>

<p>There is a core inside all religion that is true and real.  It&#39;s just that it gets covered over with so much minutia and confusion that it obscures everything that is real about it.  People get lost in the particulars...</p>
