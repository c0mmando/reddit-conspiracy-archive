    <div class="md"><p>The admins told us we were not to discuss it; probably not a good idea to do so as they could use it as grounds to ban the sub.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u4pg4/with_regards_to_the_admin_removal_of_the_slc_day/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2u4pg4/with_regards_to_the_admin_removal_of_the_slc_day/</a></p>

<p>&quot;As you may be aware, over the past few days some threads have popped up both on <a href="/r/SaltLakeCity">/r/SaltLakeCity</a> and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> regarding a day care center which, according to the research and observations of some users, was perhaps more than a simple child care operation.</p>

<p>While the moderators of this subreddit were happy to allow discussion of the topic to the extent permitted by the site wide terms of service, the admins have informed us that the information and research contained therein amounted to what they considered to be, on the whole, &quot;personal information being used to harass a business.&quot;</p>

<p>While the mod team had removed information we considered to be doxx on multiple occasions within the threads, the decision of the admins regarding the removal of the content in its entirety must be respected on our end.</p>

<p>To that end, after a long discussion between the mods and the admin team, we have been left with no option but to prevent future discussion of the situation involving the day care. </p>

<p>We want to make it clear that, from the perspective of the mod team, the free flow of information is our paramount concern. To that end, this prohibition is quite bothersome and clashes with the ethos of organically curated content that we take pride in fostering on this subreddit. However we also absolutely understand the importance of protecting personal information and the lives of innocent people. Weighing that balance can sometimes be difficult, and in this situation the admins have made the choice for us. We have agreed to the prohibition in order to protect the existence of the subreddit, and we ask that you do as well. </p>

<p>As a quick recap from our end;</p>

<p>Yesterday, a post regarding the daycare center became quite popular on <a href="/r/slc">/r/slc</a> but was removed for witch hunting. At that point, another post was made on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but only received a few hundred upvotes (no witch hunting occurred in that thread).</p>

<p>A recap thread was then post on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> which garnered over a thousand net upvotes. That post was removed by the site wide spam filter at some point yesterday, and the mod team checked in with the admins as to whether or not they had caused the removal. At that point, the admins reviewed the spam filter removal, informed us that they had not removed the submission, and told us that &quot;all looked fine&quot;.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we had assumed that the admins had looked into the situation and determined that an investigation into the day care did not violate the TOS. </p>

<p>Today, another recap post was submitted to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and, after a few hours, was removed by the admins. The mod team was confused at first, as we had been under the impression that the admins had reviewed the day care thread from the previous day and determined the content was not in violation of the TOS. However, we were informed that a mistake was made on the admin&#39;s side and they failed to look into the situation beyond simply examining why the spam filter had tripped on the submission from the previous day.</p>

<p>At this point the only option going forward would be to find a means of facilitating heavily redacted recaps of the day care situation; something that the mod team feels is not feasible.</p>

<p>We want to make it clear that this was a decision on the part of the admins, and we, as moderators, are obligated to follow their directives to protect the subreddit itself from being banned. &quot;</p>

<p>Some person saying they had been inside and seeing a creepy control room with security cameras...</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say that any of it got close to the truth - but it lost steam right around the time it was getting interesting. Could have been one big misunderstanding, but it definitely seemed like a front for something other than an actual daycare.</p>

<p>I would be interested in knowing  more - If any other discussion sites took up the cause etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After reading a post about this Kidz Fun Time &quot;Daycare&quot; I was very interested in finding out more, so I looked at was everyone was posting about it and this seems to actually be kind of big. So yesterday afternoon I went to the daycare and I parked outside in the back. I was there for about 5 or 7 minutes and for the first time in my whole life of going past there every day, a child and his mother came out. So I walked up to the door she came out of and I knocked a good 5 times, then waited and knocked again. After a minute I was going to leave but a Mexican guy with a thick accent opens the door just a crack ( maybe 6 inches ) to peek out. He waited a minute to say something and then he said &quot;hello? What&#39;s the problem&quot; (that seemed weird to me but that&#39;s not even weird to what happened next) it took me a minute because I was looking past his shoulder and the inside of the building was very dark on the inside. Definitely not a daycare feeling vibe. I answered him and said &quot;Yes, I am looking to enroll my child in this daycare&quot; and immediately he hoped the door and grabbed my shoulder and said &quot;you need to get off the property! You need to leave!&quot; And he escorted me off! So I went back to the car and he kept looking out the windows to see if I was gone. This is definitely not a daycare.</p>
