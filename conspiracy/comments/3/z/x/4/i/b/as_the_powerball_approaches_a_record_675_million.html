    <div class="md"><p>It is entirely possible that this event isn&#39;t truly &quot;live&quot;.  Video delay loops exist just for the reason of adding graphics and making it appear that they are live.</p>

<p>This type of delay is also used, for example, to edit out swearing when someone calls into a radio talk show. It&#39;s &quot;live&quot; but not really. They have anywhere from 1 second to 2 minutes or more, to edit out the problem before it goes out over the air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you&#39;d have to ask why there would exist a need for that, and why they would insist on pretending it&#39;s live? </p>

<p>The whole reason it&#39;s supposed to be live, is to make sure it&#39;s honest. If they&#39;re just gonna get on TV and tell you what the numbers were, people wouldn&#39;t trust that system. Further, if it isn&#39;t live, you could repeatedly film the balls coming out until you got the ones you wanted to come out. </p>

<p>It reads as follows: Lotteries are multi-billion dollar gambling racket run by the government, giving the illusion of winnability by having a few schmucks win and then <strong><em>not</em></strong> get their winnings because of <em>&quot;problems&quot;</em> with the lottery (problem was they weren&#39;t supposed to win).  This is after airing the winning numbers live before the ball is drawn, yet you still continue to buy tickets because you&#39;re dumb and will remain so, as long as you&#39;re buying lottery tickets instead of saving up money for yourself for college.</p>

The fact that only the government is allowed to run these gambling practices is what is the red flag in the argument of lotteries as a poor tax and &#39;prole&#39; activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a person who has profited long term from stocks, poker, and various other money related endeavors I assure you every person downvoting me is a broke ass.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about $2 it&#39;s about the exploitable and flawed thinking it requires to buy a lottery ticket (and denial to the point of trying to rationalize it). This is like the entire nation playing a slot machine simultaneously (actually the odds are much worse).</p>

<p>It&#39;s like smoking a cigarette, you&#39;ll just have one. Yeah okay buddy. Funny they sell those two things at the same store. A store can literally be shit at selling everything else and get by on lottery and tobacco, why?</p>

<p>A lottery ticket, I&#39;ll just play one. It&#39;s not about THIS lottery ticket, its about EVERY lottery ticket you buy in your entire life. You are showing the tendency that you can be EXPLOITED FOR YOUR MONEY for a COMPLETE FANTASY. An astronomical chance you could win wealth you probably wouldn&#39;t actually even want if you acquired it.</p>

<p>What happens if the jackpot doesn&#39;t go? Let me guess.... YOU BUY ANOTHER ONE?</p>

<p>WHERE DID THE JACKPOT COME FROM TO BEGIN WITH? Do you realize your community could pool their money into something actually worthwhile that would benefit you, your family, and everyone else around you? Instead you let them TAX YOU, taking a huge percentage of the proceeds, putting it into their own pockets, helping their corporations and lawyers. Why is it illegal for you to run your own lottery?</p>

<p>At the end of the day it&#39;s a fantasy. You could much more wisely invest your $2 in something that actually has a chance of benefiting you in some way. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> shouldn&#39;t be about FANTASY, it should be about LOGIC and TRUTH.</p>

<p>No wealthy minded person has ever purchased a lottery ticket, they are for pathetic fools who don&#39;t understand money, mathematics, or evident logic.</p>

<p>Often people who win the lottery end up being poor in the end once again, because people who play the lottery to begin with have absolutely no idea what they are doing with their equity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it&#39;s not their &quot;money.&quot; That&#39;s now how money works, which is why it can be seized by the government. You don&#39;t &quot;own&quot; money. It belongs to your government. Also paper fiat used to buy lottery tickets is currency and not &quot;money,&quot; but we won&#39;t dig that deep.</p>

<p>When they win the lottery it isn&#39;t their &quot;money&quot; either, as most lotteries pay small sums over time and not the large sum advertised.</p>

<p>You also lose about 40% of your winnings to capital gains tax.</p>

<p>There is nothing tangible about this fantasy.</p>

<p>People have got to stop saying it&#39;s only $2 when the vast majority of people who buy lottery tickets blow their equity every month on lots of things equally as useless (and normally buy multiple lottery tickets). Also I&#39;ve worked in a casino and have training in responsible gambling and understand the tendencies in human nature exploited by marketing departments of those organizations.</p>

<p>The same people who think like this lease cars instead of buying them, rent instead of owning a house, never buy in bulk and probably think they are saving money by being cheap, none of the above of which are a good idea in the slightest for your bottom line long term.</p>

<p>The reason the jackpot is so big, is because a bunch of idiots who all think the same put their money in a pool that was being raked for profit by a giant corporation, only to then divvy out a small portion of the proceeds back to the aforementioned idiots who put the money in.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t about the $2 LOTTERY TICKET. It&#39;s about people&#39;s broken minds when it comes to their own value.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll bet I&#39;ve &quot;lost more money playing poker.&quot; Well you lose the bet, because you are using logical fallacies to try and win this argument. I technically lose money at poker every day, or I technically have never lost depending on how you look at it.</p>

<p>If I am up over 6 figures lifetime playing poker how much have I lost? Do you know how I got it? (Exploiting people $2 at a time). I&#39;ve played around 4 million hands, thanks for the cash.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just two dollars (multiplied by every time every person ever says something that stupid)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if that were true I&#39;d have to consider these things:</p>

<p>1) you might be lying and have provided 0 evidence, and I also have to presume that you only bought 1 ticket and additionally were fortunate enough to be a part of a statistical anomaly (not your fault people lie about their gambling problems/addictions all the time)</p>

<p>2) your initial goal was not to win $100, but $630+ million. I would actually consider this an enormous failure, if your actual goal was to win the jackpot. If your goal was to &quot;make your money back&quot; or turn a &quot;small&quot; profit, then congratulations on your &quot;success.&quot; Think you can do it again? </p>

<p>3) this is how you will rationalize buying more tickets in the future</p>

<p>4) much like i said it wouldn&#39;t, the jackpot did not go and society was raked another 400 million in the process. </p>

<p>5) do you think it will go the next time? will you be buying another ticket with your &quot;profit&quot;? </p>

<p>It&#39;s just $2! And 2 more...and $2 more....and $2 more....</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen printouts of people buying $20-$50-$100s worth of tickets at a time from last night&#39;s drawing alone. Tell the truth did you just buy one? This time? Last time? Or were you already down $100 in your lifetime buying lottery tickets at this point? </p>

<p>These are mostly rhetorical questions just to provoke thought, but if you feel they are not too personal to answer I&#39;d love to hear your response.</p>

<p>Even though we obviously disagree, I want to understand the thought processes behind people who DO play. </p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with society is the widening gap of economic leverage, yet people celebrate things that create that gap like foolish peasants, to be completely honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have probably been sitting around salivating at the thought of coming back to this thread to be a cunt. I don&#39;t have a problem with the way the Internet functions. I have a problem with the way YOU function. You could have just <strong>let it go</strong> but your obsession brought you back. </p>

<p>My entire point has been that people can spend their money however they please and it is none of your business because it isn&#39;t your money. If they want to buy a 2 dollar lottery ticket, they can. That 2 bucks isn&#39;t EVER going to change their life. Shit, if they want to blow their whole paycheck on lotto tickets they can and that is still none of your business. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t tell you to stop gambling your money on poker do I? No, because it&#39;s none of my business what you do with your money. But I also don&#39;t run around on some high horse going &quot;Playing poker is for idiots&quot; because how people entertain themselves is, again, none of my business.</p>

<p>The lottery is a form of entertainment, no different than going to a movie, a concert, or an amusement park. <em>Except</em> that it has a microscopic chance of changing your financial future. Not a single person walked into the theater to see Star Wars over the past month with any chance of taking home the final box office tally. Yeah, if I choose to buy another ticket with my money for Wednesday&#39;s drawing, I have a microscopic chance of becoming a billionaire on that day, but it&#39;s a better chance than you have. But it&#39;s an entertaining chance to have. Nothing more. I&#39;m not relying on it for my future. I have an investment portfolio for that.</p>

<p>And for the record, I have spent maybe a total of 75 bucks on lottery tickets (picks and scratch offs combined) in the last 15 years and have won more than I have spent. Not exactly life changing money spent (or made). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand.  The vast majority of people that play the lotto spend an insignificant amount of their income to play, fully knowing they will not win.  It provides very cheap entertainment in the form of thinking about what you could do with the winnings and the small bit of adrenaline when the numbers are called.  This has nothing to do with depending on winning for financial salvation.  I spend my working hours using logic to make rational decisions constantly to make a living.  It&#39;s fun for me to just say &quot;fuck it, let&#39;s play pretend what I would do with $400M for the cost of a whopping total of $2.&quot; If you can&#39;t understand that then you really have no idea how most normal people think.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shows the power of the lottery. I take solace in the fact that every single one of them will lose and most of them will buy a ticket on the next jackpot, if/when this one does not go.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as if they don&#39;t understand the reason the jackpot is this big to begin with is because people who play the lottery have lost that much money (and the corporation&#39;s profit) chasing a prize even smaller than this one.</p>

<p>Nobody answered any of my hard questions, like where did the money come from to begin with? Probably because the answer is their own pockets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google &quot;micro lending&quot; and start there.</p>

<p>Invest it in litecoin and trade on a crypto trading site.</p>

<p>Invest $2 in an online poker account and learn to play by reading free books on the internet.</p>

<p>Lend $2 to a friend and ask them to pay you back $2.50 (technically illegal but if you keep it small at work by the pop machine you&#39;re earning 25% ROI)</p>

<p>Most importantly, change a way of thought out of hemorrhaging equity for no reason because you can &quot;afford to.&quot; It&#39;s a costly way of thought that adds up quickly. The average person makes over 100 economic decisions per day, nobody has a reason to be poor they are just uneducated about money and unwilling to accept that.</p>

<p>They have plenty of fallacy&#39;s that include &quot;it&#39;s not that big of a deal&quot; drilled into their forehead because they saw other broke people do it.</p>

<p>Also get the idea out of your head that you only need the $2 to invest. It could be $2 MORE dollars. People say well it&#39;s $2 I have a chance. Okay, but for $20 I am 10x more likely to win than you are. So if we run this lottery over and over in a vacuum the odds of you winning before me are a mere 10%</p>

<p>What people fail to realize is they are winning their own money back. Where did the giant jackpot pool of money come from? All of the idiots that think this way lost it to the lotto corporation, who is now giving them a small percentage of their idiocy back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I actually ended up on a job for some winners once, it was the saddest thing ever. I was an electrician and when they won they decided to blow it making their house super nice. And super big. And they had a bunch of relatives come begging so they built little guest houses for them, too. And they had plenty of money, so it wasn&#39;t a big deal, but it kept us busy as they added rooms, and buildings, to the property. They had an arcade full of machines they never played, a lot of rooms they never even went into. Honestly most days we didn&#39;t see them out of bed till after 11, and it&#39;s not like they did anything. They were certainly extremely comfortable, but from the outside they appeared deeply depressed, just totally bored and stressed at the same time. They could feel themselves wasting money, and they just laid in bed and let it happen.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a promised carrot that offers a ray of hope in the darkness from which there is no other apparent escape. So, of course, the poor subscribe, by every meaning of the word, to the promise of salvation by regularly tithing a portion of their income. The fact that that <del>tithe</del> <del>tax</del> consumer decision actually directly contributes to that darkness is beside the point because it was made entirely of their own free will (which we shamelessly manipulated in order to direct your choices to our own benefit).</p>
