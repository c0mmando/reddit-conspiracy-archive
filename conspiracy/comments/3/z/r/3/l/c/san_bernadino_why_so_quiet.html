        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe I&#39;ve missed it somewhere along the line, but it seems so strange to me that no witnesses from within the actual room where the shooting took place have come out and described what they experienced.</p>

<p>My understanding is that there were at least 60-80 people attending a holiday party, and while many were killed or seriously injured, the majority of people who were in the actual room survived. Yet, I can&#39;t seem to recall hearing an eyewitness account from any of them.</p>

<p>It seems like the media has typically been all over these types of stories in the past - you know, 60 Minutes or 20/20 doing one of those hour long sit-downs with like 20 survivors at a time to describe what they saw, or how they personally survived.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;ve missed it, if so, link me. Otherwise, this seems so strange to me. Weird. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it is a FF, But I have been wondering about the craft angle. Why if it was them would they wear their own &quot;uniforms&quot; to perform this. Are they really that bad at their job, or is it more misdirection by another group? I do not have the answer but it has been a head scratchier for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah completely agree. I&#39;m a little on the fringe in actually believing FF. I find when these things happen you don&#39;t even consider FF until YouTube and the internet have a feast on the inconsistencies after the fact. I do however remember feeling uneasy about the facts from SB, even when it was happening, the relatives going on NBC, the child of theirs?? Most people would die for their child, not leave their child alone.. Quran would not approve, if this was a jihad mission leaving the child alone would cancel it out..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the FBI still has the witnesses on verbal lockdown</p>

<p>But if the media &amp; govt &amp; officials would just release more raw footage and access on these stories, they all would seem much more believable and relatable - they are so sanitized for our protection nowadays, that its easy to see why ppl think they are fake</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shooting after shooting, I think American audiences have lost interest in seeing a 20/20 special about these kinds of things. They aren&#39;t &#39;special&#39; anymore - they&#39;re commonplace. Whether real or false flag/staged...doesn&#39;t matter for my point. This stuff doesn&#39;t sell anymore. It&#39;s sadly the norm.</p>

<p>So that means one of two things. One - If many of these shootings are real, then they will continue for a bit and then die down because it doesn&#39;t get the shooters the fame they want anymore. Or the second thing - if they&#39;re false flag events and they&#39;re losing their social impact, then the intensity of them will be notched up by those staging them.</p>
