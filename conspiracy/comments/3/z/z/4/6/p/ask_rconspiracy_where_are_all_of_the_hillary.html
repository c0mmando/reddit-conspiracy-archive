       Conspiracy, regardless of who you support politically, do you think the hype on Hillary Clinton is fabricated? I understand her corrupted super PACS financially support her but I have not talked to a single person who is pro-Hillary. We see tremendous support for Bernie Sander's all over the Internet, Americans giving small donations in massive numbers and huge crowds at events. Even the hard core republicans I talk to respect Bernie as a candidate even though they don't plan to vote for him. I don't want this to be a "pro-Bernie" circle jerk, but I'm genuinely curious as to how Hillary is still dominating the polls when it doesn't seem like any normal American plans to vote for her. This is the first presidential election I've been really involved in and it just doesn't make any sense.

       Absolutely fabricated. Because they (TPTB) select the president. Our voices/votes do not matter in the current system. That cunt should be in jail. Anyone supporting that bitch, is either ignorant as fuck or paid. But then again, that could be said about just any other politician.

       Except every other politician hasn't spent a lifetime being corrupt openly in the public eye. Not on her level, anyway. It amazes me she's yet to do a perp walk. But then again, she was in consideration to be head of WORLD BANK at one point. And you don't get that far in life without being a little untouchable.

       Also, I do believe the system is rigged but is it so rigged that if people ACTUALLY went out to vote, it wouldn't change anything? I'm asking as a genuine question.

       Yes, wouldn't change a damn thing. We have a deep state. The NSA (Think KGB, Stasi) has dirt on all these dirty fucks. They will be blackmailed, black balled, and coerced into TPTB's bidding. If you shake the boat too much, look at JFK. Mind you, he came from the elite families of yesterdays. You don't fuck with the deep state.

       While I agree and think it should be kept fairly brief, that doesn't mean things can't have more than one definition (a meta-take on
       <em>
        doublespeak
       </em>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, TPTB could be described different ways depending on where someone is on the rabbit hole journey that inevitably starts in forums like this. It could be defined as jewish banking conspiracy, insert some Rothschild and Rockerfeller stuff, and you're not particularly wrong, but it is clouded with an edge of the whole jewish conspiracy stuff that floods this place (and places like it)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it could just be described as the
       <em>
        shadow government
       </em>
       , which multiple high level political elites have admitted to, who meet in secret, and use the Bilderburg and Bohemian Grove and Freemason stuff into it - and you wouldn't be half wrong, either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Describing the same situation (our reality) multiple ways has been a very effective tool in training oneself to see things and consider things
       <em>
        may not be what they seem
       </em>
       , increasing awareness and hopefully, eventually, pushing things in an better direction.

       That is what people just don't seem to get. They think they can actually make a difference with their vote. And true, the person in power might be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       But their actions regarding policies that actually matter won't differ a bit. It's mice voting for one cat to eat them over another.

       There's just too much money in it. We will get the person that can sell the most for existing industries. Those industries are there to fulfill demand and others are there to install demand.

      <p>
       And the potential upside of challenging the existing demand system is a magic bullet that the public will swallow.

       exit polls and predictive polls are for the first time in american history, since 2000, totally wrong and consistently need to be shifted republican by 10 or so points

      <p>
       the fact the republican party exists at all is the result of the most sophisticated and huge fraud in history.

       Similarly I think Trump's support is largely fabricated as well, to the same ends. When the alternative is that jack-ass, Hillary (also horrible) is a shoe-in.

       Trumps support is fabricated, how so? If anything, his "support" is not representative of his actual fan base. Remember, the MSM and establishment do not want Trump, so why would they artificially inflate his poll numbers? If anything, IMO, his poll numbers are actually lower than where they really are

       Because he's an unelectable jackass. What better person to be a sure bet to lose to Hillary than this idiot who never stops putting his foot in his mouth?

       Right, but do you vote for the idiot who keeps putting his foot in his mouth or the polished criminal? And actually, its funny how people are starting to comment that perhaps trump was right about the Muslim Ban. Look at how Merkel is being viewed right now after all these sexual harassment claims... hell Slovakia just banned muslims from entering,  Japan will not accept refugees, etc. And as long as Clinton keeps messing around (like having Bill run next to her, some say that he is a liability) and with more emails being leaked, her past criminal activity being questioned, etc. who knows how people will view her vs. this baffoon&gt; establishment do not want Trump, so why would

       I'd assume it would be somewhat of a rational ban... No refugees, no Muslims from countries with extremist ties, etc. etc. mostly a temporary ban until we can vet those wanting to get in. I'm not for banning those based on a religion, but I'm more for protecting the security of this country first and foremost. With what has happened to Europe, I can understand a temporary ban

       I think they recognize that she has a slim chance though, that's why Donald with all of this 'extreme' rhetoric is going to be her opposing runner.

       Donald has run in the past and always drops out after a few weeks or months, why is he staying in so long this time?

       I think they were going to bank on Hillary being a woman to get her the election but her history and the whole Benghazi/email thing is just too toxic for her to win straight up on her gender like Obama did on his ethnic background.

       I like to refer to Tony Abbott as a bug's cunt, and it fits Hillary as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       A cunt is nice and warm and inviting. Even the ugliest cunt deserves a second look, because it's a cunt and cunts are good. Except for the ones with teeth, and even then... all hail the cunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think 'bug's cunt' fully expresses the desired nuance of the insult in a way that 'cunt' alone simply cannot. A bug is a non-descript, lowdown, dirty, diseased, disgusting creature and it follows that such vile abominations, deserving nothing more than the bootheel, must be birthed from some equally gross, and inconsequential, ichor-slimed hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bug's cunt is the perfect term.

       I feel this too. I know her machine is huge and the obvious name recognition, but from what I can gather from being online there is not as much grassroots support as you obviously see for a candidate as Sanders, hell, even Trump compared to Hillary has much more obvious support from individuals.

       I can empathize with him though. Back in 2008 I thought Ron Paul would win by a landslide. It was just so obvious to me that he was the perfect candidate and everyone (in my mind) knew it. Even today it's shocking to think how people didn't vote for him. So this is kinda the same for Sanders supporters not getting outside their own echo chamber.

       He was cheated every step of the way (similar to sanders). If he was given a fair shot then he would have won, but close to the primary a lot of people had the impression that he wasn't even running anymore (similar to where public opinion for sanders is heading right now).

       I don't think so. I think we have to realize that there is something wrong with people. Just talk to a Sanders supporter about Ron Paul and you'll see that many of them wouldn't have supported Paul either. This idea of Sanders fighting against the big corporations is just an angle to set him apart from the rest, but his agenda is really just the same as all the rest. He's for big government.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J4TLIPB1uc">
        Even Ron Paul talked about Sanders and said that while many times they agreed about corruption and cronyism, Sanders was still pro-war and had a foreign policy like all the rest.

       I am not (by a long shot) a sanders supporter. If it were
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       him vs. hillary, then it would be the clear choice, but it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was so much support for ron paul, and it was real support, for a real platform. If you looked at any straw poll he did very well. Also, if you saw a bumper sticker (still to this day) it probably said "ron paul" and if there was a group of people on the corner with signs it was probably "ron paul".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the iowa one he had a huge amount of people there, and the winning candidate bussed people in to see a free country music show that was closed off to the rest of the attendees. even after all of that it took the "men behind the curtain" 6 hours to count electronic votes...
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads me to the last point. The parties and primaries are 100% private (not government) and can do whatever they want. If they want to have sham primaries and select the candidate by lying about the outcome, it might trigger a scandal, but it is not breaking any laws.

       I think it would be as easy as having instant runoff in the primary. But with how much our rulers guard their power it would take a revolution to get it.

       The conspiracy aspect to this (hence the subreddit we're in) is that the mainstream media and polling numbers are manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you're in a movement, you see a lot of peple that agree with you. Hence when I was in the Ron Paul movement, I saw a lot of support for him. In the same way Sanders people see a lot of support for him just the same. It's all confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that there is no conspiracy against Sanders. the media isn't against him and there is no nefarious plot by the banks to alter the elections.

      <p>
       Sanders supporters have reason to believe Sanders can win, Paul supporters did not.

       No offense or anything, but that's really really huge.

       If we're talking old people, you give them too much credit with a 20% rejection rate of the two appointed leaders. Also: old people watch Fox News, so that split should be more equal. Like 48/48/4

       on why you're not credible. That's an Ad Hominem attack, saying that you don't do something because only an idiot would, or in this case because it's '100% a production and a lie'.
      </p>

       Seriously, if someone said they don't wash their hands because 'Bacteria is 100% production and a lie. Just because some actress on TV says Bacteria causes diseases doesn't mean that it's true'.
 You would also discredit them.

       I used to feel this way as well. After doing more research though, I think I'd vote Trump if he was running against Hillary.

       It has taken me A LOT to admit that.

       But at least he'd bring some sort of transparency to the USA. At that point is rather see us fail 100% and rebuild then deal with the corporate puppet master HRC.

       When mainstream media and establishment politicians and corporate executives are calling Trump a nazi, and trying to get him banned from entering countries, and basically going into meltdown, then you know he's the right choice.

       We have no guarantee he won't betray the people and business carries on as usual, but with the hysterics coming from the elite about him, it seems they have no guarantee that he will.

       You think opposition politicians aren't from the establishement? Hah, okay. And what on earth are you going on about "former Scottish minister"? I think more than a quick skim of the first internet article you find should be in order. I know you're in a rabid haste to try to discredit me, but you can do better than that.

       That's why I made sure to include that

       I could also point out that the Prime Minister himself disagrees with Tulip Siddiq on the Trump issue. And you don't get more "establishment" than David Cameron

       You need to look at the whole picture. Yes, some people are in favour of a ban, but

       Ugh. Don't do that. Your own posts ignore the party leaders who disagree and only mentions the outliers who want to ban him. That's extremely selective and a wider reading shows that your original point is, not to put too fine a point on it, bullshit.

       Well now you're just changing the goalposts. Being negative about somebody is not the same as calling for a ban. Duh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are we to assume that the only reason they don't want to ban him is because they'll look stupid? Why can't it be possible that a lot of people dislike Trump but don't agree with the idea of banning him from their country?

       I never claimed you did. I'm saying the wider picture doesn't support your initial claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example -
      </p>
      <p>
       When one opposition MP is in favour of a ban, and the leader of the country is not, is it not misleading to say that "establishment politicians" are in favour of a ban?
      </p>
      <p>
       You might be technically correct (depending on your definition of establishment) in that more than one elected politician favours a ban, but the general picture disagrees. Do you see what I mean?

      <p>
       Tantrum? Ok whatever.

      <p>
       If you want to know why I'm downvoting you, it's better to ask rather than make stuff up. For the record I think your argument is ludicrous and getting worse, the fact that you're now inventing my motives and ignoring most of what I'm saying is telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or not. Maybe you're right but unable to communicate why.

       Yeah, if you take it by itself. Taken with the comment I was replying to I think a fair reading is that the "nobody" applies to your claim of "establishment politicians". Perhaps the fact that it took you this long to get around to it might indicate that it's a fair comment in context.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can read it whatever way you like, I probably could have phrased it better.

       I still think your initial claim is bogus on the merits. To go back to my last post, that you completely ignored in order to spout insulting gibberish:

       This is  not complex in the slightest. Any 10 year old child has a grasp of elementary logic. So it can't be stupidity. The only people who twist words, use double-speak, exaggeration and hyperbole and hysterics to try to win an obviously illogical point, are those with an agenda that does not include the truth.

       Again, I never claimed any particular proportion of politicians. What gave you that idea? What I did is say there is (indirect) evidence to suggest that Trump is not an "establishment candidate".

       I've already addressed this - I said it could be technically correct but it depends on your definition of "establishment". And also depends on the big picture. Regarding which, I'll repost (again) my question, and an answer would be nice.

       Why? Trump's a fine candidate &amp; the best you're gonna get against this witch. Bernie, while he has a vocal support &amp; all, just doesn't have the numbers &amp; backing. The Dems have pretty much protected Hillary from one scandal after another &amp; she's their "chosen one", so she's a lock.

       The best you can hope for is a person going against her like Trump because he'll go for the throat. Bernie supporters &amp; Trump supporters actually have a lot in common, whether they realize it (or admit it).

       Good god, that line again. You know he's not always been a politician, right? He's given money to tons of other candidates over the years on both sides. Which tends to, you know, be the norm for people who own high profile multi billion dollar companies. As if Bernie isn't taking money from the Unions to run his campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you've probably got it in your head that all politicians are, or should be, some noble creatures, but that's just not how it works. Its always the lesser of evils. Hillary is obviously the fucking devil in a pants suit, that we all know. Bernie can't win the Dem nomination (any moron that's followed politics for more than a single election cycle understands how &amp; why that is).
      </p>
      <p>
       So put your big boy pants on, vote Trump if you wanna beat Hillary, or stay home &amp; sulk. The end.

       Lol, if you think Trump is our savior, then you are literally what's wrong with this country. Has it never occurred to you that the only reason he is running is to ensure book sales and to get Clinton elected? Why else would he continue to make the Republicans look more and more insane with each passing week. He has no plan other than to keep things exactly the way they are. If you like fascism, I guess you would find him attractive. Sorry, I'm not a bigot.

       So progressive. Is this still part of the all inclusive &amp; tolerant "open dialog" you hive-minders like to promote? We've moved onto the final leg of arguing with a lefty: When all else fails &amp; you're challenged, insult &amp; shame. It's comical really, and totally typical.

       I honestly think this country is fucked and no matter who we elect we are equally as fucked. You are right about one thing. We need Trump. We need him to finish this country fast. As much as I know we deserve it, I don't have the patience for a drawn out collapse that the other candidates are providing. I'm not a kid, I'm probably older than you are.

       Well I am one demo that will not vote for her. If Sanders doesn't make it past the primaries, I will abstain from voting. Quite frankly I don't think Trump could fuck it up any worse than Hillary could maintain our military industrial complex status quo. I know quite a few folks who share my opinion.

       I blame that line of thinking for the 2 party predicament we're in.  You will always vote a democratic ticket because you are told to be afraid of the republicans and the "risk" is too great NOT to vote for Hillary.

       Umm. Yes I am again of Republicans gaining more control.  I do NOT share any ideals with them or support any of their current policies. I'm happy to support either BECAUSE I personally like both candidates. I'm not going to fight about why though, but I'm happy to support.

       If you want more of the same:  destruction of the middle east (sponsored CIA coups and maybe she'll even bomb syria and iran), erosion of civil liberties with secret courts and mass surveillance, secret trade deals written by multinational conglomerates, race baiting/gender baiting, support for criminal states like israel, privatized education (Common Core/ ECAA), continued war on drugs.  She has no interest in breaking up big banks for prosecuting white collar criminals.  She has no interest in peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is a global weapons and energy dealer and everything that comes out of her mouth is rhetoric and her trying to appeal to the middle class which she shares nothing in common with.  How is she any different than Rubio?  Because she is antigun and pro-choice?  Because she wants more taxes rather than less?  Where are those taxes going?  Because she is pro-immigration?  These causes are superficial.  It's the same game.  Public private partnerships for everything and never ending war on the poor and countries with dark people.

       Can you explain the ABC point? I get the NBC/GE point, but my impression was that Disney bought each of those companies (tho maybe ABC already owned ESPN), and they're all in the same general "field" of TV/movies/entrainment.

       Blacks, Bill Clinton welfare kids &amp; voters, ABC/CNN/CNBC (basically non-Fox News Channel) viewers would be most likely to vote HRC, oh and feminists. But a few have seen the truth about her pro-woman views and policies and switched to Bernie.

       If only more feminists and women saw what a phony HRC is, they wouldn't donate/support/vote.

       I'm black and I do watch the left wing trifecta from time to time, I would never vote for HRC. This is anecdotal, but I don't know any other similar people that would either. You are right about women voting for her blindly though. I know quite a few that straight up refuse to hear anything negative about her.

       I'm a full-time working, married mother of one. I pay my dues in the work force and breastfed my son for an entire year. I also could have never done this without the support of my husband. We are a team so the whole "feminist" movement annoys the shit out of me. I understand why it's a thing and why woman should be equal compared to men in life and the work force, but I don't see why it's necessary to hate or belittle men to make this happen. My husband also works full time but he works opposite shifts so he's actually home with our son more. He's a stay at home dad 4 days a week while I work, then works 36-40 hours in 3 days. Families are different than they used to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, To get back from the tangent I just went off on, if a woman votes for HRC because she has a Vagina, than that woman does NOT understand what the fuck she is doing or voting for. If a feminist really wanted to vote on a candidate who cared about equal rights, they'd vote for Bernie Sander's.

       Feminism isn't about hating or belittling men. It's not a zero sum movement. Fundamentally it's about ensuring women have an equal number of (respected) choices as men... and that includes your dynamic of being a stay at home mom. Feminists respect and value the deal between you and your husband, just as much as they value a woman's ability to succeed in traditionally male dominated fields. Most (barring a handful of radical feminists) understand the importance of working with men to make equality happen. Most feminists also recognize that men have a set of their own difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm always disturbed when feminism gets the label as an angry movement set to undermine men. I see this misinterpretation as another way of trying to divide the people through our differences. It's the whole "united we stand, divided we fall,"-type thing.

       Agree. Kudos on 12 mths BF. I just cringe for the future of humanity when selfish people think it's too hard after a few days and then whinged about having to carry and make formula everywhere. I just wish sterilisation by mental vote was a thing. Off topic.

       Yes, have heard of a few Bush Republican women that are considering HRC "because it's be great to let a women have a go at it", though I can see the sentiment and appeal, I just think there isn't really a worse women to have. Bill's StateSec (the short chubby white haired Jewish looking lady, forget her name right now, said it was reasonable to have 500k Iraqi kids die on sanctions) might be better or worse, given she's 80 I can't make up my mind either way. Reagan was old and people loved that.

       Everyone I've met on the last few months supports Trump. I think younger people hate him. Old people like him. I don't think mainstream people are aware of anyone outside the top four candidates, and on the Republican side, maybe Trump has name recognition alone.

       Nope. I'm not confident in any candidate. I'm simply pointing out that you are making a fallacious statement. If I had to place money on it, it would be for Hillary. As scary as that is for me, she has the support of the banking cartels. Its like betting against your home team because you know the other team paid the refs off.

       It's not fallacious to have the opinion that the GOP has alienated themselves out of presidential politics. Dog and pony show all they want, but when it comes down to it they just don't have the votes anymore. Probably won't for a generation.

       You sound like you are basing your opinions off of the three people you have daily contact with. There are millions of voters with different opinions than you. Only an idiot would make the claim that he knows what the entire populations opinion is. Especially when the claim is that the entire nation shares his opinion. So if you prefer me not to use the term fallacious, I will gladly change it to idiotic.

       Both Trump and Hillary have fabricated popularity. The media controls our perceptions of who is popular, and that influences who people vote for. As long as Trump and Hillary are the top 2, then it's guaranteed that Hillary will win.

        Trump and Hillary are old friends though, so I wouldn't at all be surprised if he is helping her win by making Republicans look bad

       I lived in Maryland my whole life. O Malley was the worst, everyone hated him by the end. Maryland is a blue state and very liberal but after O Malley taxed everyone out their asses, (he even started a rain tax) the state elected a republican governor. He's a snake, and so many rumors about him getting women pregnant and then disappearing. Don't let him fool you, he's awful.

       There is a tunnel in baltimore that you basically have to go through to get downtown from the suburbs. So most people commuting to work go through it. During his tenure, the price one-way went from $1 to $4. So it cost $8 a day just to go to work, besides gas and parking(there is no free parking in the city). He made it really hard to live. He also raised the tolls on he bay bridge, made a new highway that cost money to drive on. It started getting ridiculous.

       More advertisement in an area should be a sign of lower support. It would be nearly pointless to heavily advertise an area that already strongly supports a candidate. The only benefit would be to try to convert stragglers.

       Politicians, but Republicans particularly, suffer from chicken little syndrome. The sky is falling nightly on Fox News, that makes it difficult to criticize.

       I prefer Sanders but would take Trump over Hillary for sure. I saw how they marginalized Kucinich in 08 and Ron Paul in 12. I'm glad Sanders and Trump are fairing better so far.

       I really don't know, but I'm not going to vote for Trump unless Bernie isn't an option. I know Senator Sanders is concerned with campaign financing, so I'm sure he could understand at least one of my reasons for preferring Trump to Hillary.

       I'm not 100% sure Bernie would be 100% behind Clinton, but his circumstances sort of demand that he at least act that way in public.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, he is an independent running as a democrat. He's probably wise to avoid attacking a popular figure in the party when he really isn't a part of the party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, he wants to keep to the issues. Attacking Clinton is almost necessarily personal as her political experience, in her own right, is limited. The Clintons are experts at playing the victim when their personality flaws are exposed. Therefore, his game plan is to say "Hillary is just great and would be a great democratic nominee, but let me explain to you why she would suck at regulating wall street."

       Polls can be carefully worded to produce the desired result. It depends on who is funding the poll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream media polls generally want to produce closer results as it generates more drama (more viewers). Plus with close results, public is more compliant about accepting whichever way it ultimately turns out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their vested interest lies not in an informed public but the number of eyes on the TV, advertising revenue, and editorial directives from their superiors.

       The situation with Hillary today reminds me of the lethargy on the Left when Gore ran against Bush in 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, people say things like "I'm not excited about it, but I guess I'll
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to vote for her if she wins the primary." It's exactly what I remember people saying about Gore, what
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       remember saying about Gore. It's why I ended up voting for Nader, because at the end of the day I just couldn't tell the difference between Bush and Gore, I just felt like it really didn't matter who won the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Obama, I'm more certain that my gut was right, and that by voting for Nader and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       supporting the
       <del>
        Two
       </del>
       Party System, I did what was right for both myself and my country.

      <p>
       I agree. I voted for Nader as well. The two party system produces a psuedo-choice. Bill Clinton's political mentor Prof. Carroll Quigley in his book, "Tragedy and Hope" put it best;
      </p>
      <p>
       "The chief problem of American political life for a long time has been how to make the two Congressional parties more national and international. The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can “throw the rascals out” at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy … [E]ither party in office becomes in time corrupt, tired, unenterprising, and vigorless. Then it should be possible to replace it, every four years if necessary, by the other party, which will be none of those things but will still pursue, with new vigor, approximately the same basic policies."

       Most Hillary supporters are fat, white, boomer women who dont use the internet and will vote for Hillary because she has a vagina.
Another group are the people who bought into the whole "she is invertible" narrative and see bernie as some sort of ralph nader.

       I don't mean to be a dick, but how old are you? Most young people who are left leaning support Bernie. If you mostly hang out and talk politics with younger people, you're going to see a lot more support for Bernie. Sites like Reddit are mainly used by people in that demographic. I think it's much for simpler and logical that you are just not seeing Hillary supporters due to who you talk to and spend time with, rather than it being some giant conspiracy.

       I am 24. I have friends in ALL age groups but I normally hang out with the "older" crowds because most people my age aren't married with children (like I am). The majority of people my age that I'm friends with don't give a flying fuck about politics. The people older than me are either republican, support Bernie, or don't really know who they want to vote for. I don't take all of my Knowledge from people I know personally. I work on Marketing so I pull a lot of insight reports on the candidates. It just DOES NOT make sense that Hillary is doing so well with the popular vote. Even old people have Facebook now, so it just doesn't make sense that she is polling as well as she is.

       It's not so much age as it is a big socio-economic bloc. You probably don't have many friends with REALLY different political views from you because so much of what leads to people being friends (job, neighborhood, school, places you hang out, clubs, gyms) are ALL confounders for political views. There are lots of Hillary supporters out there, you just don't know them. Your sample set (people you know) is both too small to draw conclusions from, and heavily confounded.

       That's because that's his demographic. Old people don't use the internet like young people do. Reddit and other liberal websites are obviously going to be Sanders-skewed. It's like only watching Fox News and being confused that Obama won the presidency.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no larger conspiracy of news source vying for Hillary and editing poll results. Is there a media bias? Sure. But it would be unethical to fudge poll results and report and pretty hard to keep the people who would know quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is liked by the average democratic, middle class baby boomer, and because there are more of them and young people don't vote, only they matter.

       I understand you point! I do think Bernie's following is majorly the millennials which makes sense why his online presence is huge. But it still doesn't make sense to me that Hillary is 20% ahead in the polls. Facebook is being overthrown by the older generation now and I still only see few people comment on her Facebook posts genuinely supporting her. The rest look like bots and a lot of her posts are infiltrated with people calling her out and stand up for Bernie.

       That is so weird, I was about to ask the same thing.  We went on a road trip and not one car had a Hillary bumper sticker but I saw Bernie stickers.  I haven't met anyone who doesn't hate her and hate is the word they use.

       I'm with you here, and honestly I'm guilty of it sometimes in normal conversion, but I've been working on it. It's partly wanting to show off what you know, and partly wanting to make others look bad. Neither is noble, and there are so many nicer ways to say it.

       I have left leaning friends. They all planned on voting for Hilary because of name recognition and the stigma around "socialist" Bernie Sanders. Most of them enjoy spending their free time watching reality tv and television in general. None of them spend anywhere near the amount of time that I spend on the internet and because of that their image of Bernie and Hilary are massively skewed.  It was not until I started showing them info on Bernie and Hilary did their opinions start to change, I have got a republican to say he would vote for Bernie. I feel this is what a large part of the Hilary supports are, just uninformed liberals, and with the media largely not covering Bernie they stay Hilary supports because all her soundbits sound good and they don't both researching anything.

       I'd vote for Ron Paul (not that he's running this cycle) or Bernie Sanders. It's interesting how I'd vote for people on the polar opposite of the ideological spectrum before voting in the "middle" by going for the most popular candidates.

       Those people are the target market for all campaigning. Those who research for themselves will not be swayed by campaigning. But people who actually do the work to decide for themselves make up such a small part of the voting block that they don't really matter. Elections, when not decided by voting fraud, are won through advertising..

       I would vote for Hillary. She seems the least likely to blow up the economy, and she seems the least likely to conduct foreign affairs based on bravado and posturing (
       <em>
        ahem
       </em>
       entire Republican lineup
       <em>
        ahem
       </em>
       ). Email stuff doesn't really bother me, and the whole not classifying info stuff seems overblown to me. She's the secretary of state, classifications are complicated, especially between departments, and kind of up to her. As best I can tell, she's a real politic leader that trusts the mainstream economists with the economy.

       You need to know that Hillary would let Wall St. do absolutely what they wanted. Her connections and owed favors to Wall St. would do the middle class a disservice. Yea the email scandal is exaggerated by Fox News but, still, I just dont trust her. I also feel she will send the National Debt further out of control.

       I just don't agree with the whole Wall street hate/wall street is evil. Yeah, the financial sector REALLY fucked up during the 2000's, and yes they were driven by a desire to make money. But that doesn't mean we would be better off without the financial innovations they are producing. It's weird to think about because the modern economy is so ephemeral, but the complicated financial technologies we've developed help us just as much as aerospace tech or manufacturing tech or whatever. Figuring out the optimal flow of money, freeing up more resources for investment, and minimizing investment risk helps the economy overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will totally agree with the sentiment that too much inequality is Bad with a capital B. BUT, mainstream economists are definitely not certain that inequality is at a bad level in the US currently. I mean, real wages have risen overall over the past few years, not just for the wealthy. And they ARE certain that there's no easy way to fix that inequality without messing up the rest of the economy in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I don't understand the economy, since I'm a physicist, not an economist. But there are people who understand economics better than I do. Not perfectly, but our best guess is whatever the people who study this stuff say. And the person who is going to listen to them, the person who is going to be reasonable, is either Jeb or Hillary. And there's some things I won't do, and among them is elect another Bush (Seriously, wtf even WAS the Iraq war? Like seriously wtf).

       Also, (wanted to make a new comment because my first was getting to be a wall of text) her driving the debt up doesn't bother me. It's my understanding that the only statistic that matters about the debt is debt as a percentage of GDP. Ours is around 100%, which isn't all that bad. Plenty of other countries are leveraged far more, and haven't collapsed or anything. Debt for a country is fundamentally different from debt for a person. A country never retires, and you can much more accurately predict medium term and long term performance. Wouldn't it be silly to not take people's money that are willing to invest in you at near zero interest rates? Mainstream economists are more concerned about candidates that endorse contractionary policies. At least that's my understanding of how this stuff works.

       It's recovering from one of the greatest shocks since the stock market crash in 1929. The economy is definitely getting better, that can just be a slow process, and it can be hard on young people who are locked out of the job market because people had to postpone retirement because their investments all tanked in 2008. But there are no easy solutions to these problems, no matter what a politician might tell you.

       A vote for Hillary is a vote for the status quo. Nothing major will change under Hillary as she will become the public relations face of the plutocracy as Obama has been.

       Good. The economy is recovering. We're getting out of wars in the Middle East. Biggest problem right now is global warming, and only one of the parties believes in that.

       Look at it like this, Ron Paul had incredible online support.  He won online polls and had lots of support on Reddit.  But these are young people who don't vote as much as older people.  Young people are loud and a bit obnoxious when it comes to politics.

       Ive seen a few. But they are left leaning friends who just dont know enough to realize Bernie is a better choice (if they know who he is at all since they dont really research candidates) but know enough to not want to vote Trump/Republican.

       She has no real competition.  Bernie Sanders is the Ron Paul of the Democrat party, he has a small die hard fan following but its a very small very young group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since she has no competition, there is no contest for the primary, and not need for anyone in the Democrat party to get all that energized or anything at all until the general election starts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically the Democrats will be boring and mostly just snooze, until the general election season begins.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe most Democrats are paying more attention to the Republican candidates than they are their own.

       "how did Nixon get elected? Nobody I know voted for him." I forget who said that but it's a famous quote. You don't hang out with a lot of soccer moms, union members, middle aged blacks. With the GOP splintered, and sanders a dark horse, Clinton is leading the pac right now. She has her ducks in a row. She has near universal name recognition, people like her or hate her but they know who she is.
That's huge. Most Americans dont know who Bernie Sanders is.
As a former senator she has been able to line up delegates and has a 2 billion campaign warchest (i count the clinton foundation in that; the foundation was always there to support her campaign.)
People still like Bill C, and he's had his two terms.
She's a stand-in for him, in some ways.
I expect she will get Obama's endorsement.
Some people are eager to vote for any woman, even Hillary.
If the GOP nominates Trump, or someone far right, she will pick up much of the moderate middle.
She started running long before everybody but Biden,and Biden's out of the race now. Starting earlier is a big factor.
I strongly don't like her.
But she's got the resume, the cash, and the will to power.
She's the front runner.
Also, she comes off as more moderate than Sanders.
A lot of democrats aren't sure  he's electable. Nice guy,
sincere, but pretty far left even for the Dems. How would he do in the south, and in the suburbs?

       I think she's a "voting booth" candidate. She's so polarizing people just don't publicly state they support her. They'll just wait until they pull the curtain shut to show their support.  Having said that, I still believe her poll numbers are hyped and that Sanders would do better against Trump.  But they already have the T-shirts printed as the saying goes - 
 Clinton vs. Trump

       Also gotta say I haven't met an ardent supporter of Clinton, only people who say 'meh' I'd vote for her if it was her or Trump. Am wondering where these huge supporters are largely grouped. For NY, I'm guessing mostly upstate? Maybe?

       Last time I listened to his podcast Dan Savage expressed that he would be voting for Hillary. And that guy can really mobilize his audience. I generally find him to be a voice of reason when it comes to politics, but in this case his reasons for voting Hillary struck me as rather flippant.

       It's not just on the internet, either. I live in Manhattan. Suffice it to say I talk to a lot of drunk liberals on the weekends. Most of them women. I've never heard a positive opinion about Hillary. I almost got laid 2 weeks ago just for saying the name Elizabeth Warren.

       Unfortunately, a majority of my co-workers are Hillary supporters. So approx. 300? It seems like they make up very specific sets of people. If you find one, there are lots of people they know that also support her. The problem is finding that one. Or maybe just the one willing to admit it.

       I have a close friend who is absolutely voting for Hillary. Yes, he's ignorant as fuck and stubborn and set in his ways, and he has absolutely no self respect. But he's voting for Hillary. I pointed out her crimes and behavior and that she's totally just another one from the same establishment, and he agrees with all of that. He's still voting for Hillary - and he's serious.
      </p>

       I don't understand it at all. But he's the only person I know of anywhere who is voting for Hillary.

       If Hillary's support is fabricated (and Trump's, as others here have suggested), who does the population actually support? I think it's reasonable to suspect a degree of manipulation, but I assume that would result in actual support rather than a complete and total fabrication.

       There is so much of the general public that votes for a party and not a candidate. With that said only about half of the voting age population actually votes. So if Trump can get a lot of people to vote that usually do not, he will easily win.

       I thought my town had one Hillary supporter. It would make sense, being a poor, very religious, rural town, with a strong mining industry and very low education levels. I looked a little closer and it said "Hillary for Prison 2016". I kind of teared up a little; I'm proud of this little town! (Southern IL)

       As a Canadian (we all watch American tv) I can tell you that everyone knows Hilary is running for the dem. Nom. But many people over 45 have never even heard of bernie if they have its been my experience they say things like "oh ya I think I've heard of him what's he look like?"or "that's the guy who stole Hilary information off that internet" The media is completely blocking him from the majority of your voters, the seniors are the only demographic that always votes and they at this point have been told almost nothing about him.

       Most people aren't going to vote in this election (most people don't vote anyway), but the popular support is with Trump, by far.  He appeals to the working class (the majority of people who actually vote), and he says things that everyone agrees with, but they are too afraid to say out loud

       I am assuming that the support for Hillary is fudged about as much as they can get away with, and support for other candidates is suppressed. The votes are rigged, so the poles must also be rigged to match.

       The account of Cathy O’Brien in regards to the Clintons is very revealing (I wrote about this in the article Hillary Clinton 2016). O’Brien is a former mind control victim who suffered horrific SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse) at the hands of her handlers, who programmed her to become a sex slave. You can read her story in her book Trance-Formation of America. She explicitly mentions being abused and repeatedly raped by many high-ranking politicians including George Bush Sr., Dick Cheney, Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.

       Hi.  I'd prefer Bernie, but if Hillary gets the Democratic Party nomination, I'll vote for her.

      <p>
       I attended a rally she did with Bill in New Hampshire in 2008.  I found her pretty likable as a person.  She's not my ideal candidate, but I don't think the Sanders/Warren ticket I'd like to see is going to happen.

       I would make an observation. There are two types of fame: 1) In which you're famous for being yourself [e.g., John Lennon, Picasso, Socrates, etc], and 2) In which you aren't famous in and of yourself, but you're famous for an office you hold. (For instance, a general in the military, or a politician who is treated like a god while he's in power, but once out of power, he can't get arrested. This happens because he was never liked for himself, per se, but for the power he represented.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Establishment candidates like Hillary Clinton are not liked for themselves. People will merely throw the lever for her because she represents "Generic Democrat".
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, she doesn't NEED to have a deep support-base of people who actually like her as a person, or agree with any of her policies. Once a teamster gets behind the curtain, he'll mindlessly pull the lever for "Generic Democrat". And this time around: That's Hillary Clinton. The same impulse will be in effect for people affiliated with teachers' unions, African-Americans in urban areas, transgendered wheelchair-bound Greenpeace activists, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       All will throw the switch for "Generic Democrat," no matter who that generic Democrat is.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the Republican side, it's more competitive. All the official establishment candidates [with the exception of Kasich and Rubio] are out. So, on the Republican side, people are actually voting for candidates based on their own personalities and policy positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary's position is far more depressing. Even her own rank-and-file dislike her. But they'll throw the lever for her because they're told to vote in "Generic Democrat".
      </p>
      <p>
       Left to her own devices, Hillary would have trouble filling a Burger King to have people hear her speeches. And in fact Democratic strategists have expressed concern that she's unable to get Trump-sized crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say what you will about him, but Trump actually has die-hard supporters. Hillary doesn't. She has lukewarm supporters who will only vote for her perfunctorily.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in summation: To the person who says that they've never met a Hillary supporter in real life--- Just change the question. Don't look for the term "Hillary". Listen for the more appropriate sound of people voting for "Generic Democrat" and there you'll find her support-base.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: Hillary's great strength (and her great weakness) is the fact that people will vote for her, despite not particularly liking her much. Even the traditionally Democrat-leaning media portray her thusly:

       Im sorry, the fact that donald trump is running fro president and the whole presidental debate tv show should tell you that politics are a joke in US. They are masking the two party system by having shitpost of candidate selection who show uncultured, bigoted, and crazy opinions. It isnt surprising that the top 5%contol 99% of the wealth and power. Ifluence like that, and you have yourself a consiparacy, or as I loke to call it deception.

       I'm an anarchist and I think voting is a sham, but if I did believe in the system, then I would support Hiliary over Sanders. Both Sanders and Trump give the impression of rash, impulsive behavior. Clinton shows experience and stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the way people approach elections is that they try to vote for someone that aligns with their views. Sanders captures the young and disenfranchised, whereas Clinton caters to older, business types.

       I lived in Maryland my whole life. O Malley was the worst, everyone hated him by the end. Maryland is a blue state and very liberal but after O Malley taxed everyone out their asses, (he even started a rain tax) the state elected a republican governor. He's a snake, and so many rumors about him getting women pregnant and then disappearing. Don't let him fool you, he's awful.

       A vote for Hillary is a vote for the status quo. Nothing major will change under Hillary as she will become the public relations face of the plutocracy as Obama has been.

       the electrinic machines are all managed by private companies, red states those are republican companies
      </p>
      <p>
       exit polls and predictive polls are for the first time in american history, since 2000, totally wrong and consistently need to be shifted republican by 10 or so points
      </p>
      <p>
       the fact the republican party exists at all is the result of the most sophisticated and huge fraud in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       the situation is grim, the government at this time exhibits very few if any actual american values, and the citizens statistically have no say
      </p>
      <p>
       things that 90 percent agree on are completely impossible because bribery and fraud in congress, and theres no way to investigate without being accused of terrorism etc

       It's not how the people vote that matters. It's who counts the vote.
       <br/>
       Florida  2000 is a case study of this.

       Lol, voting for Trump IS voting for Clinton. After all, they've been close friends for decades and he's given Clinton in the tens of thousands in campaign donations over the years. Coincidence? I think not.

       You need to know that Hillary would let Wall St. do absolutely what they wanted. Her connections and owed favors to Wall St. would do the middle class a disservice. Yea the email scandal is exaggerated by Fox News but, still, I just dont trust her. I also feel she will send the National Debt further out of control. (btw i didnt downvote you, ppl in this sub downvote what they don't agree with and its not how reddit works.)
