       It seems really odd that all of a sudden hundreds of immigrants
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3zxxhi/reports_of_sexual_assaults_on_women_across/">
        all around Europe
       </a>
       start assaulting woman at the same time, as if a holiday is some kind of switch in their brains to become sexual.  Then there's this rumor of a cover-up when it's really the opposite as it's blasted all over the media and reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all seems like a manufactured Streisand effect to get the immigrants to look bad and turn people against them.

       No it doesn't. It seems like exactly what it is: the European elites, who favor mass immigration, tried to cover up the expected racist crimes against indigenous European people perpetrated by non-European immigrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the internet is still somewhat uncontrolled and has not been monopolized like the mass media of yesterday, so the story came out anyway.

       What we are seeing is the European establishment's desperate attempts to stifle the truth about "multiculturalism."

       Comment I responded to was talking-tough about "multiculturalism" which will, of course, render any "diversity" of Christian denominations a criminal activity when "multiculturalism" is vanquished.

       Another nice deflect.  Same user different accounts?

      <p>
       The topic isn't Christianity, it's "multiculturalism."  Can't handle any questions about how your defeat of multiculturalism will work?  Since we're going to be a monoculture if you get your way, how do various multicultures get resolved, like White Christianity?  Simple question.

       Hence why I specified

       Christianity and no other kind.  Anti-multiculturalists are very nervous about racial matters.  Very, very nervous and frightened.

       So you can't answer the question?  What happens to different White Christian denominations when your Reich ends multiculturalism?  That's your cue to deflect again and avoid the question about your agenda in this thread.

       LOL. It seems to me that multi-culturalists are very, very nervous and frightened that their "pet" non-Europeans aren't behaving in the way they promised people they would, thus, are setting up a backlash.

       The plot is the 70-year attempt to revive the eradication of "multiculturalism" which, obviously, you haven't thought through.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you'll have many questions to answer, like OP's, who has noticed that the "immigrant scandal" tends to smell like a manufactured attempt to bolster your "anti-multicultural" narrative.  Funny that you're stumbling in answering simple questions about your fantasies.

       Removal of different denominations of Christianity "eases the lives of all Christians"?  Very revealing.  I'll bet Protestants are going to be surprised to learn they'll become Catholics or vice-versa in your monoculture.

       I flew to Europe in August and settled in Germany in November. The raping has been a huge problem, even before NYE. Look up what has been going on in Sweden.
       <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/10/23/sweden-opened-its-doors-to-muslim-immigration-today-its-the-rape-capital-of-the-west-japan-didnt/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the Article "A 1996 Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention report bears this out. It noted that Muslim immigrants from North Africa were 23 times more likely to commit rape than Swedish men. It is no wonder why today Sweden is deemed the rape capital of the Western world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more shocking, however, is the political correctness overshadowing the reporting of these crimes. Sensitive about accusations of Islamophobia, the Swedish press refuses to sound a warning alarm for native women about who these sexual predators are. Thus, when a Muslim commits a rape, the media only refers to him as a Swedish male."

       The authorities have been trying to hide the depth of the issue, most are thinking by now, to not make Merkel look bad.

       +1. All theories about conspiracies are false, except for, at most, one.

       Rape is a common scare tactic in invasions and war used througout history. This is part of a jihad to islamize and colonize Europe. Combined with their own higher fertility rate they try push scare and push out natives, not by force, but by time. Many of us know not all "terrorist attacks" in Europe are caused by muslims, religions tend to do the long run takesovers. These "terrorist attacks" are a whole other agenda, probably by some other middle eastern folks

       Just curious, but if their goal is to push out the natives, then where are the natives supposed to go to? And why would they want Europe? Why Europe?

       You're missing the point, pushing out is not meant literally, but figuratively, through time. In that theory the natives will simply die out over time because they have negative demographic birthrates. They ("the invaders") have higher Birthrates, meaning they have children earlier in life and more of them. Theoretically its not only europe, but the world.

       This is not my opinion, just trying to elaborate in tune with the narrative of kingalexroderick on what you asked.
