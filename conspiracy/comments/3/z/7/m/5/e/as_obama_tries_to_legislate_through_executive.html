    <div class="md"><p>Your position represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the system you wish to protest. </p>

<p>The person who wins is the one who gets the most votes. Ballots not cast are votes not counted. The lower the voter turnout, the fewer votes you need to win. The reason you have an unrepresentative government is because half of you don&#39;t vote. Because you don&#39;t vote for someone that represents you, you end up with nobody to represent you. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you understand why you have a Congress with 11% approval and 90% retention (or whatever it is)? It&#39;s because most of the people that actually bothered to vote actually approve of them. Both Democrats and Republicans work their arses off to make sure that if you don&#39;t vote for them then you vote for nobody. And it works. They have you convinced that a vote for anyone other than them is a wasted vote, so you waste your vote by not voting at all.  </p>

<p>This is voter manipulation. This is one of the ways you rig an relection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no winners in a centralized top down governance except the people at the top, because there isn&#39;t a feedback loop. Its a one directional system. People that get into office have to serve the mandate of government which is to take resources from the people though taxes and other governmental programs and give to the people who actually use government as a wealth extraction tool. They take your resources when ever you spend money on systems that support government and give it to the people that are destroying the planet.</p>

<p>This is why I feel we are screwed. It just seems like so many people that have been brainwashed by the system that they cant see any other way other then to support the same criminal organization that robs them blind year after year. The game is rigged from the inside. When you vote you are actually making the world a worse place to live because those people that you vote for dont have any power. Their merely puppets in a much larger game. Don&#39;t you see that?</p>

<p>Our government is a business, run like a business, for business. It doesn&#39;t represent the people. It only creates the illusion of representing the people so people go along with it. And just by what you said, they are doing a really good job at convincing you the system works.</p>

<p>This has been going on for the past 200 years. Same corrupt people in the same corrupt institutions. The problem is systemic. People are created by there surroundings, not the other way around. You can&#39;t change or replace people to make it better. You have to get to the root of the problem which is the very system that created the problem. Systems that use centralized control to dis-empower people. Its not going to change by voting. You are working with in a system you did not create that was not meant to serve you, so why would you support it? </p>

<p>We have to get back to individual rights and freedoms and stop thinking we know better then others whats right for them. That&#39;s another false standpoint that makes you feel like you are in power, when all it really does is give you a false sense of security. While at the same time allows people in power to ride your in-ability to think to steal and evade on individual rights so that you can have some fake benefit. A benefit that you feel is justified in being taken from another that doesn&#39;t support some collective view on how society should be run. And by the way its not you that are making these decisions. its people in power that use powerful tactics of persuasion to convince the rest of us to go along with some supposed benefit when its just a trojan horse designed to dis-empower everyone. It happens with all these latest terrorist attacks, forced vaccines, gun control, drone assassinations and the rest. What ever you can think of they sell it to the people as a benefit, all the while we draw closer and closer to a police state. What is it going to take for you to wake up? When your children or parents are in concentration camps?</p>

<p>Im trying to actually <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/">make a difference</a> by supporting real change by acting on my beliefs, not following a system I dont trust or believe in and expect someone within that system I know has no power to represent my views. Voting is for people that cant or wont act on their own to right wrongs and expect others to do the thinking and acting for them. We have been convinced if we just stand by and vote for a better candidate that this is going to make the world a better place. I call that supporting a superiority complex, that you convinced yourself to be on the receiving end of. </p>

<p>Nobody is more qualified than you to make the world a better place, count on that. Once you realize that you are responsible for everything that is happening right now in the world through your actions or in-actions to right wrongs is when will you finally realize that you have to <a href="http://www.commonwealths.org/divestment">divest</a> by refusing to give your power away to an organization that has been any enemy to free will for a very long time. Start acting in your own way to change the world, Stop supporting control structures that try to convince you otherwise. You will feel better about your world and yourself once you take the that step. and you will see that I am right some day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>omg dude did you not read what I said? are you that blind that you cant see that this system of government serves only special interests? If you vote you are serving there interests, not your own.</p>

<p>you can&#39;t change a criminal organization by voting people out, its based on corruption, it will always have corruption because the system itself is the very thing that encourages corruption. Thats what centralization of power is, That&#39;s what centralization of power does. </p>

<p>If you look at all the ecosystems on the planet, their all based on decentralized self-organization. The parts form together to create a whole and no one part can better or smarter than the other without the rest of the parts. It takes parts working together to form a system that is intelligent enough to act for the betterment of there species. Civilized human structures of society and government are the ONLY ONES on the planet that have everything backwards. Its an incompatible system that is designed to serve one part of the whole, instead of the whole and all its parts.</p>

<p>Its really not hard to get.</p>

<p>When we have government working as an extension of us and everything is completely transparent, then we can talk about voting, until then you are literally wasting your time and energy every single time you vote. In fact you actually make it worse because each person you elect that keeps the government going paves the way for more special interests to create more wars and steal more resources from every society on the planet. What do you think Obama is doing now? The same thing The last administration was doing. And the administration before that and so on and so on. Hope and change in government? my ass. Start putting that hope and change where it belongs, ON YOURSELF.  Act to right wrongs YOURSELF. Stand up and do something instead of expecting some administration to do it for you, its never going to HAPPEN! Not in a million years!! This conversation will be still going by then if we are still alive until you fuckers wake up and act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it appears circular because it&#39;s a fucking circle. You begin and end in the same place in order to justify your position.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t vote because the system is corrupt and because you won&#39;t participate in a corrupt system you don&#39;t vote.</p>

<p>What you obstinately refuse to recognise is that your lack of participation is the cause of the problem in the first place. By encouraging people not to vote you are creating the exact conditions you supposedly despise. The fewer regular citizens that vote, the more powerful the vote of lobbied interests become. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that is not true, this has been going on for a long time with our support. The system is corrupt because we dont run the government. It runs us. </p>

<p>Government feeds off the the people&#39;s resources: time, money and energy to complete their agenda&#39;s. They become strong because we give them our power. 
As a matter of principals you dont support something you know is not right. I know that government is not the right way to run a society</p>

-The system is corrupt because you don&#39;t participate.</p>

<p>&quot;Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&quot; - Albert Einstein</p>

<p>You sir are insane because voting is decided by those who fund the candidates and then we vote based on who got the most funded. .26% of Americans gave $200 dollars or more to any federal candidate while 0.01% gave $10,000 or more to any federal candidate and 0.000042% or 132 american gave 60% of SuperPac money spent in the 2012 election. These people who fund the elections are worth more than 90% of us combined. If you are wondering where I got the numbers here are sources. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I love the idea you propose, I am deeply cynical that voting can change anything. The voting machines are all easy to rig and the media will brainwash millions of dummies to vote against their own interests. The old lesser of two evils argument has resulted in a long string of evil politicians holding power in America. Even if you somehow vote out all the scumbags and get a new group of politicians in office, how long do you think it would take for the oligarch bankers to bribe, blackmail or kill them all? And lets say we have a group of real patriots who take every precaution and resist every seduction, whats to stop the globalist banksters from paying outside forces to wage war on us in the same way we war on Iran. Anybody who does any research will know the only reason Iran is on our list of villains, is because they aren&#39;t controlled by the central bankers. If Iran suddenly let the banksters control their financial future, overnight Iran would become our best buddy and the media would sing their praises. See what I mean. </p>

<p>Rich men, who worked for the British government previously (and sometimes still did), met together, under the auspices of <em>altering the current government</em>, <em>in private</em>, <strong>with private security</strong>, with one State not even participating.</p>

<p>A group of land owners, bankers, lawyers and slavers from Virginia showed up early and slowly steamrolled the participants into a loosely and cleverly worded document which lead to the federal behemoth you see today.</p>

If the time for Conventions is over, the Constitution is over? I don&#39;t like either the libertarian/randian nor the anarchist solutions. How  about you describe a scenario wherein the power is wrested away from the Oligarchs and manipulators?</p>

<p>I personally think we need critical mass, one we are all apart of. Its an awakening that happens when enough people&#39;s mindset change. An enlightenment if you will, where we agree on simple non aggression based principles toward each other.</p>

<p>STOP killing. Stop signing up for this bullshit. Stop treating yourself negatively. Stop watching TV. Stop buying the lies. </p>

<p>START Eating healthier. Be kinder to yourself, you family and everyone, even strangers. Educate and converse real shit with people. Discuss FACTS. Read. Think for yourself. Be a healer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry James, I gotchu bb. </p>

<p>Indeed, I will even go so far as to assume to offer an interpretation. </p>

<p>James is saying that prior to the expansion of the Burning Crusade that he was rocking a Paladin build that focused on tanking; whereas most Paladins were healers or maybe some fighters. Nonetheless, JamesColesPardon had a journey to go, despite what was popular, despite what made bloody sense (roll a Warrior, James - a Druid at the least!), he went onward. Indeed, he even was rewarded with an exceedingly rare low-level item for his guildies. </p>

<p>But despite this epic journey wherein James forged his own path, where he conquered these digital monsters in a means that was contrarian at the least, rebellious in its most glorious, he still failed. He failed because he did not see the real-life dungeons surrounding him. While he was getting sick level 12 drops, the neocons were leveling up their own script by invading the Iraq and Afghan dungeons. They swiftly overthrew the main boss and advanced their agenda whilst criminalizing opposition to their progress. </p>

<p>Now James sees the dungeon beyond the 010101. Now James is sad.</p>

<p>Rich men, who worked for the British government previously (and sometimes still did), met together, under the auspices of <em>altering the current government</em>, <em>in private</em>, <strong>with private security</strong>, with one State not even participating.</p>

<p>A group of land owners, bankers, lawyers and slavers from Virginia showed up early and slowly steamrolled the participants into a loosely and cleverly worded document which lead to the federal behemoth you see today.</p>
