       It seems like there should be surveillance video, or at least cell phone clips all over the internet by now. If not, why not? Maybe the women were paid to fabricate a mass report to make the refugees look bad?

       i was also wondering this too. i dont know, it seems a little far fetched that 1000 people would first be on the same page to sexually assualt random women and do so on the same night. second, not be worried about the consequences that would be taken on them while immigrants are already on the defensive from the paris attacks, and third, no vids turn up. for all the "sandy hook, paris attacks are false flags" talk on here, it is a little bizarre to see so many people on here taking this at face value.

       Probably not paid. They're probably part of the racist crowd that never wanted the immigrants in the first place.

      <p>
       There were 22 "sexual assaults", including 1 rape, apparently.

       Why do I feel like your the kinda person that would get mad at people for questioning sexual assault victims under different circumstances. Screaming stuff like "VICTUM BLAMING". Shouldn't these women be believed and protected at least until the facts and the evidence have been thoroughly analyzed?

       Not you man, the "you fucking hobbit" was directed towards the "Kiwi Battler" from New Zealand.
      </p>
      <p>
       At minimum he should be able to pick up the basic concept of Us and Them, the difference between your own people and "others," the concept of maintaining a perimeter to protect your own people, etc. Perhaps more importantly, he just may come to understand why these concepts are necessary for survival, and to denounce them is to shame and weaken your own people so that outsiders can abuse them (at best).

       Yeah I got that. I'm just saying if anything I'm a planetary nationalist. We are all one manifestation of the singularity which is consciousness. But being a realist I would like to see middle eastern countries embrace refugees, just because I know that, that would be better, objectively.

       that recent summer French assault on a french/australian girl way before the Paris attacks, the MSM were laying the groundwork for 'dirty arab' violence on white Europeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       supposed to be a french victim, but surprise surprise 5eyes/NATO australian victim in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       ditto the australian duping girl shot in the buttocks with her duping MSM interviewer/handler. oh the smiles and the giggles over a maiming gunshot wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       and its all so fcuking obvious if you pat attention to the details or the gaping holes in the stories.
      </p>

       G.K. Chesterton would be angry at the stupidity of the modern peoples. we truly have overpaid morons running and staffing our MSM/intelligence outfits, scripts barely worthy of Dr.Who.

       groping and petty theft would be hard to catch on camera as it occurs quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's basically just a giant mob, like after a football game... will probably take them weeks to comb through whatever footage the cops have.

       But the reports of groups of men raping women in the open are obviously exaggerated.

       If you're staring at surveillance video of a 1,000 people, finding the moment where one steals a purse is going to be hard. It's like a "where's waldo" exercise.

       If there was a mass of people, you would only see a wall heads and shouldfer. Whats happening to a women being passed from person to person in a mass of people, like groping or robbing, is happening under walls of heads and shoulders. It would be difficult to tell if a person is groping from a person who is not doing anything. Thus, a perfect place for people to commit this kind of crime.

       likely either a outright lie by MSM, or just some protest at the station being reported as a mass groping.

       there was that 'beard club' with a silly (ISIS looking) flag at some Danish castle, that was a total fabrication by UK MSM.

       The media and "forward thinking people" deny it. They deny it because it is the the truth and acknowledging it is acknowledging a problem that needs a solution.

       This line of thought must be pushed by every person who is a victim of the negative impacts from this mass migration, and it must be pushed against the media and political establishment that denies it . It will bring a quicker resolution their problem.
