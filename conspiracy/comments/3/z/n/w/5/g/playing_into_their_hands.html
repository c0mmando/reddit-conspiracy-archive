<p>What I&#39;m seeing right now both here and in world news with this whole cologne ordeal is exactly that.</p>

<p>This is the conspiracy subreddit, isn&#39;t it? Why is nobody questioning the event itself?</p>

<p>I noticed a comment in the worldnews thread stating that police believe only 20-40 people in the crowd were responsible for the attacks.</p>

<p>Heres a theory: these were paid instigators. </p>

<p>Think about it, reddit has blown up big time over this, in multiple ways. The mods nuke threads on the topic, creating the illusion of a &#39;cover-up&#39; under the guise of being politically correct. This generates a hell of a lot more interest in the topic, leading to generalisations and misinformation.</p>

<p>What I&#39;ve seen from the worldnews thread is that this has created insane amounts of anger towards &#39;left&#39; leaning people, and asylum seekers as a whole. </p>

<p>There are countless comments lumping all refugees into the same cast.. </p>

<p>So my question to you, R/conspiracy - is there more to this than just a &#39;cover-up&#39; by the worldnews mods? </p>

<p>Take emotion out of the equation and think objectively. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;real conspiracy&quot; is that these racist attacks are being covered up because the victims are German and the perpetrators are non-German.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;divide and conquer&quot; - it&#39;s &quot;unite and conquer.&quot;</p>

<p>Why is it that the &quot;elites&quot; in Europe are PROMOTING mass immigration? That goes against your narrative that the elites are trying to &quot;divide us by race.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s the precise opposite, they are trying to &quot;unite&quot; all races into a global proletariat. Breaking down tribes and peoples into one homogenous mass makes them easier to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thumbs up to this. </p>

<p>Immigrants are cheap labor to be used. Heck, look at the new years speech Merkel gave and she outright said that immigrants strengthen the economy. It&#39;s not really true as it increases the labor pool thereby leading to not enough jobs for everyone... but it IS true for the bourgeoisie, who benefit from a surplus of labor thereby driving down the cost of labor. </p>

<p>Countries either outsource to cheap labor, or if they have to, import it. Either way, it&#39;s a boon to the rich and a slap in the face to the working man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with that. But I&#39;m more talking about religious and cultural divides. Do you think they are deliberately fanning the flames to incite conflict between refugees and the host populace?

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s local, regional and world politics. So strategies being deployed at the world level often clash with the local level. That&#39;s all that&#39;s happening here in my view. At the local level anti-immigrant powers are happy to incite conflict (as who wants millions of immigrants taking their jobs), at the elite/world level that&#39;s secondary and mundane to simply importing cheap labor and mixing cultures so that they can ultimately impose a one world government and as you say expand the proletariat (especially nice if you expand it with people who don&#39;t even know what the proletariat is). </p>

<p>To the elites there&#39;s no difference between a muslim, a christian, a woman, a man, a black person, a white person... they are all just &quot;humans&quot; that can be used as labor. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think they want to incite conflict, but I don&#39;t think they care if conflict unfolds either. I don&#39;t think the world-level elites care what the populations think (we saw that clearly with Greece). They are playing out game of world hegemony and will do whatever is required for that to come about... whether the population likes it or not (and they know they will never stand up to what is happening... if people haven&#39;t stood up by now after all that&#39;s happened, they never will).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe &#39;they&#39; are aware of the cultural differences between the asylum seekers and &#39;natives&#39;, its possible they even played a part in fostering those differences. </p>

<p>Sure, you can read about atrocities happening in another country by people of different religions and think &#39;gee, that&#39;s bad, they&#39;re bad people&#39;, but will you then go out and actively fight against those people?</p>

<p>By bringing in as many refugees as they did, they&#39;re shoving those differences right in peoples faces. All it takes is one catalyst, one spark to set the whole thing ablaze. Suddenly, those people who would not have acted before are out in droves &#39;defending&#39; their culture and people from the &#39;invaders&#39;, and the chain reaction kicks off.</p>

The fear and loathing of the &quot;other&quot; seems to be the easier option for many in this sub. It was like many minds just here just stopped questioning the bigger picture and started getting swept up in the manufactured divide and conquer hatred. 
The bigotry and constant flow of white supremacist shit posts seem to be causing this sub to atrophy and eat itself.

<p>Why would they do this? Who benefits? The globalist are certainly not on the side of the Nationalists. This event crushes billions of euros worth of multikulti propaganda.

<p>How many other people were assaulted, sexually or otherwise, in major cities across the world on NYE? I read something in the SMH the other day about how there were only 30 arrests in Sydney this year... but that was down from 290 last year, thanks to Sydney&#39;s new liquor laws.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been seeing reports of 60 arrests, which sounds perfectly within the bounds of a normal NYE in a large city, but claims of 1000 people gang-raping the population of Cologne. Someone is telling porkies.</p>

I didn&#39;t see any links submitted to the Europe sub even though it was mentioned in the title. When I went to the Europe sub there was even an article about the incident submitted the same hour mark as the OP. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why that got over 5k upvotes. If he submitted the story and it was blocked in multiple different subs I might understand it. But instead he just got into a submit fight with 1 mod group. 5k upvotes is suspiciously high, but isn&#39;t an absurd number.</p>

<p>I think your explanation makes more sense. Also, since this was a sex attack by Arab men on women it would allow agents to work both the racist angle and the feminist angle.</p>
