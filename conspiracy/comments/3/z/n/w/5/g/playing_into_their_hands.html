       So I'm sure most of you are aware of the old adage; divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm seeing right now both here and in world news with this whole cologne ordeal is exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the conspiracy subreddit, isn't it? Why is nobody questioning the event itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed a comment in the worldnews thread stating that police believe only 20-40 people in the crowd were responsible for the attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres a theory: these were paid instigators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it, reddit has blown up big time over this, in multiple ways. The mods nuke threads on the topic, creating the illusion of a 'cover-up' under the guise of being politically correct. This generates a hell of a lot more interest in the topic, leading to generalisations and misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I've seen from the worldnews thread is that this has created insane amounts of anger towards 'left' leaning people, and asylum seekers as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are countless comments lumping all refugees into the same cast..
      </p>
      <p>
       So my question to you, R/conspiracy - is there more to this than just a 'cover-up' by the worldnews mods?

       Take emotion out of the equation and think objectively.

       The "real conspiracy" is that these racist attacks are being covered up because the victims are German and the perpetrators are non-German.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not "divide and conquer" - it's "unite and conquer."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that the "elites" in Europe are PROMOTING mass immigration? That goes against your narrative that the elites are trying to "divide us by race."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the precise opposite, they are trying to "unite" all races into a global proletariat. Breaking down tribes and peoples into one homogenous mass makes them easier to control.

       thumbs up to this.

       Immigrants are cheap labor to be used. Heck, look at the new years speech Merkel gave and she outright said that immigrants strengthen the economy. It's not really true as it increases the labor pool thereby leading to not enough jobs for everyone... but it IS true for the bourgeoisie, who benefit from a surplus of labor thereby driving down the cost of labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Countries either outsource to cheap labor, or if they have to, import it. Either way, it's a boon to the rich and a slap in the face to the working man.

       Agree with that. But I'm more talking about religious and cultural divides. Do you think they are deliberately fanning the flames to incite conflict between refugees and the host populace? Seems like an easy way to keep both parties from thinking about how they're getting screwed by the upper echelons.

       I think there's local, regional and world politics. So strategies being deployed at the world level often clash with the local level. That's all that's happening here in my view. At the local level anti-immigrant powers are happy to incite conflict (as who wants millions of immigrants taking their jobs), at the elite/world level that's secondary and mundane to simply importing cheap labor and mixing cultures so that they can ultimately impose a one world government and as you say expand the proletariat (especially nice if you expand it with people who don't even know what the proletariat is).
      </p>
      <p>
       To the elites there's no difference between a muslim, a christian, a woman, a man, a black person, a white person... they are all just "humans" that can be used as labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't think they want to incite conflict, but I don't think they care if conflict unfolds either. I don't think the world-level elites care what the populations think (we saw that clearly with Greece). They are playing out game of world hegemony and will do whatever is required for that to come about... whether the population likes it or not (and they know they will never stand up to what is happening... if people haven't stood up by now after all that's happened, they never will).

       If they wanted homogenous nations, why would they accept people from different cultures that they know won't be compatible?

       I believe 'they' are aware of the cultural differences between the asylum seekers and 'natives', its possible they even played a part in fostering those differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, you can read about atrocities happening in another country by people of different religions and think 'gee, that's bad, they're bad people', but will you then go out and actively fight against those people?
      </p>
      <p>
       By bringing in as many refugees as they did, they're shoving those differences right in peoples faces. All it takes is one catalyst, one spark to set the whole thing ablaze. Suddenly, those people who would not have acted before are out in droves 'defending' their culture and people from the 'invaders', and the chain reaction kicks off.

       Great post.
The fear and loathing of the "other" seems to be the easier option for many in this sub. It was like many minds just here just stopped questioning the bigger picture and started getting swept up in the manufactured divide and conquer hatred. 
The bigotry and constant flow of white supremacist shit posts seem to be causing this sub to atrophy and eat itself.
Thanks.

       Exactly right. I expected to see at least some scepticism but all front page posts just carry on about the censorship while agreeing with the overall narrative. This is meant to be a place for thinking outside the hivemind, but all I see is people echoing the worldnews comments.

       You realise this was one event out of thousands across Europe in the last decade. Look at the Pakistani gangs targeting white girls in the UK, or the Swedish rape statistics going through the roof.

      <p>
       You are wilfully ignoring the facts because you don't want to accept that there is a big problem with the medieval views of many Africans and Arabs.

       Thanks. It seems suspicious to me that every post here is only talking about the 'censorship' of the story and not the potential motives of the event.

       This is not a unique case, this what they do where ever they go. This is what nationalist have warned the public about for decades. They payed 50-100 arab men to sexually assault german women? When they are doing it for free in Sweden, Finland, Norway, UK, France etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they do this? Who benefits? The globalist are certainly not on the side of the Nationalists. This event crushes billions of euros worth of multikulti propaganda. And why should we give a fuck about the so called refugees feelings? They have absolutely no right to live in Europe and we have no responsibility to help them.
If they rape one woman send back 10000.

       It's been up and down since I posted. I'd wager there are more lurkers/brigaders than normal today due to the attention the 'censorship' threads garnered in this subreddit.

       Here's a theory: When large numbers of people get together on New Year's Eve, many of them are drunk and do stupid things that lead to the police getting involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many other people were assaulted, sexually or otherwise, in major cities across the world on NYE? I read something in the SMH the other day about how there were only 30 arrests in Sydney this year... but that was down from 290 last year, thanks to Sydney's new liquor laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been seeing reports of 60 arrests, which sounds perfectly within the bounds of a normal NYE in a large city, but claims of 1000 people gang-raping the population of Cologne. Someone is telling porkies.

       Some guy with over 16000 link karma and 27000 comment karma submits 13 links to worldnews. The worldnews mod rejects all of them consistently and provides his reasoning. I didn't see any links submitted to the Europe sub even though it was mentioned in the title. When I went to the Europe sub there was even an article about the incident submitted the same hour mark as the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why that got over 5k upvotes. If he submitted the story and it was blocked in multiple different subs I might understand it. But instead he just got into a submit fight with 1 mod group. 5k upvotes is suspiciously high, but isn't an absurd number.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think your explanation makes more sense. Also, since this was a sex attack by Arab men on women it would allow agents to work both the racist angle and the feminist angle.
