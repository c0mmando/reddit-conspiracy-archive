The only thing that keeps me going is the thought that I am not fully alone; all over the world there are individuals who are transcending this prison. I want to be with them, I want you to come with us. The fact is, it is an individual journey. We have SHAMED the individual&#39;s journey; thinking that it is more important to &quot;save the whole world&quot; or &quot;get my family into heaven&quot;. These are false promises. The world is so darn big. You were the center of your story from the very beginning. I&#39;m sure some of you think this is all bullshit and that&#39;s fine. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen my posts from time to time that I write, simply trying to connect with other intelligent minds out there on cyberspace; it is a truly desperate attempt. The world really is huge and has gotten so twisted up in pleasure-seeking, unfulfilled selfishness. We are better than this. You are better than this. Sometimes people just need to be reminded. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a heaviness I feel, every day.  A deep sadness that most people are blind to, the fact that we are utterly controlled.  Everything you do from your job every day, paying 30+ years for a home to live in, these things, these guidelines were decided long ago.  Why do we live our lives this way? Why are materialism and pop culture so important to so many, especially as it&#39;s clear this empire is sinking?  The corruption is so entangled, there is no way to simply change things from within the system.  Personally, I&#39;m still in the anger / sadness phase.  A friend said it took him about 3 decades to get out of that phase, and he speaks much more like you do.  He says that only love will change the world.  Personally, I root for revenge first.  I hope there is a fight club scenario one day.  Then maybe, I can love <del>people</del> the human race again.  Hi NSA.  </p>

<p>Thank you for your kind words.  I hope one day I can find grace and peace of mind, as you seem to have.  I find it highly doubtful though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are so welcome, and believe me good friend, I still am angry, I&#39;m not sure if the anger will ever fully go away. I&#39;ve just learned to mitigate my emotions; once you have experienced the realization that everything is indeed connected, that God is not some judge waiting to punish us, and that death is the answer to all of our questions. We are our own jailers! It&#39;s not like soldiers have to stroll down the street to make sure we go to work and pay our bills; with our fake money.. We do it to ourselves! &quot;They&quot; simply lend a helping hand. I promise you, you will have peace. You HAVE peace, it is up to you to use it; your peace of mind is the most powerful tool on the universe. Never forget how important you (and everyone else) are. Good luck </p>

SO... yay! fresh start :) But I pulled up your history and a couple of posts have already intrigued me into what you say. Regardless, the way you came across in this post makes me like you. I know how it feels to be alone. To be desperate for intelligent discourse and to be fed up with the BS that most people believe. You&#39;re not alone. I look forward to hearing more of what you have to say. Happy New Year!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not Nye&#39;s theory. I was just joking, I was talking about evolution and the Big Bang and all that jazz that scientists make you swallow; it&#39;s all nice and well packaged but I have questions. As far as the simulation goes, yes. I believe in some way, on some level it is a simulation. It&#39;s like a computer program, or a vast array of them. I shouldn&#39;t mention this but I will because it goes along with what I&#39;m saying; if you look into the Cult of Saturn you may understand later on what I truly mean. The planets, sun, and moon are (potentially, possibly) all living beings. Every major religion in the Western Hempishere worships Saturn through backwards ways. The Muslims have the Kabbah, the Christians made a Roman Holiday called Saturnalia (Dec. 17-Dec.25) into Christmas. The festival was deeply pagan, and involved convincing an innocent outsider to pose as a lord and be treated as such for the breadth of the festival before being sacrificed to Saturn, the God of time, challenges, death, and magic. Saturn is El, Baal, Marduk, Kronos, etc; he has many names. What I&#39;m getting at is that we really are on the bottom of the totem pole here, these forces of nature and/or the matrix are doing things we can hardly understand. They toy with us. We&#39;re they&#39;re pets. Sorry to drop this on you, it&#39;s just a thought I&#39;ve been going through. I realized midway through this that many people (assuming I&#39;m on to something) are not ready to experience/understand what I&#39;m trying to say. At the end of the day, if you take into account quantum physics and numerology; the perfection of nature, it really makes me wonder; is there a vast digital ecosystem out there we simply can&#39;t perceive? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it would go something like this; we all are a conscious being, together; we and everything else in existence are like jigsaw pieces that fit together to make this whole universe. We each are the sum of the whole, fit into a narrow vessel that has been in many ways made to be amnesiac. What I&#39;m saying is I think the RESAON we&#39;ve been so dumbed down, is because at our highest intellect and spirituality we are the most powerful beings in the universe. We are the creators and the destroyers. We can make the world into a spinning rhombohedral if we want to! We can make the sky green. We can do these wacky, crazy things with our minds; and if we just had enough juice (other people believing us) we could make something crazy manifest. Hence, reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, so it&#39;s less like science discovering facts about the universe and more like science creating them.  I have wondered about this (it&#39;s the premise of a very cool role-playing game I used to be into back in the day), but it doesn&#39;t seem to be very testable.

    <div class="md"><p>Your dead on. Frankly bro, with what I&#39;ve seen, I could care less what the shape of the world is; I wanna get the fuck out regardless. I wanna get out alive if I can though, haha. Your right, it&#39;s not testable, that&#39;s why it&#39;s not known by many, an that&#39;s why I only drop these kinds of ideas on people who can handle them, and you should do the same. It&#39;s not worth arguing over science. You&#39;ve heard what Einstein said during that one major conference in With Niels Bohr? I can&#39;t remember where it was, but they said the mathematics they were pursuing and studying together was adapting to the researchers. I have PERSONALLY witnessed this with my own eyes, and it is the true beauty of nature. But most of us are afraid of being in charge, even of ourselves; so we divert to government and science; institutions THERE to keep us away from true, benevolent leadership, and true, unbiased information. I don&#39;t know man, it&#39;s messy, but the chase is fun to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we are meant to &quot;get out,&quot; or even to understand the world fully.  I think we are doing just fine as ignorant pawns of whatever is calling the shots (although we might have to be destroyed soon if mass extinction continues).  There is the possibility of going against the universal &quot;status-quo,&quot; maybe, but I think it&#39;s more of a selfish endeavor than something we are meant to do.  The whole New-Age concept of being &quot;here to learn&quot; just rings false for me; why bother learning if you just lose it all at death?  But if a person wants to sacrifice enough to become enlightened then I guess that is their choice.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that you bring up quantum physics.  Have you ever read any of David Bohm&#39;s stuff?  He goes into the holographic universe model, it basically explains QP by positing connections between molecules that operate faster than light (which was what Einstein was stuck-on, even though he didn&#39;t want to admit true randomness into physics).  His discussions with Krishnamurti are on youtube I think, pretty crazy shit. Krishnamurti is all about letting go of all mental authority so it may be right up your alley. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I have been exposed to Krishnamurti before; I feel Ike this is the time to look more heavily. I haven&#39;t had anyone say this kind of thing to me that brings up so many thoughts in awhile. I&#39;ll start by saying, your right it is a selfish endeavor to an extent. But it&#39;s not out of fear, or separation; and/or hatred and contempt towards humanity and Earth; it&#39;s about true knowledge and a true, honest soul&#39;s journey. I want to see what the source of all this is. I want to be synthesized. I also am heavily, diametrically opposed to the New Age idea of this being a school. It&#39;s more like a boarding school or a jailhouse with pretty lights. You can&#39;t leave. If reincarnation is the truth, and you wake up on the other side; you&#39;ll be approached by entities who want to send your ass back to earth eventually for one reason or the other. In my humble opinion, were caught in a cycle. They very well might destroy all of us, like you said, and hell, they might NEED to so Earth can limp on into the next age; I don&#39;t know. Either way, whether or not there is anything for us after this life, we should pursue truth and justice; so that at least future generations of flora and fauna can be spared of our ignorance. </p>

If they wanna make it flat they very well could fucking make it flat.

Maybe if we all THINK it&#39;s flat, it&#39;s flat. Does that make sense? I really believe the universe is holographic and we&#39;re living in a simulation anyway so anything could manifest in this crazy world. There are laws, of course and I&#39;m not claiming to understand them all but they are there. We have free will. The universe practices balance, it&#39;s not too cold it&#39;s, not too hot.

Don&#39;t expect it from the present generation, which loves its transgendered freaks and perverted sex too much to give them up. But it will turn around. </p>

<p>One scenario is the imposition of Islam over all of North America and Europe. The strict laws of Islam will prevent the present wallowing in pornography that we see all around us. They will prevent the feminist movement from destroying the family unit -- under Islam, woman know their place. The Islamics won&#39;t stand for the racial antics of blacks, either. Under Islam, blacks are treated as second-class citizens, little better than slaves ... or they are enslaved. Slavery still exists under Islam.</p>

<p>Am I saying Islam is better? Hell, no. I&#39;m saying that we have reached such a sump of perversion and corruption, that something is coming that will blast us all clean of it, one way or another. It could very well be Islam. It could be a revival of Christianity. Whatever it is, it will be a lot more severe than what we now live under. There will be moral laws, and those who violate them will be executed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you, your right. The destruction of the family has been devastating to us. This is not the alpha and omega of our job however. Our job is to do what we can and spread the truth, or at least the DESIRE for the truth. Most people only desire safety. I know it&#39;s seems like the people here are comfortable, but I have a feeling that most of us are itching for a fight. We don&#39;t have to change everything, we simply can&#39;t. We have to strategize, compartmentalize, and spread like a virus across this planet. We all have a job to do, let&#39;s do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;And spread like a virus across this planet&quot;. I whole-heartily agree, I suppose my strategy is to fully infect the host-family cell, and to spread out from there. At any rate, it&#39;s not how it is done as along as it gets done, as I am sure you agree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely! That was a hilarious way of describing your plan.. Haha. I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m digging at you for having children. You&#39;d have to personally know me to understand really why I don&#39;t want to. I also am kinda a loner. I do love kids! They bring smiles to my face and I&#39;m a great uncle. Haha. For sure! Make those little monsters see the light. </p>
