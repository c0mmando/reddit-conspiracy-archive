    <div class="md"><p>Criminals are going to get and use guns regardless of the laws. This is true anywhere, but especially true of America, which is awash in guns and has Mexico to the south, also awash in guns.</p>

<p>Why should people be prevented from defending themselves from armed criminals? If a criminal has a gun, or a knife, why should an honest citizen be forced to try to defend himself or his family only with his bare hands? Why put the honest citizen to a disadvantage to the armed criminal? The one thing we know for certain is that criminals do not obey the laws. Gun laws only restrict honest citizens, they do not restrict criminals.</p>

<p>In my opinion, anyone who does not have a felony criminal record, or who is not insane, should be free to own and carry a gun. That way, the law works to some minor degree in favor of the honest citizen, because if criminals are caught possessing or using guns, the law comes down hard on them, whereas the non-criminals are free to own and use guns without penalty.</p>

<p>In America the Constitution guarantees everyone the right to own and carry a gun. In England, you are accustomed to the nobility telling you where you can hunt and what you can own. You are used to not being permitted the same rights as the rich blue bloods.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Canadian, so different culture than the US. I don&#39;t understand why citizens need AK-47&#39;s and Uzi submachine guns. (handgun or long rifle I get for home protection or those that live on farms to protect from wild animals, fine). </p>

<p>I get the whole &quot;tyrannical government&quot; arguement... but in my view when the gov comes for you there will be 20 guys with AK-47&#39;s and a tank versus you with your one AK-47. Not sure how you&#39;re going to win that fight.  Not to mention if the gov wanted to control the population they wouldn&#39;t use guns... they&#39;d shut down electricity, water, food, etc. and only provide those things when you behaved as they wanted. </p>

<p>Moreover, having an armed rebellion only fuels a police state. It&#39;s much harder to implement marshall law when your citizens aren&#39;t a threat. </p>

<p>Like if the gov tried to take over in Canada, sure they have the guns, but I can&#39;t see our police and soldiers using them on unarmed citizens. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s just my view. I see the whole gun thing in the US as pure insanity on both sides.... the gov letting people buy AK-47s and the people for buying them out of some notion that it will somehow protect them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;re Canadian, I&#39;ll chime in on what appear to be a number of misconceptions. First, we cannot(without extensive licensing from the Government) purchase AK-47s or Uzis legally. Any firearm produced after 1986, and is select-fire is illegal for purchase; as such LEGAL full auto firearms are cost prohibitive. </p>

<p>The next point of &#39;tyrannical government&#39; understand the phrase: from my cold, dead hands. People are fully aware that fighting against the government in any fashion as far as defending their god given right to defend themselves from either the government, or a foreign oppressor may well, and likely will be met with violence. That is not a concern. It is the right of a free individual to stand and fight, or supplicate. Instead of cowardice, folks will sacrifice their lives for their inalienable rights. </p>

<p>Surely, the government would shut down utilities, which is why they&#39;ve illegalized collecting rain water, having solar panels while not attached to a power supply line, many municipalities have made it illegal to have more than x number of acres for farming without having your property zoned/x number of livestock before they&#39;re no longer just pets. </p>

<p>An armed rebellion will fuel a police state insofar as a police state has not already been achieved. Fully militarized police forces, with automatic weapons(read: military grade), APCs(MRAPs), full kevlar indicate that the police state is already a thing. It&#39;s actually substantially easier to implement martial law with an unarmed population, which is why it has never lasted longer than several hours, to a day or two in some extreme cases(IE Connecticut).</p>

<p>A greater number of police departments than you may realize actively teach their officers to shoot women, pregnant or otherwise, children, old folks, for holding a gun, via silhouette targets, as well as training in Israel via LEEP(Law Enforcement Exchange Program), teaching officers to treat every civil interaction as though the individual before them is a terrorist/suicide bomber. Hence the 1000 police killings of unarmed civilians last year. </p>

<p>Just so you know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good points, I agree with most everything you said. I have a question though, when you mention a couple days of martial law (I.e. Connecticut), what are you referring to? Did you mean Massachusetts after the Boston Marathon Bombings or are you speaking of some CT event which I am unaware of?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Word, yeah they locked down the area around the school and the crime scene but didn&#39;t lock down the town of Sandy Hook or Newtown. Not saying Sandy Hook wasn&#39;t a totally sketchy manipulated event--because it definitely was. </p>

<p>The lockdown of entire towns surrounding Boston after the Boston Marathon Bombing is probably the best example of our police state imposing scary martial law though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that&#39;s how people within America see it. </p>

<p>From outside America it all seems insane. People keep saying &quot;they are going to take our guns&quot;... and every time the president hints at gun reform all that happens is gun sales go through the roof. Obama is the biggest gun advocate ever... his constant fear mongering but never doing anything only sells MORE guns. </p>

<p>Like explain to me how your government wants to enslave you while at the same time selling you as many guns as you can financially afford to buy? </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t get it.  If they wanted to take your guns they&#39;d have done it by now. They WANT you to have as many guns as possible... as it evident by the fact that they&#39;ll let almost anyone have a gun. </p>

<p>Do I think the gov is moving towards more and more control, yes. Do I think having a gun will protect you from it? Hell no. </p>

<p>The gov knows this as well... the more guns and the more nutjobs shooting up places, the easier it is for them to implement greater and greater control over society in order to &quot;maintain order&quot;. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t capture a nation by capturing its people, you capture it by capturing its government, its money supply, it&#39;s energy resources, it&#39;s food resources, etc. </p>

<p>So the whole &quot;from my cold dead hands&quot; just seems insane to me. It&#39;s like believing that if you have a tin foil hat that will protect you from the government listening to your thoughts. It&#39;s nothing but a false sense of security. </p>

<p>In my opinion anyway. Ultimate, I don&#39;t care if Americans have guns (since I&#39;m not American), it just seems crazy to me from a culture where everyone doesn&#39;t have a gun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the UK I absolutely love this argument.  Do Americans really think an AK and a shotgun will protect them against the U.S. DOD???</p>

<p>The U.S. And nato GIVE guns to Iraqis and other groups of rebels in Middle East countries then blow them up!  Those guys ALL have guns.  Are they winning? </p>

<p>See they have to give them weapons, so they can shoot people and cause trouble and makes themselves look threatening so they can go in and blow them up.</p>

<p>Good luck shooting that drone out of the sky with your glock before hellfire missiles destroy your entire street. </p>

<p>The problems in our world are caused by guns and violence.  Not solved with them.</p>

<p>You know half these pro-gun guys think that shit is realistic. That when the gov comes for them, they&#39;ll slip out the back door and then take out 500 army guys with their gun and steal their tank and shoot the drone out of the sky. </p>
