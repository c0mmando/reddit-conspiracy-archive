    <div class="md"><p>There IS something an individual can do. General boycott. You need things like a roof over your head and food to eat, but all the rest... the netflix, starbux, video games, &#39;going out&#39;, cars, vacations, it is really endless. When an individual chooses to purchase these things they are saying &#39;yeah it sucks, but I want this thing so fuck it&#39;. Period. Not trying to sound like an asshole, but you get what you pay for. We choose to pay for the MIC, the security state, the survellience state not through taxes, but by our willing participation in the overall economy.</p>

<p>General boycott sends a strong clear message right where it needs to go, TPTB&#39;s bottom line. Now that you have your power back (money) you can focus on using it to achive YOUR goals. Instead of pissing the bucks away on shit, install a garden, put in some rain harvesting gear, learn how to take care of yourself/family, not how to purchase solutions.</p>

<p>Even if nothing global ever comes of it, you&#39;ve pretty much guranteed an improvement in the INDIVIDUAL life. Easier said than done,I know. Probably the hardest thing you&#39;ll ever do. Good luck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for boycotts because they do send a serious message. A corporations profits can be hurt pretty bad IF there is focus on that one particular company/industry. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t just stop buying everything. It will have no effect, our bargaining power gets spread too thin. However, if everyone participates a boycott focused on one industry... you better believe they will get the message pretty quick when their shit starts piling up everywhere because no one is buying it and their profits go through the floor. </p>

<p>Netanyahu and Israel laughed at BDS a couple years ago. Now they are in a panic trying to make it illegal and an anti-Semitic crime to boycott Israel. They&#39;re starting to feel the pain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean. Generally, people can just simply stop buying the shit. Lol simple economics. If people are willing to keep paying a certain price for something, then business will never change. If sales radically decline then prices will fall too. But Americans are too lazy and dumb to do without for a change so they find a way rather than to take the tough way out.   </p>

<p><em>California has the strictest emission control regulations in the country, even stricter than the federal government. And our special gas recipe helps keep pollution down.  But it also costs more to produce. On average it adds five to 15 cents to every gallon we buy.  Lisa Margonelli, the author of the book, Oil on the Brain: Petroleum’s Long, Strange Trip to Your Tank, says one of the things we’re paying for in California is cleaner air.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this a city thing?</p>

<p>New York strip is $3.99 lb regular price... Up from $3.49 that I was paying before that gas bubble.</p>

<p>If I wait for a sale it&#39;s $2.49.</p>

<p>For reference of other prices I usually pay $.39/lb for chicken on sale and $1.49 for boneless pork loin.</p>

<p>Prices sure seem down to me!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>a year or 2 after 9/11, there was an article in (i think) vice that showed how drug prices remained exactly the same while every other company rose their prices dramatically. the take-away, was that although importing drugs into the country became much harder, drug dealers were still more fair about pricing than say, walmart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m all for boycotts because they do send a serious message. A corporations profits can be hurt pretty bad IF there is focus on that one particular company/industry. </p>

<p>We can&#39;t just stop buying everything. It will have no effect, our bargaining power gets spread too thin. However, if everyone participates a boycott focused on one industry... you better believe they will get the message pretty quick when their shit starts piling up everywhere because no one is buying it and their profits go through the floor. </p>

<p>Netanyahu and Israel laughed at BDS a couple years ago. Now they are in a panic trying to make it illegal and an anti-Semitic crime to boycott Israel. They&#39;re starting to feel the pain.</p>
