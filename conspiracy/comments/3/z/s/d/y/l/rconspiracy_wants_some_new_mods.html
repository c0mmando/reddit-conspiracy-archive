       Lol like that already isn't happening and has been happening for awhile. Hopefully it's somebody that gives a damn, but knows how not to seem like a whiner. Sometimes r/conspiracy mods seem to interject themselves over petty shit when that looks weak to me. But I don't make the decisions, apparently our brigaded voting system might? I hope not, hopefully they quietly discuss the candidates and then choose.

       Sorry for overlooking that. I agree with you though, not that newer members should be auto-excluded, because shills don't have just one account, they buy them in bulk. All you can do is choose the best from what you know and if shit don't work out, fix it.

       It would be really obvious; each moderator has a pretty unique personality and set of personal interests. The other mods would catch on pretty quickly if two accounts were always supporting each other and trust me, we watch.

       Depends where you are based. The US isnt badly covered at the mo but there is room for improvement. It shouldn't be intensive either, moderation is a team game really with different people covering different times.

       I would be both willing and interested. I am not located in North America though do travel there at times. I misread the 1000 positive karma as 100 and got excited so I am now only continuing this post due to the fact I already started typing and would feel silly if I stopped. I have made use of css but would not call myself an expert. If I can be of any use (I have way too much free time and spend far too much of it fascinated with the wild, wacky, wonderful world of conspiracy theory and fact.) let me know! Otherwise, nice to meet all of you and I hope to see this sub grow ... or at least not die off.

       Hat tossed in. I am a part time writer (working on my first novel) and graphic (print) designer if either of those things help. In the midwest. I am interested in all things conspiracy, but mainly anything concerning environment, social problems, and I love the hell out of a good UFO info leak.

       I would be interested.  I did some work to help bring the Sibel Edmonds AMA to the sub last fall.  The AMA was a bit last-minute, but she wanted to get her message out on
       <a href="http://imgur.com/a/E8BxZ">
        The Hastert Scandal
       </a>
       . In the end, I thought it went very well--Sibel Edmonds got her message out and our sub got a surprise AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also created and mod r/TSBD (which is just a reference area, but does have 300 subscribers)

       EDIT 2: Awesome--thanks to everyone who supported me--I will definitely do my best to help get us some more AMAs..Congrats to the other new mods as well...

       I've tried contacting various people about doing an AMA, but have not received one reply.  I'm not sure if it's because the sub has a image problem or something else.

       One of the many a hater I'm sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eh, being this is 2016 and all, it could be one of the many in the army of bots that's going to grow till there is a 1:1 with users before we any of us realize it's happened. Then it will surpass it. And in a few years time, only people like us here will realize that now the entire internet is nothing but the greatest propaganda machine in history while the rest of the idiots continue to believe the false narrative they imagine their way through every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       But oh wait, if we're all still lucky enough to be alive to have grandkids, we can tell them how WE were on the first website/place/whatever that allowed early AI to be trained with really life Guinea pigs in the art of manipulating the human narrative. This work being done here and in other online portals will with other factors evolve into real life AI. Or should I say with AI having the ability to interface with humans in a way that convinces us. AI will surpass us for no other reason in that it can evolve in ways, go places, and do things we will never be able to. The weakness that our type of life form suffers from is length of time to evolve. That will be the problem when face to face with an AI that is equal to our intelligence and ability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who has not accepted that once we cross a certain threshold with AI that their will be no going back...read and learn about the world my friends. When AI can do all that we can in every way without our assistance, how do we now tell them "well hey now guys your not alive, you can't take control of the earth like we have over all other beings of this planet! Only we humans have that right!" Something to think about!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know. I always try to look at the bright side...least it will be a good story if anyone is alive or free enough to tell it.

       Hard to believe, but a lot of people haven't been on reddit...Most people only have a certain amount of time and often spend it on facebook, twitter, instagram, etc...Marketers know reddit is a good place to create a buzz, but this sub is more about spreading Truth and becoming aware of theories. Hopefully, this sub will continue to grow and we can attract more authors/journalists, etc...

       Thanks. I've been here for far longer than this account. I change it up (thanks NSA). I like this account and you know what, fuck the NSA! I feel I'd be a fair mod and would love to throw my hat in, but I guess rules are rules. I mod on a sub with mods here, but my "account" is too young....

       I know my way around automoderator (set up all the automatic flairing and hotword lists for flairs in Nexus5), and am pretty good at trial and error. (In a seperate testing sub of course)
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont see modding as a job, but when my green M comes on i speak as if i were a representative for a company. I dont like fights, not over the internet or IRL, and always try to solve things well. When things become personal (i.e. a user disagreeing with my ways) i always ask the other mods for input.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, im a techie in general. I dont know CSS (but could start learning it, i do better when i have a goal to do so).

       Modding this subreddit is something that tends to require daily vigilance in order to keep track of the varying personalities on the sub, and how they interact; which means it tends to be a bit time intensive as you get the feel for how the place tends to run, but it becomes easier over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new queue averages 3-10 posts per minute throughout the day, and the modqueue usually will have 75-100 items over 24 hours (these are user reported comments/submissions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once/twice per month there will be a controversy which requires longer attention by the mods, usually involving the admins or a situation that walks the gray line of the reddit rules. This can require a few hours per day during that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, it's not something that can really be quantified as it can't be viewed in that manner. It's a commitment to put the community first, and be there when other's are too busy or otherwise preoccupied. You have to more than love reddit. You have to actually
       <em>
        care
       </em>
       about it.

       I'm not sure where my future with this subreddit will fall (and I'm not throwing my hat in the ring as my mod position is being discussed), but I want to implore users to be careful during the vetting process.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been users in the past who got a mod spot, and then used their influence to attempt to ban
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1rv28k/guidelines_update_moving_redditrelated/">
        any posts which reported on censorship around reddit
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This subreddit also garners a lot of attention from groups of moderators who would love to undermine the policies of free flowing information which are viewed as "the last vesitgies of an ancient reddit". (there's a reason
       <a href="/u/mr_dong">
        /u/mr_dong
       </a>
       put
       <a href="/u/aaronsw">
        /u/aaronsw
       </a>
       on the side bar.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods of this sub are intelligent and well versed in most of these tricks, but they can do little if users do not spend time vetting the candidates proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a subreddit that serves as a vital replacement for the catch-all that was
       <a href="/r/reddit.com">
        /r/reddit.com
       </a>
       , and, in fact, when other subreddits close/have issues, this is often the first sub that most users will visit; to that end, ensuring the free flow of information is viewed as canon is paramount; and with the way that reddit moderation works (even on this sub) it is of vital importance that anyone added to the mod list will not attempt to undermine the fundamental principle of free speech which pervades throughout this subreddit.

       I'd be willing to take on the task. I currently reside in NA and have been active on this sub for 3 years at least. I think what would set me apart from others is that I'm naturally skeptical and I don't generally jump to conclusions about particular issues. Creating an open forum that promotes free speech with order and respect for all would be on of my top priorities, next to not succumbing to outside influences.

       Yes that's the correct link, I can't help you if you don't see how he's getting called out, as that user explained the situation very well indeed.  I remember at the time being shocked by the comments.

       My approach is to try to help people who haven't got much time/interest to read articles to be able to get the info within one sentence, if I'm confident from my other research to add in some info then I do it.  It's a form of journalism, it's used against all the time by our enemies, that's because it's highly effective.  They'll add a smear into a heading for example.  Even the word 'Terrorism' is being used as a term of propaganda.

       Most likely because people haven't got time to read through it and work out what it means.  It was also being kept out of view by the usual suspects i.e. 57%.  To counter the downvote censors I had to create a better title, so as their downvotes wouldn't keep it out of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by adding in that Zuckerberg almost certainly has close relations with the secret services, we help people to connect the dots.  If people ask for separate sources for that then they are provided.

       It's all about whose team people play for when the going gets tough, we need all the help we can get here now, so if we have to think up a good title to get enough upvotes to counter the censors, we need our fellow team to back us up, not put the dagger in at such a crucial moment.

       The shills are only effective if people don't know exactly how they steer discussion and how common they are. As of right now, very few people know the full extent of the shill situation. One way to solve that problem is to spread the subreddit
       <a href="/r/Shills">
        /r/Shills
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the mods think of banning them as approaching a "slippery slope," so they just let it be. Who knows. The best we can do is spread the information and let people figure it out from there.

       One way to attack the shill problem (admitting that it can be hard to tell a shill from the merely willfully ignorant) within the parameters of the current rules, is to more vigorously enforce the rule against attacking the sub or its users.  Time after time, users supporting the official story (on whatever topic) are hostile, insulting and sarcastic, while steadfastly refusing to examine the obvious contradictions in the story put forth by the mainstream media.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub exists to question the official narrative.  The world is already awash in the views put forth by the NY Times, CNN, MSNBC, etc.  We don't need more of that here, especially when delivered with over the top hostility.

       Since a lot of the really good active posters can't offer their services because their accounts are inconveniently young... I will! I'm just some guy with almost no real qualifications aside from browsing the new queue and occasionally reporting some bullshit. I make very little commentary, nor do I have an agenda to push/have pushed. I mostly just read, and really bring nothing awesome to the table. Sounds great, amirite?

       <a href="/u/bloodwillow">

       for well over half my life.  They woke me up, and without them, I would not be the woman I am today.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I would not state this if I did not believe it.  I have been on reddit since close to it's inception, and I have seen how the site as a whole, and even more so
       <a href="/r/conspriacy">
        /r/conspriacy
       </a>
       have been manipulated and downtrodden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bloodwillow will bring a truth and honesty to this position that is sorely needed IMO.  He researches topics in depth, and does not take what is on the surface for truth, even if, and many times when, it's a hard truth to swallow.  He also comes from a place of respect for life and other humans, and does not let himself get drawn in to the downward spiral of drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that said, I think he would be a great addition to your team. AMA if you have any questions on his integrity or anything else.

        Funny little side note. My wife had never witnessed a UFO until driving with my son a few years ago. What they both saw sounds fascinating, as it occurred in broad daylight on a busy street. If you would like to ask her about it her name is
        <a href="/u/Haven">
         /u/Haven
        </a>
        . They both tell me that it was ovoid/spherical in shape, metallic in appearance, and hovering over treetops. My son said he got such a close look at the object that he could see plating of the metal. His exact quote was that “It looked like the Death Star from Star Wars.”

       I think it's important to understand who are active mods in the lineup. I can name a few but it seems other are just on the list that don't really moderate the sub. I know
       <a href="/u/flytape">
        /u/flytape
       </a>
       is the most active and glad someone is managing this sub. I think the inactive mods either need to step up or resign. It's simple math.

       Interested, as always.

       Thank you again,
       <a href="/u/mr_dong">
        /u/mr_dong
       </a>
       , for the Owl flair
       <strong>
        two years ago
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been an active member of this community for years, have moderator experience with cultivating
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       over the past year (where we have gone toe-to-toe with both the TMOR crew as well as admins), as well as private modmail subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have boasted at least two stickies this year on this sub (which I can dig up upon request), and have exposed the SITE Intelligence Group, ISIS propaganda, as well as the USA Freedom Act, the FCCs Open Internet Rule regarding Net Neutrality, CISA/CISPA, and the TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google searches of my username will show countless posts and referrals, and some of my content has been rehosted on other sites (without my permission, such as investmentwatch or something).
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not been banned by any other subs and have positive standing in all defaults for awareness spreading, treat
       <em>
        all users with respect
       </em>
       , and have comments in the defaults with multiple guildings to boast as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you and the community consider this application despite plenty of users here who certainly deserve recognition and consideration.

       New job has me working 12 hour shifts - with one week being heavy (4 shifts) and another being light (2.5 shifts).

       I can check in of course - but only superficial lurking typically.

       Is there going to be an official subscriber vote for mod positions? Hopefully it can be carried out in a way that it can't be gamed.

       I'm interested primarily because, as it stands, the shills and conspiratard crowd have over run the place.  In post after post, the top comment is some variation on:  "You wacko nut jobs who believe every conspiracy is true, get a life and move out of your mom's basement."
      </p>
      <p>
       While those posting intelligent, reasoned comments showing real evidence that nobody died at Sandy Hook (for example) get heavily downvoted.  The sincere
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       users are being run out of town.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, there need to be more warnings and more bannings, so good discussions can take place between genuine researchers, without ad hominem attacks from 3 day old accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all those who want to continue to trash the place will downvote this.

       I've been trying to get on this lately but it's a slippery slope and we need to be careful.  Brand new accounts that are trolling are instantly banned in almost all cases once I/we see them though.

       I'm with you man.  reddit as a whole is in its death throes I think, and that spills over to all subs.  Won't be long before it'll all be over-run with bots posting bullshit and trolling - if we aren't at that point already.

       "Controversial" is a decent option.  A lot of the posts that show up from it are shit and were downvoted for a reason but you'll also find some with fierce debate or which have tons of great comments yet were buried in downvotes.

       What's slippery about it? If someone violates the rules, that should be a strike - Regardless of who said it or how old their account is.

       That means a lot from you my man. It's good to hear.

       Truth be told, I've spent far too much time on it - and it didn't come out
       <em>
        as I wanted
       </em>
       , but it's probably what
       <em>
        I needed
       </em>
       , and it's a crazy mix if classroom and community where if the only rule is to ignore the user and attack the argument - a syste where inteligent and respectful debate are the only thing to come for, what develops in a system made of
       <em>
        conspiracy nuts
       </em>
       leads to very interesting results.

      <p>
       You see it all the time, someone disagrees, that person gets called a shill and a shitfight ensues. It's a total ad hominem and whilst the word has a functional purpose, it's abused in just about every case barring the very few.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to mention bad rules? Have a look at rule 2, that's a bad rule.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       But breaking the rules is just going to get your post removed by the mods when they're not on holiday, which seems to happen

       nah they were supporting monsato 24/7 that is paid troll proof. plus like I said bad rule anyway. this is a big boy board, look at those dumb rules they all get broken. and I think they are getting new mods as an excuse to put more paid trolls in mod positions. this sub is getting killed like rest of reddit. it's fine I unsubsubscribed but am replying to you for who knows what reason. bye.

      <p>
       So you're not allowed to have a strong opinion on something without being a paid troll? I don't see how posting a lot about something is proof of anything, much less being paid to post about said thing. And what would being paid to post in r/conspiracy accomplish anyway? Many users here are notorious for sticking to their easily debunkable delusions, even though the only "proof" they have of their nonsense is some random guy rambling on YouTube, which is apparently the gold standard of proof around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're just going to call people shills/paid trolls with no proof for no other reason than because they post about things you don't like, you're part of what's wrong with this subreddit.

       It was top all day votewise, getting lots of publicity, getting completely bombarded by external attackers.  It is times like that when we need to stick together, but instead you pulled a dagger out at that key moment in full public display.  None of the other mods would have done that.  You helped the enemy that day, their agenda was to make it appear that there was a consensus that the link was debunked, you helped them create that illusion.  This sub is heavily under attack, we all need to help our team-mates or we will lose.  At this moment you have a lot to learn and much trust to gain before you could be viewed as mod-worthy material.  Any new mod here needs to have a long and almost flawless history.

       My approach is to try to help people who haven't got much time/interest to read articles to be able to get the info within one sentence, if I'm confident from my other research to add in some info then I do it.  It's a form of journalism, it's used against all the time by our enemies, that's because it's highly effective.  They'll add a smear into a heading for example.  Even the word 'Terrorism' is being used as a term of propaganda.

       Most likely because people haven't got time to read through it and work out what it means.  It was also being kept out of view by the usual suspects i.e. 57%.  To counter the downvote censors I had to create a better title, so as their downvotes wouldn't keep it out of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by adding in that Zuckerberg almost certainly has close relations with the secret services, we help people to connect the dots.  If people ask for separate sources for that then they are provided.

       I haven't been as active on Reddit as of late but as that's more from a tendency to lurk more often than post, I
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       consider a mod position. Though I definitely back
       <a href="/u/smokinbluebear">

       and
       <a href="/u/cojoco">

       (if he wants it) as prime choices and more a priority than myself.

       Thanks, I didn't put my name forward last round as I didn't have any meaningful modding experience and was a lot busier with work, that's why I stopped modding highstrangeness ultimately. I'm working part-time from home again now and could definitely dedicate some time to modding here if there's an opening.

       I'll do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, be careful with user names that have numbers at the end or underscores. Analyze those users more carefully if you make one of those a mod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again not all peeps with underscores or numbers at the end are baaaaad. I'm just thrown off at how many underscore user names and numbers at the end are applying to be mods which furthers my theory on them.

      <p>
       Just do a double comb through on those applicants.

       I'm a long-time redditor and contributor/commenter on this subreddit. I am English, and live in the UK and am active here several times during the day, notably from 9am - 2pm GMT (which is 4am - 9am EST).

      <p>
       I passionately believe in this sub, and its ethos of allowing free thinking, even when this takes us in uncomfortable directions and/or to unpopular conclusions. I believe
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would be compromised if it ever published a list of "forbidden" conspiracy theories, and I commend the active mods for standing firm on this, and their work in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, as I have said before, I do think the mod team should be tougher on the haters and disruptors who come here to antagonise users  and denigrate their ideas. This is sub needs protecting, and that means more (active) mods.

       Well, I'm sure you know Israel is loaded with conspiracy and has everything to do with why the world is the way it is today going back to Rothschilds, The Balfour Declaration and events that predate that even.
      </p>
      <p>
       You just can't label every post that involves Israel or Jews as a "political view", therefor its not conspiracy and not allowed. That is precisely the kind of thinking r/conspiracy does not need.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's your choice...if you see a post about Israel or Jewish conspiracy, don't read it if it bothers you or better yet, why not join the debate and express your point of view against the other commenters.

         There is a very obvious line between all the Anti-Israel &amp; Anti-Jewish posts and the genuine conspiracy posts. More than 90% of the "anti-Israel" posts does not even qualify as conspiracies, even in the most remote sense of the word, which automatically disqualifies them from the r/conspiracy forum in the first place.

         I am asking the Moderators to do their bloody job, no more no less, and ain't gonna sugar coat it. In r/politics you post about political issues. In r/conspiracy you post about conspiracies, not about politics+religion+Israel. The Conspiracy forum has rules, it would be nice if the Moderator actually followed them! You could of cause device a conspiracy theory about Israel or the Jews, but that is not what we are seeing here in the vast majority of cases.

       Modern Political Zionism began as a conspiracy -
       <strong>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Zionist_Congress">
         initiated in 1897
        </a>
       </strong>
       , and engineered and orchestrated by a small group of extremely wealthy and politically powerful European Jews - to create a "Jewish Homeland" in Palestine. The task they set before themselves was utterly monumental, as it required laying their hands on the real estate (then under control of the Ottoman Empire, who was utterly opposed to the scheme) and somehow managing to populate the region with hordes of warm Jewish bodies (most Jews were ALSO utterly opposed to the scheme).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Zionists were determined, and 50 years later (after several revolutions and two world wars), the Zionists managed to achieve their goal.
       <strong>
        Israel is the fruit of that conspiracy
       </strong>
       , and it is ongoing, as by its very nature, the Zionist State was born incompatible with its neighbors, and has been in constant turmoil since the Zionist Conquest began. Israel relies and has always relied on support from external "allies" to prop-up its existence, and to deal with its enemies, so it in turn relies on the ceaseless efforts of Zionist-minded Jews, living outside of Israel, to influence the foreign policies of these "allies" to serve Israeli interests - which are often INCOMPATIBLE with the interests of the "allied nations" and their peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure that you would LOVE to see all discussions regarding the machinations of Israel and its Zionist Minions silenced here - so would many other people. In fact, I would venture to say that the majority of the sworn enemies of this sub are primarily motivated by their hatred of such discussion.

        </em>
       </strong>
       ??? I suppose it is

        if
       </strong>
       the political entity
       <strong>
        is itself racist

       , being founded on purely
       <strong>

       <strong>

       I suppose one

       see opposition to such a political entity as "
       <em>

       3) I don't like fascists, which is why I have often criticized the Communists, Nazis, Zionists and religious organisation like the Hamas, Fatah and Hezbollah. In general I also don't fancy ideologies or organized religion. But I have never bought into the whole "Zionists control the world" theories.

       Zionism is an extremely powerful and politically influential force that uses deceptive and subversive strategies to achieve its self-centered goals.  This must be recognized and dealt with if we non-Zionists wish to preserve our own interests. This is not racism, on the contrary, it is anti-racist.

         And you can be racist all you want, I don't mind, but it shouldn't be on the conspiracy forum, find yourself some obscure Reddit sub-Forum where stuff like that is both allowed and appreciated. It is like the difference between the toilet and the living room, they have different purposes.

         I still haven't in any way, shape or form written or told you about my stance on Israel, Jews or the Arabs. Those are your somewhat crazy assumptions, not mine. And you can't tell what I think or assume, before I tell you about it. Mkay!

       I am not offended that you call me crazy. I hope that you will not be offended when I say that your knee-jerk reactions are close-minded and ignorant. :-) Zionists have played a massive (and little known) role in the history of both the 20th and 21st Centuries - a major factor in the outcome of WW1, the run-up to WW2, the staging of the Bolshevik Revolution, the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the "Western" attacks on Iraq, on Libya, on Syria, and much, much more. This is not conjecture. The fact that you may not be aware of these roles is not surprising, as the Zionists do not want their dirty history exposed, and actively suppress any efforts to do so.

       The shoe often fits. If you take objection, I suggest that you either ignore those posts that you find offensive, or, as another gent suggested earlier, hop into the discussion and help to dispel those ideas that you feel are being portrayed unfairly.

       I would love to be a conspiracy mod because I'm very experienced in dealing with conspiracies. From the age of 12 I suspected that my parents weren't my real parents and it turned out that I was right. They tried to censor all of the information but I managed to uncover the truth... eventually. I had to do some things that I didn't want to do but that's the point, I'm committed to the truth and fighting censorship, even if it's my own parents. I'll stop at nothing and no one to fight with you. Sometimes the admins remind me of my parents will all of their lies and censorship. I can't wait to take them down too.

Yes, I'm rather old to be hanging out with you wide-eyed whippersnappers here on Reddit, but have extensive insider knowledge of all sorts of conspiracies, starting with the JFK assassination (after all, I learned from the best from an early age [

       Mods, or sycophants? You have a mod that posts "irrefutable!!!!" crap weekly. It's all refutable, and makes this sub look horrible. Do you want more of that? That's what you are asking for until you clean that "let's make the sub look bad" crap.

       Full transparency; I am a little biased here.  I have known
       <a href="/u/bloodwillow">
        /u/bloodwillow
       </a>
       for well over half my life.  They woke me up, and without them, I would not be the woman I am today.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I would not state this if I did not believe it.  I have been on reddit since close to it's inception, and I have seen how the site as a whole, and even more so
       <a href="/r/conspriacy">
        /r/conspriacy
       </a>
       have been manipulated and downtrodden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bloodwillow will bring a truth and honesty to this position that is sorely needed IMO.  He researches topics in depth, and does not take what is on the surface for truth, even if, and many times when, it's a hard truth to swallow.  He also comes from a place of respect for life and other humans, and does not let himself get drawn in to the downward spiral of drama.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that said, I think he would be a great addition to your team. AMA if you have any questions on his integrity or anything else.

       But you're based in the UK and this is something that the current team need. You're also a trusted contributor with a clean posting history.

       My approach is to try to help people who haven't got much time/interest to read articles to be able to get the info within one sentence, if I'm confident from my other research to add in some info then I do it.  It's a form of journalism, it's used against all the time by our enemies, that's because it's highly effective.  They'll add a smear into a heading for example.  Even the word 'Terrorism' is being used as a term of propaganda.

       Before posting the thread that went viral, I posted this, on the same topic, it went nowhere.

       Most likely because people haven't got time to read through it and work out what it means.  It was also being kept out of view by the usual suspects i.e. 57%.  To counter the downvote censors I had to create a better title, so as their downvotes wouldn't keep it out of view.

       So by adding in that Zuckerberg almost certainly has close relations with the secret services, we help people to connect the dots.  If people ask for separate sources for that then they are provided.

       So you're not allowed to have a strong opinion on something without being a paid troll? I don't see how posting a lot about something is proof of anything, much less being paid to post about said thing. And what would being paid to post in r/conspiracy accomplish anyway? Many users here are notorious for sticking to their easily debunkable delusions, even though the only "proof" they have of their nonsense is some random guy rambling on YouTube, which is apparently the gold standard of proof around here.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're just going to call people shills/paid trolls with no proof for no other reason than because they post about things you don't like, you're part of what's wrong with this subreddit.
