    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s not about race.  Jews are &quot;God&#39;s Chosen People&quot; and have been a nation without a nation, but now they have a nation again.  </p>

<p>They run the world&#39;s currency systems with the exception of a few small countries.  They run US and world news and entertainment (propoganda) and for most purposes, create the narrative which keeps the military industrial complex running.  Look at that National debt.  That debt is brought about by the fed and their entertainment divisions keeping the masses enslaved to materialism and violent &quot;nation building&quot;.  </p>

<p>Back to 1930s Germany, Hitler cut off the central bankers and removed themselves from control of the Rothschild cabal.  They lost that war, and were punished with an absolutely crippling current National debt.  </p>

<p>Entertainment and News (propoganda) and the Fed (debt slavery) is the answer to your questions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct that people do segregate themselves, but the segregation that truly matters is that of class.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve served in the melting pot known as the U.S. Marines.  All walks of life are represented.  Want to know the dividing line in the Marines?  It isn&#39;t race, it is class.  Non-NCO, NCO and SNCO for enlisted and then company-grade officers, field-grade officers and general officers for commissioned officers.  Has nothing to do with race, the only thing that matters is what rank a Marine is.  White, black, Arab, Hispanic...it doesn&#39;t matter.  Line them up, at any color, E-1 through 0-10, and who is most important is determined by class.  A General, because of his rank (class) is hands-down more important than everyone lined up beside him, even if he is black and everyone else is white.  </p>

<p>People fall for the &#39;us&#39; vs. &#39;them&#39; when it comes to race, which allows those who want to pit the lower classes of people against one another so they don&#39;t focus so much on the people that occupy the upper class levels.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesnt mean we are not equal.... Clearly we are all different but theres a difference between recognizing that and, for example, believing black people are more inherent to violence. Whatever biodiversity we have doesnt change the fact that every human basically wants the same things for themselves and their family. Your respect for individuals should be a blank slate to be filled in with specific experiences for that individual rather than a predetermined thought based off of race or skin color.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re just saying that you stop recognizing human biodiversity and the differences between people when it makes you uncomfortable. I refuse to do this in my quest for the truth. Who could deny that east Asians obviously naturally have high IQs and outperform everyone, everywhere, on IQ tests, SATs, etc. Everyone is comfortable with this idea. But if one group is the smartest there must be a group who is the least intelligent, right? Science does not respect the polite boundaries instituted by PC culture, that is why, as I stated above, this is usually the roughest part of unconditioning.</p>

<p>I respect everyone. Respect should not neccesitate disengaging from reality.</p>

I know a black kid raised in rural new england who does not act violent or try to rap or whatever stereotype your have.How can you not see it is the society that mostly molds you? I dont think its me trying be comfortable, its you... You are not used to other societies so you need to fill in the void with stereotypes for ALL of a race. People are to be judged as an individual.

    <div class="md"><p>Your evidence is anecdotal. The science shows that if a white family adopts an east Asian baby, statistically those children will still have their IQ cluster with other east Asians. I implore you to look past what you&#39;ve been told into the facts and science of the matter. Just considering the implications of Darwinism for human races should be enough if you actually really sit down and think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Darwin, evolution, and basic biology. If you search for facts about human biodiversity you will find them. Are you suggesting genes don&#39;t correlate to intelligence? Are you suggesting people of the same race don&#39;t have similar genes? I&#39;m not saying race creates a person 100%, I&#39;m just saying it has some effect.</p>

<p>Seriously, how is it possible with what we know about Darwinism that all humans, regardless of the natural selection and evolution their sub-species faced, are exactly the same? It is literally as unscientific as creationism. Please answer this question directly.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t see it because you&#39;ve been trained not to. We see differences between the races but attribute it to racism. That is only one factor. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to gather all the studies but they are out there. People have asked this question and gotten a scary answer so its kept silent. Even wikipedia, for example, plainly states that different races have different average IQs. This cannot only be attributed to racism, income, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If generations of white people or asian people were ghettoized i guarantee their educational averages would go down because of those factors... Do you think a poor asian farmer is naturally smarter than a poor white or poor black farmer? for the benefit of discussion lets say none of these farmers focused on education and dont know much beyond their farming and they were all raised lower middle class in rural montana. Do you believe that the asian farmer would naturally be able to study better and perform better on an IQ test? I dont understand your conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asian people were ghettoized. We basically enslaved Chinese people to build the railroad and we took everything from Japanese families and put them in camps while some US citizens were still alive, only 70 years ago. Their IQs did not drop and they still outperform white people in their own nation in terms of income, IQ, low levels of crime, etc.</p>

<p>Yes, the average poor East Asian farmer would have a higher IQ than the average poor sub Saharan African farmer. This is an observable reality. Black people in nations like England have the same average IQ as in America, despite the fact that they were not enslaved there in large numbers. Part of it is genetics.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect myself to convince you. It&#39;s your choice to look open mindedly into the science and reality or believe the picture of smiles and rainbows and equality painted for us in school all those years.

<p>You don’t need to say it.

    <div class="md"><p>Race exists, but it matters not one whit where it regards the respect, the honor, and the dignity that evolved beings should ultimately extend toward one another.</p>

<p>That’s all <em>I’m</em> saying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It does not make me asleep to recognize the scientific fact of human biodiversity and its logical implications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does, however, show that you are very much asleep in not recognizing the extent to which none of what you mentioned ultimately matters where it regards an ability to look beyond such superficialities and unite as one <em>species</em> together toward a common cause.</p>

<p>As such, yes.  You are, unfortunately, very much asleep.  You have been rendered somnambulistic by a level of societal conditioning you&#39;re probably not even aware you’ve been subjected to - one designed to keep humanity apart, divided, at odds with one another, and as such, very much conquered as a species.</p>
