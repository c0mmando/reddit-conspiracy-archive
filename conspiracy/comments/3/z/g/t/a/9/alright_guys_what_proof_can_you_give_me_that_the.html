    <div class="md"><p>this is the theory that makes me most happy. it was the most amazing change for me. to live my whole life never ever thinking I had anything to question about that we are on a spinning globe. and now -- i see what a fallacy it is. it is the most amazing paradigm shift. it honestly feels incredible to relinquish those wrong-assumptions that I never thought I even had cause to question. </p>

<p>once you kind of open yourself up to evidence the many many ways you can prove it just pile up -- but it&#39;s the first few things that are the biggest hurdle - and I think they vary for individual. I think it&#39;s often -- what is that given person&#39;s expertise -- what do they &quot;know&quot; that they can use to challenge what they are taught. </p>

<p>for me it was (because I have a background in fine art)  what the vanishing point is.  I&#39;d been reading up a bit on the flat earth theory - I knew the basics of the argument and I was curious to consider the ideas but I hadn&#39;t felt the truth of it yet. I went to a place where they have a foucoults pendulum to get a look at it for myself and ask some questions I had come to have about it (for the record that thing is a huge lie unto itself - -very easy to disprove that it proves the earth spins , -- but because disproving proof isn&#39;t proof of the counter argument -- it was only a curiosity at that point) ----after the pendulum research  I wondered around and looked at lots of displays and placards of info -- and then I came to these animated dioramas. </p>

<p>they were supposed to illustrate ancient people observing the sun rise and sun set. you could just look inside the display and watch the sun move across the sky up and down and the sky get dark and bright. the people were the size of green army men - to give scale. </p>

<p>and as I looked at the sun rise and set in the displays for a few moments I had the most amazing sensation/realization/change in my understanding of everything. </p>

<p>the sun is not going down it is going away. it is following the exact path (in our view) of an object receding from view but staying at the same height. </p>

<p>when you look straight down a very long hallway for example the ceiling seems to go down as it goes further away from you. but if you walked the length of the hallway you would see the ceiling was the same height the whole way down. every visual artist knows -- the floor and ceiling, ground and sky meet at a distance because of how your eye sees - not because the ground and the sky actually meets. so when an object in the sky appears to go down it may actually only be receding from view.  as if it is rolling down that hallway ceiling.</p>

<p>I looked at the sun in those dioramas setting and rising over and over again -- something you cant observe consistently in it&#39;s totality in normal life -- I looked at the shape of the line the sun was making as it went up and down. and I knew  the sun was receding only. and only vanishing because it was escaping our line of sight, not because it was literally going down. the sun is surpassing the vanishing point when it &quot;sets&quot;, the vanishing point is not the edge of the earth it is how far our eye can see. these are two very different things and they are understood to be two different things in perspective drawing, which is the two dimensional mapping of how our eye sees in the three dimensional world. once you apply that knowledge to how we observe the movement of the sun - wow. </p>

<p>well - at first I thought I knew it could be either way. actually. at first I thought we would get the exact same moving image either way, if the sun was going down or away -- and then I realized - no we wouldn&#39;t. because we already know it&#39;s going away, -- we believe it&#39;s receding and going down. but -- but the rate of it&#39;s &quot;fall&quot; visually speaking it should be faster if it was both receding and going down - it should look like it&#39;s going down the steep part of a slide from our perspective in the latter portion of the day - not keep it&#39;s &quot;you can set your clock by it&quot; steady rate. receding and only receding is what is necessary to make it move at the pace it is moving and at the angle(s) it&#39;s moving. </p>

<p>and at that moment - walking out of that science building -   i just knew. the sun never sets. not the way we think it does. it just goes beyond our line of vision. the earth is flat. those freaking nuts on the internet are absolutely right, at least in large part.  I do not know why or how the earth is flat. but wow am I ever curious. when I stood on the big lawn -- overlooking the city - ocean in distance -- I could see it in the world. I could see what I realized - I always should have realized. the sun never truly goes down and under us. it always stays above, and we are not a spinning ball, at least in no way as it has been described to us. the world we know and occupy is a flat surface, the most basic observations of the sun, with consideration to how the human eye sees, show this must be the case. it&#39;s so simple, all this time we forgot to factor in how the human eye sees. and I could have gone my whole life and missed it and most do. amazing. I feel so freaking lucky to have stumbled on those &quot;wacky&quot; videos and watched them &quot;just for fun&quot;, I never would have thought to ask those question otherwise. what a freaking gift. </p>

<p>next I thought about the ocean, and water. and I considered that the surface of still water is always perpendicular to a plumb line, and all plumb lines are parallel with each other -- </p>

<p>Many months later I&#39;m still realizing new evidence all the time &amp; /i&#39;m still in awe and thrilled about it. </p>

<p>This is the question.  Flat earth presents many problems with the official spinning globe model, but offers a flawed alternative model.  It is presented as a choice between these two models so that when you see the problems with the flat model you forgive the unresolved issues with the spinning globe.</p>

<p>There are other possibilities.  I think the concave model is correct.  Your comment shows that you actually looked into the flat earth model and identified problems with it.  Try the same approach with concave.  This is a good place to start:  <a href="http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/">http://www.wildheretic.com/concave-earth-theory/</a></p>

<p>A conspiracy theory relevant to the Flat Earth Fiction would be that it&#39;s an organized disinfo campaign intended to neutralize the conspiracy theorist movement.
