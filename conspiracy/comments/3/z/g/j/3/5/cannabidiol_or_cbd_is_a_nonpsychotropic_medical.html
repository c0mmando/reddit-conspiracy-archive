        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>One thing I find aggravating is the fact that CBD oil was available for sale on amazon a year or two ago, and now it&#39;s gone.  Why?  I thought it was legal?  Oh. I just found this. Apparently it&#39;s only legal in <a href="http://www.celebstoner.com/news/marijuana-news/2014/03/13/four-states-on-verge-of-passing-cbd-only-laws/">15 states</a>.  </p>

<p>This is very strange because I thought CBD was not federally controlled (ie: not on the DEA schedule), so only cannabis-derived CBD was illegal as it would likely contain minute amounts of THC.  This is how they are able to continue to sell hemp-oil which contains CBD, federally. </p>

<p>Is CBD too far removed from delta9THC to fall under the analogue-act?  If so, it&#39;s non-psychotropic, so then everything else that&#39;s non-psychotropic in cannabis would also be illegal along with endocannabinoids produced in your brain, which means all sorts of other substances in for example butter would be illegal too by transitive equality.  I thought the line was drawn with <em>psychotropic substances</em> as outlined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances">UN 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances</a>, to inform country policy on what <em>was</em> and <em>was not</em> or <em>what should</em> or <em>what should not</em> be deemed <em>unlawful</em> or society-threatening.   </p>

<p>This whole CBD thing is a mess.  But it&#39;s getting messier:</p>

<p>As pointed <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> out, <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3zflr6/govt_targeting_nuns_for_making_thcfree_cbd_oilin/">the government is targetting nuns for making CBD oil in a state where cannabis is legal</a>.  Think about it -- why they would do that?</p>

<p>The establishment is fighting back against a non-psychotropic and therefore non-abusable drug derived from cannabis--<em>Cannabidiol</em> or commonly referred to as <strong><em>CBD</em></strong>.  Why are they fighting it?  </p>

<p>Several reasons.  </p>

<p>Primarly because it <em>works</em>, which I will irrefutably demonstrate below using the establishment&#39;s own work as sole evidence.  (This kind of research is just too easy, all it takes is time, formatting and the right keywords.  google.com&amp;query?=site:nih.gov cannabidiol -- yes, it&#39;s that easy and even a goof like myself can do it.)  And given the irrefutable fact of CBD actually working, they know this will disintermediate the profits of the pharmaceutical, medical insurance, pharmacy-lobbying, military-defense industries.</p>

<p>Without going into too-long a discussion of how the pharmaceutial industry&#39;s pillmongering helps the insurance industry and military-industrial complex, suffice it to say that despite the spending and loss involved in paying for clients&#39;/civilians&#39; pills, these spendings only serve to justify an even greater coverage of said spending/loss.  This means to the insurance industry, greatly increased premiums to maintain even higher rates of revenue.  Whereas to the military, this means asking for larger congressional budget for continued occupation of Afghanistan which then acts as a catalyst to ever more power, backchannel bribery and covert drug-dealing in the dubious shadows of the overt, legit dealings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll cut the crap.  <em>This is about heroin and painkillers</em>, a hundreds of billion dollars a year industry.  Competing with them.  Making them irrelevant and without causing addictions or creating permanent customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Secondarily, it&#39;s about curing cancer, epilepsy and a host of other medical concerns.  </p>

<p>Tertiarily, it&#39;s about control and not letting people be in charge of their own health with a powerful OTC supplement that actually works for so many things, because that would cause them not to go to the doctor as often or use as many pharma pills.  </p>

<p>Quaternarily?, it&#39;s about KONTROL--they don&#39;t want to cross that slipperly slope of giving people <em>even the idea of using herbs to heal themselves, because then they&#39;d start to question the whole authoritative hierarchies of medical control that would have us give up our power over ourselves to them, forever, only trusting what *they have to say, never ourselves</em>.  Only doing what <em>they want us to do, even if it hurts or even kills us</em>.  They don&#39;t want to go down that road so they viciously attack anything that sounds like this straight away, and try to destroy it as quickly as it starts to show up, <em>like a cancer</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our empowerment in self-healing is cancer to them.</p>

<p><strong><em>Here&#39;s how we know &gt;&gt;&gt;</em></strong></p>

<h4>It&#39;s not a street drug, is non-psychotropic and thus can&#39;t be abused</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25801536">Cannabidiol, a Major <strong><em>Non-Psychotropic Cannabis Constituent</em></strong> Enhances Fracture Healing and Stimulates Lysyl Hydroxylase Activity in Osteoblasts.</a> -- forget the fact that it heals bone fractures, take from this that they said themselves at <strong><em>NIH</em></strong> that CBD is <em>nonpsychotropic.</em>  That is <strong><em>point #1.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Point #2 is that <em>NIH also soundly and properly demonstrated it has acceptable medical uses below</em> in many different areas <em>proving it is</em> <strong><em>not</em></strong> <em>a substance with no medical use</em>, and that CBD is a naturally-occurring molecule in an unaltered plant that is therefore unpatentable, which means it cannot be evaluated as a prescription nor can it be thus prescribed.  This makes it an OTC supplement, which it should legally remain, <em>unless the Federal Government wishes to contradict itself, betraying a deep corruption for everyone to plainly witness</em>:</p>

<h4>Cancer</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579246/">Cannabidiol as potential anticancer drug</a> -- &quot;Collectively, the non-psychoactive plant-derived cannabinoid CBD exhibits pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative actions in different types of tumours and may also exert anti-migratory, anti-invasive, anti-metastatic and perhaps anti-angiogenic properties. On the basis of these results, evidence is emerging to suggest that CBD is a potent inhibitor of both cancer growth and spread.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25398831">The combination of cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol enhances the anticancer effects of radiation in an orthotopic murine glioma model.</a> -- &quot;High-grade glioma is one of the most aggressive cancers in adult humans and long-term survival rates are very low as standard treatments for glioma remain largely unsuccessful. Cannabinoids have been shown to specifically inhibit glioma growth as well as neutralize oncogenic processes such as angiogenesis&quot; -- <em>&quot;Holy sh_t.&quot;</em></li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22506672">Cannabidiol as potential anticancer drug.</a></li>

A role for transient receptor potential vanilloid type-2.</a> --&quot;...we investigated the effects of CBD and BORT in CD138+TRPV2- MM cells and in MM cell lines transfected with TRPV2 (CD138+TRPV2+). These results showed that CBD by itself or in synergy with BORT strongly inhibited growth, arrested cell cycle progression and induced MM cells death by regulating the ERK, AKT and NF-κB pathways with major effects in TRPV2+ cells.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24373545">Inhibition of colon carcinogenesis by a standardized Cannabis sativa extract with high content of cannabidiol.</a> -- &quot;CBD BDS attenuates colon carcinogenesis and inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation via CB1 and CB2 receptor activation. The results may have some clinical relevance for the use of Cannabis-based medicines in cancer patients.&quot;</li>

<h4>Anxiety, anti-psychotic / psychiatric activity</h4>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25667194">A systematic review of the antipsychotic properties of cannabidiol in humans.</a> -- &quot;The first small-scale clinical studies with CBD treatment of patients with psychotic symptoms further confirm the potential of CBD as an effective, safe and well-tolerated antipsychotic compound, although large randomised clinical trials will be needed before this novel therapy can be introduced into clinical practice.&quot;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716160">A critical review of the antipsychotic effects of cannabidiol: 30 years of a translational investigation.</a> --&quot;These results support the idea that CBD may be a future therapeutic option in psychosis, in general and in schizophrenia, in particular.&quot;</li>

<h4>The CBD Hit Job</h4>

<p>As I&#39;ve <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3xbn3c/socal_psychology_reveals_some_disturbing_traits/">pointed out before</a>, sometimes the scientific community <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3163460/">falls prey to biases</a>, but sometimes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U2LY3D2?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage">it&#39;s gamed.</a></p>

<p>A person I follow closely for government treachery is alternative media videographer and documentarian <em>par excellence</em>, James Corbett of <a href="http://www.corbettreport.com">CorbettReport.com</a>. James has pointed out this behavior in science several times in his discussions of the fenagling of data in climate change models.  We also know this from the GMO junk science that&#39;s been put out.</p>

<p>Well, friends, I believe it is yet again, more fudgery of science.  This final CBD article attaches a value-judgment over the effectiveness already demonstrated by numerous of their own studies, acting to discredit all of them in one-fell-swoop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thus, as further evidence for CBD&#39;s beneficial effects in neurological disease emerges, there remains an urgent need to establish the molecular targets through which it exerts its therapeutic effects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(no there doesn&#39;t, food chemist, see above mountains of work many smart people the world-round have already done.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here, we conducted a systematic search of the extant literature for original articles describing the molecular pharmacology of CBD. We critically appraised the results for the validity of the molecular targets proposed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(and you have credentials to evaluate those?  Are any of you neurologists or pharmacologists?  I see 2 food chemists)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thereafter, we considered whether the molecular targets of CBD identified hold therapeutic potential in relevant neurological diseases. The molecular targets identified include numerous classical ion channels, receptors, transporters, and enzymes. Some CBD effects at these targets in in vitro assays only manifest at high concentrations, which may be difficult to achieve in vivo, particularly given CBD&#39;s relatively poor bioavailability. Moreover, several targets were asserted through experimental designs that demonstrate only correlation with a given target rather than a causal proof. When the molecular targets of CBD that were physiologically plausible were considered for their potential for exploitation in neurological therapeutics, the results were variable. In some cases, the targets identified had little or no established link to the diseases considered. In others, molecular targets of CBD were entirely consistent with those already actively exploited in relevant, clinically used, neurological treatments. Finally, CBD was found to act upon a number of targets that are linked to neurological therapeutics but that its actions were not consistent withmodulation of such targets that would derive a therapeutically beneficial outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the date, Oct 2015: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26264914">Molecular Targets of Cannabidiol in Neurological Disorders.</a> -- The researchers in this rubbish article are in 1) University Food/Nutritional Science and 2) Pharmaceuticals companies <del>&quot;Narrowmind&quot;</del> &quot;Broadmind Ltd&quot; and GW (bush) Pharmaceuticals in the UK.  Yet they have something to say of the effectiveness of all the other studies, and in particular in <em>neurology</em>.  JUNK SCIENCE.  Value Judgment.  UK.  &quot;We&#39;re being paid to protect Her Majesties Royal heroin lines!&quot;  (Also, for those who like the synchronicities:  <em>&quot;Whiteknights&quot;</em>)  Here&#39;s my take:</p>

<p>BUT BUT</p>

<ul>
<li>Anecdotal!!<br/></li>
<li>Poor bioavailability!! and </li>
<li>Correlation not causation!! </li>
<li>Results were variable!! </li>
<li>Target identified had no justification!! </li>
<li>But we already have stuff for that disease!! (egggg-zacktly)</li>
<li>Acts on too many targets!!<br/></li>
<li>Too weak to work neurologically!!  -- (oh yeah?  F you <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109356">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23109356</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Talk about a pharmacological hit-job.</em>  One that tries to undo all the links above.  Why do you think they continue to study CBD?  Why are people uprooting their families and moving to Colorado because it is legal and they can no longer buy CBD on amazon?   (NOTE: they made it federally legal (cbd, via hemp oil) but now it is restricted and you can&#39;t actually buy it anymore except maybe (??) on ebay.  CBD websites keep getting shut down.</p>

<p>Anyway thanks for the info on Crohns.  I&#39;ll pass that on to a friend who has a pretty bad case of it (he&#39;s dying from it, actually).  What is harlequin?  A strain of cannabis?  Also what is OG?  I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not that sophisticated with these terms.  I just know the indica strain blueberry is something I love and sour diesel kush is something I will leave to the others (too intense for me)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Harlequin is a sativa dominant strain of medical marijuana that finishes flowering in 9 weeks. Grows like an indica which means more short and bushy than tall and thin. </p>

<p>We were breaking ground in thc-v research which targets depression. A successful cross of tahoe og and Chem-D spit out a seed that would later test 19% thc-v. We traded this cut to Harborside in Oakland who in turn blessed us with the special cut of harlequin. </p>

<p>Took me about a year to dial everything in with the cut for mass production. Then we started in on the the ointments. I had a neighbor with chrones so I grew him a mini mom that could produce all the clones he needed. He grew up the mom and made 45 clones. The idea is to leave them on 18 hour lights on and 6 off. This prevents them from flowering or making buds. </p>

<p>So with a rotation of 45 he can strip one a day of all its foliage. Cbd is very rich in the fans. Then turn that into his daily morning juice.  When 30 days go by your flock will be twice the size. They love being pruned. Changed his life. I get a Christmas card every year. </p>

<p>We were all legal, by the book. Had lawyer in every county we serviced on retainer. When we got raided our lawyers were there in 5 minutes. They took care of everything and we moved on. But it&#39;s a wild coincidence. </p>

<p>So, what are some good ways of getting a source for CBD? CBD oil is legal where i live. There are brans like medihemp, where a 10ml bottle costs between 60 - 70 €. 
Can you recommend a better alternative or is a price like this perfectly reasonable?
How much of a concentration would you recommend?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you enter the realm of &quot;medicine&quot; you tread upon a monopoly existing over 100 years. Medicine, in and of itself, has been monopolized, and long before that it was deemed that petroleum based products would be the basis for most modern medicines. Go figure. People talk shit about Rothschild, and rightfully so, but let us not forget the great things Rockefeller did in the name of capitalism and freedom. Certain substances can make these shackles almost weightless, but at the end of the day, so long as the shackles remain, we&#39;re still enslaved. Look at who buys off our government (not just Israel by a long shot), and it should make sense why our government represents the will of the corporate person and not the living person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other thing that opiates (medical painkillers) do is they tear up your stomach with ulceration. This is not often talked about in the news or television, but often talked about among people who take these substances over the long term.  </p>

<p>This is really where CBD shines.  It&#39;s a painkiller that doesn&#39;t tear up your stomach and may actually fix many other maladies in the body as well.</p>

<p>Of course, as a painkiller it absolutely cannot compare to morphine because they act differently:</p>

<p>morphine makes all sensation go away--it numbs the nerves until the signal is effectively gone.</p>

<p>CBD mutates the sensation so that it&#39;s not painful anymore but rather a really &#39;strong vibrating sensation&#39;.  Which means effectively that it changes your perception of pain (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception">nociception</a>) so that you continue to perceive it, can analyze it, and relate to the pain in a different way than out of fear and suffering.</p>

<p>Ultimately making a different relationship to the pain may be better because it allows you to &#39;take better care and caution&#39; with the damage to the body so you don&#39;t further injure it.  (This is the reason they say you shouldn&#39;t take painkillers while hiking because you risk actually damaging yourself more if you don&#39;t &#39;understand what you&#39;re body is telling you).  For these reasons I believe CBD to be a superior painkiller than opiates by far.</p>

They were selling (and evidently you were consuming) a filthy impure product made by folks on their way to prison soon.  (Mike Llamas, of MJNA).  (See my other post for links further down).</p>

<p>Do not break your arm patting yourself on the back for this post.  Medicine is made in FDA approved GMP compliant laboratories for a reason:  so Mobsters like Llamas and Mona and Kleber from Dixie are not allowed to make heavy metal and solvent contaminated goo and sell it to idiots like you calling it &quot;medicine&quot;.  </p>

<p>Without laws and well capitalized corporations making pure medicines, you get snake oil made from piss and mercury and snake venom masquerading as cannabis extracts bcause there is nobody there to stop the gangsters from selling shit to idiots like you along side the soulful hippies doing their best to make a pure product in their Mom&#39;s garages.</p>

<p>I am a CBD proponant.  Everybody thinks it&#39;s magical shit, but it is just weed with the parts that get you high removed.  If you dont mind getting high, save your money and consume whole cannabis.</p>

<p>People are so gullible.  Particularly you, OP.  We need the FDA and REAL drug companies to make our drugs so we don&#39;t get dosed with heavy metals like YOU did consuming Dixie products made from Czech hemp and sold by pump and dump artists and charletaines like Trip Kleber. </p>

<p>Ok, well you just outed yourself as a shill and stalker.  The use of this &#39;patting yourself&#39; phrase is the key.  I made another post several pages deep that ends with &#39;patting myself on the back&#39;, so you obviously went fairly deep into my history just to find some stuff to make a personal attack---your reference to this specific idiomatic indicator says that you&#39;re aim is to actually come in here take a big shit on me and try to discredit purposefully.</p>

<p>edit: Also, you went kind of crazy on this dixie thing.  I&#39;ve actually never consumed a dixie product.  I was thinking about it as they looked like a legit site, and so had them bookmarked.  I went back there to buy something and coulnd&#39;t because your friends at the nsa / mafia had hacked their site.  I just used that one example because it was the first one I came across in my bookmarks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>GMP.  Good Manufacturing Practices.  Anybody know what that is?  It is the set of cleanliness and purity standards that any manufacturing facility making medicines must pass to be able to sell their medecines under the &quot;Clean Food and Drug Act&quot;.</p>

<p>Most of the &quot;Hemp Oil&quot; that was being sold on Amazon had a single origin:  Medical Marijuana Incorporated in San Diego.  They bought tons and tons of hemp in Eastern Europe and sold a crudely refined impure tar and called it &quot;CBD oil&quot;.  Lab tests repeatedly found it to be contaminated with both heavy metals and solvent residues.  (Growing hemp is actually used to clean heavy metals from contaminated sites--but then you make hempcrete out of it, not fucking medecine!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2014/03/26/high-times-inside-the-pot-stock-bubble/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2014/03/26/high-times-inside-the-pot-stock-bubble/</a></p>

<p>The Pro-CBD organization, Project CBD actually exposed the shite these evil fuckers were selling as medecine for kids:  <a href="https://www.projectcbd.org/article/hemp-oil-hustlers">https://www.projectcbd.org/article/hemp-oil-hustlers</a></p>

<p>Long story (read those articles) short:  if you are not investing hundreds of thousands of dollars to meet GMP, you can&#39;t make fucking asprin to sell to other people!  You are not making pure, clean medicine if you do not meet GMP.  You are making homemade shitty hash oil of unknown purity.  Consume it yourself all you like.  But dont think you can legally sell it to other people.  You can&#39;t.</p>

<p>Ever since Upton Sinclair wrote &quot;The Jungle&quot; in the early 20th century, people kinda decided they wanted clean food and drugs.  So the FDA was started, and the first thing they did was set up cleanliness standards--and setting up procedures so that if (when, it happened often) a guy fell into the hotdog meat grinder, they couldn&#39;t go ahead and sell the hotdogs anyway as they did before there was an FDA.</p>

<p>I am sure the folks here bragging about how great their strains and their homemade oil is have the best of intentions.</p>

<p>But if you are allowed to make medecine in your garage and sell it to little kids, then we have to let Mike Mona Jr. and Mike Llamas and Stuart Titus and the other mobsters who give no fucks sell heavy metal and solvent laden shit to people and call it medecine as well.</p>

<p>Or you can all just accept the 100 year old fact that it is best to let well capitalized businesses with the money to meet GMP standards make pure, clean medecine.  And that is underway.</p>

<p>No conspiracy here.  You would not want to give what was being sold on Amazon to your dog, much less your child.  That is why it is gone.  Not because it is CBD---but because it had mercury and formaldehyde in it.  Because the FDA didn&#39;t check it.  When they checked it, it was removed from sale because it was poison. </p>

<p>ALso, if you are true believer in the free market, what you do is you let anyone play with the requirement of having an independent third party assay your product and you have to publish the results.  You don&#39;t need the FDA, except maybe to evaluate the evaluators (chemical labs who do the assaying).</p>

People are very insistent that it is a non-psychoactive molecule yet it has been clearly demonstrated to invoke <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697769/">behavioural changes in rat models</a> and is being explored as a potential anxiolytic and anti-depressant. These are properties of <em>psychoactive molecules</em>. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I thought sativa would have been the preferred strain because it is more of a mindful euphoria rather than a couch lock state induced by indica varieties. </p>

<p>However you are right, indica strains produce more cbd in proportion to thc compared to sativa plants. There are hybrid strains now with mixed genes to produce more balanced effects.</p>

<p>Some more reading:</p>

<p>&quot;Many people choose to medicate with a combination of different strains. The ‘high’ effects of Sativa strains make them a better choice during the day, when wakefulness is desirable, whereas the relaxing effects of Indica varieties often make them more suitable for evening and nighttime use. Hybrid strains can offer the best of both worlds to many patients but may be less suited to others. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great article. Marijuana remains Schedule I because its deemed easy to become addicted to and abuse, despite its obvious medical benefits. By that logic, Oxycontin and other opiates should be deemed Schedule I and they are not. This fact proves the cover-up and alternative reasonings (financial and control) for keeping it Schedule I.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, what are some good ways of getting CBD without THC? I live in a european country where CBD oil is legal. Do you have any knowledge that goes in this direction? 
How much CBD/day should the intake be to reap all the effects. Some of the studies used daily doses of 300mg in their tests which would be quite expensive.</p>

<p>Edit: Excellent post btw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Harlequin is a sativa dominant strain of medical marijuana that finishes flowering in 9 weeks. Grows like an indica which means more short and bushy than tall and thin. </p>

<p>We were breaking ground in thc-v research which targets depression. A successful cross of tahoe og and Chem-D spit out a seed that would later test 19% thc-v. We traded this cut to Harborside in Oakland who in turn blessed us with the special cut of harlequin. </p>

<p>Took me about a year to dial everything in with the cut for mass production. Then we started in on the the ointments. I had a neighbor with chrones so I grew him a mini mom that could produce all the clones he needed. He grew up the mom and made 45 clones. The idea is to leave them on 18 hour lights on and 6 off. This prevents them from flowering or making buds. </p>

<p>So with a rotation of 45 he can strip one a day of all its foliage. Cbd is very rich in the fans. Then turn that into his daily morning juice.  When 30 days go by your flock will be twice the size. They love being pruned. Changed his life. I get a Christmas card every year. </p>

<p>We were all legal, by the book. Had lawyer in every county we serviced on retainer. When we got raided our lawyers were there in 5 minutes. They took care of everything and we moved on. But it&#39;s a wild coincidence. </p>
