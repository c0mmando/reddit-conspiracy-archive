       Global warming has been from the very beginning about disrupting the fossil fuel business. it's all about spreading the wealth from fossil fuel companies to alternative energy companies and governments. The science community has been shown to be completely for sale and they are more than willing to shame their own who threaten the grant gravy train. Academia is actively brain washing our children. The strategy is really brilliant. People who feel guilty about killing the planet are more likely to take action, change habits, pay more for alternative energy and accept more taxes. They've been convinced that even if global warming isn't real, these changes are helping the planet.

       If it's all a ploy to get rid of big oil, then why would the oil companies themselves show internal R&amp;D documents pointing to the concerns voiced by the scientific community (in regard to climate change), and why would the company not make any mention of those findings?

       Also, why would they spend so much money on active denial?

       Rockefellers are behind both sides. They fund the denial side through their oil companies and they fund the push for carbon permit trading and hiding geoengineering by using their foundations to steer where the green groups go with their movement. Its the hegelian dialect at work.

       Like I said, I agree with you that the climate change political agenda is a fraud and that the Rockefellers control the environmental movement. Ive seen all this research and know the fraud going on. But at the same time, the other side is also controlled by the oil industry.

       I believe the political agenda behind climate change is a hoax and basing it all off carbon, but to act like the environment is healthy would be naive imo. Its a fact ecosystem and species rates are declining at a rapid speed

       But the AGW aren't addressing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could tackle our pollution problems with three existing technologies:
      </p>
      <p>
       thorium,
      </p>
      <p>
       hemp,
      </p>
      <p>
       algae based biofuels.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ever see a climate change alarmist mention any of these, please let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we also know is that the only means of breaking down hydrocarbons are mushrooms:
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul Stamens showed a complete decomposition of hydrocarbons. He designed mycobooms that can float on salt water and break down hydrocarbons.
      </p>
      <p>
       He developed mycofiltration to prevent run-off pollution in our waterways.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, instead of pursuing, developing and implementing this natural technology, we ignore it for the competitors of large chemical companies that just further pollute our waters.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an extensive topic and I don't expect you to agree without some research.

       The technologies exist, but science is busy funding papers that the government wants published: those that allow them to increase tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is: we can solve most of the issues we face, but doing so would eliminate the power the government has and so is not pursued.

       I agree they are not addressing it with the current movement because its been hijacked. But to say that climate change isnt real to me would be equally false. Its real but the solutions being presented are all about a power grab. Carbon is not really a big part of the problem.
      </p>

       Geoengineering though is completely destroying the planet and all life on it. You can still believe in climate change and be against the mainstream political agenda behind it

       It has long been known that contrails warm the planet. What the situation is with the climate is hard to determine. I can't say I can believe what is said by really anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel geoengineering is being used as a means of mitigating climate change, I can't agree. I know that there are many underlying agendas pursued with geoengineering and for all I know, the bulk program under which they act are as false as the programs they are used to cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mushrooms can help bioaccumulate many toxins and the King Oyster is especially good at accumulating the key components identified in geoengineering.

      <p>
       We have the tools to meet our own needs and should pursue them. If not, we are just furthering demand for the destructive means of satisfying our needs.

       How do u explain all the aluminum showing up in the soil, in all types of species as well as extinction rates skyrocketing, and the massive spike in autism and dementia. These same chemicals are all patented by the u.s. gov't for the stated purpose of geoengineering. i mean just look up in the sky and its blatantly obvious whats going on.

       Obviously your on conspiracy because u know something is up with the world, so i just dont see how any can justify the planet is healthy. Having a completely unbalanced planet goes exactly with the backwards world in which we live

       What does the health of the planet have to do with climate?
      </p>

       The aluminum is coming from geo-engineering. But it's not the only thing coming from geo-engineering. They are sending all kinds of weapons from the sky to alter moods, health, thoughts.

      <p>
       Geo-engineering masquerades as a solution to climate change. But of course, we don't actually know what it is for.

       Agreed. Supporting the climate agenda being pushed by tptb is not helping. But doesnt mean there doesnt need to be an actual logicaly based plan that combats it.

       I think you are assuming that they are doing geo-engineering because they are trying to maintain our climate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you assume this? because some of the publicly available data suggests that is what it could be used for? Edison thought the phonograph would be used as a language learning tool, turns out people actually like music.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be so inclined to assume that whatever geo-engineering is happening is done because of CO2 emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned above, contrails are said to cause warming. What happens when you intentionally cover as much of the sky as you can with enhanced such trails?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything we say we think they are doing with geo-engineering is rampant speculation. We know there are patents, but they are extensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to do something about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Support thorium. Support hemp. Support algae based biofuel, support myco remediation and the elimination of toxins as negative externalities of your lifestyle.

       But don't assume that you have any idea what geo-engineering is being used for.

       There is no doubt in my mind geoengineering is happening on a massive scale. Yeah i support all your solutions but we have to stop messing with the climate for those to work properly.

       I believe they have been spraying since the 40's as many documents suggest and they fucked with the weather so much that now their trying to actually cool it to make up for their mistakes. But hey, we can have differing opinions. Good site if u want to learn more about geoengineering.

       This isn't a single cause kind of issue. The climate of the world is very complicated, there are millions of factors. Humans are a factor, and the percentage of carbon in the atmosphere surely has repercussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the idea that we can accurately or precisely measure the temperature of the earth collectively is pretty absurd to me. Also I find it pretty convenient how politicized this issue is. I think TPTB will use this idea as leverage to impose taxes on fuel. Since it's a world issue, we will need global enforcement. Suddenly we can bankrupt countries by adjusting their fuel tax from overseas. We can invade countries on claims they are polluting the atmosphere at a high rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       A war on climate change will be like all wars. Groups of people with power and resources will use the opportunity to take more power and resources, or to eliminate the power and resources of others.

       Well first let me just be clear that it would be really dumb to ever deny "climate change".  The climate changes constantly, has changed throughout the history of the planet, and will continue to change in the future and this is true of all places on earth.  I also think humans have negatively impacted the planet and environment significantly, look no further than something like the "Great Pacific Garbage Patch" or the plummeting bee populations around the world or all of the oil spills that have happened over the decades, destroying ecosystems and poisoning ground water.  There are thousands of other examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said though, man-made
       <em>
        global warming
       </em>
       , AGW, is complete bullshit as far as I'm concerned.  None of the models' predictions are ever accurate, the IPCC has been caught forging data and blatantly lying, and you can even chart global temperatures right alongside solar activity and see the obvious correlation with your own eyes.  This all makes perfect sense since, logically, the Sun is by far the biggest factor in determining the temperature of the planet and always has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other clue is that the Green movement seems to be taking no steps to
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       solve any of the issues it talks about.  Where is the big push for alternative forms of fuel which we already know exist and which could work efficiently on a large scale (i.e. hemp fuel)?  Where is the big push to limit the oil expenditure of the US military which is the biggest consumer of oil on the planet
       <strong>
        by far
       </strong>
       ?  Instead all we hear about are carbon credits.

       Hmm ok. I wanted to get you opinion since I respect your posts and thoughts. I would tend to disagree with you. I tend to look at it in the hegelian dialect whereas the denial side and climate agenda side are both hijacked and controlled by the same players to hide the real problem of climate engineering and so they can be forced into each other to force world gov't/depopulation. Here is my take on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The planet is clearly out of whack. Species extinction rates are through the roof, autism/dementia rates are skyrocketing, i do beleive the temperature is rising and the artic is losing ice, droughts all over are continuing, deforestation is rampant, and just pollution is just out of hand. We dont live in any kind of balance. However, while there are many cause, carbon might play only a small factor. The big cause to me is geoengineering, which has been going on since the 40's. Carbon is just the easy scapegoat so as they can blame it on society and the people and not on themselves. Its also a way to make massive amounts of money which we clearly see their trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this premise, they have hijacked the climate change movement and steered it towards carbon as being the culprit and then using it as a ploy to make money and bring about world gov't. It no doubt that the NWO cabal has infiltrated the green movement and through their foundations are steering the narrative by deciding who gets funding according to who plays ball. More money is spent on this side because they cannot possibly let the environmental movement find out whats really going on as well as their money is tied up in fossil fuels so they have to control the transition.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time they are funding the denial side to cast doubt in people as to whats really happening so the major oil players can continue to pollute and dominate the economy. This gives them more time to bring about a transition as well as depopulate the planet and hoard them into cites like Agenda 21 states. Less money is needed on this side because most on the right follow this side and they already dont trust the gov't. Also, when the whole premise is designed around carbon only, its easy to disprove.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both sides though, refuse to talk about climate engineering as a cause, let alone the single greatest cause. It would make sense why they would go to such great lengths to hide this as these same people are responsible for it. Why is aluminum showing up everywhere: in the soil, in all these animals showing up dead, and in us. While vaccines and gmos play a role, I think the autism link is a direct result of all the spraying. Also, all these bees are showing up with Alzheimer's which has such a strong link to all the metals being sprayed. There is just a mountain of evidence pouring out the geoengineering is going on in a massive way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to conclude, I think both sides are controlled to hide the main cause and further the agenda of world gov't and agenda 21.

       I certainly agree.  But like you said carbon emissions isn't the main issue and that's what's universally referred to by global warming proponents as basically the one and only boogie man.

       I agree with all of that except for the part where you say the earth is warming.  I don't think there's much evidence of that at all that doesn't come out of the global warming crowd, much of it from the highly corrupted IPCC, and if you go back far enough you'd find that the earth has been much warmer in the past and that temperatures are cyclical based on solar activity.  Even
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       the earth is warming though, I don't think carbon emissions are even close to the main culprit.  I'm being very specific here with what I'm "denying" and that's the standard spiel of carbon emissions increasing global temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with basically everything else you're saying so you might've misunderstood me a bit or I wasn't perfectly clear so sorry about that.

       Exactly.  Neither do they talk about pollution like I mentioned.  Even if we're going to whine about carbon, where is the talk of the US military cuttings its carbon emissions?  It's the biggest consumer of oil bar none yet I've never heard a single word mentioned about that - why not?  If you want to limit emissions, you start at the top and work your way down, and yet what we're seeing is the exact opposite.  It's us, the individuals, the "end users" who are taking the brunt of the accusations.  It's our "carbon footprints", nevermind those billions and billions of tons of oil the military consumes.

       I agree with you wholeheartedly.  I have a growing suspicion that things like Morgellon's are directly related to all of this.  Or even those "floating cities" over China.

       Awesome, so were pretty much on the same page on just about everything but the global temperature warming. This one I know is a highly debated topic. Ive watched much of James Corbett's stuff about this subject and was in that same camp. However, among more research I would have to say that I think he is wrong on this issue. I think the goal of tptb is to actually give the impression that the planet isn't as hot as it actually is. I think through years of poor lifestyle choices by the masses but more importantly a long history geoengineering, the planet was getting warmer then its supposed to and they are actively spraying now to keep the planet cool. It appears on the surface that they want the planet to warm so they can bring about their agenda but I actually think now that their trying to lowball the global temperature. There has been cases of them falsifying the temperatures lower then what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only place that seems to be getting cooler is the east coast of the U.S. and my suspicion among other people is that they are intentionally trying to cool it so as to give the appearance as to it being a debatable topic since most of the population lives there. Also, a good chunk of the IPCC data is coming from the U.S. if my memory serves me right and the margin for error is strong so it could just as likely be higher then they say and not lower like others claim. I think this is a topic the climate scientists have right but they are just totally lead astray as to whats causing it as they are not considering geoengineering at all. On the flip side, the alternative community understands the carbon scam but I wish others would see the data that the planet is heating. i think this is how they hide truths on both sides and keep them divided. I think much of the solar cycle stuff is not based on sound science.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong but thats what my hunch is at the moment after doing alot of back and forth on the subject. Im trying to write about ti so that where all the inquiry is about. Here is a few links maybe to check out.

       I'll check out some links today but I think that site is ignoring the big picture.  Even scrolling down the first couple of articles, the guy specifically mentions that global temperatures are possibly the warmest they've been in 4000 years.  Even if that's true, and maybe it is, what it still tells me quite clearly is that the planet was just as warm 4000 years ago as it is today.  4000 years ago when geo-engineering didn't exist, when oil consumption didn't exist, when nuclear pollution didn't exist, etc., etc.  So if the planet "warmed on its own" then, why is it impossible that it's doing the exact same thing now?  We already know scientifically that solar activity and global temperatures are cyclical, I think we should be looking at the data in a much longer time frame than 30 years or 50 years which is what the people trying to prove global warming always seem to do.

       Hmm. Send many any links on the temperature if you got them too. Really want to get to the bottom of this or atleast the best I can. Im also going on just my own perspective and those of people I know all over the world. Everyone I talk tao in all different parts of the world, especially when asking their parents, say its abnormally warmer then before. Im not basing all my info off that but its a factor nonetheless.

       Yes, lots of disinfo from both sides no doubt.  The entire thing is a clusterfuck clearly (and cleverly) designed to get us all arguing amongst ourselves and staying confused as to what the real issues are.  Geo-engineering and pollution are real and growing problems either way though, whether the planet is warming or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should definitely try to look at long-term graphs of temperatures though on the scale of hundreds/thousands of years.  Temperatures have been where they are now in the past, long before the "carbon emissions" boogieman ever existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also a nice little scientific primer about the global warming hoax which might be worth reading for you is
       <a href="http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles%202007/GWHoaxBorn.pdf">
        here
       </a>
       (it's a short .pdf).  I think it's important to understand where the idea of "global warming" actually comes from, what the original stated "science" is and what it was based on.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other tell to me that man-made global warming is likely a scam is the "97% of climate scientists agree" meme that's all over the internet.  This percentage is blatantly misleading at best, more accurately it could be called outright propaganda.  Simply reading any of the few studies where this number comes from is all it takes for anyone to prove to themselves that no, 97% of climate scientists
       <em>
        do not
       </em>
       agree.  At least, there's no evidence that they do (since none of the papers include all scientists or all papers on the subject, obviously).  The data is cherry-picked badly to make that percentage work.

       <a href="http://icecap.us/images/uploads/GLOBALSCAM.pdf">

       argument for it being a hoax.  This one is also a .pdf but is in the form of an actual scientific study, complete with an abstract, conclusions, full list of sources and citations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the one I wanted to link you but I wasn't able to find it at first.  Definitely worth a thorough read.  It basically makes the argument that all climate data is defective by default, that the evidence behind "global warming" is not convincing or credible, and that all variations in temperature can be much more effectively explained when correlated against natural influences like the Sun, ocean tides, volcanic eruptions, etc.

       Here might be another way to look at it. Climate change is very real, specifically global warming, but just not in the way were told. Were told its all about carbon, and while thats a factor its not close to the real problem of geoenginieering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find to hard to believe that all the data by scientists showing species extinctions through the roof, autism/dementia through the roof, droughts all over the world, and our total disregard for living in balance with nature is not affecting the planet.

       … Environmentalism. You’ve seen the famous “better world for nothing” comic, yes? The things listed on the board are environmentalist ideals. None of them have anything whatsoever to do with AGW.

       The “fixes” claimed by the AGW crowd result in environmental damage and societal and industrial destruction.

       Ok,... so what is your solution? I feel like every one I've talked to that is a climate change denier just is looking for an excuse to allow the private sector to continue destroying the environment. Many of them are in favor of removing many basic EPA regulations that give us clean air and water. I disagree with just about all of their so called "solutions."
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it odd that one is an environmentalist and chooses to ignore what the scientists are saying. It sounds fundamentally at odds.

       Execute for crimes against humanity everyone who created the AGW lie. Arrest and imprison those who were paid to manipulate scientific data to fit the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remove all government energy subsidies and let the market dictate the desired sources of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maintain modern emissions standards and put sanctions on/discourage business with countries that do not meet them. Additionally, stop denying the expansion of domestic western industry.

       The “scientists” are lying. Environmentalism has nothing whatsoever to do with global warming.

       It has long been known that contrails warm the planet. What the situation is with the climate is hard to determine. I can't say I can believe what is said by really anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you feel geoengineering is being used as a means of mitigating climate change, I can't agree. I know that there are many underlying agendas pursued with geoengineering and for all I know, the bulk program under which they act are as false as the programs they are used to cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mushrooms can help bioaccumulate many toxins and the King Oyster is especially good at accumulating the key components identified in geoengineering.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the tools to meet our own needs and should pursue them. If not, we are just furthering demand for the destructive means of satisfying our needs.

       I'm not sure what you mean by actual environmentalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you implying that climate change, not being real by your presumptions, would embolden us to care about the planet more than we do now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely concerns of leaving a habitable planet for future generations is a part of "actual environmetalism," no?
