        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In honor of the occasion, I&#39;m going to tell you a little bit about who I am, because who I am is why I&#39;m here. For 10 years I was addicted to heroin. The first 5 of those years, I was doing great. I had a good job, a loving wife, I owned two houses, had a beautiful car. I would get up in the morning, get high, and go about my day. I had my drugs, and I had no worries. I was living the dream. Or at least I thought I was. First, my job was gone. Soon after, my wife. Then, the house, and after sleeping in it for a couple of months, the car. The last two years of my addiction, I was homeless. I was sleeping in a makeshift tent in a drainage ditch, having the shit kicked out of me regularly, eating every two or three days, half (or more) of my teeth had fallen out, and my arm was on the verge of being amputated. So why am I telling you this, and what is my point? </p>

<p><em>I still thought everything was okay.</em></p>

<p>I had my little tent, and the occasional meal, and I managed to beg or swindle enough day-to-day to stay high. I came across lots of people in my situation who were seemingly worse off. My jacket was thin and falling apart, but <em>that</em> guy only had a sweater. I just bought shitty dope, but <em>that</em> guy didn&#39;t score any. In my mind, things weren&#39;t really that bad because they could always be worse.</p>

<p>One day in early March I crawled out of my tent and went downtown to beg for change. It was freezing cold, it was alternating between raining and snowing, and the wind was blasting through my shitty thin coat. After two hours without scoring so much as a nickel, I went into a nearby mall to warm up. I sat down at a table in the food court, and within 30 seconds I saw a security guard making his way towards me. This guy had kicked me out dozens of times. I started to get up to leave, but the guard told me to sit down. I did. He bought me a coffee. &quot;Listen man, I really don&#39;t like being a dick, but this is my job and you can&#39;t just sit in here every day. You can finish that coffee and then you have to go. I know it&#39;s shitty outside, but you&#39;re going to have to figure something out.&quot; </p>

<p><em>You&#39;re going to have to figure something out.</em></p>

<p>Well, there it was, like a slap in the face: The Truth. </p>

<p>And so here I am a few years later, cleaned up, with my life (mostly) put back together. Because I would rather face the uncomfortable truth than live in a comfortable lie.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers man, thanks for sharing and thanks for all you&#39;ve done, do, and will continue to do.  I&#39;ve lost some of my closest friends to heroin so it always lifts my spirits to hear about someone who was able to climb out of that abyss.  Because at the end of the day, that&#39;s what it takes - nobody else can do it for you if you won&#39;t yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazing post. Congrats on all your progress. Makes me proud to be part of this community that helps people grow and learn about themselves. </p>

<p>Your post also reminded me of some research about North Korea I did a couple weeks ago. I didn&#39;t realize that most people there actually <em>believe</em> the propaganda and love dear leader Kim Jong Un. Like, people fucking <em>love</em> this dude who is as bad as Hitler. It&#39;s the real life Matrix. </p>
