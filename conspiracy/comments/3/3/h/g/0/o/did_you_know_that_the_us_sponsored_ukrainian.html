    <div class="md"><p>Before anyone brings up how there are articles about some of these people in western media, there is no outrage. What happened when the Russian opposition Nemtsov was killed? It was front page news on every talk show and news channel for weeks. Putin was condemned and blamed.</p>

<p>Dozens high profile politicians and journalists get murdered in Ukraine, and it&#39;s covered just as regular news. No condemnation, nobody speaking out against this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Propaganda is a form of communication aimed towards influencing the attitude of a population toward some cause or position.
Propaganda is information that is not impartial and used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively (perhaps lying by omission) to encourage a particular synthesis, or using loaded messages to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information presented.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The people calling for the destruction of Ukraine&#39;s economy, started a civil war, are conducting mass murder and ethnic cleansing, and conducting terrorist operations against their own people, is the US installed Fascist regime in Kiev and their Nazi brown shirts like the Azov and Aidar brigades and Right Sector Nazis.</p>

<p>The regime in Kiev is very much like the one in Washington DC. They are both traitors and terrorists against their own people. They are both thieves and impoverishing their own people. Both are destroying civil rights attacking, intimidating and jailing dissidents. Both are wasting billions on making wars of aggression. Both have governments that are bought and paid for by Oligarchs and foreigners. Both have lockdown on the media. They are also both Fascists that will see their own country destroyed.</p>

<p>Most of these people haven&#39;t done anything of what you posted. They are simply against the new unelected president. There&#39;s fucking kids there too, I guess they should be murdered?</p>

<p>you trust the government to label people as terrorists without due process?</p>

<p>How would you feel if a similar website was made in Russia? Where Ukraine sympathizers private info was posted.</p>
