<p>I don&#39;t think that gentile it is offensive.  I know or I think it is the case that that Jews are also &#39;Gentiles&#39; (and therefore in translation Goy) too as it just means a gene group / a family group but gentiles plural only applying to all the other gene groups means that gentiles has come to be thought of as not including Jews or the generalia or &#39;mob&#39; or &#39;rabble&#39;.

    <div class="md"><p>Jews from the <em>original</em> 12 semite tribes came from the middle east- all of which, bar one, were wiped out.</p>

<p>The new Anglo-Euro jews do not descend from those tribes, they descend from the Khazar empire whose King <em>chose</em> Judaism for his people to stop interest from Byzantine, Persia and Islam in converting their people.</p>

<p>This way they would have Abrahamic faith and begrudgingly be accepted by their &#39;brothers&#39; in the other Empires. You see? It was entirely artificial. The tribes from <em>this</em> empire then migrated across Europe and parts eventually formed into the Zionist clusterfuck we know today.</p>

<p>If this was common knowledge, the &#39;Palestinian homeland&#39; prerogative they spout would be rendered baseless.</p>

<p>Correction: Jews <strong>LIKE</strong> cats.</p>

<p>Actual quote - top post in the thread:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jewish communities where segregated from others, <strong>and Jews like cats</strong> so ipso facto very small numbers of Jews contracted and died from the Plague and everyone thought they caused it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Brilliant psychology: &quot;Jews like cats&quot; &gt; Reddit likes cats = Reddit likes Jews!</p>

<p>And who wouldn&#39;t? </p>

<p>Like cats, Jews can be cute, funny, warm, cuddly... and sometimes they even wear <a href="http://www.peterpalms.com/shtreimel/silk%20coat.jpg">furry hats!</a></p>

And that God himself was frequently annoyed to shit with them and only stuck with them because he gave his word that they were the Chosen People. But that didn&#39;t stop him from wiping out large chunks of Jews on a whim. There is even a story of Moses having to talk God down from killing all the Jews because they were annoying him so much.</p>

<p>As a half Jew...I can see where God was coming from. There absolutely is a reason why Jews have been persecuted and kicked out of so many nations through out history. We&#39;re a very annoying and stubborn people.</p>

<p>The story of the entire OT is basically, &quot;Jews annoy God, so he sends them back to slavery, eases up and sends a great man to free them, Jews annoy him again, puts them back into slavery...&quot; repeated over and over and over for hundreds/thousands of years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well an overwhelming majority of those instances are a result of anti-semitism, scapegoating the different people, pogroms etc etc, almost all probably. Unless it was the Jews fault Hitler came into power and dozens of medieval kings used them as scapegoats (hint: the only fault of the Jews was being the different people). </p>

<p>The Jews have had a tough existence. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m sure a lot of you assume this is the Jewish people&#39;s fault somehow... But unless you have several top tier historians backing your claim then you are just flat-out wrong. But then you will prob go, &quot;well the top tier historians are in on the conspiracy!!! Zionism!!! Blah&quot;. Well then you don&#39;t know how evidence, historiography, and academia work. &quot;But but i have this ONE amateur historian who claims this&quot;, more than likely he can&#39;t back up his shit with quality evidence and a real historian will shit on his face. But by then you will fall on the classic, &quot;open your eyes... Wake up... Shill... Etc etc&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lolol. Anyone who genuinely denies the Holocaust is in their own league of dumb asshole as well. Like they see and can actually go through the mountains of data confirming that it happened from documents, physical evidence, photographs,  videos, Nazi officials confirming it, civilians confirming seeing/smelling the camps, thousands of soldiers on the American, British, Soviet, and Polish forces liberating the camps, and then you have (had now that most of that generation is gone) millions of people who lived through on BOTH sides and their testimonies. Most conspiracy nuts were probably convinced that it didn&#39;t happen from some shitty youtube documentary with little to know evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please elaborate - I think most would agree that the Holocaust did not begin as a deliberate genocide. There was a period of time in which Hitler wanted to round up the Jews and send them to an isolated location, like Madagascar, a single place in GG, etc. By the second half of 1941, however, it seems that Hitler had decided there could be no turning back in the destruction of the Jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the fact that the laws of biochemistry and of materials state that bodies put to death by cyanide turn pink, while the walls of the chambers used turn blue, yet none of this occurred in any of the death camps.</p>

<p>The fact that there is no evidence of a written order by Hitler calling for the extermination of the Jews.</p>

<p>The fact that in order to gas people, the chamber needs to be hermetically sealed, yet the door at the Auschwitz gas chamber was rickety to say the least.</p>

<p>The fact that the chimney at Auschwitz was built by the Soviets after the war.</p>

<p>The fact that the confession of Rudolph Hoss was obtained after three days of torture, as admitted to by the torturer, Bernard Clarke, in Robert Butler&#39;s <em>Legions of Death</em> (1983).</p>

<p>The fact that the confession of Adolf Eichmann was obtained after him being put under severe mental and physical pressure to make statements (he was tied to a bed for eight days after his kidnapping), as described by Jewish journalist Hannah Arendt in her book <em>Eichmann in Jerusalem</em> (1978). She also reported that &quot;Eichmann had found it impossible to recruit ex-Nazi colleagues to serve as defense witnesses. Reason: because the Israeli government refused to promise that they would not be arrested if they set foot on Israeli soil.&quot;</p>

<p>The fact that the &quot;interrogations&quot; for prisoners awaiting trial at Nuremberg left clearly visible marks (skin burns, destruction of the bed of the fingernails, knocked-in teeth, broken jaws, crushed testicles, wounds caused by clubs, brass knuckles and kicks, being locked up naked in cold damp rooms for days on end, mock trials, mock convictions and mock executions (as stated by the Congressional Record-Senate No. 134, 26 July 1949).</p>

<p>The fact that the Israeli Supreme Court was forced to admit that they had put an innocent man, Ivan Demjanjuk, on trial based on phony evidence, yet previously to that they had somehow found Jewish eyewitnesses of his atrocities at the Sobibor camp.</p>

<p>The fact that Chaim Weizmann declared war against Germany on behalf of all Jews on 5th September, 1939.</p>

<p>The fact that the Nazis took the blame for the Katyn Massacre until the Russian government formally admitted in 1990 that the Soviets were responsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of these &quot;facts&quot; would be compelling if you could provide sources for them. Still, I&#39;ll attempt to address your claims one by one:</p>

<p>1) In regards to the cyanide and biochemistry and then the rickety door, this would be compelling evidence if it were true. Could you provide me with a source on the matter? I&#39;d like to read more.  </p>

<p>2) There is no evidence of a written order by Hitler, but there was a pivotal conversation between Hitler and Goebbels in August 1941 that seemed to definitively provide for the extermination of European Jewry. Given that Heydrich mentioned a &quot;final solution&quot; to members of the Einsatzgruppen in September 1941 and the construction of gas chambers at Belzec began in November 1941, this is contextual evidence of the Final Solution having been decided upon. Take it or leave it. </p>

<p>3) Source required - but isn&#39;t one of the oldest Holocaust Denial claims that when US intelligence planes took aerial photos of Auschwitz in 1944, there was no smoke being emitted from the chimneys? Make of that what you will, but this is a tacit admission that there were, in fact, chimneys present at Auschwitz-Birkenau. &quot;Rebuilt&quot; might be a better choice of words. </p>

<p>4) As a Jew following the Holocaust, wouldn&#39;t you want to beat up Nazis, given the opportunity? A little joke. In the case of Hoess though, it wasn&#39;t three days of torture - it was a few strikes to the face and then &quot;it took three days to get a coherent statement out of him. But once he started talking, there was no holding him.&quot; Is this what passes for evidence of torture? What I am finding is that Holocaust Deniers will pounce on any possible shred of evidence that they might find in order to support their claims. Bonus statement from Clarke himself - since you have previously used his &quot;statements&quot; as proof, I assume that you consider him a reputable source: </p>

<p>&quot;Prior to the capture, my hair was jet black, After the three days, a white streak suddenly appeared in the centre, which stayed until the rest of my hair went white as well.
It was not due to the strain of events. I could cope with that. But Hoess had repeated with pride the instructions that he had given to prisoners to dig pits in which they were subsequently shot. He revealed how the bodies were ignited and how oozing fat from them was poured over others.
He admitted without a trace of remorse that he had been responsible for around twon million deaths and that killings had frequently been carried out at the rate of 10,000 a day.&quot;</p>

<p>Eichmann - that is interesting, but his statement was mostly desired so that they could kill him. Really, there&#39;s enough evidence of his actions that his testimony is of little consequence in proving the magnitude of death in the Holocaust. They wanted him dead. If there is an issue here, it is his unethical treatment. Can you blame them? another little joke. Didn&#39;t Arendt also refer to Eichmann as the &quot;banality of evil?&quot; Inaccurate by the way - Eichmann seemed to take great pride in his role, travelling across the continent leaving destruction in his wake.</p>

<p>5) It is not debatable - Nuremberg prisoners were abused. That said, is it not notable that the reviled losers of the Second World War were given a chance to stand trial whatsoever? Also, if you are willing to provide me with a link to the Congressional Record it would be appreciated...I couldn&#39;t find it online (at least not immediately), although this is almost certainly my fault.</p>

<p>6) It wasn&#39;t phony evidence - if you are referring to the Trawniki card, forensic tests have deemed it authentic, and he was at Sobibor from March 1943, something he was convicted of independent of eyewitness accounts in 2011. That said, the eyewitness accounts were based on a case of mistaken identity - when it was evidenced that Demjanjuk was NOT, in fact, the Ivan the Terrible the eyewitnesses thought he was, his guilty verdict was reversed and he was released. </p>

<p>7) re Weizmann - <a href="http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/540d.html">http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/defense/evans/540d.html</a></p>

<p>8) The Nazis didn&#39;t take the blame for Katyn, they said that the NKVD was responsible. Their statement was deemed unreliable by the Allies, as the statement came from Goebbels&#39; Ministry of Propaganda, and more importantly, they weren&#39;t going to condemn an ally that was doing most of the heavy lifting! Why even mention the Katyn Massacre? It is only tangentially related to the murder of Jews. </p>

<p>Anyways, my issue with Holocaust Denial is that a lot of it is unfounded or based on very flawed interpretations of poor evidence. Everything is worth questioning, but it is important to recognize when an accepted interpretation is the most accurate one.  </p>

<p>200 Years Together
Two Hundred Years Together was written by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the famous Russian dissident who won a Nobel Prize for Literature. It is about the time of the Russians and the Jews inside the empire. He wrote in Russian of course but various publishers decided they were not going to put out an English version because they were Jews or frightened of them.
The together of the title refers to Russians and Jews. The first volume was Russian-Jewish History 1795-1916. The second was called The Jews in the Soviet Union. So it is clear enough why the Jews were never going to like what he had to say.
Alex knew them close up and personal. Alex tells the truth about Jews so they hate him and his book. Oddly it has been put out in German and French. One might think the Germans would not be allowed access to the truth about the shysters marketing the Holocaust® story. </p>

<p>He makes the connection between the Jews that instilled communism in Russia &amp; what eventually led to the demise of millions of Russians.</p>

<p>I am familiar with his work, I&#39;ve read One Day In the Life of Ivan.....   And I know he was sent to the Gulags. </p>

<p>Just because his book wasn&#39;t PRINTED (=/= banned btw) and just because he makes a claim in a book you have never read does automatically make his claims true, no matter how much you wish they were. Do you see how skewed your perception is? You just assume his book was banned, and you just assume his claims are true. You people are more gullible than any other group I know.  </p>

<p>You guys cherry pick and ignore mountains of evidence on the other side. It&#39;s embarrassing. I would love to see YOU go head to head with a leading scholar on modern Russian or European history.  Historians are good at their job and their work is accepted due to the fact that they gather all the evidence and interpret it, rather than ignore some that doesn&#39;t agree with their bigoted world view and cherry pick the tiny bits that do. </p>

<p>If you genuinely believe that Jews planted the Communist regime then once again you are ignoring MOUNTAINS of evidence. In fact what evidence is there to support what you claim other than a book you&#39;ve only heard about in passing? Maybe a few of the revolutionaries happen to be born into Jewish families or something? Wtf do Jews gain from that?

<p>And its not just that, jews ONLY help other jews. You always see rich jews donating money to various jewish organizations, they are extremely ethnocentric. Look at Israel, they hate african immigrants more than nazis hate the jews. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The main thing that I learned about conspiracy theory is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in a conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the Jewish banking conspiracy or the grey aliens or the 12 foot reptiloids from another dimension that are in control. The truth is more frightening, nobody is in control. The world is rudderless.&quot; (<em>The Mindscape of Alan Moore</em>, 2003)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/">According to <em>Forbes</em>,</a> the top ten most powerful people in the world are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vladimir Putin</li>
<li>Barack Obama</li>
<li>Xi Jinping</li>
<li>The Pope</li>
<li>Angela Merkel</li>
<li>Janet Yellen</li>
<li>Bill Gates</li>
<li>Mario Draghi</li>
<li>Sergey Brin</li>
<li>Larry Page</li>

<p>What you are suggesting---that this well-documented account of a king requiring his entire country to accept a national religion, to the point of forcing adult males to be circumcised---doesn&#39;t matter, because the people living there were already jews that had somehow shown up north of the Black Sea en masse sometime after they were scattered abroad from Palestine in 70 ad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First it should be noted that Dr. Eran Elhaik never really claimed that ALL (or even MOST) European Jews are descendants of converted Khazars. His only claim is that the Khazar Empire was a transition point were Jews from all kinds of places (including Judea, Byzantine Empire, Iraq, Persia, and even Rome) met, mixed a bit with each other and with local Khazar population, and then continued to East and Central Europe - <a href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/61/F1.expansion.html">as can be seen in his Fig 1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/61.full">Here are the real conclusions of this study:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We conclude that the genome of European Jews is a tapestry of ancient populations including Judaized Khazars, Greco–Roman Jews, Mesopotamian Jews, and Judeans and that their population structure was formed in the Caucasus and the banks of the Volga with roots stretching to Canaan and the banks of the Jordan.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s true that he does claim at some point that: &quot;The Near Eastern–Caucasus ancestries are dominant among Central (38%) and Eastern (32%) European Jews followed by Western European ancestry (30%)&quot;; And also that: &quot;Although the Rhineland hypothesis explains the Middle Eastern ancestry by stating that Jews migrated from Palestine to Europe in the 7th century, it fails to explain the large Caucasus ancestry, which is nearly endemic to Caucasus populations&quot;... However, a quick look at his Fig 5 reviles that other Middle Eastern populations, like the Cypriots, Syrians and the Lebanese, got almost the same amount of &quot;Caucasus ancestry&quot; (~15% - 25%) and a much-much higher amount of &quot;Near-Eastern ancestry&quot; (that would probably be Turkic ancestry - which would make them closer to Khazars than the Ashkenazi Jews), and even some amount of &quot;Western European ancestry&quot; (10%-20%) - which altogether means that Askenazi Jews got most of their &quot;Caucasus ancestry&quot; and a bit of their &quot;Western European ancestry&quot; in their ancient homeland in the Middle East...
See <a href="http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/5/1/61/F5.large.jpg">Figure 5</a></p>

<p>Now, an interesting conclusion from Eran Elhaik&#39;s study is the part were he tries to determine the &quot;biogeographical origin coordinates&quot; (i.e. where in the world thy most fit genetically today) of Eastern European and Central European Ashkenazi Jews by comparing their DNA to DNA of other populations who live today in different places of the world. To make a long story short, he comes up with all kinds of coordinates in the northern parts of the Middle East - not even close to Europe. For example: The smallest deviations in the geographical coordinates were obtained with Armenians for both Eastern (38 ± 2.7° N, 39.9 ± 0.4° E) and Central (35 ± 5° N, 39.7 ± 1.1° E) European Jews. Try running those coordinates on Google Maps, and you&#39;ll find that the biogeographical centers of Eatern (38° N, 39.9° E) and Central (35° N, 39.7° E) European Jews, are just a bit to the north and a bit to the south of the line between Ur-Kashdim and Harran - which is where Abraham is supposed to have come from.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonentine/2013/05/16/israeli-researcher-challenges-jewish-dna-links-to-israel-calls-those-who-disagree-nazi-sympathizers/">Here is a Forbes article about Elhaik&#39;s work.</a> My favorite part is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Discover’s Razib Khan did a <a href="http://forward.com/articles/175912/jews-a-race-genetic-theory-comes-under-fierce-atta/?p=all#ixzz2TBcaw5rq">textured critique</a> in his Gene Expression blog, noting the study’s historical fuzziness and its selective use of data to come up with what seems like a pre-cooked conclusion. As Razib writes, it’s hardly surprising that we would find a small but sizable Khazarian contribution to the “Jewish gene pool”. In fact the male line of my own family traces to the Caucuses, suggesting I’m one of the 20 percent or so of Jews whose lineage traces to converted royal Khazarians. But that view is widely acknowledged by Ostrer, Hammer, Feldman, Michael Thomas and every major researcher in this area—as summarized in my book, <a href="http://www.abrahamschildren.net/"><em>Abraham’s Children: Race, Identity and the DNA of the Chosen People</em>.</a></p>

<p>The rebuke of Elhaik’s study apparently has irked the beleaguered and brash researcher. He’s launched a new offensive—the double entendre is intentional—as chronicled in the <a href="http://forward.com/articles/175912/jews-a-race-genetic-theory-comes-under-fierce-atta/?p=all">Jewish Forward</a>. Elhaik is now calling the world’s top geneticists “liars” and “frauds.” When I weighed in on the magazine’s discussion board, Elhaik responded with academic restraint, claiming my reporting was no better than the geneticists he trashed, saying it shared “common ground with the Nazism (sic) ideology.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Y&#39;all might like Razib Khan. <a href="http://tktk.gawker.com/new-times-op-ed-writer-has-a-colorful-past-with-racist-1692187849">He&#39;s not exactly a fan of the Jews</a>. Cui bono, right?)</p>

<p>And, again, any one can convert and become Jewish. Japanese people can convert and become fully Jewish. The idea that Ashkenazi Jews had sizable numbers of converts is both unsurprising to traditional Jewish history and noted by earlier genetic studies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lolol. Anyone who genuinely denies the Holocaust is in their own league of dumb asshole as well. Like they see and can actually go through the mountains of data confirming that it happened from documents, physical evidence, photographs,  videos, Nazi officials confirming it, civilians confirming seeing/smelling the camps, thousands of soldiers on the American, British, Soviet, and Polish forces liberating the camps, and then you have (had now that most of that generation is gone) millions of people who lived through on BOTH sides and their testimonies. Most conspiracy nuts were probably convinced that it didn&#39;t happen from some shitty youtube documentary with little to know evidence. </p>

<p>Conspiracy crackpots are very good at completely ignoring evidence, or cherry picking it when it suits their delusions. </p>
