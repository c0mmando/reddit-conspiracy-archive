       These commercials tug on our heart strings, and the storys are truely sad.  Those people that put their lives on the line should be given all the assistance they need in putting their lives back together.  They deserve every donation given to help them in that effort.   What they dont deserve is the lack of treatment they have recieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       My outrage comes from the fact that the government isnt OVER providing for these people who's lives have been changed forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are permanetly injured in an automobile accident that is not your fault, you are usually awarded a large sum of money to compensate you for your life long disability.
      </p>
      <p>
       These veterans were sent to war, on a pack of lies, are suffering permanent disabilities, and the government obviously isn't giving them the best care available if projects like Wounded Warrior even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the soldiers that were in active combat that return with all their body parts, still suffer mental scars that will never heal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the governmnet doing about them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet the congress and president are getting better treatment than the ones that put their asses on the line, and for every wounded veteran one of them should give up their healh care for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are still in office that could have protested harder against the wars that didn't.  Maybe a stronger debate from the congress may have resulted in someone opting not to join the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of  them going to war for reasons that have proven to be unjust.  Even if the wars were just, they still should be taken care of.
      </p>
      <p>
       You the elected officials should be ashamed on yourselves for making any veteran go on TV with hat in hand, exploiting themselves, and their injuries, looking to exploit the public by  asking for help for their care from war time injuries that you are obviously failing to provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't the ones who lead us into the illegal wars financially responsible?  Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, their familys, and cronies made a bundle off the wars through no bid contracts awarded to Haliburten and other contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't they helping with the care of the ones who risked their lives so they could profit?
      </p>
      <p>
       That should have the american public, every one in congress and the white house outraged, and for some reason, dealing with Irans nuclear program, the patriot act, and net neutrality seem to be the priority.
      </p>
      <p>
       The politicians in DC, and the lobbiests urging against care for returning veterans are truely the lowest form of life on the morality totem poles, below lawyers, and tied with Hitler, George Bush (both of them), and the international banking cartels.

       They are basically a marketing front that exists only for its own existence. It's much better to give money directly to veteran's organizations. All WW does is hand out grants to those organizations.

       Even better would be to give money to the victims of veterans who don't have the luxury of returning to a developed country and what little they did have was completely destroyed by these very veterans.

       Why are you surprised they treat military soldiers like dogs? The people who send them off to fight and kill to further their own agendas, look at them literally like their attack dogs. That's why they're given dog tags to wear proudly around their necks.

       Their record is settled. Have you seen the movie "Born on the Fourth of July". That is how they treated Vietnam veterans and nothing changed. It is inexpensive to say words of appreciation and give them badges to motivate them like a good dog, but the real value and appreciation for a soldier is shown when he is not needed anymore. Some old horses are brought to the slaughterhouse because it is financially convenient.

       Some part of me agrees with you, but on the other side there are citizens who fall at a very young age for the appealing military recruitment tactics and their live conditions were unjust from the beginning of their lives. Probably they had not parents to pay them college tuition fees, or nobody smart enough near them to explain them not to got to war and that there is no honor in killing people with the biggest and most aggressive military force on earth.

       Agreed. For many people, the military is the best opportunity they have to make a decent living to support a family. Not everyone has the resources for college. I've also heard of people who've been arrested for things like drug charges being told that they can either go to jail or agree to join the military, presumably as a type of "second chance" way to turn their lives around. Kind of hard to blame people facing that decision.

       That's why I joined. My parent's house was getting foreclosed in the economic crisis of 2008, I was in college but I had no money to pay for it, my parents filed bankruptcy, and I didn't know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "go to war or go to jail" deal, I knew a guy in my unit who had that happen pretty much. Judge told him if he didn't join the military he'd probably be sent to prison. So he enlisted.

       Median age of my Basic Training class was probably 20.

       I was 19. Young, naïve, idealistic, and impressionable. Our country loves having a lower class to die in its wars.

      <pre><code>In Haig's presence, Kissinger referred pointedly to military men as "dumb, stupid animals to be used" as pawns for foreign policy. Kissinger often took up a post outside the doorway to Haig's office and dressed him down in front of the secretaries for alleged acts of incompetence with which Haig was not even remotely involved. Once when the Air Force was authorized to resume bombing of North Vietnam, the planes did not fly on certain days because of bad weather. Kissinger assailed Haig. He complained bitterly that the generals had been screaming for the limits to be taken off but that now their pilots were afraid to go up in a little fog. The country needed generals who could win battles, Kissinger said, not good briefers like Haig.
    As quoted in The Final Days by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in chapter 14. Page 194 in the paperback version (1995).

       I'm not a vet or never will be but don't you think that's a little insensitive? I don't agree with our foreign policy at all but you can't deny that if shit were to hit the fan, those dudes and gals, some of which are my friends, would be out there to make sure we're alright no matter what the agenda is. And many of them would have our backs no matter what goes on domestically.

       That doesn't excuse imperial invasion. We'd all take up arms if our homeland were invaded (just like the Iraqis and Afghans did). And your friends killed them for their bravery. That's not cool.

       Come on now, you can't figure out how nurses allow the trigger pullers to return to the killing field? Invasions require an entire crew. Someone loads the bombs, someone else drops them. Another person cooks the food. They're all responsible for the people killed in their invasion of a country that doesn't belong to them.

       Do you realize how out of touch you sound? Soldiers' feelings are hurt because someone called them a mean name. Meanwhile, they fucking explode people with shrapnel and molten lead. Have you ever watched an apache helicopter attack? They shred people limb from limb. Even if they wave a white flag, they keep shredding them. Because American military lawyers said you can't surrender to an aircraft.

       The truth is they (the government/TPTB/MIC) really don't give a shit about them unless they are killing people and completing missions in the war. Once they come home, they could give two shits about them even if they loss limbs or are suffering mentally. It's like an insurance company. They love when you're paying them, but as soon as you ask for a claim they are evil vampire pricks about paying out. It's disgusting and treasonous. smh

       Knowing the effects of wars, you would think that the government would be smart enough to realize the actual cost of post war care and would have made arrangements or included it in the war budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also know from expirence that PTSD is a real issue and should have effictive programs to deal with it instead of making soldiers fight to prove they suffer from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The politicians and people lobbying to send them to war should all be forced to serve a term in front line combat to get an understanding of what they caused, or voluenteer one of their children if they are too old to be effictive.
      </p>
      <p>
       That  happens and I bet the chicken hawks in DC quit beating the war drums pretty dam quick.
      </p>

       Espically if they get injured and are dependant on the VA for care.  That were to happen, policies would change.  Believe you me.

       This. I've said this in many arguments online and offline to people. It should be mandatory if you are in congress, the house or the president. All politicians should offer up 1 of their of age children to fight first. A draft of all the politicians children. If that were to happen, maybe there would be less war. But then again most of these politicians place
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       power and money over the lives of their children. Fucking psychopaths.

       Who cares?  We have 300 million people in this country.  I bet we could find back ups of equal or greater value without breaking a sweat.  Although the losers of elections might inflame the war lobby in hopes that the person they lost too gets sent to battle.

       I agree it's fucked. But, seriously  Donahue isn't that bad in it. He barely narrates. It's the story of a guy who got his spine severed his first day in Iraq and how poorly he was treated by the army and VA. It's heartbreaking but important.

       The Wounded Warriors is a corporation, hands down.  Something like less than 10% of the money raised actually goes to Veterans, the rest goes to pay employees.  Please don't give to them, give to little no name

       Look all of it is a con game.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Marines/Army:
      </p>
      <p>
       They recruit young kids in high school with fancy looks about Military Operations Specialties aka MOS. Touting getting advance training in such as /computers/electronics/avionics/etc.... for future civilian employment and making good future money. That is true to a few who excel at it in training. However what they don't tell you the dark side. You fail these training classes and they boot you down to a rifleman, and put you on the front line, and wind up in shit holes like Afghanistan or Iraq. There you become the esteemed fighting machine to kill the faceless enemy. There you get pounded every day psychologically on horrors such as your CO telling to fire an explosive round into a house. Yet you know kids are in there, and you have to do it, or face insubordination, and punishment from such. The monotony of it every day. Then you see your buddies get maimed/KIA, and you fill with more rage, and hate everyone in sight, and want to kill them all, or you regress into mental seclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah that is one con your government doesn't tell you. They put all that rah rah support the troops, and how glorious war is to defend your country etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Medical:
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the con you to relive you will get the best medical care your country can provide. Which ain't shit, and full of kickbacks, and money saving incentives by a bureaucratic machine that really doesn't give a fuck whether you live or die. To them you are just a statistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The donation con:
      </p>
      <p>
       Wounded Warrior program has some good intentions, but basically it is just a bunch of guys setting up a corporation. They get donated some money to help vets, but less than 20%. Not all or even half of it. Money basically goes to operational cost to pay employees, and pay their executives a high salary. Just as Susan G Komen foundation does. Just as Cancer Society does. Just as Diabetes organization does. They are self sustain corporations that rely on gullible people handing out cash who believe that their money is well spent when not really. These donation causes should be on minimal operating budgets, and handing out at least half of the money to help others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anther example is Red Cross. They took the donations intended for 9/11 event families. When in reality they saw barely nothing of it where as Red Cross took that money for other support into their operations such as employees salaries etc... Even though not used for what they advertised, and even got celebs to plead for. Making them look bad as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one big con game, and it is disgusting how we are working it on each other rather than really helping those it was intended toward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore this rant was intended to give insight how we as country are deceiving ourselves by conning good young men and women into a killing game to support the war lords arms merchants off your tax money, and the con game of predators who take your money to give themselves a fat salary on the executive level. Thus sustain the on going bullshit machines that are out there. I also rant on this as I saw some posts on how they say fuck these troops. When actually they were brainwashed as young kids and decided into joining a farce set up system. We are nothing more than the Ancient Roman empire with self sustaining war machine to keep fighting off the enemy for over 200 plus yeas with very little peace in between. We are always at war. Because it makes men at the top money off your taxes, and they are laughing at you all the way to the bank. Wake up.

       They know to much about what the wars were really about (conquering nations). All war is done by deception. That's why they are viewed as the enemy by government, they could start a revolt against war (the economic savior to unbacked currency systems in trouble).

       They deserve what they got, ignorance isn't an excuse or we can say the same for nazi soldiers that they were innocent and just lied to. Your car analogy fails big time. Just look at the cadets forced to wear red high heels on some universities and complied, this shows they will do as they told. Respect veterans and soldiers? Fuck them. Im not going to respect pawns of imperialistic trash.

       Thats your opinion, you are entitled to it.  I have never been in the military, my problem with authority and smart mouth would have not been a good fit.

       I do believe that those who swore the oath -
      </p>
      <p>
       “I, XXXXXXXXXX, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.

       I do feel that many atrocities have been committed in the names of every US citizen, by our military and the ones giving orders to them, but they still have put their lives on the line, and lost limbs, and should be provided the best care available, regardless of my opinion that the wars were unjust, and they should have disobeyed orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of them were probably doing it for money (which doesnt make it right) college funding, or just not knowing what they wanted to do in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with the choice fight or the stockade, almost every one is going to battle with their buddies, than rot in the can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right or wrong, they still deserve the best care from a government that sent them in harms way. Imo anyway...

       Why would they take good care of the veterans? They are even more useless than the active-duty soldiers, because they have already gotten out and cannot be as easily controlled. They are older and they have probably figured out that the military is a con.

       To the GOP, taking care of the vets after they come home is like paying the check at the restaurant after you've eaten, "Ugh, do I have to? I was all gung-ho to pay any amount since I was hungry, but now that I'm full the urgency seems to have faded."

       You can say both sides are to blame, but the republicans have a historic record of denying benefits to Veterans (even opposed the G.I. Bill). Especially in the last 15 years, remember when parents would by bullet proof vest for their kids because George Bush wouldn't? Look at any of the blocked Veterans bills since Obama was elected as well?

       I wish a group of veterans, wounded or not would orchrastrate an occupy DC movement with news cameras and refuse to leave until this is addressed.  Basically what the 9/11 victims familys did to get an investagation.  Thats probably what it will take.

       I just wanted to say I think you are exactly right. I find it shameful  that we don't treat our veterans, especially our wounded veterans, better. I also get very frustrated with all the support our troops slogans. Why don't we support them by not sending them into endless wars?

       What pisses me off the most is how fucking brainwashed most people are. They pretend as if soldiers are protecting us from the boogymen in turbans.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, soldiers are the pawns of the elite. They are the ones who profit from War (Defense Contractors who sell violence, International Banks who lend the money, and Politicians who get bribes to sell war).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Thank you for your service...to the greedy pieces of shit who's greed creates death and destruction" is more appropriate than "thank you for your service to our country".
BTW
      </p>
      <p>
       "soldier's" salary - Paid for by Tax Payer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then soldiers always pull that BS "military discount" move at establishments  - Paid for by the establishment (too afraid to ask "discount for what!?")
      </p>
      <p>
       "soldier's" medical bills - (partially) Paid for by sob story infomercials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just ask the same fucks who destroyed their lives to pay for their shit (salary, benefits, medical). Yeah, I'm saying that the military Industrial complex, war-mongering politicians, and International bankers should pay for that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, that would defeat the whole purpose of profiting without cost. And we all know it is better when someone else pays for shit.

       I can put my 2 cents in on this one.  I was wounded in Afghanistan,which led to my medical retirement from the Army.  The Wounded Warrior Project is an amazing organization.  When i woke up in the hospital after my injury, the first care package i was given that contained shorts, a tee shirt and some other books and whatnot was from them.  It was a lifesaver truly. (They cut off all your clothes when you're medivaced so i had none other than the gown when i awoke).  Since being discharged they have offered me unlimited support and even sent me and my family on outings to destress and help me reintegrate.  As for the government, it has been over 3 years and i have yet to get my backpay from the VA.  Its taken them also until now, and it still hasn't happened  to "review" my marriage certificate to acknowledge that i have a spouse and add her as a dependent.  Medical appointments you must wait months for, therefore you just give up and pay to see a civilian doc out of pocket.  I can't work, bit yet the VA still moves at a snails pace to pay out my claim not giving a fuck one if I can financially make it.  I wrote my congressman in hopes they could assist in moving the issue along, got a letter telling me how "appalled" they were at my situation and it would be foxed post haste.  That was 2 years ago, I haven't heard a peep since.  So basically without organizations like the WWP, troops like me would be given the shaft completely.  And the events let you be around like minded, disabled brothers and sisters. Having PTSD, you really don't interact with people anymore, and civilians don't "get you" since they have no comparable experience in their lives to war. I hope this helps, and if you have any further questions i would be more than happy to answer.  Please forgive spelling errors and shitty formatting as i am on mobile and cant see what the hell I'm typing. Its just type, and hope for the best at this point.

       Civilians don't 'get you' because most individuals who have a conscious refuse to be a part of a death cult and willing to kill people for a paycheck. Maybe your current situation is a form of karma coming back at you for choosing to be a part of the MIC cult that is perpetuating the suffering of humanity.

       Thank you for your service.  Its total bs you and the many like you have to go through this shit when it was an all volunteer army.  As I stated in the comment thread, if the chicken hawks had to go fight or send one of their kids to if they were to old, im betting for one, we probably wouldnt be in everyone business, and two, there would be no problems with the VA.  God bless the wounded warrior program, i still think its bs we need one, but for people like you, im glad its there.

       I don't understand why a mere $100 million from the black budget yearly can't be used for this.  It's mind boggling how much money we shit away for "defense," yet can't provide basic care for the vets who give their lives in the same war machine.

       The one that really got my dog was the plea for socks for soldiers. I'm like, you mean to tell me that soldiers serving overseas in war zones aren't provided the socks they need? I talked to a father whose son just got back from a few years overseas and he confirmed for me that he had to send all sorts of essential supplies to his son...including socks.

       As a vet myself I'm lucky to not be physically injured, I have a friend who is and it makes me sick how the VA would do nothing for him until it got to the point that he could barely walk and he is only 30! Its this kind of care that make me not want to go and talk to them about my issues, I'm afraid what they might do to me.

       When did this sub become soldier friendly? Fuck the troops, these fuckers can suffer for all I care, they volunteered to go help carry out horrific US foreign policy and know they are going to cry about getting injured because the people they were oppressing actually had the gall to fight back? I have noticed that his sub has been getting much more racist in relation to how soldier friendly it has been getting, not a coincidence at all as soldiers are some of the most vile, racist, and despicable humans in this country.

       We are supposed to be our government, but we have been not living up to our end of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excerpt from the Declaration of Independence -
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.
      </p>
      <p>
       --Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope it doesn't come down to those dramitic circumstances, but we the public have been asleep at the switch for far too long and imo its as much our fault for letting it get to this, as it is theirs for doing it.   We shoulder equal blame, but what to we do now to make it right?

       That's the brutal honest truth but most people will refuse to accept it. They have been brainwashed to believe these people are heroes far too long to see the big picture.

       This sub has been slowly taken over by super racist soldiers in the last year who are clearly trying to push an agenda and influence what is discussed.

       is what a successful post and discussion looked like just a year ago, today there's lots of soldier apologists and unhinged racists steering the conversation.

       I will try, but I dont know if I can deal with Phil Donahue for any amount of time.   Seems like the powers that be know this also and probably why they have Donahue doing it.

       The post is just something that I thought of after seeing the commercials like 3 commercial breaks in a row, and just made me go WTF?  Are these people seriously not given the care they need from the government that sent them to war?  An illegal one at that?

       im not surprised as much as i am pist.  I totally think the wars were bs, but the government needs to take care of them.  The whole you break it you buy it thing.  But they dont exactely have a good record with that either.

       I'm not a vet or never will be but don't you think that's a little insensitive? I don't agree with our foreign policy at all but you can't deny that if shit were to hit the fan, those dudes and gals, some of which are my friends, would be out there to make sure we're alright no matter what the agenda is. And many of them would have our backs no matter what goes on domestically.

       Agreed. For many people, the military is the best opportunity they have to make a decent living to support a family. Not everyone has the resources for college. I've also heard of people who've been arrested for things like drug charges being told that they can either go to jail or agree to join the military, presumably as a type of "second chance" way to turn their lives around. Kind of hard to blame people facing that decision.
