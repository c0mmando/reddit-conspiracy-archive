<p>This journal was published quarterly from 1908 until 1968 when it changed names to the more politically correct title of <em>Social Biology.</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s filled with articles by elite U.S. and British intellectuals calling for forced sterilization, population reduction, etc. They are very open about these plans, and even admit that overpopulation is really just a euphemism for mass murder so that the Anglosphere can remain dominant. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2986352/">Here&#39;s</a> an article entitled &quot;Eugenically Desirable Types.&quot; </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an excerpt from <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2982454/pdf/eugenrev00024-0015.pdf">another fascinating article</a>: </p>

<p>&quot;Jefferson himself belonged to that interrelated
Virginian social Elite to which the new nation&#39;s
debt was so obviously great. He and John
Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court,
and Edmund Randolph, first Attorney General
of the U.S.A. were cousins, all three descended
from William Randolph, butler to Edward,
Lord Zouche in the reign of Elizabeth I. It
could hardly have been hidden from these
people that the sort of endogamous group or
class of which they were members combined the
advantages of good nature and good nurture.
Then why did Jefferson proclaim that men &quot;are
created equal?&quot; &quot;His task,&quot; says the American
historian Nathaniel Weyl, &quot;was to wage psychological
warfare.&quot;</p>

<p>Game over. </p>

<p>Edit: there is an absolutely massive amount of information here. Any one interested in putting together a research project?</p>

<p>Conspiracies aside, overpopulation is still a very real problem. And, it will continue to become a bigger problem than can be handled, unless major changes are introduced in our food production and allocation methods, as well as sustainable living environments built for massive populations. Speaking as realistically as possible with the known facts, earth cannot support the human race if we continue on the same way we are now. Simple as that. Either our earth will fail (as we are starting to see with the growing number of climate-change induced events) or our race will collapse in on itself. <a href="http://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2428&amp;amp;context=open_access_etds">See Calhoun&#39;s Overpopulation Study with mice.</a> Eventually drastic actions will need to be taken to prevent the total extinction of the human population. It is a cold, frightening, and depressing truth. I wrote a research paper on overpopulation, and I can provide some more facts and sources if people would like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The notion of eugenics or &quot;social biology&quot; being a necessary evil to ensure the propagation of desireable genes or to prevent degeneracy is an outright monstrosity of a lie. </p>

<p>Nature doesn&#39;t need a helping hand because that would directly contradict the reason for eugenics in the first place! </p>

<p>If you were born debilitated then by default you don&#39;t get to procreate to the extent of messing up the desired genepool. Let me put this frankly so the real retards get it straight away: a mongoloid doesn&#39;t get to impregnate, nor does a person with &#39;undesireable&#39; traits. Too ugly? Too dumb? Too poor? Too sick? Trying to survive out there is more than enough, let alone getting a shot at succesfully procreating and rearing offspring with another human being that has the &#39;right&#39; traits. Somewhere down the lineage it stops automatically, but not soon enough for the vile scum who want what little the disadvantaged, heavily burdoned need to not live in pure agony!</p>

<p>What&#39;s the framework to which those desireable traits correspond? Social constructs! Ideological systems! Labour schemes! Arbitrary nonsense passed down from generation to generation without us still consciously knowing what led to it. </p>

<p>Who creates those? Not some invisible hand, a god or even nature ... </p>

<p>We all did under the auspices of a bunch of money and power hungry sociopaths on top of the food chain for as long as we&#39;ve been &#39;civilized&#39; ... Every foolish narcissist who thought he was congruent to the ideal happily went along. But they never were! Nobody was or is! They change overnight. The ones who decree those standards and ideals don&#39;t correspond to it themselves. </p>

<p>Winston Churchill? Bipolar! Roosevelt? Paraplegic! Hitler? Autistic drug addicted failure and by no means &#39;Aryan&#39;! European aristocrats or royals? Inbreds suffering degeneration! </p>

<p>Two decades ago, a computer geek was an autistic outcast that got massively shunned. Now all of a sudden they&#39;re demi-gods. There are dozens of examples of this ... Van Gogh was bipolar and spent his life in miserable poverty or insane asylums. Now his paintings are considered too invaluable to even roughly estimate the price tag.</p>

<p>This reminds me of this post on the front page of pound dogs looking absolutely ill and then when they got adopted suddenly started to radiate happiness and well-being. Imagine doing that to human beings once in a while: giving them a fucking chance or a second one ... or as much as they bloody need! The world would be an entirely different place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t think that quite solves the problem. First off, you&#39;re going to see a lot of people&#39;s intelligence suddenly jump to 76 IQ points -- after all, those administering the tests are human, too.</p>

<p>Now if you were to extend this condition to all welfare, that would take care of the arbitrary intelligence threshold. You want welfare? You can&#39;t have kids.</p>

<p>But of course, that can never be implemented politically. It&#39;s equivalent to the proposition that voters should vote against their interests -- and there are far too many voting welfare recipients for that to happen.</p>

<p>So how, again, does violence solve this problem created by violence?</p>

<p>Convieniently missing in this reply is that sure, this happened, but the only way they managed to do it was through overt or covert control of the indiginous people&#39;s freedoms, economic systems, and the use of the  slave trade (Irish, Africans, etc) to build up their industrial targets. </p>

<p>It&#39;s ultimately a system that was built on blood, sweat, and tears of those less fortunate, and they were indoctrinated to believe that the grass aint always greener and surely their children will have a better life than themselves, if we all just work hard enough.</p>

<p>So why are you using your money (also known as capital) to buy that smart phone if you are so concerned about where it came from?   This is one of the most powerful aspects of capitalism,  to vote with your dollars.  Your not forced to buy anything,  as opposed to Socialist or Communist systems. So you knowingly are buying products that used slave labor to make it,  and then complaining about how it&#39;s made while literally typing on it. Seems pretty hypocritical to me. </p>

<p>Again,  you never answered my question,  if not free market capitalism,  THEN WHAT?   Where is there anymore opportunity in this world then America,  and why isn&#39;t much of the rest of the world trying to come there instead of here?

<p>Because in order to accomplish what i think I need to accomplish, I need this thing to communicate with as many people as I can. And I bought this new phone off craigslist used, rooted and wiped it, and stopped paying ridiculous wireless bills to Big Red years ago. </p>

<p>At least I acknowledge the flaws in this globalistic capitalist system - but I was born into it and still hold the belief that if change were to actually happen, it&#39;s through nonviolence whenever necessary, must come from within, and awareness every where else. </p>

<p>You keep railing against these systems without acknowledging that the US system is itself socialist and communist in many ways, but will most likely point to their flawed executions in Soviet Russia and Red China, when there are many other reasons for their failures (namely despotic murserous leaders, but if there&#39;s one thing the human race in general can produce effectively, it&#39;s those dudes.

<p>Slavery was NOT unique to white western civilization you idiot! It was and still is practiced in Africa today! Slavery was happening way before the evil white man civilization took over the world. Read ancient history. The white man ABOLISHED SLAVERY! <strong>A civil war in America paid the debt for slavery with blood and lives of 650,000 white men in the civil war to abolish it!</strong> No other payment is necessary.</p>
