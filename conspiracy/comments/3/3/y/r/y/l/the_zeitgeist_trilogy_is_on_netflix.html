       I was under the impression that Zeitgeist is not the type of doco we want to be associated with. It does have some good things in it, but at the same time a lot of it was been proven false.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if the powers at be were the makers of this. It's got soo much bullshit in it that anything true is instantly discredited. Also if it was legit then how come it's left of netflix?

       I think this is the only 9/11 conspiracy flick on there, actually.  There was one movie in the DVD section I think about how they suppressed the "docudrama"
       <em>
        The Road To 911
       </em>
       , but that was really just Fox News whining about how the Clintons destroyed their movie.  It was still an interesting watch, but not exactly what I would consider a 911 conspiracy flick in the normal sense.

       Perhaps non-coincidentally it is the 9/11 doc with the most spirituality and verifiable non-facts.

       Well, he's not, but even if he was, that isn't the point. The point is he created a thought-provoking documentary series that shows how flawed our system is and that we as a species have the complete potential to change it and make it so that it benefits everyone living on this planet instead of a select few. Nothing will ever be perfect, but we will ALWAYS have the ability to make things better. To refuse to take initiative is to refuse your own freedom.

       There's nothing wrong with democratic socialism. The problem is full blown socialism/communism or on the other equation full blown capitalism. There's nothing wrong with taxes to pay for things the government provides, the rich just need to pay their fair share. What we don't need is money going towards a huge war machine and intelligence agencies that carry out assassinations and false-flag terror attacks, create war, and control the illegal drug trade.

       Zeitgeist had a lot of false stuff in it, like it's attempt to debunk the Bible.

       The Bible is ridiculous. Regardless whether his debunking was accurate or not, the fact is that religion separates man from each other. I have read the Bible and there are more hateful ideas in it than ideas promoting unconditional love. It may offend and hurt some, but religion has to go if we want to move forward as a planet.

       I agree with you somewhat in principle as people are holding on to outdated aspects of religion, such as ideas that you must believe what they believe or you are doomed, but what about Jesus narrowing the ten commandments down to 2 commandments, love God and love one another, this is what I take from the Bible, this is the part of importance.

       The point is the Bible is obsolete. It should have no presence in today's society to try and dictate how we live our lives. The commandments were never real. God never told anybody to love anybody. Humans love by nature and destroy by behavior.

       I agree that the Bible is obsolete. I believe humans were of a more ignorant barbaric nature in the past and God has worked to progress humanity. Jesus was a light in the world creating a revolution of love at a time when people were ready to receive his message. No one needs the Bible today, but it's history is interesting for seeing where we've come from and where we are now.

       You are right. In the story of the Bible, Jesus loved lepers, prostitutes, sinners, the poor, (but not gays, they can go to Hell), yet we see that the people who are highest in political power boast of how they devote their lives to Jesus, yet they fail to follow his teaching of caring for the sick and the poor. Instead, they use it to manipulate voters and pocket as much money as they can. The only thing they seem to practice from the Bible is hating gays and shaming others, damning them for being "wrong". I will believe there is a God when he rids the world of poverty, sickness, and all other horrible devices he is responsible for. God would be a tyrant if he truly existed. If people truly wish to worship a god, they should worship all of creation instead. They should keep their Earth healthy and clean. They should appreciate the mysterious and infinite unknown of the universe and embrace its magnificence, not sucking up to some man so they can get into "Heaven". These people are constantly worried about what happens after they die and to make it into Heaven, but their ignorance prevents them from seeing that they have the complete capability to create their own Heaven on Earth if they were truly willing to embrace and spread unconditional love and unite with others as a people. If every religious person did that instead of making reasons to start wars and kill others for their lack of faith, I would respect religion.

       The message of Jesus is one of unconditional love and there are many Christians that do practice this. There are many people who are ignorant though. People are given free will and there are those who use their free will to cause harm, so that is why there is many problems. You can't earn your way into heaven it's a free gift from God.
