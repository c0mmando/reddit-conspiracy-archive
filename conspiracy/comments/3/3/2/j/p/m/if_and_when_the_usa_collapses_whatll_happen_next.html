       In my opinion technology is the greatest enemy of the state: decentralized power, local manufacturing via 3D printers, peer-to-peer internet, and farming automation's ability to lower food cost. These will allow neighborhoods to be islands independent of government. The elimination of scarcity will also lower crime and some international strife, thus softening the "Boogey Man Effect."

       The British-American Empire will coexist their rulership with the UN, since they created it in the first place. The Empire isn't going anywhere, but a Global take over will continue with a slow downward spiral for the middle class, till the reality that your grandkids will be in will be a normal way of life that we cant even fathom yet. So far removed from what we remember as our normal, that it will be mindblowing for those that get to see it, but yet totally an acceptable way of life for those who know nothing else.

       That's assuming the military doesn't get involved. And if you look at how they are planning when shit hits the fan. From natural disaster or a full ok collapse of America. The elites have a lot of plans for then. ESP since we won't have our rights that the constitution  states. They are setting up specifically for this if you ask me. And waiting for and egging on a catalyst.

       I think it will balkanize. When it collapses (I think it's coming), there are too many armed people in the US and we have very strong militias. I think civil war will break out and the nation will split up into city states. The elites are done with the US being the world's super power. The elites are looking into China as their host to infect with their cancerous ways.

       You've got to account for the fact that some military leaders will not go with the flow, and will take their toys and play with the other side, National Guard units will tend to support and protect their local interests, and as we saw in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq, a highly motivated local force can do plenty of damage to a far superior military force, even win.

       I don't generally disagree, however it should be noted that the Obama administration has removed (fired, forced retirement) and replaced
       <em>
        hundreds

       of top, long-serving military officials.

       I have seen the various stories about these removals, and don't doubt that they are happening but I don't know the real circumstances behind these removals. Just because an officer directs troops to do something, does not mean that the order will be followed.  If we have a general collapse, that will change the basic relationship between leaders and soldiers, mainly because now, these soldiers families and friends back home are now in direct danger.  And, there are elements inside the military that disagree with the whole NWO and other unconstitutional tangents that the country has been taking.  So if things fall apart there will be factions.

       History is replete with examples of insurgent groups defeating superior military forces.  Our own American rebels did it to the vaunted British Army back in our war of Independence. Wars of attrition aren't won with superior weaponry, they are won in the hearts and minds of the fighters.

       IS is seizing military bases in Iraq to get such weapons. What makes you think that if shit really got that bad, militias and ex military wouldn't do the same? What I said may have been cute to you, but what you said was naive to me.

       I'm generally not much for sharing my views on things like this.  Not because I don't want to share, it just seems my opinion tends to differ quite a bit.  And sometimes not.  But I wanted to comment on this because it's one of the things I am interested in.  And not in an exciting hobby sort of way.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Divided?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's my opinion.  It is my belief, that the people have been continually 'pushed' and 'incited' to divide in a (un)natural fashion that makes it appear that human beings are just plain terrible creatures.  And I know some are.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I believe that TPTB have had a continual hand in keeping Racism alive.  Granted, there are many regions of this country that are saturated by this.  But there are then so many others where Racism just isn't really 'a thing' any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        It is my genuine belief
       </em>
       that we, as a species, should have left crude things like that in the past decades ago.  I realize that I have what is possibly a "unique" way of viewing this because although I was exposed to racism all around me, I never personally understood the logic in it.  I guess in some weird way I was 'lucky' enough to have none of those, what I consider to be, irrational views.  I have never been Racist or Sexist.  I have never looked down on peoples personal religion even though I already knew at around age 10 that the prominent views around me weren't something I could subscribe to.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I know I can't be alone in this.  I can't be the only "white boy" who saw these types of views as crude and void of reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at what is happening right now in our universities.  This generation is further splintering all in the name of 'rights' and 'equality'.  So if this race, or this sex, or this sexual preference has 'special rights', then they feel that their personal race/sex/relgion/preference/etc should have them too. It is mind boggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, all said and done, everyone will end up equal.  -  Yes I realize that is, what should be, the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I choose to believe that if we just stopped behaving like animals and just respected each others' life, we could do away with all the time, money, resources, diverted teaching, and so many other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now the entire country is splintering further, the gaps becoming larger, and they are all learning to be 'against' all of the others.  Now I consider that to be the brilliant and absolutely messed up end-game.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Divided.  Absolutely.  More and more every single day.  When it should be quite the opposite.  Because how can we, as a people, stand up against tyranny if we have no one to stand with?  Gah I find it so disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that is how I feel about that small part of the inevitable collapse of a nation.
