    <div class="md"><p>I do think it would gradually crumble, but the last bits will have selective violence. </p>

<p>In my opinion technology is the greatest enemy of the state: decentralized power, local manufacturing via 3D printers, peer-to-peer internet, and farming automation&#39;s ability to lower food cost. These will allow neighborhoods to be islands independent of government. The elimination of scarcity will also lower crime and some international strife, thus softening the &quot;Boogey Man Effect.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s assuming the military doesn&#39;t get involved. And if you look at how they are planning when shit hits the fan. From natural disaster or a full ok collapse of America. The elites have a lot of plans for then. ESP since we won&#39;t have our rights that the constitution  states. They are setting up specifically for this if you ask me. And waiting for and egging on a catalyst. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen the various stories about these removals, and don&#39;t doubt that they are happening but I don&#39;t know the real circumstances behind these removals. Just because an officer directs troops to do something, does not mean that the order will be followed.  If we have a general collapse, that will change the basic relationship between leaders and soldiers, mainly because now, these soldiers families and friends back home are now in direct danger.  And, there are elements inside the military that disagree with the whole NWO and other unconstitutional tangents that the country has been taking.  So if things fall apart there will be factions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m generally not much for sharing my views on things like this.  Not because I don&#39;t want to share, it just seems my opinion tends to differ quite a bit.  And sometimes not.  But I wanted to comment on this because it&#39;s one of the things I am interested in.  And not in an exciting hobby sort of way. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Divided?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  </p>

<p>And here&#39;s my opinion.  It is my belief, that the people have been continually &#39;pushed&#39; and &#39;incited&#39; to divide in a (un)natural fashion that makes it appear that human beings are just plain terrible creatures.  And I know some are.</p>

<p>First, I believe that TPTB have had a continual hand in keeping Racism alive.  Granted, there are many regions of this country that are saturated by this.  But there are then so many others where Racism just isn&#39;t really &#39;a thing&#39; any longer.</p>

<p><em>It is my genuine belief</em> that we, as a species, should have left crude things like that in the past decades ago.  I realize that I have what is possibly a &quot;unique&quot; way of viewing this because although I was exposed to racism all around me, I never personally understood the logic in it.  I guess in some weird way I was &#39;lucky&#39; enough to have none of those, what I consider to be, irrational views.  I have never been Racist or Sexist.  I have never looked down on peoples personal religion even though I already knew at around age 10 that the prominent views around me weren&#39;t something I could subscribe to.</p>

<p>And I know I can&#39;t be alone in this.  I can&#39;t be the only &quot;white boy&quot; who saw these types of views as crude and void of reason.</p>

<p>Just look at what is happening right now in our universities.  This generation is further splintering all in the name of &#39;rights&#39; and &#39;equality&#39;.  So if this race, or this sex, or this sexual preference has &#39;special rights&#39;, then they feel that their personal race/sex/relgion/preference/etc should have them too. It is mind boggling.</p>

<p>Essentially, all said and done, everyone will end up equal.  -  Yes I realize that is, what should be, the point.</p>

<p>I choose to believe that if we just stopped behaving like animals and just respected each others&#39; life, we could do away with all the time, money, resources, diverted teaching, and so many other things.</p>

<p>Right now the entire country is splintering further, the gaps becoming larger, and they are all learning to be &#39;against&#39; all of the others.  Now I consider that to be the brilliant and absolutely messed up end-game.  </p>

<p>So Divided.  Absolutely.  More and more every single day.  When it should be quite the opposite.  Because how can we, as a people, stand up against tyranny if we have no one to stand with?  Gah I find it so disgusting.</p>

<p>So, that is how I feel about that small part of the inevitable collapse of a nation.</p>
