      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The objective of the session is to put us in the best position possible to make a decision as to whether we should proceed to the next steps in seeking site blocking in the US.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first step is a pre-phase in which we will get prepared and try to create a more favorable environment for site blocking. This would involve multiple parallel tracks. Without attempting to be exhaustive, those tracks include:
Outreach to respected technologists to begin to forge agreement on technical facts and site blocking efficacy — and, where possible, garner policy support for site blocking (or at least dampen opposition to it).
Continued research and record building on the effectiveness of site blocking.
       </p>
       <p>
        Outreach to academics, think tanks and other third parties to foster the publication of research papers, white papers and other articles that tell the positive story of site blocking: e.g., it is commonplace around the world and working smoothly; it has not broken the internet; it is not incompatible with DNSSEC; it is effective; legitimate sites/content have not been blocked; etc.
       </p>
       <p>
        Building the record (and telling the story) that the sorts of sites at issue are dangerous. It is not just copyright infringement. Kids are one-click away from identity theft, graphic porn, malware, etc. Parent groups, consumer protection groups and other third parties can be cultivated to speak out against such predatory sites.
Telling the positive story of the widespread availability of legitimate content.
At the right time, we would quietly approach ISPs with which we have good relationships and which we believe might consider cooperating with us to test US site blocking. If any US ISPs are prepared to cooperate — and we can create a track record of effective site blocking in the US — the environment for US site blocking more broadly will become significantly more favorable.
We do not need to decide in advance how to proceed if no US ISP is prepared to work with us cooperatively. We recommend that we cross that bridge only if and when we need to, in context of the landscape we face at that point in time.

        US Site-Blocking: We can review the four supplemental analyses that have been circulated. Ultimately, we need to decide whether we want to move forward with a site-blocking strategy and, if so, what the next steps should be. Search “Asks”: A 2013 exercise resulted in a list of six antipiracy asks for search engines. At the GSM, there was consensus that the GCs should attempt to reduce the list to one or two principal asks that we can use in all public advocacy and negotiation venues. For your reference, here are the six asks from the 2013 process: Promote authorized sites. Search engines should obtain and use information from authoritative sources on which sites have been authorized to provide copyrighted content, and use that information to prioritize legitimate sites in rankings for search. De-prioritize rogue sites. Search engines should make meaningful changes to algorithms to ensure that results from infringing sites do not appear on the first pages of search results and to promote the elevation of legitimate sites to take their place. De-index rogue sites.

       Nazis were good people . Or they were just regular first world humans I should say. Hitler was actually the good guy of WW2 if you simplify it. The Holocaust was a sham if you do your research. We've all been conditioned to learn the victor's side of the war and never the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my knowledge it was Poland that started WW2 with the Danzig Massacre or Bloody Friday. But in actuality I have no idea why the US and UK wanted in on the action. Probably the military industrial complex saw it as the best opportunity of the century. But I haven't read "War is a Racket" yet so I wouldn't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes Neo - Nazis have no understanding of Nazis(as they were not racist and were also composed of blacks, Indians, Muslims, Chinese,  ect)  and use the false portrayal as an excuse vent their own racism.

       That's some very skewed information you got there. Whenever Germans occupied a country they never inflicted harm or terrorism. On the other hand when the Allies occupy Germany,  over 2 Million German women were raped, tortured,  killed.

       Google and other search engines have already implemented new algorithms that reorders the search results to give "legitimate" sources top ranking and lowers those they deem illegitimate. I think it has been going on before these attempts that were leaked by wiki leaks. When Google was going to court over their news section; they probably explored new ways to change that section of search capabilities on their own.

       duckduckgo uses Yandex and other crawlers.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's beside the point. Google also honors a site's robot.txt. There is a lot of Internet out there that's unsearchable; that doesn't want to be indexed. This is the other part of the 'darkweb' that doesn't get enough attention; the kind that doesn't need FreeNet or I2P or Tor.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we talk about blocking entire sites at an ISP level; we're going way beyond the implications of it simply being not searchable. We're talking about content being unreachable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite how broken the US government is and how worthless voting is, there are thankfully some lobby groups supported by the people like the ACLU, EFF, Fight for the Future, et. al. that are fairly effective in getting the message out and bringing up legal action to stop a lot of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's enough blowback that something like this would be difficult to pass unless they clocked it in another bill and fast-tracked it. We've seen stuff like this even standup in some Federal courts, which is really messed up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US legal system doesn't really work right now, but there is some effort to at least do some things right. UK style filtering in the US may eventually come, but I think it will take considerably more effort. They really won't even need it once they kill net neutrality. Afterwards, the price for decent servers on connections with a high speed pipe to everyone will grow significantly.

       I don't have a specific link that ELI5's this end-to-end but I would definitely recommend you looking up the leaks related to NSA program's named  'Prism' and (the somewhat lesser publicized) 'Muscular' program. Both make it clear that Google is not to be trusted and their networks are under NSA surveillance 24/7.
      </p>

       Same goes for most major social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and large file sharing services like Dropbox..

       Hell I would not be surprised at all to discover that Reddit is giving up users privacy as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       With more than 6% of the planet using Reddit it would absolutely be one of the top sites I would get my hooks into if I were looking to track and monitor people!!

       You could say the same about bitcoin itself :) Thing is, its still better than centralized solutions controlled by 1%.

       Bitcoin or Ethereum are just parts of something much bigger - blockchain technology, which means decentralization of digital world. Can it be influenced? Of course. Can it be controlled? Hardly.

       Bitcoin is awful. Advocates say it's "Better money" but that's like taking a giant pile of shit and saying it's better shit. It's just as bad as metalists talking about the gold standard (gold has no value. You can't eat it, put it on your car; it only has value because of social constructions...just like fiat currency).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus it takes more power to mine BTC than the current value. It's horrible for the environment.

       I think you misunderstand. I'm against currency in general....and capitalism for that mattet. You cannot have infinate growth with finite resources, and we are no where near getting people on Mars or mining astroids.
      </p>
      <p>
       With ever new piece of technology that comes out, I always wonder when we're going to run ou tof copper...or zinc or any of the other resources used to make all our tech. Everything you buy contribues to massive pools of toxic waste in parts of China.

       No everyone needs to work. Not everyone needs money. The majority of history has us living without money (or barter...the barter system is a total economic myth. The earliest systems were all credit based).

      <p>
       Why do we need a replacement? Human economies existed for thousands of years without currency. People shared to each of their abilities. Money actually removes personal aspects from a transaction. Money adds the impersonal. Even if you charge a friend for something; if it's a small thing like a jar of sauce you made and you offer it to people at work -- the price tends to be not that much. Sometimes we buy a beer for someone and someone buys us one; but with friends you don't keep track on the "tit-for-tat" ... buying beers of equal quality and balancing out the scales. Some people do...but think about those people and their personalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now in the modern world, this is difficult. How do we get rid of the need for money? Technology needs to eliminate scarcity. Think about the fictional Star Trek world. In this world, the energy problem has been solved. The resource problem has been solved (they can replicate anything; they truly control the power of the atom).
      </p>
      <p>
       We need some pretty big advances: better energy storage (all our batteries are horrible when you think about them), cheaper/cleaner energy generation (pure water reactors -- Toyota pumped years of research into them...we can generate power from water, but we don't know how, so it's not consistent or predictable. See the documentary: Fire From Water). 3D printers are a start, but they still require a lot of oil (plastic).
      </p>
      <p>
       It will take a lot, but once you remove scarcity, the way the world works will change. When you can reproduce a piece of art, atom by atom, it looses a certain aspect of its value. But you gain so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will it happen? I don't know. But I think it has to within the next 500 years. We have never been so close to our own extinction.

       this isnt really a suprise... Copyright holders have always been pushing for the ability to block sites they dont like. Hell, when the mp3 player was invented they tried to get it banned.
censorship of the internet is inevitable, sadly. we just need to work on finding was around it.

       It isn't just about copyright infringement - there are groups and organizations that have been working their asses off to censor the net (and
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       forms of speech) for decades - and their motives are political, rather than commercial.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Zionist
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League">
        Anti-Defamation League
       </a>
       and their international counterparts have led the charge to censor the net via government regulation since its inception, and they have been very successful in doing so in many countries (see Holocaust Denial and "Hate Speech" laws)- but in spite of their best efforts, their attempts in the US have been stymied by that pesky First Amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frustrated by their inability to get government to take action, they have formulated a new strategy that will utilize the methods described in the Wikileaks documents above: Pressuring search engines, ISP's and other non-governmental entities into blocking access to websites and content that they don't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       The strategy is outlined in a 2013 book co-authored by ADL Director Abraham Foxman:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/cyber-safety/c/viral-hate/viral-hate.html">
         Viral Hate: Containing Its Spread on the Internet
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Calls for violence, bigoted rants, lies, bullying, and
        <strong>
         conspiracy theories
        </strong>
        circulate openly on the Web, with effects on individuals and society that are profound – and dangerous
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       [...]
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The authors expose the threat that this unregulated flow of bigotry poses to the world, exploring how social media companies are struggling to reconcile the demands of business with freedom of speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then they look at the options society has for addressing the problem, showing that the principles of free expression and the dangers of censorship make legal action the least viable option.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that does not mean that society must simply accept Internet hate.
        <strong>
         Viral Hate is a call for increased action by Internet companies to speak out against hate-filled content and to take active steps toward a more civil Internet
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The ADL hides behind the cloak of "protecting minorities and children", but anyone who is familiar with this insidious organization and its sordid history knows that their motives are PURELY political, and that their primary mission is to deflect criticism of Israel and Zionist movements, and their influence over US government and foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1990's the ADL was involved in a massive scandal when it was caught spying on US government officials, private and religious organizations and individuals on the behalf of Israel and South Africa.

       It helps a lot of big players: Big media companies (they can remove torrents from Google search results, but they can't blog the actual trackers), big telecom that wants to charge more for bandwidth, government propaganda agencies that want control the flow of information more strictly, private prisons that benefit from more people being put in jail, and the list goes on and on an on

       Nazis were good people . Or they were just regular first world humans I should say. Hitler was actually the good guy of WW2 if you simplify it. The Holocaust was a sham if you do your research. We've all been conditioned to learn the victor's side of the war and never the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my knowledge it was Poland that started WW2 with the Danzig Massacre or Bloody Friday. But in actuality I have no idea why the US and UK wanted in on the action. Probably the military industrial complex saw it as the best opportunity of the century. But I haven't read "War is a Racket" yet so I wouldn't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes Neo - Nazis have no understanding of Nazis(as they were not racist and were also composed of blacks, Indians, Muslims, Chinese,  ect)  and use the false portrayal as an excuse vent their own racism.
