        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Well it started a few months ago, my mom started watching some conspiracy videos on YouTube. At first I didn&#39;t think much of it because I went through a phase where I did the same thing when I was around 13. For me it passed fairly quickly and I didn&#39;t care much for conspiracies thereafter, because there are much better things to devote my time to. My mom is a mild manic-depressive and has taken meds on and off over the years. She doesn&#39;t take meds anymore because she saw videos of how those meds are meant to control you or do more harm than good. I guess why I&#39;m posting here is because I&#39;m starting to get worried about her, and want to know what I should do about this or if I should do anything. She has drastically changed her diet ( I think she is on the Keto diet) and refuses to drink our fluoride-enriched tap water. Today she was telling me about how Katie Perry is actually Jonbenet Ramsey (that child that went missing many years ago). &quot;The world is being ran by Satan, and that is why there are so many gays&quot;, quote from my mom.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>there are much better things to devote my time to. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really?  Like what?  Not saying there aren’t “better things to devote your time to”, but I’m wondering what you consider are “better” or more important things than understanding the extent to which this entire planet is awash with manipulation by a ruling elite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and want to know what I should do about this or if I should do anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some accounts are mostly b.s.  Others are more factual than not.  Firstly, it might not be a bad idea to actually <em>find out</em> what KIND of information she’s investigating.  The field is very big and she could be looking into all kinds of things - some valid, some not.  Then find out what her feelings on it are.  If she thinks “Men in black are out to get me because of this information I’m investigating!” then this isn’t really the fault of the information as much as it is the fault of your mother’s own mental/psychological issues.  Let her know that discovering the world is fucked doesn’t necessarily mean that <em>her own life</em> is in immediate danger or peril.  Her life will likely continue on just the same even if she DOES find out all kinds of heinous stuff about the world we live in.</p>

<p>Granted, being able to help her in this way and explaining that she’ll likely be alright regardless involves YOU YOURSELF understanding the truth about much of what she’s investigating also.  You won’t help her at all if you were to say “This is all stupid, mom.  None of this is real anyway.”  Those are the words of the ignorant, and even she will be able to see right through that.  You have to first give the information she’s investigating respect and let her know that you are looking at what she’s looking at with honesty.</p>

<p>Then let her know that, again, even if she’s <em>right</em> about shit being fucked up, she can (and should) still strive toward being a balanced, intelligent being.  Existence on this planet is a lot about YOU as an individual simply being as intelligent and responsible as you can be through the trials you get presented in this life REGARDLESS of what those trials happen to be.</p>

<p>You yourself have to raise your own level of intelligence and awareness in order to help her in this manner, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>She has drastically changed her diet…and refuses to drink our fluoride-enriched tap water. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And?  That’s a <em>good</em> thing, dude.  Is that some sort of bad thing?  Is this something that you’re using as a reason why she’s “going crazy”? because she’s refusing to drink water that you yourself <em>know</em> has fluoride in it?  What?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today she was telling me about how Katie Perry is actually Jonbenet Ramsey (that child that went missing many years ago). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, well <em>that</em> sounds a bit unfounded and might possibly have more to do with her own mental issues than any type of “conspiracy theories” she’s looking into in general.  Again, if you want to help her, it would behoove YOU to understand that there is a lot on this planet that is most definitely NOT how the MSM and TPTB present them to be.  Your mom may not be right specifically, but she is not incorrect if she feels that there is a lot of underhanded manipulation going on here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The world is being ran by Satan, and that is why there are so many gays&quot;, quote from my mom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay.  And?  If she says something like this, then your best bet w/regard to how to “help” her is to say “Yeah, mom.  The world does seem like it is greatly controlled by not very good forces - whether it be Satan or whoever/whatever else.  I’m not sure you can really help those other people out too much, but you CAN help yourself.  Know that you don’t have to get too worked up or get too antsy about too many of these issues.  They’re going to happen regardless of whether you get worked up about them or not…so just continue educating yourself, but try to be as chill about it as possible.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I&#39;m on my phone writing this, but when I say I have better things to devote my time to, I mean im a full time college student who lives at home while also working 32 hours a week, I prefer to spend the little free time I have spending time with my friends, going to concerts, or having other fun. I just think that is a happier way to live my life than thinking about how fucked up the world is, when I can do virtually nothing about it. As for your other points, you are right in that I should be more understanding of her, and I agree it&#39;s not all bad that she is changing her lifestyle. I&#39;m just a little worried because my mom is the type to fall for things easily. She bought those garcinia cambogia pills she saw on Dr. Oz, she once believed an Indian guy on the phone that her PC has a virus and let him remotely control the computer and put a ton of adware on it and then charged her for over $100. I don&#39;t know if she will take this conspiracy thing a little too far. As of right now it&#39;s fine. I was just looming for some other opinions about this situation. And thanks for taking the time to reply to my post. I&#39;ll talk more with my family about this when I have more time.</p>

<p>So, in other words, “I’m too busy being a wage slave while I willingly pay an institution money I don’t have so that they can brainwash me with state propaganda designed to make me an even better wage slave than I currently am.”…right?  Is that it?</p>

<p>Now, to be sure, I myself am as much of a wage slave sheep as the next wage slave sheep.  However, <em>I understand</em> that that’s what I am and don’t try to think I’m something different than that.  I understand that that’s what I and all of us have to work <em>out</em> of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I prefer to spend the little free time I have spending time with my friends, going to concerts, or having other fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having “fun”, right?  Well good.  Have “fun”.  Most definitely.  We don’t necessarily want to spend our entire lives being curmudgeons, after all.  However, realize that on THIS planet, the more you <em>don’t</em> pay attention to what is really going on in the world around you, the easier it is to manipulate you and have you chase your tail in a wheel in a maze like a hamster without your even knowing that that’s what you’re being made to do.  A lot of “fun” activities and “parties” and “woo hoo!” things ultimately do little other than drive you deeper into the maze of an unthinking, un-critical life that is not self-examined.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that this is what <em>you</em> are per se or that this is what <em>you</em> do.  I’m just saying be very careful and be very aware of these things…and I’m not super sure you <em>are</em> aware of them is all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just think that is a happier way to live my life than thinking about how fucked up the world is</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are the words of the sheep in the slaughter house that says it is much better to simply not think about the fact that you’re a sheep in a slaughter house.  <em>“Why think about it?  It’ll just make you sad!  Better to just laugh and pretend we’re all okay and we’re NOT in a slaughter house!”</em>  Well, the fact of the matter is that you have a SIGNIFICANTLY better chance of actually <em>getting out</em> and NO LONGER being a sheep in a slaughter house if you actually <em>think</em> about the reality of the world around you and the <em>real</em> state that you find yourself in.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid of what is difficult or what is frightening.  The manipulation exists to a great extent in this world because your/my/our ignorance does not examine it sufficiently to GET RID OF IT.</p>

<p>The unexamined life is the one that is the <em>real</em> tragedy…even if that life is spent “laughing and merry” in social gatherings, etc…that life is one that is generally wasted if it does not take a really good, hard, critical, <em>deep</em> look at what is really going on around it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when I can do virtually nothing about it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is what the powers around you (us) controlling this civilization manipulate you into thinking is the case.  This is not true, however.  There is a lot you can do about it.  It might not be external or in the <em>outside</em> world.  It might not involve “going to congress and changing laws!”.  However, the more you DO look at it, the more you can understand that your INNER world is significantly effected by what you do not know and what you do not act on while you are on this planet.  If you DO become aware of what is going on inside your heart and mind, however, and you make an effort to understand what’s going on IN THERE, then you have a much better chance of not living your life flying blind and being easily subject to the whims and manipulation of a ruling elite that <em>depend</em> on your ignorance in order to continue manipulating you.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you make a greater effort to understand yourself and the world around you, then you will have a MUCH greater chance of evolving and developing better as a spiritual being <em>independent</em> of the physical vehicle that you happen to be manifesting in currently (i.e. the body).  THAT will really help you as you continue on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just a little worried because my mom is the type to fall for things easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then, if you can, you should help her KEEP from falling into things too easily.  That involves, again, YOU YOURSELF making sure and not being a dupe either (that way you’ll be able to help keep her from falling into the wrong things…otherwise it might be little more than the blind leading the blind).  If you really want to make sure she doesn’t fall for the wrong kind of manipulation, then it’s best for YOU YOURSELF to investigate things as well.  That way you’ll be able to say “Mom, this stuff right here you’re investigating I think is wrong, and this is why.  However, THIS stuff right here that you’re investigating <em>does</em> seem to be valid and <em>does</em> seem to be correct.” etc, etc.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don’t know anything about “garcinia cambogia”, but I have heard that a lot of the Indian phone dudes should NOT by any means be trusted.  Your mom sounds like she is at an early stage of “awakening” where she is in a VERY vulnerable place.  She knows enough at this point to know that shit IS indeed fucked up in this world…but she’s not understanding or knowledgeable enough to know WHAT specifically is fucked up.  She doesn’t know enough to not trust a lot of the junk that’s out there.  She’s not aware enough to understand that there is a lot disinformation and misinformation.  She seems to be at a stage where she might be falling for the <em>bad</em>/fake “conspiracies” as much as anything else.  It’s called couintelpro (short for Covert Intelligent Programs).  There is a LOT of, again, misinformation and disinformation designed to get a lot of people AFRAID of digging deeper into the lies that are really told in this society, and many cointelpro agents do this by infiltrating an area where there is indeed valid truth against TPTB (911 being a false flag attack resulting in the murder of over 3,000 American citizens, for example) and they purposefully inject lies and falsehood into the fold in order to confuse that truth (saying “aliens did 911!” or whatever in order to marginalize anyone associated with 911 truth and make them look uncritical).</p>

<p>It sounds like your mother has JUST barely woken up to the fact that things are REALLY fucked on this planet, but doesn’t know enough to understand that the ruler manipulators on this planet aren’t merely playing checkers on the board of global chicanery.  They’re playing very complicated, high-stakes chess with many, many lives at stake.  She doesn’t know that there is a lot of stuff out there labeled “conspiracy” that is actually junk and that is purposefully designed to fool you and dupe people who aren’t sufficiently discerning so that the public can then turn around and say “See!?  Anyone looking into conspiracies is an idiot!!” when such a thing couldn’t be further from the actual truth if one is INTELLIGENT about how they search and investigate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t know if she will take this conspiracy thing a little too far.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She already <em>is</em> taking it too far if she’s believing everything that’s out there labeled “conspiracy”.  Your best bet is to let her know that a lot of conspiracies have SOME truth in them, but a lot of them have a lot of falsehood as well.  It’s best for her to reference and <em>cross</em> reference any information she comes across in order to assess if the data really is as sound as it might seem.</p>

<p>But how is she going to find that out?  Who’s going to tell her?  <em>You?</em>  Someone who thinks she’s a kook for looking into these things to begin with?</p>

<p>It’s definitely a tough proposition she finds herself in, to be sure.</p>

<p>And I’m giving you my perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And thanks for taking the time to reply to my post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly, sir.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll talk more with my family about this when I have more time.</p>

<p>What’s most important in all of this, sir, is to realize that NONE of this dynamic here is “black” or “white”.  You yourself have validity in what you feel.  One DOESN’T want to be too crazy in their investigations or go “too far”.  Also, however, realize that your mother is NOT on the wrong path in thinking that there is something very, very wrong and “off” with this world.  Don’t think there’s something wrong with her for thinking that there’s a lot in this world that is hidden from us and that TPTB here keep away from our understanding.  There is a <em>lot</em> we are not told, and we are kept <em>greatly</em> in the dark on <em>many</em> subjects on this planet.</p>

<p>You say you&#39;re worried about your mother and that you feel she is going crazy. However, you want to spend the little free time you have doing other things instead of helping your mother. I&#39;m not agreeing with you that she needs help or that she is going crazy, but if you really felt that way, maybe you should try to help her. </p>
