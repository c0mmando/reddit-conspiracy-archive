<p>Oh I&#39;m not either by any means. Was just looking for well-researched documentaries. I figured by asking which topic people knew/cared the most about and docs on that subject it would weed out the shitty ones or at least give a solid starting point for further research. </p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice list. I would add that the other Adam Curtis documentaries are worth watching. The Trap is really important. Pandora&#39;s Box, The Mayfair Set, The Living Dead,  It Felt Like a Kiss and All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace are also really good.</p>

<p>The way he threads ideas and film clips together is pretty unique I find.</p>

<p>edit: Nice..I just saw that there is a new Adam Curtis documentary that I haven&#39;t seen yet called Bitter Lake from this year(2015)...going to watch it now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re right, he was probably pushed into that narrative by the BBC. I&#39;ve followed his blog occasionally and in the pieces I&#39;ve read he&#39;s hardly ever brought up Assad and never in detail, so it&#39;s just as likely he&#39;s going off what the elite have polluted all of our heads with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I consider the documentary <em>Secret Government</em> the best documentary on the subject of conspiracy.  There are several great things about it.  One, its not a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; documentary - its Frontline with Bill Moyers - very mainstream shit.  But more importantly its kind of like the foundational understanding you need to have on why &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is the opposite of tinfoil hat bullshit.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/videos/national-security-alert">CIT&#39;s investigation regarding the Pentagon needs people to see it.  I believe it is as obvious as WTC7 in NYC.</a></p>

<p>Very few people seem to be able to see what 13 witnesses, including 2 Pentagon Police officers witnessed at the Pentagon.  They all said the same thing and they all got their testimony on record, in 2002 and 2004.  They all corroborate each other and that means they can&#39;t be lying and can&#39;t be in on it together.</p>

<p>They all prove the plane did not hit the Pentagon.  They also show that it couldn&#39;t be some magical squiggly line or guided missile, or global hawk.  </p>

<p>Lloyd England also spills the beans that it was an &quot;event for them&quot;.  Keith Wheelhouse also proves there was an attempt at deception when promulgating the lie that &quot;another plane was guiding&quot; the 757 into the Pentagon.  The C-130 piloted by O&#39;Brien was nowhere near the pentagon.  Sean Boger being the man in the heliport control tower had the plane fly right at him.....his testimony by itself crushes the bullshit that a plane hit and Edward Paik show the plane was not even close to holding the flight path we are sold.</p>

<p>It is a topic that needs more attention/scrutiny.  I am nobody special but I stand by these statements and <strong>challenge</strong> someone to watch this thoroughly and even multiple times and tell me how this information is wrong.</p>

<p>Yeah, but don&#39;t overlook the fact the fact that they all corroborate that the plane <em>did hit the building.</em>   You can&#39;t on the one hand say corroborating witness testimony is important and then dismiss the fact that they <strong>all</strong> saw the plane hit.  That&#39;s absurd.</p>

<p>In my opinion CIT was cleary some kind of COINTELPRO job meant to muddle up the whole discussion of the pentagon.    </p>

<p>I was 100% convinced a plane didn&#39;t hit the pentagon <em>until</em> I looked into CITs stuff.    </p>

<p>The Pentagon was an operation exactly like the WTC.  Plane hits building but explosives do the real damage.    </p>

<p>The interesting thing about the witness testimony is that it all contradicts the official flight path, and that is the real smoking gun at the pentagon.  And CITs job was to obfuscate that evidence with the wild goose chase flyover bullshit.  </p>

<p>Yeah, sure they were <em>fooled</em> that&#39;s for sure.  They may think that it hit, but their testimony of <strong>where</strong> the plane was, proves that to be impossible.</p>

<p>They were fooled.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CIT was clearly some kind of COINTELPRO</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly?  Those guys, whom I&#39;ve spoken to on the phone, both Aldo and Craig were basically kids at the time, paid their own way to Arlington, VI are far from Gov&#39;t agents.  OK, I think you&#39;ve gone too far there.  What a claim.  Attack the people?  No attempt to challenge the information?  Wow.....that should tell people what you&#39;re all about.</p>

<p>If you personally think a plane DID hit <em>after</em> their testimony, I think you&#39;ve got it entirely backwards.</p>

<p>The plane was NORTH of the citgo gas station.  It can&#39;t be any other way.  Craig and Aldo didn&#39;t coax those people into all saying the same thing.  They didn&#39;t persuade or coerce two Pentagon police officers into saying anything.  They had those people draw what they saw on a picture (as shown in the video) and I don&#39;t think even you can say that they made them draw the flight path those witnesses saw, for them.  Can you?</p>

<p>That is an unreal possibility.  I was going to say, you need to rethink your thought process but I think I know your goal here already. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.flyian.net/twa/ian/757eng.jpg">The plane COULD NOT possibly hit the bottom floor without digging trenches where the engines would hang 6 or more feet below the wings.</a></p>

<p>The building was blown up for sure, but the plane could not impact without causing wing strikes and vertical stabilizer strikes to the facade and to windows that all somehow managed to stay intact.  The building was also recently renovated against &quot;bomb blasts&quot; just a month prior, and only <em>that</em> side of the Pentagon, go figure.</p>

<p>You know, this is great, because it gives me good opportunity to give better details here.  So thanks for that.</p>

<p>CIT did not produce/fabricate any witness statements on their own, people like <strong>Steve Chaconas</strong>, a commercial fisherman on the river saw the plane fly over the river, which contradicts the official theory entirely.  They did not get him to make that up.</p>

<p>You Sir, are a bullshitter or you&#39;re just fabulously out of touch.  These are the kinds of people I have to deal with.  These are the kinds of &quot;well thought out&quot; arguments I continually have to defend against on this topic.  Brutal attempts to contradict what is clearly shown in their video.  </p>

<p>You have attempted to make Craig and Aldo out to be the &quot;bad guys&quot; and detract from the real information.  Challenge accepted, but failed badly.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to watch their video, and like I had to do....watch it multiple times in order to make sure that all their testimony combined all ensure that there are only two things that cannot be denied.  </p>

<h1>1 - The plane was on the <em>north side</em>....not in line with a damage path (light poles were downed and physical damage path through the building) that MUST have been fabricated in order to support a plane impact.  Again Lloyd England shows this to be an obvious sham.</h1>

<h1>2 - A triangulation of viewpoints provided by the witnesses themselves.</h1>

<p>Sean Boger who again, was in the control tower of the heliport landing pad, had the plane flying right at him.  Said the plane was on the NORTH side of the gas station.</p>

<p>Robert Turcious, worked at the gas station that splits the REAL flight path from the fabricated one, saw the plane NORTH of his location.</p>

<p>All the witnesses at the Arlington National cemetery.  William Middleton Sr., Darius Prather and Darrell Stafford all saw the plane fly SOUTH of their location but NORTH of the gas station.  Again, all drew the same flight path on a picture for you to scrutinize. </p>

<h1>3 - The last Pentagon Police officer to see the plane was Roosevelt Roberts, who ran out of the &quot;south loading dock area&quot; to see a plane flying &quot;low and away&quot;, a &quot;jet airliner&quot;.</h1>

<p><a href="http://www.citizeninvestigationteam.com/official-interviews">They didn&#39;t all get it wrong.</a> All their quick info and picture testimony are show in the link provided.</p>

<p>Good luck out there Sir, very poorly done.</p>

<p>Also, I won&#39;t add to anymore and clutter up this section with accusations as ridiculous as that.  If you&#39;re TRULY interested in chatting more or I can start a self thread and the issue can be talked about there.  I apologize to the OP if this screws things up for other comments.</p>

<p>Also having a little trouble with the formatting.  Oh well.</p>

<p>I never get why you CIT guys fail to see how you defeat your own argument.  The basis of your argument is that the witnesses corroborate each other.  But then you think you guys can just throw out the fact that they all saw the plane hit the building.  And say that even though they all corroborate each other they are all wrong - congratulations!  You just removed the foundation upon which your argument is built!    </p>

<p>Not according to them.  They say they saw it hit.  Kind of an inconvenient fact for you guys seeing as you are basing your theory on corroborating witness testimony.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain it again:  you can&#39;t just pick and choose what you want the witnesses to have said.  You are basing your theory on corroborating witness testimony.  <em>All the witnesses say they saw the plane hit.</em>  End of story.   </p>

<p>If you want a flyover theory I suggest you base it on something other than the witness testimony, because they don&#39;t help your case at all.  Maybe find some witnesses that saw the plane flyover the building...oh that&#39;s right, there aren&#39;t any!</p>

<p>You&#39;re ignoring the evidence.  They themselves prove it couldn&#39;t have happened.</p>

<p>You started off your comments with &quot;you can&#39;t rely on testimony&quot; now you&#39;re saying they can&#39;t be argued with!  The testimony is that the plane was on the NORTH side.  </p>

<p>It couldn&#39;t have hit if it was on the NORTH side.  They were fooled.</p>

<p>Address the information.  Don&#39;t cherry pick.</p>

<p>Also, Roosevelt proves a flyover .....I don&#39;t see you bothering to tackle his testimony or Chadwick&#39;s or Bills testimony.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree with that.</p>

<p>I have found it&#39;s fairly difficult to convey a personal threshold like that.  I can honestly say that when I dig in, I tend to dig longer than necessary.  Some things can&#39;t be <strong>proven</strong>.  </p>

<p>Depending on the specifics, I may just toss it in the &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I would really like to know&quot; pile.  Sometimes, I am actually satisfied, personally, to consider it proven.</p>

<p>Of course there are things that I end up dismissing / debunking.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming we all enjoy the chase when we find something new that we want to reveal as fact or fiction.  (=</p>

<p>But to use an example, and because you brought it up directly, I will give my opinion on JFK and maybe that will show you roughly where my threshold lies.</p>

<p>I realize this is common knowledge to most everyone, but I feel this, in addition to so many other signs, is significant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JFK - 7 days prior to his execution, &quot;There&#39;s a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That doesn&#39;t prove a thing of course.  But I will certainly admit that the evidence was very substantial.  Well, just as you said.</p>

<p>And, again, just as you said, it hasn&#39;t been officially confirmed.  I do believe that they would consider that one to still be a large enough deal that it would cause some turbulence.</p>

<p>So, do I feel that I can say &#39;Confirmed&#39;.  Yeah, I pretty much do.  It would take a great deal to convince me otherwise, knowing what I <em>do</em> know.</p>

<p>I realize that was probably a little more long-winded than you signed up for, but I really like to explain myself. People tend to take me the wrong way. </p>

<p>For example, see my first post in this thread.  (=</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely.  And I certainly agree with your view on it.</p>

<p>It was actually a good friend of mine that I met here in this sub that first introduced me to Corbett.</p>

<p>It would actually be pretty cool if we could have more than one sticky at a time in these subs.  I believe it would benefit a lot of people to have some idea where to start.  I can think of many places that, I believe, would be a <em>terrible</em> place to start.</p>

<p>But in that regard, I know that we all essentially agree to respect each others views and path.  And rightfully so.  Just as I respect everyones choice of religion.  (No, for the folks at home, I wasn&#39;t directly comparing those things to one another.)</p>

<p>That said, it would undoubtedly be a difficult task to get enough people to agree on what is good and what is not.  That is completely understandable.</p>

<p>Yep, I talk a lot.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t meant to be humorous, but one of the things I was hoping for was to shame 4to6 into improvement. I know it&#39;s a stretch, but maybe if enough people would ridicule such idiots, maybe they would eventually start questioning their stupid and hurtful beliefs.</p>
