       With the release of the NSA spying and things like climate change and GMOs, we (including myself) seem so meh about their ramifications.  I feel there has to be an outside reason of our pacification.  Any theories?

       COINTELPRO, debt slavery, severe economic distress, unstable employment, a police state that scares the bejesus out of every sane human, a prison system with 25% of the world's prison population, endless distraction provided by conglomerates with what from the outside appears to be a satanic agenda, constant misinformation from mainstream media, bogus wars on drugs, poverty, Islam, you name it.
People don't know if they're coming or going. People know they're getting screwed but they're so tired that why should they give a shit if the government is peeping at their computers?
You want them to care about GMOs when they never cared about high fructose corn syrup, increased cancer rates, depleted sperm counts and countless other things connected to our modern diet?
People aren't stupid, but they are burned out. People need to heal before they will believe that resistance will amount to anything effective.

       I am reminded of a quote from Dune Messiah...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The greatest palatinate earl and the lowliest stipendiary serf share the same problem. You cannot hire a mentat or any other intellect to solve it for you. There's no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers. No servant — or disciple — can dress the wound. You dress it yourself or continue bleeding for all to see.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem is that there are not enough healers or people willing to imagine the possibility of helping one another.

       Your hubris is full of a disdainful arrogance to the point that reading your self righteous words is like hearing nails on a chalkboard. Dude, you may have some gems up there in that angry mind of yours, but you are having a difficult time effectively getting it through all the bullshit swimming in your head. Try losing your cherished air of assumed authority and for the love of god, stop saying "red herring."

       I'll tell you what, why not post these comments as a self-post in the conspiracy subreddit. It's a bit silly to try to address any of these in a comment chain. You can give people a chance to explain their reasoning on some of this stuff, there might actually be a chance for putting links into answers, and if you can cut the ad hominem for a little while you might come away with a better understanding of how to communicate with a non scientific community in a way that doesn't  antagonize them.

       Yeah man. Chill out. If you're really against conspiracies then you'll watch us all die from lack of vaccines or whatever. Or be imprisoned by the govt....so it's a win win for you, don't know why everyone gets angry with conspiracies.

       The spraying has already begun on the Gulf Coast. It's called Corexin and C-130's still spray it down here. You can read reports of it's ill effects if you google it, but you rarely hear about it on the news.

       I'm not saying gum disease isn't a thing, I understand the medical applications of dentistry, but I'm not going to pay a man a small fortune to "fix" my imperfections if the only thing wrong with my mouth is something ultimately cosmetic.

       That's your choice.  Nothing about this "empire" forces you to be lazy.  With the internet, you have more resources for research and scientific advancement than ever before.  You could choose to help advance technology and thus improve humanity's chances for survival.  What's stopping you?

       Donating your future income is essentially the same thing.  You earn that income doing whatever you're good at, presumably by adding value to society.  It doesn't have to be actual science.  Society needs a lot of things.

       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       • Young men have been taught that what makes a "man" is chasing p*ssy
      </p>
      <p>
       • Having real goals, hobbies, and interests has less "peacock factor" than owning an expensive car, wasting money on designer clothes, spending ridiculous amounts of time on appearance (with the possible exception of fitness if you're doing it for your own health and quality of life).
      </p>
      <p>
       • In order to stay in the good graces of mainstream society men are afraid to rock the boat.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Sure, they might get in a bar fight or watch some sports, but these activities don't actually change anything about the system, so they are permitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr - Men, who traditionally lead revolutions and great social changes, have been psychologically neutered. And it's not even their fault-- this has been done to them externally by our laws and society.

       there is a part of me that is slowly starting to agree with some of these nuts, i mean morality aside.
      </p>
      <p>
       we as in the people paying attention imo have a pretty good chance of making it out the other side of this on our own (unless they come after us that is) if there really is a culling or big mass death event its going to be mostly the "sheeple" that take the brunt of it and the ones who are probably going to suffer the worst fates.

       After whatever is coming happens, I would hope to see no more illegal wars sold and packaged to the public, corporations stripped of their personhood and power to finance and back political powers. No more bills that undermine the value of our entire political system, like the TPP. No more illegal surveillance... I could probably keep going, but that's a good start!

       Tearing down the legal structure is probably drastic; the legal structure itself, though, is built to be pliable and moldable, as we have clearly seen with the addition of extraordinary rendition, and the loss of habeas corpus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would rather drastically refine the legal system (I like habeas corpus!) than destroy it.

       Hey Op,
There are various mystical traditions that teach that there are a variety of levels of consciousness in individuals. Gurdjieff comes to mind, but also subsets of Buddhist teachings, various advaitin masters as well tech this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, you have levels of consciousness and the majority of people are almost entirely unconscious zombie drones. They are not aware of their own thoughts, of their own decision making, of the subconscious are just slaves to programming and hive mind think of status quo proportions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to this that diet and environment has a direct effect on levels of consciousness. The fluoride, glyphosate in the food supply, fast food and soda, 24/7 media bombardment via tv, cellphone, internet is designed to keep you from looking within, to keep you from becoming more conscious
      </p>

       well the "elites" eat this shit up so at the very least you need to be educated about it and understand the basics. groups like the bohemian grove, thule society, and o.t.o. have influenced these people for centuries. to look at conspiracy without them imho is like looking at the leaf and ignoring the tree. the thoughts and concepts from these groups form a lot of the picture of who these people really are.

       It's probably because American citizens don't really have a reliable way to productively participate in government. Money controls the government and it's hard to be moral and make money. You can vote all you want, protest all you want, and even try to get yourself elected, but in the end, if you don't have the means to persuade people, nothing will change. The American government system is just flawed, and I think eventually something big will happen and better people than us will be able to fix the problem.

       Who knows anyone who those things have actually, demonstrably affected adversely?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's not actually affecting anyone's lives, they're not going to do shit about it. Heck, people won't even get off their asses to vote and when they do, at least half of them vote against their own best interest. How the hell are they going to be bothered to do something about an issue that doesn't (seem to) affect them at all?

       Red flag comment. Humans are programmable -- neural networks, if you want to dig. There is some deep "firmware", if you will, but most human behavior is programmed.

       We're conditioned, almost from birth, to be passive and accept authority. And then we have the chemicals lobotomies, the fluoride, the SSRIs, the opiates, and even the cannabis for some people.

      <p>
       Dismissing the apathy as "human nature" discounts all this conditioning.

       's comment above has the right idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that most people realize just how shitty things get before a revolution.  People in the US don't know the real truth of how terrible life was under British rule before the revolutionary war.  People were subject to arrests with no trials, crazy high taxes that caused many to die from the long harsh winters, unfair treatment from the British, etc, etc.  The colonists put up with a hell of a lot more than we have and yet, even when war broke out, they had trouble rallying more than 3% of the people to fight with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people will avoid confrontation as long as possible and try to just live their lives.  It needs to get REALLY bad before we will stand up and fight.

       meh, supply and demand will create big incentives for civil engineers to fix any "leaks" in the system. The main point is that the US land mass has greater natural resources than most other countries. Once the corrupt parasites have been removed, those natural resources will flow  more freely.

       The problem is that government protects the existing monopolies. If the gov didn't do this, and didn't provide them with trillion dollar bailouts, they would frequently go bankrupt (e.g. 2008 collapse) and be eaten up by scavenging smaller businesses.

       That's your choice.  Nothing about this "empire" forces you to be lazy.  With the internet, you have more resources for research and scientific advancement than ever before.  You could choose to help advance technology and thus improve humanity's chances for survival.  What's stopping you?

       Your hubris is full of a disdainful arrogance to the point that reading your self righteous words is like hearing nails on a chalkboard. Dude, you may have some gems up there in that angry mind of yours, but you are having a difficult time effectively getting it through all the bullshit swimming in your head. Try losing your cherished air of assumed authority and for the love of god, stop saying "red herring."

       I'll tell you what, why not post these comments as a self-post in the conspiracy subreddit. It's a bit silly to try to address any of these in a comment chain. You can give people a chance to explain their reasoning on some of this stuff, there might actually be a chance for putting links into answers, and if you can cut the ad hominem for a little while you might come away with a better understanding of how to communicate with a non scientific community in a way that doesn't  antagonize them.

       Helping to advance technology? In what way? I fully support the development of Transhumanism but I am by no means a brilliant scientist or engineer.

       Now would I be willing do donate my future income? Sure. But I'd have to know it would make a difference to my species.

       The problem is that government protects the existing monopolies. If the gov didn't do this, and didn't provide them with trillion dollar bailouts, they would frequently go bankrupt (e.g. 2008 collapse) and be eaten up by scavenging smaller businesses.
