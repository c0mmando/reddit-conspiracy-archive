      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Last week, Walmart abruptly closed five Walmart stores in four states just hours before tens of thousands of low wage workers, including Walmart workers, began the largest one-day strike of low wage workers in American history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Barlage talked about the closing as she rallied in front of a McDonald's store in LA during the national strikes and protests staged by low-wage workers. "But we know better than what Walmart says is the reason they shut down," she said. "It is no accident that they shut down our store which has been a one of the most successful centers for organizing by OUR Walmart members.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's interesting that one of the stores closed holds that distinction. One wonders where the other four stores stand on labor organization.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Workers are asking the National Labor Relations Board to seek injunctive relief under section 10j of the National Labor Relations Act... As the filing notes, this is not the first time Walmart has taken dramatic action to quell worker action. In June of 2014, the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that Walmart had violated labor law when it closed the Jonqui√©re, Quebec Walmart store.

       I wonder if they notified the workers in advance that the stores were going to be closed "to repair the plumbing"? It is obviously something that they would know about ahead of time, if that is the real reason why the stores really closed... I had the feeling the closings were bullshit and were related to quelling workers from organizing. Good to know I am not the only one who was thinking this.

       If by "in advance" you would measure in hours, not days, then yes. Already covered in previous news stories. Some employees got all of one hour notice. I don't recall any news stories saying anyone had as much as a day.

       Thats one way to stop a union.   A company I used to work for in the mid 90's has 18 branches in Canada that organized and went union.  The CEO didn't care too much for unions, and had a subtle yet effective way of dealing with it.  The whole of Canadian operations, the 3 DM's 18 BM's and several CSR's were all fired.  They didn't talk of unions too much up north after that.  I don't agree with the tactic, yet it was effective.

       I used to work for a home depot distribution warehouse. The first mandatory video you have to watch is an anti-union video. Its not that sinister. They just knew if union took over they couldn't do incentive pay and have to pay everyone a lot more for doing a lot less.

       It's an illusion. You're saving money in the moment but paying more in taxes to subsidize the employees of WalMart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some states have recognized this is a WalMart business strategy and are taking steps to enact laws to charge WalMart for all the social services their employees use.

       I fail to see how closing a store to navigate union talk is sound business. Walmart sucks, they should all close. If all you have to do to close a walmart, is talk about unions around a walmart, more people should mention unions around walmarts.

       Do you fail to see how paying employees $7 and change an hour could be viewed as "better business" by MBA types than paying employees an actual living wage?

       I agree with this, but I'd prefer a solution that has them paying living wages (so their employees don't need to be subsidized by government programs - read we the taxpayers - for the poor, as they do) and maybe even stock a much higher ratio of products made in the USA.

       Would paying the employee more money keep the cereal boxes more stocked and fronted? No. Is Walmart interested in keeping people long-term? No. Is Walmart a good place to work? No. Is Walmart a healthy addition to towns and neighborhoods? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is making Walmart anything but a colossal failure something that serves the people? No. Fuck them, I want their employees to hate it there. I don't want Walmarts employees to be happy, I want them to quit. I want them to start small businesses or trade groups. I want the demand for labor to be so competitive that walmart is priced out of the market. That's what I'd prefer instead of some new rule that keeps them in business. I'd prefer Walmart was mandated to pay their employees here what their overseas factories pay theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's no what it's about, it's about politics, union power vs vested corporate entrenchment. At least that's how the party of the unioned interest would have you view it.

       Even though I wasn't yet alive when it all started, I have no illusions about why my typical (90% of the time) work week is 5 days and 40-43 hours instead of 6-7 days and 60+ hours. That reason is unions... even though I have never been a member of one. Yeah, they have corrupt leadership. But, like WalMart, they ought to be fixed, not destroyed.

       Walmart isn't an institution, it's a retail chain. Retail is the institution. Walmart deserves destruction as it has attained it's height through destruction. When you protect something from the very mechanism by which it gained it's power, you're removing it from the organic nature of that mechanism and protecting it. That's what it wants. It wants to climb to the top and kick the ladder down. Make no mistake, the last thing walmart wants is a competitive labor market. Forcing Walmart to pay whatever a living wage is reduces the demand on labor in that market because Chip's Bakery can't compete and has to pay a lower wage and gets the people Walmart can't employ, like those who can't get to work sober. Changing the law entirely makes that problem endemic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, unions did a good thing 100 years ago and have been corrupt ever since, more often than not in league with the industry, so you owe eternal loyalty to them for capping your hourly income at 40 X wage. I'm happy you enjoy the downtime and the salary cap. I think you support them because not supporting them would mean being closer to republican than you're ready to accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the unions today are public unions extracting the greatest wages, benefits and working conditions on the tax dime. Unions have, across the board, sent people to work in public jobs because of the lure of decent pay for moderate production. The real money is in government work, working for and selling to because it's revenue is unlimited and they always pay top dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you opened a private school today, could you compete with even the brokest of school districts for similarly qualified employees? Not without startup capital and incredible outlay which serves as a mechanism for defense against competition except by already monied interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       getting back on topic, I would investigate if these Walmarts have had staffing problems or issues with quality of viable labor. It takes 2 to 3 hundred sober people to run a Walmart supercenter. If you believe that paying people more money will keep them off dope and from coming to work hungover, you are new to this world. It's entirely possible, especially in saturated areas, that a store would be closed to send the viable labor to another nearby store to address staffing issues. It also helps if you understand Walmart is as much in the real estate business as anything else.

       Your work week is capped at 40 or so  because your employer is incentivized to keep you at 40 by paying a punitive assessment (overtime) for going over. You didn't think overtime pay was for being a doubleplusgood worker did you? The upside if there is to be one is that you aren't working 60 hours a week, so 2 people can work 30 instead.
      </p>

       That doesn't even bring into question the rectal hammering Uncle Scam will give you for overtime pay.

       It kind of is because you chose a single point of contention out of a larger body of debate. You're dwelling on the choice of garnish after being served a 3 course education.
