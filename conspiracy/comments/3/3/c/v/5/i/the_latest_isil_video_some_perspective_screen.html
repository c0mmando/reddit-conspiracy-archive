        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, by now I’m sure you’ve heard about the latest ISIL/ISIS/DAESH/Islamic State video <em>purporting</em> to show the simultaneous execution of two groups of prisoners – rumored to be Ethiopians, Coptic Christians, and who else knows.</p>

<p>It was released this Sunday, is almost 30 minutes long, and the most I’ve seen reported of it is a snippet of the video or two, offering no context and obviously showing none of the gory bits.
If you’ve been picking up what I’ve been putting down lately during Seasons 1 and 2 of the ISIS/ISIL beheading videos which were specifically used to get the American public to be supportive of ‘air strikes’ in Syria and Iraq (and no doubt eventual ground forces, considering President Obama’s draft of an AUMF which has no geographical limitations, allowing ground troops to be used anywhere on the global to take out this most recent big bad boogey men group). For those of you that don’t remember, here’s a PDF of the AUMF <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/aumf_02112015.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, here’s some links to some sites covering the video, before we delve in to the main topic of this post.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/04/19/407035/ISIL-purportedly-executes-Ethiopians-Video">PressTV - ISIL video shows purported beheading of some 30 Ethiopians</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 29-minute footage, released online by the Takfiri group on Sunday, purportedly shows the beheading of a group of around 12 Ethiopian Christian men on a beach and the shooting of another group of at least 16 others in a desert area.
A text on the screen read “followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church.”</p>

<p>A masked pistol-brandishing militant made a statement in the video, threatening Christians.</p>

<p>The exact number and the identity of the victims are not known so far.</p>

<p><strong>ISIL has released several similar videos from Iraq showing the execution of its captives from different countries, including, Iraq, Syria, the United States, Britain, and Japan.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If those of you at home have been paying attention, the videos referenced here include those of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and others that, if you actually watch the video, notice that the videos themselves cut out prior to the actual <em>beheading</em>, and only then show the aftermath. You will also note that these videos (if you go back in my posts or go watch the videos or the initial coverage of such) were released by the SITE Intelligence group, a private, US-based firm run by Rita Katz. They also have a fantastic habit of posting these videos online before ISIL/ISIS does (at least sometimes).
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/19/africa/libya-isis-executions-ethiopian-christians/">CNN - ISIS executes more Christians in Libya, video shows</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The al-Furqan Media video -- which is highly produced and titled &quot;Until There Came to Them Clear Evidence&quot; -- shows two groups of men, one in orange jumpsuits and the other in black, being killed at different locations in Libya, according to the video&#39;s narrator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s a brief 2 minute video found on liveleak <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/ll_embed?f=c5c7478ad98c">here</a>, with (surprise!) the SITE logo in the upper right hand corner. This is a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tPvK0hb.png">screen grab</a> of SITE’s site (heh) which details the video and states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Islamic State (IS) released a video of beheading the 21 Egyptian Christians it kidnapped in Libya in January of 2015, <em>containing</em> the same images of the men that appeared in the seventh issue of Dabiq magazine**. The link to the page is <a href="https://news.siteintelgroup.com/">here</a>.
Being the inquisitive dude that I am, I went and looked through the seventh issue, and only found one image regarding the Coptic Christians <a href="http://imgur.com/vv5pMZe">here</a>, and as you’ll see from the album below, this doesn’t match what the video shows in the slightest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So – where am I going with this? I watched the whole thing, which was produced fantastically, by the way, with great graphics, fully HD, with various interviews and amazing transitions from scene to scene. And of course, I had to wade through 26 minutes of bullshit before the action began, but I do this for you, ladies and gentlemen, and will do it as long as you keep clicking that up arrow.</p>

<p>So, since my (and others, of course) criticism of these videos for not showing the gory bits and fueling the fire that these videos are fake or produced in studio, no doubt at some point we’d most likely see more realistic killings, or real killings, or whatever as time went on and a stronger military response was needed (which obviously requires the American public’s support). </p>

<p>In September of 2013, the <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/09/03/public-opinion-runs-against-syrian-airstrikes/">Pew Research Center</a> reported that 48% opposed air strikes in Syria and 29% were in favor, with 23% undecided. And mind you this was during the farcical chemical weapons attack that was falsely attributed to Bashar Al Assad’s regime (despite the fact that the UN and their reports stated it was most likely the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10039672/UN-accuses-Syrian-rebels-of-chemical-weapons-use.html">rebels</a> that the US backs, by the way, as well as a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1006045/possible-implications-of-bad-intelligence.pdf">report from MIT echoing the UN’s sentiment</a>.</p>

<p>Since the chemical attacks didn’t really work according to Pew above, a new strategy was launched, which I affectionately call the ISIS/ISIL beheading reality television series, now entering at least it’s 3rd season. </p>

<p>After the first two seasons in 2014, now <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2-3-americans-support-airstrikes-iraq-syria/">more than 2 out of every 3 Americans supported airstrikes</a> according to PBS Newshour in October of 2014. By the way, <em>airstrikes</em> seems to be a nice new Newspeak word for bombings, but that’s just my little Orwell tie-in for this post. </p>

<p>Moving on.</p>

<p>Season 3’s production values have gone sky high, the videos harder and harder to get (I’ve been saving them all, because I’m a crazy <em>conspiracy theorist</em>), and am going to link you now to an IMGUR album I created yesterday (Patriot’s Day in the US, so very fitting and ironic). If anyone has a spot where you’d like them to all be uploaded (I have most, but not all of them), feel free to PM me and maybe we can work something out.</p>

<p>Without further ado – here are 33 (the irony is not lost on me, trust me) screen grabs that start at 27:21 and end at 27:52, which should be in order. The most interesting things to me are the constant hard cuts to black before and after specific action (rifles going off, knives grinding into necks with little to no blood, or blood on the knife but not all over the place initially, etc), and you can track the order because Windows Media Player has the timestamp at the bottom left of each screen grab. I swear on my Owl flair that I did manipulate them in any way, and the <em>extremely clean neck cuts and skin flaps</em> after they place the severed heads on the middle of their shoulder blades are what inspired me to write this post and publish these stills. You be the judge, and if you can stomach it, take the time to watch this kind of stuff. The way the media reports these things (especially in the past) would surprise you if you haven’t been paying attention.
The US government and media apparatus uses these to gradually increase to the next phase of the plan (IMO), which is boots on the ground and expanded forces to overtake Mosul and most importantly, sell some fancy ass military hardware to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Tunisia, and any other ally that Boeing, Lockheed, and this sub’s favorite Northop Grumman wish to unload their stockpiles on so the American taxpayer can foot the bill for some more.
Lastly, a disclaimer: No, I do not think this group is fake, per say. </p>

<p>But I do believe their logistical sophistication, organization, funding, and military hardware are extremely suspect. Their social media/internet presence is unparalleled (so far for a terrorist group). And they are working fantastically to continue a strategy of tension (reminscient of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Operation Gladio</a>), a ‘stay-behind’ clandestine NATO program that’s worth some casual reading for perspective on this whole operation and those like it.
So, without further ado, here is a link to the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/tFeeL">IMGUR album</a> with the obligatory <strong>NSFW/GORE</strong> warning for that particular link that is the basis for this post. I’ve asked the mods to tag this as NSFW/GORE, and a special thanks to <a href="/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway">/u/AssuredlyAThrowAway</a> for talking me through how to post this in a way where users will be able to digest the content and still have the option to not see this stuff if they don’t want to.</p>

<p>As always, whenever possible look to the source documents, and trust only yourself as a lens to discern truth from untruth. MSM or Alt-Media, it does not matter – you are the arbiter of what you determine is real, and it is up to you to sharpen these skills as much as possible. I&#39;m trying my best to do it for me and you all, as I gain no financial compensation or value from this other than the spread of my thoughts and analylsis, so at least you know I&#39;m not trying to sell you seeds, prepper stuff, or other bullshit.</p>

<p>If you think this type of content is worthwhile and are willing to possibly contribute with this type of primary source analysis – I’m working on a project for the Summer where these type of posts will move off of reddit and onto a platform I can control more myself (although of course I would still cross post things here as well). If you are interested in reading primary source material (be it legislation, propaganda videos such as this, or even watching MSM television ‘news’ and breaking it down in written and spoken word/podcast form, PM me). The goal would not be to compete with an Open Source Investigation that Corbett does, but at least mimic it in a way, where instead of CNN using screen grabs and offering propagandistic analysis that they currently do for the masses, the full sources of all things reported upon will be available for intelligent, free thinking readers to pass along and start trying to spread awareness for things that the American public appears to be so susceptible to and manipulated by. Any and all are welcome, and I know many have already reached out with the willingness to contribute and jump in on the ground floor of something that I feel is needed and there is a relatively untapped market for it. Maybe not a huge money maker, but I&#39;m working on an idea where we can use this free-thinking community and crypto-currency anonymous donations/tip jar type things to incentivize quality posts. At some point this idea would need to have servers to host content and a few dudes/ladies who are far more technologically competent than I to facilitate the spread of information, so you guys are at a premium for this stuff (of which you know already). Fuck, it took me like 3 tries to get an imgur album uploaded in the correct order. So that&#39;s an indication of the technologically illiteracy I&#39;m dealing with.</p>

<p>As always, long days and pleasant nights,</p>

<p>-JCP</p>

<p>The Foley/Sotloff videos were a little easier to digest because I really don&#39;t think they were offed (or the videos certainly didn&#39;t show it and there were a lot of Final Cut Pro shenanigans with those productions, but these (I think) appear to be genuine-ish, and it&#39;s obviously a tragedy that this level of violence is being conducted on innocent people who didn&#39;t ask to be a part of this type of conflict.

<p>I think it&#39;s obvious that they work towards using this fear to garner votes, and using this fear to keep our major industry (which accounts for the highest percentage of federal funds, the military industrial complex) going.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that this country had the potential to be so fantastic, and our biggest and baddest and most technologically advanced export is products that are used to destroy things and kill people. And everyone is OK with it, and wave their little red/white/blue flags at a moments notice.</p>

<p>And the looks I get when I don&#39;t stand for the pledge during official ceremonies that are work related give me the ugliest of looks, because everyone&#39;s so lost in their own shit (and frankly, I don&#39;t blame them) to have looked into the real history of this country, its government, and its current policies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to consider that many of the western european recruits are highly educated. I know of numerous cases in particular where the young men who went to join ISIS were media and production university students. They definitely have the capability to do these things on their own, I mean just look at independent films which are made with budgets a fraction of what ISIS can call upon. They have a population of tens of millions under their control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those clowns have definitely been given ample funds to graduate from potatocams to HD and slick post production editing. Still, there&#39;s something off about the gore. Has anyone seen Narco/Cartel videos? Guess <em>these</em> ISlS victims were doped to the gills because that serene look on the face of that decapitated guy... </p>

<p>It&#39;s puzzling, the strange edit rhythm and choice of action shown on all these videos. At first it was, if you subscribed to the idea of ISlS being a western-forces puppet, somewhat understandable, as the right amount of gore could make them barely palatable for our media to at least snippet and become the justification of further military action there. But to me at least, it seems all those videos are actually recruitment fodder for the angry hotheads there, the ones <em>radicalized by drone</em>. Then why aren&#39;t they more graphic? Why the coyness of photoshopped-looking stills and such?</p>

<p>Maybe the real videos we are not even able to get on this side of the globe, the real ones are for local consumption only?</p>

<p>The first two seasons were certainly manipulated/faked (IMO). These seem far more real, but the strange skin cits and weirdness of the bodies as the heads were being placed looked odd to me. That&#39;s the only real funky thing I see from this one.</p>

<p>If you watch this video it had to be expensive to make and produce. And these guys are apparently not short on money. But you have a point, for sure.</p>

<p>I think of anything the first two seasons were twofold bad far as purpose goes:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I see your point and can only speculate on what the answers to your questions may be, I&#39;m sure you realize that you don&#39;t need to know the &quot;why&quot; to notice and consider problems with the narrative.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like with 9/11: one doesn&#39;t need to know exactly what happened or who was involved to know that the official story is BS.</p>

<p>As to your questions?  I&#39;m not sure but one thought I&#39;ve had is that ISIS is a totally fictional entity made up entirely of actors pushing propaganda.  This being the case, of course all of the videos they produce would just be more of the same - why would they kill one of their own accomplices (i.e. the actor who would&#39;ve been playing &quot;James Foley&quot;, for instance) when they can just fake it and very few people will know or care about the difference?</p>

<p>Just a thought, like I said I don&#39;t have the answers - but I think there&#39;s a ton of sketchiness surrounding ISIS and the videos they&#39;ve put out regardless of whether people are actually being murdered or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the only one who has ever been able to articulate this point. The videos may be faked because they are made here in the US, by Americans,  who are pretending to be operating in the middle east. Makes some sense when you consider it, I agree.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Perhaps.  And as I think we both agree, the videos are being used for propaganda purposes regardless so the end result is mostly the same - the only issue is whether innocent people are actually dying or not.</p>

<p>I definitely have my suspicions regarding the first few videos though, the last second cut aways from the beheadings just struck me as odd, as did the British guys who were apparently ISIS members, as did the lack of emotion from the victims despite knowing they probably had mere seconds to live, as did the western intelligence agency that somehow had the videos before anyone else, etc., etc.  They just didn&#39;t <em>seem</em> real while I was watching them, nothing like videos of beheadings I&#39;ve seen in the past which are brutal and tough to watch, and often show the victims crying and pleading for their lives.</p>

<p>However, to your point, I guess that if the videos are propaganda they would have an element of &quot;unreality&quot; to them regardless of if people are actually being killed in them or not.  Who knows - bottom line is we&#39;re all being manipulated either way and ISIS is almost certainly the new Al Qaeda 2.0 boogeyman, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p>Because it didn&#39;t look like him and didn&#39;t show any beheading. Have you researched Foley at all? His reporting was shit and he was captured not once, but <em>twice</em>. And if he&#39;s cover/a plant/playing the game like I posit he is - you don&#39;t kill your own guys. You&#39;ll never get more recruits. Same reason we haven&#39;t extracted Snowden and have given him interviews on with Brian Fuckin&#39; Williams (who has since been outed as a shill and fired, by the way).</p>

<p>Answered above.</p>

<p>And the best part about this <em>theory</em> (you&#39;re on a conspiracy board after all, don&#39;t forget that) is I don&#39;t have to satisfactorially answer this for my theory to be proven true. Who cares why they faked them? They did.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t show beheadings. Any of the first two seasons for the Western audience (which I argue concluded with the Japanese prisoners, which were even worse as far as production value goes).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am wondering exactly how hard it is to cut someone&#39;s head off with a knife like that. It can&#39;t be easy. The person is going to be thrashing around and wouldn&#39;t the blood be dark red?</p>

<p>I have been stabbed before and that blood was really dark red. It also was thick not watery like this video suggests. </p>

<p>Cutting thru all that tendon and ligaments would be a pain in the ass. Added to the fact I would think your heart would pump until your spine was cut. Then the person would be thrashing around cause oh they are getting their goddamn head cut off.</p>

<p>Not like you got much to lose. I know I would fight like a mother fucker. I really am skeptical on these videos like this. If anyone can show me the error of my logic please point it out. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to be a dick about it either. I will read it or watch it.</p>

Those videos of foreigners getting killed but not showing the actual killing. Could be anything: propaganda towards european youth maybe. My opinion? They are batshit crazy extremists in whose mind it is completely A-OK to kill someone who prays 3 times instead of 4. God knows what they think when they are making these videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>dude all you need to do is spend one night on Twitter making a Twitter List of users who are covering Syria. Western independent journalists. The people from Vice are the best. They will be following/retweeting YPG/PYD Kurds in Syria and Iraq. They will be retweeting members of Shia Militias. And they will be retweeting ISIS fanboys from throughout the Middle East and Europe. In the past 18-24 months I have scrolled past enough cringe-inducing photographs of dead and dismembered corpses to sicken Joffrey Baratheon. Every fighter in the region has a camera phone. This isn&#39;t really a Phenomenon that can be produced and manipulated the way you presume it is.</p>

<p>The production value of ISIS videos increased because they garnered a huge following (aforementioned &quot;fanboys&quot;) in the Gulf States. These losers ship them GoPros and Quadcopters and probably produce their videos for them. It is indeed Reality TV, you&#39;re right on that part.. but it&#39;s not even aimed at the American populace, it&#39;s aimed at that of Qatar/Saudi Arabia. In 2014-2015 once they attacked the Kurds we started to see the videos aimed at Kurdistan. Or that footage of the Jordanian pilot, aimed at the populace of Jordan? </p>

<p>Your entire thesis is a joke and I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve spent this amount of time on it. Anyone paying attention to Syria will tell you this. Every video from someone in that region of the world is aimed at someone else in that region of the world. To compare ISIS videos to Operation Gladio? Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Americans and Europeans are on the sidelines. None of this is about the West. The Middle East has video cameras and media, too, you know. ISIS/JAN TV has nothing to do with drumming up support for Western Government Intervention in Syria unless the footage is hijacked and used by said Governments or their Media Members for that purpose. They&#39;re Electronic Press Kits for ISIS and their supporters. Got nothing to do with us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually quite funny/telling that you&#39;re only just coming around to it now, focusing solely on the Western victims and missing the forest for the trees..? You&#39;re 2-3 years late on it. Did you actually know of these people&#39;s abductions and beheadings before CNN caught wind? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a whole other world out there.</p>

<p>Vice has gone down the tubes since Murdoch and co gave them millions. Says enough about your level of analysis at this point.</p>

<p>Sure it can. And it has.</p>

<p>And yet in the first two <em>seasons</em> &#39;Jihadi John&#39; specifically mentioned Obama, Blair, and the West. So this point is completely and utterly factutally incorrect. Sounds like <em>your thesis</em> needs a rework.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Looks like your reading comprehension skills are a joke. I am comparing ISIS itself to a Gladio operation, and leaked documents coming out <em>now</em> are proving that it was the brainchild of Saddam&#39;s old guards who made the blueprints, attached a religious theme to it, and they were off to the races.</p>

<p>Oh, really? Here I thought they were just praying to Mecca 5 times a day and slapping stones together for fire. Thanks for the education.</p>

<p>This.. Actually happened. The videos are leaked/<em>released</em> from a US private company based in Washington DC, ran by Rita Katz, whose father was tried and executed by Saddam for being an Israeli spy. You think she doesn&#39;t have an axe to grind?</p>
