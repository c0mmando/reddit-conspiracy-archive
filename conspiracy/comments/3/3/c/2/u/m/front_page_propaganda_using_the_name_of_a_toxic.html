       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/33b3hp/bored_entitled_sjw_college_students_at_berkley/">
        This post popped up on my front page.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I was ready to laugh at SJWs (Social Justice Warriors - a group of fringe new-age "feminists" who don't support any of the actual ideals of feminism and seem more obsessed with censoring anything that goes against their idea of every heterosexual white male being literally Hitler), as the recent GamerGate controversy has made it painfully obvious that they're a bunch of wackos that love to make utter fools of themselves in public in the name of faux-feminism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after actually watching the video, I noticed something odd. These people in the video aren't SJWs at all. Not once do they ever mention anything that SJWs care about.
      </p>
      <p>
       What these people are actually doing is protesting against police brutality and the killing of innocent people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is their way of going about it (by blocking off the gates to a college campus) a stupid way of protesting? Yeah, sure. It's pretty stupid, and they could have found a much better way to express their disgust with the police in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look in the comments of the thread, everyone is parroting the idea that these people are SJWs - whose names have become toxic as of late, again, due to GamerGate and their obvious censorship and corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what is happening here, is that shills have swooped in, found a video of people protesting something that actually matters (albeit in a poor way), and spun it around as "those fringe wackos are doing something wacko again!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same thing that they've been doing with the term "conspiracy theorist" for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, anyone pointing out the fact that these people aren't SJWs or that police brutality is a very real, and very serious matter, are being downvoted into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, if you look at
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/33b3hp/bored_entitled_sjw_college_students_at_berkley/cqjffjt">
        my post
       </a>
       in the thread, you can see that I've been downvoted quite a bit (-9 at current, and I was at -2 within 5 minutes of posting it) and I've done nothing but state facts and argue with some guy who is probably a shill, as he is parroting the same nonsense that the top comments are.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, more propaganda for the front page. Shills are fucking losers.

       That thread is jam-packed with astroturfing.  The whole thing is a ploy to push people off of valid social causes: equal rights, free speech, gender rights, basically everything that everyone with half a brain believes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw one of the comment trees had "
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/33b3hp/bored_entitled_sjw_college_students_at_berkley/cqjabdh">
        they're pushing people right
       </a>
       ".  The protestors are characterized as racist among other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But apparently it's been removed from the front page and conservative teenagers in undelete think it's Pao's nefarious equality agenda.  Whoever is running this PsyOp is a fucking evil genius.  It's really terrible; they're succeeding at dividing men and women.  I don't know how to come back from what's happened in the last year.

       Why not avail yourself of the internet to which you are connected evidently by your presence here, and look up the terms individually?  Research multiple sources and come up with a good idea and then you'll be able to contribute to the discussion.

       Anita Sarkeesian has received public accolades.  I have no idea how this actually translates into everyday life, but not every posting on the internet is made by a liar or shill.  A significant amount of damage has been done in a very short time with wedges between different groups.

       That may be true, but I'd just suggest that you avoid the flame-wars and those who are caught up in them. Should be pretty easy to do. I hadn't even read the term "SJW" until last year, and I've never heard it mentioned AFK.

       That's part of my point.  "SJWs" is a new moniker for a group made of liberal, progressive people who did not previously realize they were constituents.  It is a methodology of division applied systematically to multiple demographics of society calling for egalitarian humanist justice.

       This doesn't effect anything. Some random youtube celebrity caused a fuss - a bloo blooo, who cares. This is not a real world issue.

       The ambiguity of the term "social justice warrior" is the problem here. Most of those people, probably OP included, have no real understanding of its typical use in regards to LGBT/feminist extremism.
