    <div class="md"><p>The three main claims of the holocaust---(1) 6,000,000 jews were killed (2) mainly in gas chambers (3) due to an order by Hitler---are questionable.  </p>

<p>I used to believe what I had been taught in school, and by tv, until one day about seven years ago I saw that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=auschwitz+plaque&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=qMz&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;channel=sb&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=S4GgU7LiJtSuyAS4-4LABg&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=789#imgdii=_">the plaque at Auschwitz</a> had been drastically changed, from 4 million, down to &quot;one and a half million...mainly jews.&quot;  And I got to thinking about the number.  I did the math---you can too, anyone can, we have calculators right here on our computers---and found out it was ridiculous.  We&#39;re expected to believe (and we do accept it, unless we investigate) that from the time of the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942 (the alleged date of the order to &quot;exterminate jews&quot;) until Auschwitz was liberated by Russia on January 27, 1945, that Germans killed an average of 5440 jews, every day.</p>

<p>That means we&#39;re supposed to believe that every single day, without fail, on average, 5,440 jews were killed---that&#39;s 227 killed each and every hour, 24 hours each and every day, non-stop, day after day, for over three years---mainly from gas chambers, from the day after the Wannsee Conference to the day of the liberation of Auschwitz. And we&#39;re supposed to believe that the efficient Germans felt it was more important to buy many tons of Zyklon-B (with no receipt) to gas them with, then bought many, many tons of coke (with no receipt) to incinerate the bodies. And just how many Germans were pulled off the front lines to kill 6,000,000 jews and dispose of all the evidence...6,000,000 people they could&#39;ve been using in the work-camps to help their war effort? And this all supposedly occurred while Germany was fighting a war on two fronts.</p>

<p>Why bring 6,000,000 people into a camp by trains to spend even more money to gas them, incinerate them, and dispose of them when they could&#39;ve easily put a single bullet to the base of the skull back in the Warsaw ghetto?</p>

<p>Even if &quot;the holocaust&quot; lasted for 5 years, the numbers still don&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t mistake what I am saying.  I have no affinity for Hitler, I am not a skin-head nor a neo-nazi, nor a supremacist of any type.  I despise all sorts of superiority, whether it&#39;s kkk, aryan nations, muslim brotherhood, zionism, new black panthers, whatever.  Thinking that any one race is better than any other race is bee ess.  This has nothing to do with hating anyone.  It has to do with hating a lie.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying that no jews were killed.  There may have been camps set up specifically to kill jews and others.  But I&#39;m pretty sure the primary killer in Auschwitz was not Zyklon-B showers, but typhus.  </p>

<p>The Germans were expedient and efficient, and they documented everything, including the number of bullets expended in the camps.  And though there is no documentation of extravagant purchases of Zyklon-B for &quot;gas chambers&quot; nor coke for cremation, there is significant documentation for the typhus outbreak.  Typhus had been brought in from the ghetto denizens, and due to the lack of medicine, the sanitation problems created when you house that many people, and the bombing of Germany&#39;s infrastructure, they had a difficult time getting a handle on it.  At one point, there were 30,000 dead in one month due to this horrific disease.  Typhus causes vomiting, diarrhea, and body temps up to 108F.  People boil to death in their skin over a period of weeks.  It is a slow and terrifying way to die.  In an effort to halt the spread of this escalating horror, new inmates were shaved, and their clothes were deloused with Zyklon-B.</p>

<p>Google &quot;Wannsee Conference&quot;.  Check the wording used.  Hitler did not order genocide.</p>

<p>Regarding the 6,000,000, it has been very well documented that the &quot;6,000,000&quot; figure was used for money-making &quot;humanitarian efforts&quot; well before WWII.  In fact, there is a shocking book (at least it was shocking to me!) called <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheFirstHolocaust2003149P..pdfheddesheimerDon-TheFirstHolocaust2">&quot;The First Holocaust&quot; by Don Heddesheime</a>r, where he has photocopied many such newspaper articles claiming that &quot;6,000,000 jews&quot; were in danger of various horrors, and that money needed to be raised to save them, dating back to 40 years before the war.</p>

<p>Regarding the Zyklon-B &quot;gas chambers&quot;, I urge you to read <a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/16-tlr.pdf">the Leuchter Report</a>, as well as <a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/02-trr.pdf">the Rudolf Report</a> on the science.  Also, back in the 80s, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQjNs-Ght8s">a young jewish man named David Cole went to Auschwitz with some questions, and he made a video</a>, available for viewing on Youtube.  You should check it out, and see what he discovered.  </p>

<p>Or don&#39;t.  You&#39;re free to believe whatever you want, as am I.  You can ignore any and all facts in order to make the story fit what you&#39;ve been told.</p>

<p>But as Albert Einstein said, &quot;<strong><em>Condemnation without investigation is the height of ignorance.</em></strong>&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>dont forget that most were killed in furnaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve researched how big the furnaces are, this is a ludicrous assertion. They were obviously for cremating bodies and not for execution. </p>

<p>Also according to the USHMM website, there were only a few camps that actually had gas chambers, all outside the initial borders of Germany. If the Germans&#39; goal was exterminating the Jews:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why have so few gas chambers? There were no gas chambers inside the initial borders of the old reich.</p></li>
<li><p>Why were the gas chambers set out all the way on the front lines of the war? Surely it would have made sense to have them more centrally located?</p></li>
<li><p>Why go to so much effort to hide the killing if it was explicitly part of the Nazi regime? This is the thing I really don&#39;t understand. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re supposed to believe that Treblinka II, for example, was explicitly a death camp, yet it had clinics and workshops, things that Treblinka I had, strange considering they were only a mile away from each other and connected by train. </p>

<p>Also Treblinka II opened in July 1942. Your link, <a href="http://www.ushmm.org">www.ushmm.org</a> says that deportations ceased to Treblinka in May 1943. Only at minimum 5 months later, in the Fall of 1943, did they order that the camp be dismantled.</p>

<p>So we&#39;re supposed to believe that this camp that was equipped to receive and supposedly slaughter 50 or 60 train cars full of people at once was sitting on the front lines of a losing war, fully staffed (by SS officers and doctors), receiving no new victims for 5 to 6 full months? </p>

<p>This is a huge camp by the way, its described as a trapezoid that&#39;s 1312 ft x 1968 ft so it&#39;s at least ~a million square feet. That&#39;s a pretty immense &quot;death camp&quot; to construct and oversee. Strange that it wouldn&#39;t be receiving any new victims for at least 5 months considering your link describes its sole purpose as &quot;mass murder&quot;.</p>

<p>So essentially the official story is that this million plus square foot death camp was constructed, received victims for less than a year, then sat receiving no new deportation for 5 months. Then the Nazis, whose supposed goal was to kill all the jews, wanted to hide their crimes to badly that they had the prisoners exhume 800,000 to 900,000+ bodies, and then burn them, and then crushed up the bones in giant bone crushing machines, that no one has ever seen. (Again this is all from the website you linked to.)</p>

<p>Why would they spend all that manpower to hide what was supposedly the entire point of their regime: killing jews? If Treblinka really was a death camp, why was it sitting empty at the supposed height of Nazi genocide?</p>

<p>Every death camp I&#39;ve investigated has turned out this way, by the way. I&#39;m Jewish for the record, and want to believe the official story but just have seen way too many of the loose ends. I&#39;m not a &quot;holocaust denier&quot;, just someone with more than a casual interest in history, especially historical events that are in many ways the basis for how we operate in modern society, like the Holocaust. Anything you have to say about the specific points I raised, I&#39;m really all ears.</p>

<p>The allied propaganda machine turned the deaths of the typhus epidemic and wartime malnutrition into some sort of non existent genocide by the Germans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there was never a plan of genocide from within the Third Reich. Plans were being made during the war on where they should transport them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">(The transfer agreement)</a></p>

<p>The conditions in the camps were fine, and they were fed and clothed properly. It wasn&#39;t until the chaotic wartime conditions and typhus epidemics broke out when mass deaths started to occur.</p>

<p>You can definitely debate weather some guards were harsh on the prisoners, but it was not widespread as Hollywood movies like to depict it.</p>

<p>The German&#39;s went through great lengths to try and maintain the epidemics (Hence why they shaved their head for lice) and their clothing were fumigated in chambers. </p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDsJtB2F9i8">If you&#39;re interested, Eric Hunts documentary&#39;s on the camps are a great place to start your research if you&#39;re genuinely interested.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;they were fed and clothed properly&quot; that is a huge pile of bullshit. Allied POWs were not fed enough so why would &#39;untermensch&#39; be fed properly? Also one of the worst things for the prisoners in concentration camps were the wholly inadequate wooden clogs which caused many to be unable to walk. </p>

<p>Also at Auchwitz (1) the guards were monsters, many were ex criminals and kept discipline in check</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Staged is a bridge too far.  British and Russian bombing of German supply routes disabled Germany&#39;s ability to provide for those they captured during the war. The allies earned the right to tell that history.</p>

<p>WW2 was a new era in warfighting in that civilians were targeted all across Germany by British bombing campaigns. No longer were bombs reserved for tactical targets. The carpet bombing of the German people is the genocide story that never gets taught in school. Those civilians who weren&#39;t bombed to bits were ravaged by hordes of mongols and godless Russian heathens. </p>
