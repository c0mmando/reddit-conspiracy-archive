       I'm not sure you really understand how the presidential election works nowadays.  It makes no difference what the people think or want.  They are going to make whoever they want as president.  Voting is a masterbatory act people do so they can lie about how free they are.  If they want Hillary as president, then she'll become president regardless of what the people want.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, for sake of argument, let's pretend we actually have a choice.  Even if you were to show every single person in America absolute proof that Hilliary is a baby-eating satanist, the fact of the matter is that the majority of women are going to vote for her simply because she's a woman.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you had her on live television admitting she's actually a man and then whipping out a dick, all she'll have to do is go on TV the next day, laugh, and say that was a joke, and her popularity would actually rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single woman in this country has been conditioned to think that men have been oppressing them and men are responsible for all the horrible things in this world, and what this world needs is a woman leader.  They are simply not going to not support her.

       You must not talk to many women. A good portion of them think this, but a lot don't, and many of them simply don't care about things like politics and voting. Just like men.

       You mean the person who talked about a plan to give a certain amount of money over the course of 20 years or so in the hopes of helping the Ukraine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait I forgot the "nuland tapes" is a buzzword that proves that the US engineered the Russian/Ukranian conflict. Funny how there's not actually anything in the tapes that supports that though. Just the act of giving money to a country isn't proof of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in any case, I don't think this proves your "women have it really easy and all women will vote within their own gender/interests" very well. The GOP has been anti-woman for some time now and still gets quite a few female voters.

       What snipers? Let me guess, you think that the US had snipiers firing into crowds of people (wtf? there is no proof of this). But I bet you don't believe that the current PM ordered his troops to fire on the squads, killing about 77 people"? (was a while ago now, I forget)

       Right, by suggesting that Nuland somehow started a war in Ukraine. I believe that war happened when Putin reacted to a protest and lessening of Russian control by moving troops up to and then eventually over the border.

       Thankfully, despite RT's best efforts, most people realise that the guy who murdered his own people then fled the country was NOT unfairly ousted by Nuland's schemes (of which there is no evidence she actually did anything other than send aid money over the course of a decade).

       Regardless, by trying to get Ukraine into NATO she is trying to start the next global war.  You can call it "helping the Ukraine" if you want, but it really just makes you look like a tool.

       It's constantly amazing to me that people can understand that the media lies and manufactures public opinion all the time, UNLESS it's about a topic they agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one's saying women are stupid, or that everything is their fault. That's a textbook SJW knee-jerk that doesn't at all address the content of what's being said. This radicalized feminism that only serves to polarize the sexes smells a lot like the increased racial tension ahead of Obama's first election.

       Instead of focusing on the negative energy, why not get involved with the candidate that most closely resembles the person you want to see as president and help them get elected instead?

       Ever since I heard where Barry Seal was landing his plane I had it my mind that there was a Clinton connection.

      <p>
       That guy at the end confirmed it for me. And how.

       With all the negative online stories about Clinton lately, I think they're angling towards a Republican in office. It's an easier storyline.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats have to spin war as foreign aid, while the Republicans can chant "USA! USA! USA!" and rally their base for a direct military invasion.

       If the past is any indication, all we need to do is figure out which candidate has the most royal blood in them to determine who the winner will be.  In every single election in the history of the US presidency (to my knowledge), the person with the most royal bloodline has won.

       You mean the person who talked about a plan to give a certain amount of money over the course of 20 years or so in the hopes of helping the Ukraine?
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait I forgot the "nuland tapes" is a buzzword that proves that the US engineered the Russian/Ukranian conflict. Funny how there's not actually anything in the tapes that supports that though. Just the act of giving money to a country isn't proof of anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in any case, I don't think this proves your "women have it really easy and all women will vote within their own gender/interests" very well. The GOP has been anti-woman for some time now and still gets quite a few female voters.

       What snipers? Let me guess, you think that the US had snipiers firing into crowds of people (wtf? there is no proof of this). But I bet you don't believe that the current PM ordered his troops to fire on the squads, killing about 77 people"? (was a while ago now, I forget)

       Right, by suggesting that Nuland somehow started a war in Ukraine. I believe that war happened when Putin reacted to a protest and lessening of Russian control by moving troops up to and then eventually over the border.
