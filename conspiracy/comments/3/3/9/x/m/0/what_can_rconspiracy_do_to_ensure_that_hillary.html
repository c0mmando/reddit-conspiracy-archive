    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you really understand how the presidential election works nowadays.  It makes no difference what the people think or want.  They are going to make whoever they want as president.  Voting is a masterbatory act people do so they can lie about how free they are.  If they want Hillary as president, then she&#39;ll become president regardless of what the people want.</p>

<p>But, for sake of argument, let&#39;s pretend we actually have a choice.  Even if you were to show every single person in America absolute proof that Hilliary is a baby-eating satanist, the fact of the matter is that the majority of women are going to vote for her simply because she&#39;s a woman.</p>

<p>Even if you had her on live television admitting she&#39;s actually a man and then whipping out a dick, all she&#39;ll have to do is go on TV the next day, laugh, and say that was a joke, and her popularity would actually rise.</p>

<p>Every single woman in this country has been conditioned to think that men have been oppressing them and men are responsible for all the horrible things in this world, and what this world needs is a woman leader.  They are simply not going to not support her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean the person who talked about a plan to give a certain amount of money over the course of 20 years or so in the hopes of helping the Ukraine?</p>

<p>Oh wait I forgot the &quot;nuland tapes&quot; is a buzzword that proves that the US engineered the Russian/Ukranian conflict. Funny how there&#39;s not actually anything in the tapes that supports that though. Just the act of giving money to a country isn&#39;t proof of anything.</p>

<p>And in any case, I don&#39;t think this proves your &quot;women have it really easy and all women will vote within their own gender/interests&quot; very well. The GOP has been anti-woman for some time now and still gets quite a few female voters.</p>

<p>What snipers? Let me guess, you think that the US had snipiers firing into crowds of people (wtf? there is no proof of this). But I bet you don&#39;t believe that the current PM ordered his troops to fire on the squads, killing about 77 people&quot;? (was a while ago now, I forget)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and &quot;Fuck the EU.&quot;</p>

<p>Right, eastern Europeans have been taught to hate what might be forward progress. Instead, suckle on the teat of homophobic rights denying Russia! Fuck democracy, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I answered your specific question about women starting global wars.</p>

<p>Right, by suggesting that Nuland somehow started a war in Ukraine. I believe that war happened when Putin reacted to a protest and lessening of Russian control by moving troops up to and then eventually over the border.</p>

<p>Thankfully, despite RT&#39;s best efforts, most people realise that the guy who murdered his own people then fled the country was NOT unfairly ousted by Nuland&#39;s schemes (of which there is no evidence she actually did anything other than send aid money over the course of a decade).</p>

<p>No one&#39;s saying women are stupid, or that everything is their fault. That&#39;s a textbook SJW knee-jerk that doesn&#39;t at all address the content of what&#39;s being said. This radicalized feminism that only serves to polarize the sexes smells a lot like the increased racial tension ahead of Obama&#39;s first election.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean the person who talked about a plan to give a certain amount of money over the course of 20 years or so in the hopes of helping the Ukraine?</p>

<p>Oh wait I forgot the &quot;nuland tapes&quot; is a buzzword that proves that the US engineered the Russian/Ukranian conflict. Funny how there&#39;s not actually anything in the tapes that supports that though. Just the act of giving money to a country isn&#39;t proof of anything.</p>

<p>And in any case, I don&#39;t think this proves your &quot;women have it really easy and all women will vote within their own gender/interests&quot; very well. The GOP has been anti-woman for some time now and still gets quite a few female voters.</p>

<p>Sure she did. I&#39;m sure those snipers really helped the Ukraine.</p>

<p>What snipers? Let me guess, you think that the US had snipiers firing into crowds of people (wtf? there is no proof of this). But I bet you don&#39;t believe that the current PM ordered his troops to fire on the squads, killing about 77 people&quot;? (was a while ago now, I forget)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, and &quot;Fuck the EU.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, eastern Europeans have been taught to hate what might be forward progress. Instead, suckle on the teat of homophobic rights denying Russia! Fuck democracy, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I answered your specific question about women starting global wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, by suggesting that Nuland somehow started a war in Ukraine. I believe that war happened when Putin reacted to a protest and lessening of Russian control by moving troops up to and then eventually over the border.</p>
