    <div class="md"><p>Oswald&#39;s CIA connections make it hard to believe he was just eating a sandwich in a building along the president&#39;s motorcade route, overlooking the stretch of road where he&#39;s assassinated. </p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking it went down something like this: &quot;O, we have intelligence indicating that the Soviets are plotting to take out JFK. We need you in a sniper&#39;s nest ready to take out the shooter. You&#39;ll be part of a team, so don&#39;t be alarmed if you see other agents in the area. Our man in Dallas will provide you with a weapon, which will totally not be loaded with blanks. Good luck, soldier. By the way, all this is Top Secret, national security, we will disavow if yadda yadda you know the drill.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://youtu.be/U1Qt6a-vaNM">Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick</a> makes a pretty compelling case for the multiple shooter theory, with some interesting twists I hadn&#39;t considered. For example, the &quot;Man on the Grassy Knoll&quot; is sorta pop culture&#39;s mascot for conspiracy theorists, but I was never convinced that colorized Moorman Photo shit was anything other than a very creative use of MS Paint.</p>

<p>The filmmaker assumes LHO is in on the plot, but I don&#39;t really buy it. I think the true conspirators kept him in the dark about the real mission, planned on setting him up, and hoped the cops would take him out in the manhunt. That didn&#39;t happen, but Oswald&#39;s covert status was enough to keep him quiet while the higher-ups coordinated Jack Ruby&#39;s hit job and ultimately sealed the deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK II has a ton of good info in it.  Until the documentary below came out, I thought it was the best accounting of what happened.</p>

<p>JFK II <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we3vEvOhKR0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we3vEvOhKR0</a></p>

<p>JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man&#39;s Trick
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1Qt6a-vaNM</a> </p>

<p>As far as it relates to JFK, I believe this is what actually transpired.  It does not contradict any info of JFK II,  and ties up alot of the loose ends left with it.  It is a long movie, but well worth th watch.  Even if you have to do it in segements.  At the 1hour 45min point it goes into the actual operations of the shooters.  The reaction of JFK&#39;s head to the final shot makes total sense where he claims it came from.  It wasn&#39;t the school book depository, or the grassy knoll...  But once you see it, it is undeniable.   You can fact check the info as it relates to JFK (I did)in this movie, and its solid.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it involved our government, the Mafia and possibly international hitmen. It started with some of the most powerful people in the gov. and trickled down from there. I believe Oswald was working for ONI, the FBI or most likely both and unwittingly the CIA. I think that George Joaniddes CIA files from JM/wave need to be released as well as all CIA files from that era. I mean come on its almost 52 years. How many major players are still alive? Maybe when George Bush die they will tell the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty close. JM/wave was there, Hunt and CIA behind the grassy knoll, Max Wallace in the DalTex building, Sarti for the Mafia.</p>

<p>Though my impression of the head shot makes me believe it came from the direction of the overpass. Entrance wound in right front temple and exit in the right occipital area, least that&#39;s what all the doctors saw at Parkland.</p>

<p>The big movers were Allen Dulles, the Bush family, Mafia, big oil, and JM/wave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98OSYceGvWA">Hunt&#39;s dearth bed confession</a> he said he was just backup, not the actual shooter. I feel the kill shot came from either the DalTex building or from the direction of the overpass. Mac Wallace in the DalTex or JM/wave at the overpass.</p>

<p>Sarti may have been behind the fence, but remember the tramps were also. They were grabbed by police in a train car. The angle of the bullet path through the head seems to me to show from DalTex or overpass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watched a doc called From JFK to 9/11: A Rich Man&#39;s Trick or something to that effect, the guy seemed pretty sure there were 8 shooters, 16 shots most of which totally missed, and the big kill shot came from the sewer below the grassy knoll.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I watched that. But how could a bullet from the sewer create an exit wound in the lower right rear of the head? It would have entered at his jaw from that angle. Autopsy photos show no wounds in the front of JFK&#39;s face. The only angle that works for an entrance would to the right temple and exit wound in the lower right rear is from the direction of the overpass. </p>

<p>I agree that there were a lot of shots. One to Kennedy&#39;s throat, his back and his head. A couple to Connolly, and a bunch to the limo, street sign, curb and grass. </p>
