       Children are getting cancer and no one seems to care besides them getting better. 50years ago children didn't get cancer. There is obviously something causing children to get cancer more frequently and no one seems to care what the cause is. They only care about a "cure".  If you bring up the fact that cancer rates are 1000s and 1000s of percent up you are instantly a conspiracy theorists. Why is America so brain dead?

       Lot's of reasons for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines, fluoride, artificial chemicals in the food/processed food, political correctness, media influence, education (lack thereof), I could go on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's self reinforcing too, once you mold society to see fluoride/vaccines/processed food as normal and acceptable, you quite literally dumb down the population even more as your control over media forces them to do/believe things that are not in their best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dissenting opinions are squashed, and the people are divided, easy to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing too is that we know what causes cancer, an imbalance in body chemistry. When they say x might be "carcinogenic" what they mean is that it causes chaos in body chemistry to such a high state that it can be definitely called "carcinogenic".
      </p>
      <p>
       The cure/answer/reason for cancer was known in the 30s, research otto von warburg who won the nobel prize in medicine for his work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cancer cells do not grow in alkaline (oxygen rich) environments, and will actively start to die off if the body's PH is raised to 8.0 or higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason cancer rates are so high is because people are filling their bodies with acidic and generally toxic "food esqe" items that over time add up to cause cancer. It is good to eat a balance of foods, and there is nothing inherently wrong with "acidic" foods as long as it is balanced out by alkaline foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       You combine the (mostly) acidic foods with tons of household chemicals (detergents/soaps) combined with fluoride in the water and toothpaste, combined with taking showers in chlorine water, combined with BPA laced plastic, and aluminum everywhere, and the body can only keep up the balancing for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       And before some (thinks he knows it all) armchair internet expert comes in here and tells me the usual line: "oh but the body always regulates PH so it doesn't matter what you eat" keep in mind just because the body tries to regulate it doesn't mean that eating a high acid diet is not damaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like saying that the body will always heal cuts/scrapes so it doesn't matter how many times you cut yourself because the body is always going to heal it anyways...

       The thing is, there is no money to be made by big pharma if the cure is merely to stop consuming so many chemicals, eat healthy, and get better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drugs are needed to make money, and if you approach "curing cancer" with the need for drugs, you will never find a cure as the problem is not one solved by consuming more things, but less.

       So what foods are alkaline? Fresh fruits and veggies? What if your taste buds wretch and gag when you have these? Does that go away? I seriously hate most fruit and veg, but a shitty chicken mcnugget tastes great. That's a conspiracy in itself cause I can't be the only one that has a taste for toxic food.

       It is, fast food companies put tons of dopamine inducing chemicals in their foods, lots of sugar, salt, and fat. Many chemicals added to food are not necessary for the actual food itself, only the "feel good" effect, such as MSG.

       Thanks. No, I'm an adult and actually in good physical shape, but just can't get myself off the toxic food as much as I would like, maybe cause I just don't know how to cook or select good foods. Thanks for your insight. I can engineer anything, but lack basic food skills.

       Google is your friend. Children getting cancer back then was incredibly rare and pretty much unheard of. Same with autism. The rate was 1 in 50k in the 60s now its 1 in 86.

       its 1 in 68. Google 1960s autism rate and you will find it which its 1 in 50k.  Its just not on the cdc website(unless I have't found it) because its not the 60s anymore.

       No shit its changed. But you have to be a complete moron to think it will go from 1 in 50k to 1 in 68. It may go from 1 in 50k to maybe 1 in 40k or maybe a little bit less than that but if you really think it went to 1 in 68 you should just drop out of life. + if you read the chart its constantly changing and projected to be 1 in 25 within a few years.

       Yes, changing the metric to something considerably more fine grained can do that. Of course, that also ignores one of the other important factors in determining autism risk; parental age.

       That's an excellent attitude! Whether it's a downvote or an upvote I perceive it all as a confirmation. That's how I make sure I never need to reevaluate my ideas and my statements when everybody is confirming them.

       People laugh at California but the fact is that lots of shit causes cancer... even outside of California. This is because you're not required to prove industrial chemicals safe before marketing and selling them.

       Science denial is the reason america is brain dead? Really?

       I mean, forget global warming and evolution for a second as those are not only no brainers, but the overall controversy is amongst the religious anyways.

       What other "science denial" examples are actually causing people to be brain dead?
