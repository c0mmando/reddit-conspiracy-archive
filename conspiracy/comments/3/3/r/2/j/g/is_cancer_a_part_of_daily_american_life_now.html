<p>Why is America so brain dead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lot&#39;s of reasons for this.</p>

<p>Vaccines, fluoride, artificial chemicals in the food/processed food, political correctness, media influence, education (lack thereof), I could go on and on. </p>

<p>It&#39;s self reinforcing too, once you mold society to see fluoride/vaccines/processed food as normal and acceptable, you quite literally dumb down the population even more as your control over media forces them to do/believe things that are not in their best interests.</p>

<p>Dissenting opinions are squashed, and the people are divided, easy to control. </p>

<p>The funny thing too is that we know what causes cancer, an imbalance in body chemistry. When they say x might be &quot;carcinogenic&quot; what they mean is that it causes chaos in body chemistry to such a high state that it can be definitely called &quot;carcinogenic&quot;.</p>

<p>The cure/answer/reason for cancer was known in the 30s, research otto von warburg who won the nobel prize in medicine for his work. </p>

<p>Cancer cells do not grow in alkaline (oxygen rich) environments, and will actively start to die off if the body&#39;s PH is raised to 8.0 or higher.</p>

<p>The reason cancer rates are so high is because people are filling their bodies with acidic and generally toxic &quot;food esqe&quot; items that over time add up to cause cancer. It is good to eat a balance of foods, and there is nothing inherently wrong with &quot;acidic&quot; foods as long as it is balanced out by alkaline foods.</p>

<p>You combine the (mostly) acidic foods with tons of household chemicals (detergents/soaps) combined with fluoride in the water and toothpaste, combined with taking showers in chlorine water, combined with BPA laced plastic, and aluminum everywhere, and the body can only keep up the balancing for so long. </p>

<p>And before some (thinks he knows it all) armchair internet expert comes in here and tells me the usual line: &quot;oh but the body always regulates PH so it doesn&#39;t matter what you eat&quot; keep in mind just because the body tries to regulate it doesn&#39;t mean that eating a high acid diet is not damaging.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying that the body will always heal cuts/scrapes so it doesn&#39;t matter how many times you cut yourself because the body is always going to heal it anyways...</p>

<p>Drugs are needed to make money, and if you approach &quot;curing cancer&quot; with the need for drugs, you will never find a cure as the problem is not one solved by consuming more things, but less.</p>

<p>Yes, along with plenty of other things.</p>

<p>Well if you&#39;re not 12, and a grown adult then you might have some kind of phobia or other problem.</p>

<p>It does for most people once they hit adult age.</p>

<p>It is, fast food companies put tons of dopamine inducing chemicals in their foods, lots of sugar, salt, and fat. Many chemicals added to food are not necessary for the actual food itself, only the &quot;feel good&quot; effect, such as MSG. </p>

<p>Yes, changing the metric to something considerably more fine grained can do that. Of course, that also ignores one of the other important factors in determining autism risk; parental age.</p>
