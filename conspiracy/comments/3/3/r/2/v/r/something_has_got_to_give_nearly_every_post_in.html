<p>My 1 vote per post is always an up vote here. Because I know that we have been infiltrated or are at least being trolled by down vote brigades.</p>

<p>Even non subscribers can down vote posts when they are born dropping approval to 50% therefore making it a struggle for posts to avoid being buried.</p>

<p><a href="/r/xboxone">/r/xboxone</a> has a system in place that I believe could benefit this community in regards to this issue. Non-subscribers are not allowed to down vote. </p>

<p>If we implemented the same policy I believe it would save many great posts from being disregarded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although it would be a welcome and helpful change. It wouldn&#39;t change as much as you think. Anyone can make a bot brigade with every account subscribed to the sub, and downvote all the same.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the main problem, organized bot downvote brigades. It&#39;s why even though this sub has passed 300k members, many posts struggle to reach even 50 upvotes and it&#39;s why the ratio of upvotes/downvotes is always around 60% upvoted. It&#39;s not that only 60% of users find it worthy of upvoting, it&#39;s more like 90% upvote, and bot brigades supply the majority of downvotes...</p>

<p>If anything, the main change would only affect frontpage posts that hit thousands of net upvotes, so regular people from the main subs can&#39;t come in and downvote. It would be unusual for non subscribers to come to r/conspiracy and mass downvote the &quot;new&quot; category...other than bot brigades which are going to subscribe anyways if this change is made. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on and off the new queue most of the day. At a couple points, it looks like a single user or a couple of users may have gone through and downvoted a bunch of stuff. I didn&#39;t notice anything falling below -1 or - 2 when this happened, so I don&#39;t subscribe to the notion that it&#39;s a brigade or group of people systematically doing stuff; rather, just one or two people being jerks. I&#39;d imagine a concentrated effort at censorship by an outside interest would have larger results than this.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen, this isn&#39;t an unusual occurrence on most subreddits. For example, the new queue on <a href="/r/magictcg">/r/magictcg</a> often has most posts sitting between 0 and -2 for a bit. (I chose this subreddit for comparison as it seems like a sub where corporate and political interests wouldn&#39;t have much, if any, any need to directly influence or guide the dialogue. And I&#39;m a nerd.)</p>

<p>That being said, I haven&#39;t been sitting here staring at my screen all day relentlessly, been doing some housework and whatnot, so it&#39;s possible there was a real brigading incident and I wasn&#39;t sitting here when something major happened.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t generally downvote stuff, as I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s constructive to a conversation. </p>
