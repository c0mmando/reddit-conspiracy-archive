       Yes this is a conspiracy within

       and however ridiculous it may sound, I urge you to look for yourself.

      <p>
       My 1 vote per post is always an up vote here. Because I know that we have been infiltrated or are at least being trolled by down vote brigades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even non subscribers can down vote posts when they are born dropping approval to 50% therefore making it a struggle for posts to avoid being buried.

       <a href="/r/xboxone">
        /r/xboxone

       has a system in place that I believe could benefit this community in regards to this issue. Non-subscribers are not allowed to down vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we implemented the same policy I believe it would save many great posts from being disregarded.

       I've suggested before that we just remove it altogether here. It goes with the anti-censorship theme of the sub, and it stops things being buried before they even get a chance. Right now it's preventing more relevant stories than it stops shitty ones.

       I would support such a move. It would not solve the problem, as subscribing is a button click away, but might help mitigate it. My guess would be anyone who consistently downvotes the new queue is likely subscribed already.
      </p>
      <p>
       There a number of us who browse the new queue when we have time and upvote worthy posts. I think this is the only long-term solution, so our best bet is to spread the word.

       If you can tell that I am voting on a linked post (the np. bullshit), there has to be a way of knowing the vote counts for all users. Who's up for showing everybody their voting records?

       What about making a new sub with a bot that automatically crossposts posts that get a weird number of downvotes? Kind of like

       Although it would be a welcome and helpful change. It wouldn't change as much as you think. Anyone can make a bot brigade with every account subscribed to the sub, and downvote all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the main problem, organized bot downvote brigades. It's why even though this sub has passed 300k members, many posts struggle to reach even 50 upvotes and it's why the ratio of upvotes/downvotes is always around 60% upvoted. It's not that only 60% of users find it worthy of upvoting, it's more like 90% upvote, and bot brigades supply the majority of downvotes...
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, the main change would only affect frontpage posts that hit thousands of net upvotes, so regular people from the main subs can't come in and downvote. It would be unusual for non subscribers to come to r/conspiracy and mass downvote the "new" category...other than bot brigades which are going to subscribe anyways if this change is made.

       I think it's a good idea that only subscribers are allowed to vote, especially since this sub gets attacked frequently. Maybe talk to one of the mods!

       It happens in other subs as well. Last night I posted a photo of a school lunch that had printed numbers on the hamburger bun and it got downvoted to hide the facts. People are trying to reach out to let other people know but the "protection trolls" finds way to bury it.

       This is exactly the type of stuff that made me make a post yesterday about weighting the upvote system.   I take it from the lack of traction that it gained that the community thought it was a bad idea,  but i really think we should try and come up with a creative solution to this problem.  It not a huge issue,  But the bigger this sub gets, the more vote brigading its going to receive.

       Is there anyway to make all the votes public by user?  I am all for an open subreddit, no one should have anything to hide here, that's the point.

       I've been on and off the new queue most of the day. At a couple points, it looks like a single user or a couple of users may have gone through and downvoted a bunch of stuff. I didn't notice anything falling below -1 or - 2 when this happened, so I don't subscribe to the notion that it's a brigade or group of people systematically doing stuff; rather, just one or two people being jerks. I'd imagine a concentrated effort at censorship by an outside interest would have larger results than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've seen, this isn't an unusual occurrence on most subreddits. For example, the new queue on
       <a href="/r/magictcg">
        /r/magictcg
       </a>
       often has most posts sitting between 0 and -2 for a bit. (I chose this subreddit for comparison as it seems like a sub where corporate and political interests wouldn't have much, if any, any need to directly influence or guide the dialogue. And I'm a nerd.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I haven't been sitting here staring at my screen all day relentlessly, been doing some housework and whatnot, so it's possible there was a real brigading incident and I wasn't sitting here when something major happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't generally downvote stuff, as I don't believe it's constructive to a conversation.

       I've suggested before that we just remove it altogether here. It goes with the anti-censorship theme of the sub, and it stops things being buried before they even get a chance. Right now it's preventing more relevant stories than it stops shitty ones.
