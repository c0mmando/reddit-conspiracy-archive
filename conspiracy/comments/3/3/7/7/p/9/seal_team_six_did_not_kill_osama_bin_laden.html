        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello fellow redditors, friends.</p>

<p>I was in the US military, I was never in any super secret special forces part of the military, but my experiences did &quot;wake me up&quot;. </p>

<p>I was about 12 when the planes hit the towers, and I thought it was just another Tuesday, people die all the time right? Nbd.</p>

<p>Eventually I finished High School and all my friends enlisted, so I blindly followed suit because, well, America? I don&#39;t even honestly know why anymore at this point.</p>

<p>Anyways, this is supposed to be about that terrible bin laden fellow. Well, here&#39;s the thing guys... Our president bush was friends with that man, he never wanted bin laden killed! (I can post a video for proof later when I&#39;m sober). Our special forces had sights on him right away, we&#39;re America after all, it does not take us 10 years to kill a person any more.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care about my karma at all so vote however you please, but what I do know is Bin Laden died in 2005. He died because of some medical issues with his kidneys, he was never shot in the head by US forces 10 years later, sorry. Us politicians didn&#39;t want him dead, that would have ended our fight over oil too soon and it was &quot; important &quot; to re-elect Obama. That is all, and this shit pisses me the fuck off, good day.</p>

<p>It is so sad that so many young people, in the prime of their lives, are going through this, knowing that they were a veteran of death and misery and knowing it is our own government who are the terrorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, don&#39;t blame those guys. I know a lot of soldiers, and the vast majority have/had good intentions. People actually trusted the government back in the early 2000s. The propaganda machine was running strong 24/7, everyone&#39;s blood was boiling. So many impressionable individuals were eager to go kill brown people in Iraq out of some warped sense of patriotic duty. It was borderline mind control, they didn&#39;t know any better.</p>

<p>I like to think people are smarter these days. In 2013, when they were pushing for a ground war in Syria because of alleged chemical weapons, the response from the population was an overwhelming &quot;FUCK THAT, We aren&#39;t falling for that shit again&quot; and you know what? It worked, we didn&#39;t invade Syria that year. Although ISIS conveniently appeared very soon after, so now we have a fresh evil boogeyman to go invade Syria over. Strange how everything always works out perfectly for the military industrial complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are two more credible alternatives than the official narrative. On one he died in December 2001 and on the other in 2003. From 2005 on nobody saw a new OBL video, but there were quite a few rumours that he was already dead. The audio tapes later on were fake and the videos were old footage to remind the public of the Boogey man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing that really has interested me were the interviews. There were four important ones, I believe, if memory serves me correctly. The first two showed an aged and elderly bin Laden. The third one on the other hand showed clearly a younger Bin Laden. Yet the media claimed it was a current bin Laden video, and, funny enough it was this video where he claimed responsibility of 9/11. </p>

<p>I just found this oddly strange and go figure the only video where he on video taking claim for the attacks is also one where he looks different. Back when I first noticed it I emailed a few friends the different pictures asking which bin Laden faces looked faked and all of them pointed to the one where he has the black beard. This would be impossible as he had a graying beard and wrinkles as early as the 90s.</p>
