<p>Not even halfway through this documentary, but it absolutely needs to be seen by as many people as possible.  I think it&#39;s been put up as an OP here before, but it definitely bears posting again.</p>

<p>...and it&#39;s about a LOT more than what the title alone suggests.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Just finished watching the entire video.  Absolutely amazing and choc full of stunning information.  An absolute must watch for anyone who wants to have a better idea of what&#39;s really going on in this planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes sir.  People should definitely watch it in parts if they can.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m currently doing.  I still haven&#39;t even finished watching the whole thing, but I wanted to link it here for others to watch.  The information in it as absolutely incredible.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  As MrMarmot said, it talks about some of the <em>real</em> players and motives behind some of the most significant global movements that have taken place in the past century or so.</p>

<p>This should be like...mandatory study - not only for people in this subreddit, but for <em>every fucking SCHOOL KID in the United States</em>.  They&#39;d end up knowing more BY FAR than their teachers if they watched and studied this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow.  You watched the whole thing?  I&#39;m still just a little over halfway through with it.  I&#39;m seriously multitasking also and doing other things, etc, so I&#39;m coming back to it bit by bit, but wow.  Impressive that you&#39;ve already watched all of it.</p>

<p>And yeah.  So far it&#39;s <em>very</em> intense indeed.</p>

<p>Some <em>serious</em> fuckery afoot in this country and on this planet.  This country is pretty much a covert dictatorship if you really stop to think about it.  That&#39;s a pretty bad thing.</p>

<p>The assassination of President John F. Kennedy lingers as one of the most traumatic events of the twentieth century. The open and shut nature of the investigation which ensued left many global citizens unsettled and dissatisfied, and nagging questions concerning the truth behind the events of that fateful day remain to this day. Evidence of this can be found in the endless volumes of conspiracy-based materials which have attempted to unravel and capitalize on the greatest murder mystery in American history.</p>

<p>Now, a hugely ambitious documentary titled Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick adds fuel to those embers of uncertainty, and points to many potential culprits whose possible involvement in the assassination has long been obscured by official historical record.</p>

<p>Authoritatively written and narrated by Francis Richard Conolly, the film begins its labyrinthine tale during the era of World War I, when the wealthiest and most powerful figures of industry discovered the immense profits to be had from a landscape of ongoing military conflict. The film presents a persuasive and exhaustively researched argument that these towering figures formed a secret society by which they could orchestrate or manipulate war-mongering policies to their advantage on a global scale, and maintain complete anonymity in their actions from an unsuspecting public. Conolly contends that these sinister puppet masters have functioned and thrived throughout history - from the formation of Nazism to the build-up and aftermath of September 11.</p>

<p>The election of President Kennedy in 1960 represented a formidable threat to these shadowy structures of power, including high-profile figures within the Mafia, crooked politicians, and the world&#39;s most influential and notorious war profiteers. Thus, a plot was hatched which would end Kennedy&#39;s reign prior to any chance of re-election, thereby restoring the order and freedoms of these secret societies.</p>

<p>At nearly three and a half hours, Everything is a Rich Man&#39;s Trick examines a defining event of our times from a perspective not often explored. While it may or may not win over viewers who remain skeptical of mass-scale conspiracy, it presents its findings in a measured and meticulous manner which demands attention and consideration.</p>
