       I can comment re:

       - he messaged me privately this afternoon stating he had to unplug for a bit but stated he would return at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have lives here outside of this little world we created, and sometimes users here either get paranoid or need to unplug for a bit (I went really deep two months ago and had you guys pulled me back up, of which I am eternally grateful).
      </p>
      <p>
       When he approached me to help mod
       <a href="/r/C_S_T">
        /r/C_S_T
       </a>
       I initially had reservations since his account was like 1 month old, but he said he deletes and remakes from time to time (and I know others do the same once in awhile).
      </p>
      <p>
       And I haven't told anyone this yet, and have dismissed it as of late, but after last week's
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       WTC7 thread that was pretty successful and got some real exposure, I received some threatening text messages (of which I never give out my number), as well as some cryptic texts from friends who state they
       <em>
        did not
       </em>
       send the texts I received).
      </p>
      <p>
       Area code was Chicago, and I haven't really pursued it. Maybe he got something similar and wanted to take a step back. Just speculation on my part, sure, but as far as I can tell he wasn't deleted by admins or anything, but it was self-inflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also just received a credit application for a used car loan that I certainly didn't apply for, but that could be completely unrelated. Just got it via snail mail today to confirm things from a credit union in a town over 50 miles away that I've never contacted.

       If what you say is true, you are faced with the question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this coincidental, or an attack on your person?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you trust your friends? What do you mean by "cryptic messages"? Are you sure they didn't send them? If you're telling the truth, you can document it all for posterity, and hopefully also publish a privacy-preserving version so that we can investigate it further. But if you're not, at least flesh out the story with more detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clandestine threats are nullified if you publicize yourself and document the threat -- and if the threat needs to remain clandestine. If nothing happens, you are "discredited" for having a "paranoid moment". But if something happens to you, it must happen without the cover of silence.

       I can imgur some screenshots if you wish. I'll crop out my buddy's info but leave the other one up. I didn't think they were related initially but they were both sent at 4:15 AM one morning at the same time, which was interesting.

       Well, I'd be really interested to see this stuff. You never know, maybe others will chime in that they've had similar experiences. Maybe not. Either way, it might shed light on the situation, and if the threats are credible, it might neutralize them. You might want to make a separate post of it though, i think it's something a lot of folks here would be curious to know.

       I'm trying to connect with my buddy before I do anything with his text (since they were at the exact same time that have to be related IMO). I'm going to try and connect with him this weekend and then if he can't satisfactorily answer I'll post them both. May not be for a day or two. I originally wanted to ignore it, but don't think it's that credible and putting it out there isn't really going to escalate things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've worked pretty hard over the last few months to deconstruct and remove any levels of fear I've developed over my 32 years on this planet that I've been indoctrinated with in this country (that sounds cliche, but fuck it).
      </p>
      <p>
       They want us scared, fearful, and willing to sacrifice things for other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at this point, I think I'm educated enough and understand things enough that when you are immune to fear, you are really uncontrollable, which is what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       want least.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll keep everyone updated here.

       Yeah, I think it's just a trolling kid and have disregarded it - but can post a screenshot of it if you want. I do have hesitations as I just wanted to send a message that I'm unaffected by it, but thought I'd at least bring it up here with the drama if deleted mods and such.

       That and it coinciding within the exact minute of a text by a buddy that was pretty cryptic that he denies sending gave me pause for a day or two, but my history this last week shows that I'm not going anywhere so far.

       Maybe. We used to hang weekly and converse daily, but I know he's got other things going on in his life and for whatever reason he has cut me out as of late (we last hung out the Friday of podcastgate), and haven't had a chance to meet up and talk about the text and whatever else is going on with him (I'm trying to give him time to work on whatever he's working on).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll keep you all in the loop, but when I did the standard reverse phone lookup stuff all I got was reports from other people stating that it's 'probably just a kid' and just a number where threatening/trolling texts are sent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a link to one of the sites - I don't think it's a good idea to post a screen shot at this point (of either text) until anything else happens.

       The last thing I want is to pursue it and make a bigger deal of it than it is, as I can take care of myself quite easily. If anything I think it would result in a formal doxx, of which I wouldn't be too thrilled about (but wouldn't be the end of the world, as I mostly post here about things that I can verify are bullshit and am just trying to shed light on propaganda/deceptions that we're all subjected to daily, and if my name was attached to that type of online discourse it wouldn't be the worst thing, but still something I'd like to avoid at this point if I can. Know what i mean?

        I'll keep you all in the loop, but when I did the standard reverse phone lookup stuff all I got was reports from other people stating that it's 'probably just a kid' and just a number where threatening/trolling texts are sent.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So was the threat specific to you or anything you've said lately? It sounds like either this is anumber that is used regularily for this kind of thing or you just happened to get a troll text with really bad timing.

       Interesting... looking at the website for the phone number it sounds like it might be used by an anonymizer app or something similar as they are all harassing phone calls/texts coming from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's the case I'd say most likely some troll with too much time on their hands.

       Heck if I know. Alot of the information put out there is to discredit people by association, so I don't want to say something and have it taken the wrong way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be my imagination, but for the post-offices, I had local law enforcement confirm that my mail was being gone through. The webmaster for my old email was a relative and they noticed the disruptions before I did.

      <p>
       Right now, my only logical guess is that this may be due to my involvement with politics and voter data (which seems absurd,) or due to having friends in Russia (which seems even more preposterous,) or from going through source code for college placement tests that had a glass ceiling depending on demographics (which again, doesn't seem to explain this.)

       you break the rules"!

       I was banned from r/tressless the other day for saying negative things about a certain prescription drug. I'm almost certain shills of the manufacturer of this drug inhabit that subreddit. I got baited into saying something inflammatory but for some reason the other guy didn't get banned. I called him the dumbest person I have ever talked to and he called me mentally ill or something. Go figure

       Is that really what you think at this point?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's an honest question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a very level-headed and rational guy.  I don't even entertain many things I see.  Either I'm not ready to follow that to the truth or not, or it just doesn't seem like a priority compared to other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, while I knew all of this was coming "someday", I'm genuinely getting worried.  You all don't know me, I don't expect anything.  Just putting my opinion out there.
