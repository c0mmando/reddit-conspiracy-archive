       NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.

         Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study

         Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:

       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.

        <a href="http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/steel.html">
         Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:

       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.

          In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled “WTC Dust Signature,” at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove (to its insurance company) that the building was “pervasively contaminated with WTC Dust

        Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed.
        <strong>
         OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.

       This and WTC 7's free fall into its own footprint from fire on one corner of the building are huge red flags.

       Coordinated thermite explosions make a lot more sense in the collapse of all three towers than jet fuel and office fires.

       In all fairness this is like the question "was there evidence of explosions". The Nist reply is no. Then when asked if they actually looked for any evidence of explosions the answer was also no.

      <p>
       None was found likely because it was never searched for.

       Unfortunately non of these people has put forward a published paper that is critical of NIST's findings. Simply saying "I DISAGREE" is not a scientific refutation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these groups really believed that NIST's report was a fraud, then take the data used to create their model, and show the world how horribly wrong they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that won't happen. They know what outcome it will produce. The exact same one as the scientists who were on retainer for Aegis Insurance gave sworn testimoney to.

        single

       I would say that you don't manage to get a paper published in the Journal of Structural Engineering without adhereing to the scientific process. I haven't read through the paper that the other guy posted just yet, but from what I gathered from skimming through it, its nothing to do with how the data was collected.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would object to the data being poorly collected. If so it would be simply impossible to create an independant model, but that happened. When Aegis Insurance was investigating to attempt to prove neglect, NIST's findings (ie WTC7's collapse) were all corroborated under oath by several preeminent experts (e.g., Guy Nordenson, Joseph P. Colaco, and Jose Torero) who independently created and analyzed their own collapse model at Edinburgh University.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extrinsic data is there. To say the least, a model that produces a fire induced collapse, and one that shows a thermite controlled demolition would be
       <em>
        drastically
       </em>
       different. Nothing of the sort has been shown. I'm almost certain that A&amp;E49/11Truth have tried, but do you really think they'd come out and say, "Hey, we built our model, and it further confirms what we called a fraud." Not a chance.

       The "professionals" involved in the creation and release of the NIST report have lied, omitted critical evidence, violated standard investigation protocol, ignore FOIA requests and refuse to release their model data for peer review. Thousands of experts disagree with NIST findings and have put their careers on the line to expose this unscientific and fraudulent report. Their knowledge and expertise equip us with the credible evidence for demolition. Here they are on

      <p>
       I would say that you don't manage to get a paper published in the Journal of Structural Engineering without adhereing to the scientific process. I haven't read through the paper that the other guy posted just yet, but from what I gathered from skimming through it, its nothing to do with how the data was collected.

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I would object to the data being poorly collected. If so it would be simply impossible to create an independant model, but that happened. When Aegis Insurance was investigating to attempt to prove neglect, NIST's findings (ie WTC7's collapse) were all corroborated under oath by several preeminent experts (e.g., Guy Nordenson, Joseph P. Colaco, and Jose Torero) who independently created and analyzed their own collapse model at Edinburgh University.
      </p>
      <p>
       The extrinsic data is there. To say the least, a model that produces a fire induced collapse, and one that shows a thermite controlled demolition would be drastically different. Nothing of the sort has been shown. I'm almost certain that A&amp;E49/11Truth have tried, but do you really think they'd come out and say, "Hey, we built our model, and it further confirms what we called a fraud." Not a chance.

        NIST maintains that WTC 7 collapsed due to fire acting upon the 13th floor &amp; A2001 girder. But — NIST omitted flange-to-web stiffeners on the south end of the girder A2001. These omitted stiffeners would prevent the girder flange from folding when the girder web moved beyond the seat.

        They also said shear studs were not used on WTC 7 girders — and claim the 13th floor A2001 girder was pushed off its seat at column 79 by 'thermally expanded' beams. If shear studs had been used on the girders, it would have been impossible for the beams to push the girder off its seat.

       doesn't like when you answer him. NIST never even gave an explanation for the global collapse of either of the Twin Towers. In fact, they stated that they were "unable to." So he is wrong in stating that they "disagree" is not an acceptable refutation. It is a completely acceptable response to an unproven theory.

       How would you explain the model made at Edinbourgh University? Scientists on retainer from Aegis Insurance who were investigating the collapse to attempt to prove neglect. Whilest under oath they confirmed the same as the NIST report, fire induced progressive collapse that began at column 79.

       Yes. They rigged a building that sat separate from the two they were going to hit with planes for implosion. On the off chance that some debris hit WTC7 from the other two. Then let the fires burn for seven hours (let's hope it doesn't ignite that uber secret nano-thermite there lads!) before bringing down a building in the most impressive manner ever seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the reason WTC7 had to come down? Documents. Ha. AHAHAHAH. Apparently its easier to smuggle and fit thousands of kilos of thermite into an office building, than to remove super secret original documents from one.

       Your Truther movement is dying. And its because of fuckwits like you. Narrating the same dipshit talking points over and over, not believing that
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of the "offical story" could be possible. Hence this controlled demolition nonsense. You live in a bubble. One day you'll do the same as I did and self examine your idealoligy, and realise that any idea of the buildings being imploded holds no water. None.

       Great post. Before anyone tries to "debunk" this claiming some crap like a hydrogen reaction kept the heat up, take a look at this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the WPI metallurgical study of WTC steel done for the FEMA investigation, which indeed found steel had melted by eutectic reactions, which caused "intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese."

       I've seen this evidence before and the science is pretty weak.
The evidence they use comes from a paper they reference, but misconstrued:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Rapid deterioration of the steel was a result of heating with oxidation in combination with intergranular melting due to the presence of sulfur. The formation of the eutectic mixture of iron oxide and iron sulfide lowers the temperature at which liquid can form in this steel. This strongly suggests that the temperatures in this region of the steel beam approached ~1,000ºC, forming the eutectic liquid by a process similar to making a “blacksmith’s weld” in a hand forge.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was from the rubble of WTC 7 that had uncontrolled fires, the scientists concluded that the "section" of the beam sustained temperatures [that are well within building fire temps.]
Also one article is about the twin towers and the metallurgy was from WTC 7, not to mention the page inserts it's own statements alongside quoted results form the paper, which is extremely disingenuous.

       Weak science? Actual data compared to mere conjecture? The beams were turned into swiss cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot more than that one paper too as far as evidence for thermitic material being used:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/how-to-debunk-wtc-thermite/5360964">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of the evidence in the above well sourced link points to very hot temperatures long before the buildings collapsed, and clearly points to a source of the heating as something other than hydrogen/steam heating
       <strong>
        as it is clear that ridiculously hot temperatures were in effect long before the time it would take for the building to heat up from the steam/hydrogen reaction.

       Wanna take a guess at what type of thermal reaction can MAKE ITS OWN OXYGEN ? THERMITE.   Thermite makes its own oxygen and therefore burns extremely hot. Hot enough to turn steel into liquid.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when thermite is burning , it's shoots off sparks ... The smoke from it also is white , and very thick. And guess what Ya saw when the WTC was burning ? Thick white smoke and showers of sparks shooting out of the windows.

       Assuming there were no explosives and this was not a demolition, how much from the forces in the collapse should turn into heat? I'm sure plenty, because stuff tends to get hot when breaking, bending, rubbing, etc, under massive load. Is there even a remote possibility the temperatures would have risen enough to melt some metals?

       Getting so fed up with reading all this. It's the same claims and retorts every time. What it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       do is steer the conversation away from aspects that actually matter - possible motives, targeted organisations, money, which nations/individuals were involved and responsible etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the buildings fell is irrelevant to the big picture, but it's where conversation is deliberately steered to cause a circular argument with no possible conclusion. You're wasting your trying to prove this and playing into the hands of those who want to disprove you.

       The prevailing hypothesis here is that nano-thermite was used,
       <strong>
        but
       </strong>
       high temperatures were observed for some considerable time afterwards (days / weeks?).
      </p>
      <p>
       As nano-thermite reactions would have started quickly and ended quickly, given their only purpose would have had to be to cut through girders and weaken the building's structure, what is the proposed expanation for this, within that particular hypothesis?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how many tons of nano-thermite would be required to take down WTC 1, WTC 2 and WTC 7?

       I fully believe that 9/11 was not 100% a terrorist plot; I believe that the government did in fact have something to do with the attacks of that day.

       However, with respect to thermite, is it possible that the aluminum from the plane and the steel from the supports mixed together in slightly oxidized quantities to make thermite?

       The argument is that the thermite observed in the dust from the buildings is nano-thermite. Production of nano-thermite is complicated to say the least. The mixture of components on a nanoscale could not happen "by accident".

       No.  I've tried it for my own edification with aluminum can and rust.  Does not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's more likely that the additional fire proofing foam that was reapplied to the beams in the months leading up to 9/11 was actually a military grade thermite compound.

       I'm not saying I disagree with you, in fact quite the opposite. I wanted to see if the deniers could use that as an argument, that the traces of thermite are from the aluminum and steel from the plane and building respectively.

       May be a dumbass thing to say. What about the pressure of the building falling on twisting all that metal. Would that cause it to heat up and melt like it did?,

       Not really. It would take a large amount of time to buildup the amount of heat that was observed at the towers
       <strong>
        BEFORE THEY COLLAPSED
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the key.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some defenders of the official government story claim that a hydrogen/steam reaction could have kept the heat up and that somehow explains away the massive amount of heat at the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which would be a decent theory, except
       <strong>
        first responders had carbon nanotubes in their lungs, a sign of thermitic reactions
       </strong>
       .

       So, even if this were theoretically possible, much higher temperatures were observed
       <strong>
        before the building collapse
       </strong>
       which clearly proves the theory false. And coincidentally, proves that the official story is false as nothing else can explain the ridiculously hot temperatures observed
       <strong>
        before
       </strong>
       the collapse.

       I think that we've had this conversation. It's not necessary to invoke thermite or "nano thermite" to explain molten pools in the pile, as the ingredients for fire were present (fuels, air, ignition source, venting) and the physical environment for "naturally-occurring" furnace structures to melt metals was created by the chaotic mixing of fine ground metals, fuels and insulation in the larger macrostructure of the debris pile. Descriptions above are consistent with this process: "they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing...", "The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust... and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles" (from ground up hardware/accesory castings).

       Once the building starts collapsing the momentum build up, potential energy from the hight of the structure, wind vortices acting like a blacksmith's bellows createing a super heated air, and the fact that there are built in stress points so that if the structure ever needed to be demolished in would collapse downward instead of sideways all spelled disaster for those towers.

       Not wild clams. Actual source, independent verification by a structural engineer and a physics professor interviewed by a local Public Radio station WAMC.
I really don't have a horse in this race, not trying to argue but there are a world of facts the government is not releasing relevant to the 9/11 attacks. Some with good reason (national security), some without (epic intelligence failures). To a large extent if they weren't so secretive there would be less conspiracy theories out there. (Source: My father, 9/11 first responder World Trade Center location) There are things he saw that are not public knowledge that really made me mad they didn't get widely reported on.

       So uh, my question is, if the terrorists got guns onto the planes, why couldnt they have gotten, say, thermite? That would be easier to get onto the plane, and would do a tremendous amount of damage to the structure, therefore killing more. Why couldn't the terrorists planted something to melt the beams inside the building? It just doesn't make sense that we suspect our own government.

       I've seen this evidence before and the science is pretty weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence they use comes from a paper they reference, but misconstrued:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Rapid deterioration of the steel was a result of heating with oxidation in combination with intergranular melting due to the presence of sulfur. The formation of the eutectic mixture of iron oxide and iron sulfide lowers the temperature at which liquid can form in this steel. This strongly suggests that the temperatures in this region of the steel beam approached ~1,000ºC, forming the eutectic liquid by a process similar to making a “blacksmith’s weld” in a hand forge.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was from the rubble of WTC 7 that had uncontrolled fires, the scientists concluded that the "section" of the beam sustained temperatures [that are well within building fire temps.]
      </p>
      <p>
       Also one article is about the twin towers and the metallurgy was from WTC 7, not to mention the page inserts it's own
       <strong>
        statements alongside quoted results form the paper
       </strong>
       , which is extremely disingenuous.
      </p>

       You say the science is weak...yet those are not the only tests done on the rubble that demonstrate extremely high temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       You argue it's misconstrued because it was WTC7? Or because the authors insert their own statements?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the answer, the problem is still the same. The reactions needed to turn steel into swiss cheese were not likely caused from hydrogen/steam heating.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to look at it from an unbiased perspective, look at all the other evidence for extremely hot temps/thermitic material SOON AFTER THE PLANE IMPACTS, which means NO TIME FOR HEAT BUILDUP which puts the hydrogen/steam theory to rest.

       This one is particularly damning. You aren't going to have carbon nanotubes be found in first responders lungs from hydrogen/steam heating...I mean think critically for a moment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Carbon nanotubes have been found in the WTC dust and in the lungs of 9/11 first responders. Formation of carbon nanotubes requires extremely high temperatures, specific metal catalysts, and carbon compounds exactly like those found in nanothermite formulations. Researchers have discovered that nanothermite produces the same kinds of carbon nanotubes. That finding has been confirmed by independent analysis in a commercial contract laboratory.

       Well they may have the capability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know how a gamma / cyber knife works?  It's an array of emitters used in radiation therapy to blast primarily brain tumors, such that each small, low energy beam does not overly damage tissue upon entry.  The beams converge, their energies are summarized, and this destroy the tumor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a lot of satellites out there that can emit EM on a variety of wavelengths.
       <em>
        Perhaps like a microwave, the harmonic resonance frequency of the type of steel could be selected and emitted by an array of satellites, coordinated and focused on a single target, heating it up to the melting point of steel.  This could explain multiple points of failure where the single point of failure is clearly false.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know that wavelength, but man if we find out it's in the range of mobile or radio frequencies, uh oh--hypothesis thus proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So like the cyber knife, just for an example,  one could coordinate a satellite array (for example, the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation">
        IRIDIUM 66 Satellite constellation
       </a>
       ) to focus on a single target and affect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course IRIDIUM is only for mobile communications, to our knowledge there are no other 'capabilites' that we are allowed to know about.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The melted cars were always an interesting thing.  This convergence hypothesis would also explain the melted cars on the street as EM leakage if there were a lack of a heat wave.  Or from the heat given off by the steel, although more evidence of a heat wave on the ground would surely have been observed and it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, for God's sake.

      <p>
       The U.S. Defense Strategic Defense Initiative put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam to be used as a weapon in outer space.[13] Neutral beam accelerator technology was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As part of the Beam Experiments Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project, a prototype hydrogen beam weapon was launched from White Sands Missile Range in July 1989 and successfully deployed into low Earth orbit. It was operated successfully in space and after reentry was recovered intact. In 2006 the weapon prototype was transferred from Los Alamos to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.[14][15]

       Also, let's say one had a particle beam of some sort, how do you intend it to work in an atmosphere?

       In particular, stable self-pinched propagation of high-current charged-particle beams in the atmosphere is possible over distances equal to several Nordsieck lengths.

       Off the top of my head, you could harmonize the resonance of the particle beam with the resonance of the atmosphere, and start with a fine and lower-power beam like drilling a pilot hole, then power it up.  But that's just a guess, I really know nothing.

       It was a proposal and nothing has come of it.  But there are arrays of satellites that have the capability of multispectral imaging and topographical and geoprospecting technologies akin to sonar (bouncing signals from one satellite to another and reading doppler like changes to detect stuff).  Now if we are emitting EM, even at low power, imagine if you focused all of them on one target at the same time.

       If it's blown with forced air or wind. Otherwise it does well to  just cook hamburgers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you  point to any sustained  wind to force enough heat  within the burning  ( actually very quickly depleted)    kerosene  to weaken the steel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is countering evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the north tower for instance,  a  now well known lady with very long hair  was standing in the north towers most probable air inlet where the air should be rushing in past  her to feed the supposed but in no way verifiable inferno in the elevator shaft of that building  but her hair is not  being blown. by any such flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       No such air flow is indicated in video from the lobby either.  The black smoke indicated an oxygen starved fire.  The smoke moved lazily.
      </p>
      <p>
       The frame was cool enough for her to touch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The air was cool enough  for Orio Palmer, in the south tower's 78th floor  to breathe and the only proof of any such steel weakening heat is the word of employees of known liars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is  no wind,  not feeding an alleged inferno and not even  skin  burning heat in the buildings  frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any 'evidence' of steel weakening heat is just unsupported  theory that hopes to  support a wholly flawed government story.

       Jet fuel is confirmed to have entered many elevator and vertical air shafts. The result is basically a forge. Also, a lot of melted material is known to be aluminum. A lot of the destroyed steel is known to be a reaction from high heat, steam, hydrogen fires, and other chemical reactions which can rapidly erode steel in that environment.

       Sources on the 'confirmation' that jet fuel was accounted for before the collapse? I'm pretty sure most of the fuel blew up in the initial explosions. Also curious as to how 'a lot' of it was known to be aluminum smoldering for weeks.

       Nope. Factually incorrect. Roughly 1/3 or less was destroyed in initial impact/fires. We have endless testimony of elevators on fire and fires spreading into floors/lobbies via jet fuel. Factually we know the shafts were saturated with jet fuel and that it was on fire. The shafts became fuel repositories. This is confirmed/ well established physics, that massive heating will result. It's basically a jet fuel forge. The fires at top pull in and accelerate cool air from the bottom; carrying fuel vapor with it. Wind blowing at the top also assists, creating a low pressure at the top - like a chimney. Basically a poor turbocharger.  Same concept, though less effective, was used to burn alive the people in Waco.

       That doesn't seem to line up with the scale of jet fuel vs the size of WTC buildings.

       Wouldn't the jet fuel have been absorbed by the drywall in the elevator shafts? A scale pic shows the amount of jet fuel to be miniscule compared to the size of the towers.

       A bellow-type scenario isnt possible in this case, the problem with it is that it didnt have sufficient fuel for the bellow system to work. jet fuel doesnt react to wind (ie enhanced) as positively. it needs solid fuel in order to get that effect (timber, coal, etc) and there wasnt enough of that in the office spaces either.

       When the planes hit it knocked off the fire repellent on the beams the combined gas and office fires cause the steals to bend and break and eventually collapse the building. The magma flowed for weeeks and the fires burned for months I believe. open and shut case. People who don't think airplanes can bring down buildings are obviously not believing their eyes

       I don't have an "anti-conspiracy" opinion. I find many of them interesting, and the thought processes that go into believing such even more so. Some thoughts I might show disdain or even get pissed off at, but that's not because of the subreddit they post in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I separate what I post in
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       and here. But dissenting opinions simply aren't welcome here. I would say that what I post most definitely furthers discussion, yet routinely and without fail my posts are buried. Simply for not agreeing.

       Modern experiments
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. Defense Strategic Defense Initiative put into development the technology of a neutral particle beam to be used as a weapon in outer space.[13] Neutral beam accelerator technology was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. As part of the Beam Experiments Aboard Rocket (BEAR) project, a prototype hydrogen beam weapon was launched from White Sands Missile Range in July 1989 and successfully deployed into low Earth orbit. It was operated successfully in space and after reentry was recovered intact. In 2006 the weapon prototype was transferred from Los Alamos to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.[14][15]

       So the military has a program that is a resounding success and then stops all work on said program? Not likely.

       Well they may have the capability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know how a gamma / cyber knife works?  It's an array of emitters used in radiation therapy to blast primarily brain tumors, such that each small, low energy beam does not overly damage tissue upon entry.  The beams converge, their energies are summarized, and this destroy the tumor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have a lot of satellites out there that can emit EM on a variety of wavelengths.
       <em>
        Perhaps like a microwave, the harmonic resonance frequency of the type of steel could be selected and emitted by an array of satellites, coordinated and focused on a single target, heating it up to the melting point of steel.  This could explain multiple points of failure where the single point of failure is clearly false.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know that wavelength, but man if we find out it's in the range of mobile or radio frequencies, uh oh--hypothesis thus proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So like the cyber knife, just for an example,  one could coordinate a satellite array (for example, the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation">
        IRIDIUM 66 Satellite constellation
       </a>
       ) to focus on a single target and affect it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course IRIDIUM is only for mobile communications, to our knowledge there are no other 'capabilites' that we are allowed to know about.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The melted cars were always an interesting thing.  This convergence hypothesis would also explain the melted cars on the street as EM leakage if there were a lack of a heat wave.  Or from the heat given off by the steel, although more evidence of a heat wave on the ground would surely have been observed and it wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, for God's sake.
