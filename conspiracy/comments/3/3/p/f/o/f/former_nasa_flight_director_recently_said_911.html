       Retired NASA Senior Executive Dwain Deets published his concerns on the matter at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) as follows...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       <strong>
        A Responsibility to Explain an Aeronautical Improbability - Dwain Deets AIAA Associate Fellow
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (Senior Executive Service - retired)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The airplane was UA175, a Boeing 767-200, shortly before crashing into World Trade Center Tower 2. Based on analysis of radar data, the National Transportation and Safety Board reported the groundspeed just before impact as 510 knots. This is well beyond the maximum operating velocity of 360 knots, and maximum dive velocity of 410 knots. The possibilities as I see them are:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         (1)
        </strong>
        this wasn’t a standard 767-200;
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         (2)
        </strong>
        the radar data was compromised in some manner;
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         (3)
        </strong>
        the NTSB analysis was erroneous; or
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         (4)
        </strong>
        the 767 flew well beyond its flight envelope, was controllable, and managed to hit a relatively small target.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Which organization has the greater responsibility for acknowledging the elephant in the room? The NTSB, NASA, Boeing, or the AIAA? Have engineers authored papers, but the AIAA or NASA won’t publish them? Or, does the ethical responsibility lie not with organizations, but with individual aeronautical engineers? Have engineers just looked the other way?
      </p>

      <p>
       It is established based on corroborated expert statements, raw data, and precedent, that the extremely excessive speed reported for the 9/11 aircraft is truly the "Elephant In The Room" and needs to be thoroughly investigated

       There is pyops running where companies are upvoting bullshit, speculation and downvoting facts. There were very damaging NSA documents released on sub early and they were completely buried and stories about jade helm being response to Asteroids (what the hell?) were upvoted to top.

       Student pilot here. From the 767-200's specs:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mach 0.86 (493 knots, 567 mph, 913 km/h at 35,000 ft (11,000 m) cruise altitude)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The article in question says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        groundspeed just before impact as 510 knots. This is well beyond the maximum operating velocity of 360 knots, and maximum dive velocity of 410 knots.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The most important consideration would actually be the V/DNE speed, or never exceed speed of a 767-200, which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ""velocity to never exceed" (Vne) is stated informally by several sources to be: 514 kts."
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there's going to be some wiggle room engineered into there, to avoid structural damage right at VNE / DNE.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At speed in excess of Vmo/Mmo ... normal airplane handling characteristics are not assured." What they are saying is that an airplane can be taken somewhat beyond Vmo/Mmo by a skilled pilot. We would expect a safety factor of at least 10%, probably more like 20% or 30%, before structural damage may result.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But what about fast speeds in high density altitude (low to the ground?)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, it looks like the argument hinges on this, but it looks like....
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The B767-200 however has a Vmo below 10,000 ft of just 250 knots
        <strong>
         because the windshield isn't certified to withstand birdstrike above 313 knots
        </strong>
        . Above 10000 ft the 767 Vmo is limited to 350 kts... The Vmo limit [of 250 kts] is a windscreen issue only"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now we're talking here about manuvering speeds, which obviously leaves us at the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       We'd need to see a radar track to see how much the supposed pilot was turning the aircraft to see if we're concerned about positing the aircraft breaking up due to that speed at that altitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       All things concerned, it certainly seems possible, and probably plausible that a 767-200 stands a good chance to not break up just due to the speed at that altitude.

       Thanks. I think there are a lot of points where you can attack the media reports on 9/11, but I don't think saying a 767-200 couldn't have performed the necessary maneuvers is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably stressful for the aircraft, but more than likely, very very within it's performance parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
       People forget that commercial jetliner technology is all the washout from a very flush military R&amp;D budget going back to the 1940's to now. That tech goes from our black aircraft, to our production aircraft, then to our commercial aircraft.

       Nice response! One follow up: what about the reported skill levels of the hijacker pilots? Your post cites "skilled pilots" but from what I gather the men at the controls that day we're anything but.

       Yes! IT's pretty clear that the hijackers wouldn't have nearly what you would consider to be a high level of skill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would really doubt that a 767-200 would break up at that speed at that altitude, however, as long as:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         the aircraft was in a clean configuration (no flaps, no gear down) . This is likely, because a clean configuration would have been what the plane was in when it was in cruise.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the aircraft didn't attempt any very sharp turns. This is why I would be interested in the radar track. I think if the radar track showed no sharp turns, it's very reasonable to believe that the plane would have almost no chance of mid-air breakup at 510 knts under 10k feet altitude.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       However, if the radar track showed a very tight turn, i would be skeptical that it was a 767 200.

       No offense, but I'll believe the judgement of a highly educated, trained and experienced NASA aviator over a student pilot. I appreciate your analysis, but in the end your and his opinions are merely speculative. Like I said, his carries much more weight. Sorry.

       I'm putting my argument in the specs dude . of the vmo under 10k feet is merely due to bird strike safety , its pretty easy to conclude speeds under vne are not dangerous , or at least possible .

       What? It has percentages still. When you made your post it had 0 downvotes
      </p>

       Edit: didn't see your shill accusation there. Funny, I would argue it is bullshit accusations like that that would distract from discussion far more than any of my comments.

       Any dissenting opinion means you're a shill. I enjoy this subreddit for the alternate opinions, but a lot of times if I express my viewpoint (often against the majority here) I just get DV'd and called a shill. It's the easiest method of dismissal.

       Yes, I took a screenshot and waited for someone to mention downvotes.  Because I obviously screenshot every post and wait for someone to say something about downvotes, just so I can pop out of the woodwork and be all "aha!"
      </p>
      <p>
       OR -- real scenario here -- I took the screenshot after the other dude posted about it having downvotes. Which it didn't actually have any of.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hey, I even have proof:
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at how long ago the post was created.  Look at how long ago someone was all "downvotes, sad sad!"  Now look at the timestamp in the screenshot I took, and look at how long ago my post was made.  Apply logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, judging from your notion that I sit on screenshots of every post, I'm not sure how well the "apply logic" step will go.

       Ignoring "Proposal" in the title helps.  The actual law was passed in the 80's, and was amended during the early 2000's.  The last change was made in 2008 (yes, that's before Obama took office).

       I am often critical, on r/worldnews, of the Israelis' treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. My comments are logical and well written. They are NOT racist or anti-semitic. I have to wait 10 minutes after every comment before I am allowed to post another. The mods tell me it is because of my low score on the sub. So my reasonable comments get downvoted by Israeli zealots or paid shills and I am basically blacklisted on the sub.

      <p>
       There is another possibility!  That people are confusing the "maximum operating velocity" with the "maximum capability is the aircraft".  Typically you wouldn't take the craft above 350 knots, not because the aircraft is incapable of doing so, but because when you take it up to those speeds you introduce stresses on the plane that make flying the planes at those speeds over the long run untenable.  It's not like once the aircraft reaches 361 knots the aircraft will just rip itself apart or something.  The aircraft is well within it's capabilities of flying that fast, especially for a short trip down the Hudson river into Manhattan.  I don't see any Elephant in the room, just a lot of misunderstanding about how aircraft work.

       Generally speaking, it isn't a logical fallacy when the appeal to authority relies on someone that may be considered an expert in the field.  I'm not saying the guy is right or wrong, but asserting that Mr.Deets has a "misunderstanding about how aircraft work" can't be taken seriously given Mr.Deets' qualifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, Mr.Deets even suggests the possibility that "the 767 flew well beyond its flight envelope, was controllable, and managed to hit a relatively small target."  Based on the OP, Mr.Deets seems to be suggesting that the likelihood of the aircraft being controllable by a couple of inexperienced pilots is fairly low.  What part of his analysis, specifically, would cause someone to question his authority as an expert?

       The claims aren't based strictly on ones credentials.  The conclusion is based on a combination of, at least, the known flight characteristics of the aircraft and the expert level understanding of aeronautics of Mr.Deets.

       The flight training of the pilots is known and although some of them may have had a commercial certification there is no evidence to support that they were experienced with flying 767s outside of their normal operating range.  Lack of experience is, by definition, inexperience.

       You appear to be inferring things from my posts that simply aren't present.  Mr.Deets' conclusion was that, based on the evidence, there are a lot of oddities about the flight characteristics and there should be more investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       That seems like a pretty fair statement from someone considered to be an expert in this situation.  A person would have to be intentionally ignorant of this individuals qualifications to assert that he has a "misunderstanding about how aircraft work."

      <p>
       There are no oddities. A 767 flying at those speeds is perfectly reasonable and possible. What Mr. Deets needs to do, and
       <strong>
        should've done if he wants to be taken seriously by his engineering peers
       </strong>
       , is come up with a Finite Element Analysis using Catia, SolidWorks or program of his choice, showing that given the parameters of the flight data, would cause enough stress and strain on the airframe to where it would cause great structural compromise. However, the plane did indeed fly into the building, so we can conclude that the planes structural integrity didn't compromise, thus was capable of flying at those speeds.

       I honestly have no idea what you are even arguing about.  There is
       <strong>
        zero
       </strong>
       appeal to authority regarding the flight characteristics since there is no formal conclusion.  Nobody is proposing that a specific thing happened.  My sole statement, which landed us in this rabbit hole, is that given the qualifications of Mr. Deets it would be unreasonable to characterize him as having a "misunderstanding about how aircraft work."
      </p>
      <p>
       How can you characterize his statements as a misunderstanding when one of the possibilities he suggests is that "the 767 flew well beyond its flight envelope, was controllable, and managed to hit a relatively small target."  Which is simply a statement that he thinks what happened was odd, but maybe there isn't some grand conspiracy and what happened is just what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you disagreeing that maybe nothing weird happened?  What is it, exactly, that you want me to believe?  Hiding behind the shield of an appeal to authority is simply nonsense in this specific instance.  The claim I'm making that Mr.Deets has a thorough understanding of how aircraft work is fully supported by his resume; the facts support my claim.

       He, logically, wants a real investigation to actually find out what happened. Stating that what you are told is not true because it is not possible doesn't automatically lead someone to speculation if you are a logical thinker. There can be no conclusions drawn if there are no facts to base them on. We need further investigation so that more facts can be obtained. Only then can definitive answers be ascertained.

       Jets don't have a Vne. They have a Vmo, which has nothing to do with structural capabilities of the aircraft. Any and all references to Vmo in any post here is an immediate clue the poster in an idiot. In this case, the poster absolutely knows this and is purposely misleading people here. His posts have consistently been proven in direct conflict with reality. He knows this too.
      </p>
      <p>
       For most large jets, Vmo is the jet's rated ability to withstand a bird strike. Nothing more, nothing less. Exceeding Vmo simply means a bird strike is likely to penetrate the windshield. It says absolutely nothing about the structural integrity of the aircraft in this context. Nothing. Period.

       Wow never knew that. I work on turbines that are due for overhaul, maintenance, bird strikes etc and I've never heard that term. The Wikipedia article I read on V terms(and apparently there's a lot) simply says maximum operating speed. Crazy to think you can go so fast that a bird can break the fucking windshield. That's some tough shit.

       I don't believe that there are, though there are audible warnings and annunciators that light up.  I don't believe that they would put some "breaking mechanism" in like that because there are legitimate reasons why a pilot might need to exceed the maximums.  Even if they had something like that installed, it could likely be overridden by pulling a breaker or two.

       I can think of many instances where a plane's hydraulics were compromised and that left the pilots controlling the plane only with differential thrust using the engines, in a case like that the pilot would want to be able to use the full thrust of the engine.  It is an extremely difficult way to control the plane, and it usually doesn't end well.  JAL 123 is a fairly famous example,

       You are welcome.  I wish the truth about 9/11 would come out, but unfortunately the whole field of research on the subject has long since been saturated by people who will accept anything and everything as "evidence" of a conspiracy.  I miss the days when people accepted the possibility that people
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       hijack those planes and
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       fly them in to buildings
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       that was part of a larger conspiracy.  It's so simple, why make it more complicated.

       I've seen the evidence proposed and for me it just wasn't convincing enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my humble opinion, the mechanism for collapse was reasonable (falling debris starting a fire, the emergency water pipes being messed up by the collapse 370ft away and a subsequent uncontrolled 7hr fire), and I was not able to find compelling evidence that truly undermined it for me.

       airplanes are designed to be 1.5 times stronger than required, so in theory you would have to reach just 50% more force on the plane than at 410 knots, which doesn't necessarily mean 50% faster. you haven't proven anything and taking and airplane 100 knot above it's maximum operating velocity is very risky indeed, because no aircraft retains 100% of its strength from the time of manufacturing and after years of use due to fatigue, wear, contamination and other things of that nature.

       what I'm saying is the plane likely didn't have 100% of it load capacity. and what is the overall increase in the resultant force of an airplane going 100 knots over its max velocity, is it 50%? if its greater than 50% plane would be expected to fail. if its equal to 50% your running a damn high risk of the plane catastrophically failing.  and the faster you go the air resistance on the plane exponentially increases so 100knots over the max velocity is a high demand for sure, although to know for sure you would have to calculate it.

       Fuck  are you still going on about that? What I was actually referring to was 911. Nobody but Americans buy the cover story. Similar to how no one in the world believed the naked retard in the net story as the cause of the Reichstag fire in Germany. Try to keep up, Nancy.

       There we go. The cowards way out. It is a verifiable fact that the USA is the only nation still hoping the 911 commission is correct. Bury your head in the sand all you want, ain't gonna make it true.

       I am a "student" of studying plane crashes, I could probably elaborate on the subject far better than most everyone, that's what I can offer to the discussion in terms of my knowledge.  I'm glad that you, as an engineering student, can offer other perspectives on the subject.  So are you an aircraft engineering student?

       They are using MS flight sim to determine the structural integrity of the craft? I've been playing ms flight sim since the mid 80s, I've logged over 20000 hours in the sim and i can say with some certainty MS flight sim is an excellent flight simulator and a terrible crash simulator. It simply doesn't have any robust simulation running determining how to simulate a crash, especially in its ability to determine when a plane is overstressed. It's basically no more complex than 'are you exceeding a certain speed? Okay you are overstressing the plane, simulation over. There isn't any nuance (for example it doesn't simulate overstressing specific control surfaces, which is the weak point in an aircraft when it comes to overstressing. You wouldn't be able to simulate aa 587 in ms flight sim).

       overall the video is fairly vague in ita methodology so when I gets to the point at 2:56 and puts up a full screen slide asking "is it possible to duplicate the 9/11 attacks with MS Flight Simulator X using data from the government?" I hope you'll forgive me in thinking they were using MS fsx to carry out the simulation.
 I'm on mobile and I can't hear the audio very well, but from what I'm seeing it looks just like ma fsx. When they change the settings in the sim it is very obviously the menus I know so well from fsx.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, I think its a pretty meaningless test, msfs is a flight simulator, not a crash simulator. These tests are meaningless.

       (PilotsFor911Truth.org) - Much controversy has surrounded the speeds reported for the World Trade Center attack aircraft. However, none of the arguments for either side of the debate have been properly based on actual data, until now. Pilots For 9/11 Truth have recently analyzed data provided by the National Transportation Safety Board in terms of a "Radar Data Impact Speed Study" in which the NTSB concludes 510 knots and 430 knots for United 175 (South Tower) and American 11 (North Tower), respectively. A benchmark has been set by the October 1999 crash of Egypt Air 990, a 767 which exceeded it's maximum operating limits causing in-flight structural failure, of which data is available to compare to the WTC Attack Aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Egypt Air 990 (EA990) is a 767 which was reported to have entered a dive and accelerated to a peak speed of .99 Mach at 22,000 feet. Boeing sets maximum operating speeds for the 767 as 360 Knots and .86 Mach. The reason for two airspeed limitations is due to air density at lower vs. higher altitudes. To understand equivalent dynamic pressures on an airframe of low vs. high altitude, there is an airspeed appropriately titled "Equivalent Airspeed" or EAS[1]. EAS is defined as the airspeed at sea level which produces the same dynamic pressure acting on the airframe as the true airspeed at high altitudes.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilots For 9/11 Truth have calculated the Equivalent Airspeed for EA990 peak speed of .99 Mach at 22,000 feet as the equivalent dynamic effects of 425 knots at or near sea level. This airspeed is 65 knots over max operating for a 767, 85 knots less than the alleged United 175, and 5 knots less than the alleged American 11. Although it may be probable for the alleged American 11 to achieve such speed as 430 knots is only 5 knots over that of EA990 peak speed, It is impossible for the alleged United 175 to achieve the speeds reported by the NTSB using EA990 as a benchmark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilots For 9/11 Truth have further studied if a 767 could continue controlled flight at such reported speeds. According to the NTSB, EA990 wreckage was found in two distinct debris fields, indicating in-flight structural failure which has been determined to have occurred a few seconds after recording peak speed. Based on EA990, it is impossible for the alleged United 175 to have continued controlled flight at more than 85 knots over the speed which failed the structure of EA990.
      </p>
      <p>
       EA990 basically disintegrated. Thoughts?

       It is certainly fucking infuriating, but at the same time it's not completely their fault.   The power of propaganda my friend. Causes people to support the very chains that keep them shackled.
Some will reject because they've been drinking the juice for far too long, but others will awaken from their slumber.

       Neither could I. I studied things like this in physics class, it's pretty cool. It's not that a plane CANT exceed it's VMO, it's that it cant sustain an exceeded VMO. Depending on the aircraft, it's flight history and quality of maintenance, it could last seconds or it could last minutes. There's no real way to tell.

       Just for clarification, the maximum cruise speed of a 767 is 490-ish knots, but that's for at altitude.

       (PilotsFor911Truth.org) - Much controversy has surrounded the speeds reported for the World Trade Center attack aircraft. However, none of the arguments for either side of the debate have been properly based on actual data, until now. Pilots For 9/11 Truth have recently analyzed data provided by the National Transportation Safety Board in terms of a "Radar Data Impact Speed Study" in which the NTSB concludes 510 knots and 430 knots for United 175 (South Tower) and American 11 (North Tower), respectively. A benchmark has been set by the October 1999 crash of Egypt Air 990, a 767 which exceeded it's maximum operating limits causing in-flight structural failure, of which data is available to compare to the WTC Attack Aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Egypt Air 990 (EA990) is a 767 which was reported to have entered a dive and accelerated to a peak speed of .99 Mach at 22,000 feet. Boeing sets maximum operating speeds for the 767 as 360 Knots and .86 Mach. The reason for two airspeed limitations is due to air density at lower vs. higher altitudes. To understand equivalent dynamic pressures on an airframe of low vs. high altitude, there is an airspeed appropriately titled "Equivalent Airspeed" or EAS[1]. EAS is defined as the airspeed at sea level which produces the same dynamic pressure acting on the airframe as the true airspeed at high altitudes.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilots For 9/11 Truth have calculated the Equivalent Airspeed for EA990 peak speed of .99 Mach at 22,000 feet as the equivalent dynamic effects of 425 knots at or near sea level. This airspeed is 65 knots over max operating for a 767, 85 knots less than the alleged United 175, and 5 knots less than the alleged American 11. Although it may be probable for the alleged American 11 to achieve such speed as 430 knots is only 5 knots over that of EA990 peak speed, It is impossible for the alleged United 175 to achieve the speeds reported by the NTSB using EA990 as a benchmark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilots For 9/11 Truth have further studied if a 767 could continue controlled flight at such reported speeds. According to the NTSB, EA990 wreckage was found in two distinct debris fields, indicating in-flight structural failure which has been determined to have occurred a few seconds after recording peak speed. Based on EA990, it is impossible for the alleged United 175 to have continued controlled flight at more than 85 knots over the speed which failed the structure of EA990.

       You are right, and it can be very frustrating. However, let's channel our anger and frustration into a positive that can do some good. It doesn't do any good to berate people for their ignorance. They are ignorant - they literally don't know any better. Let's keep changing that.

       There is not one instance where a 767 exceeded those speeds and had an accident.

       Plus, the speeds people need to recognize are the VNE speeds. Most V speeds are overmarked for safety reasons and have a built in buffer.

       A model of anything. If that is what you're so certain you will find, then go for it. You claim the NIST report to be utter garbage, so use the extrinsic data that they used, build an alternate model and
       <strong>
        prove it

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If you claim NIST's findings do be inaccurate and fraudulent, your community should do the logical thing. Produce a better scientific model. Or.. At the very least a paper that is critical of NIST.

      <p>
       This is the problem that we'll face when we're communicating is that you will see A&amp;E49/11Truth making their huge claims over YouTube or whatever, and believe them when they say it was made by scientifically illiterate fools. But what I would need some actual scientific process to believe that what these people are saying holds weight.

       <em>

       Precisely that. When you say that the paper is not peer reviewed, is this coming from the A&amp;E49/11Truth guy submitting an appeal citing the FIOA? Now if there is another instance of this happening that was from the field of study, but wasn't issued under an act that would allow the information to be spread to the public I would like to see it. Or the whole "only six weeks for public comments" memic repetition?

       Complete nonsense. They didn't release their own model, which they weren't required to do. They did on the other hand release the data they used to create that model. You're the first truther I've came across that has denied that. I mean seriously, it might burst your bubble thinking that the information is there for anyone to create an alternate model. But its fucking there.

       Well this gets to the root of the debate. We know they exceeded the safe flight guidelines, but did they exceed it by enough speed that the structural integrity of the plane would have surely been compromised?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people who 'debunk' this point say that although the plane exceeded the guidelines it still is flyable until much higher speeds (at which point it breaks apart)
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question here really is by how much did they exceed those guidelines? And would we have been able to see this on a standard commercial airliner (through wing flex or vibration or something)

       Ultimately no one really knows at what point a plane well break up. They simply sunny test them to the point of catastrophic failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       However they have a fairly good idea of when certain major parts may fail and work from that.
      </p>
      <p>
       FAA regulations require safe flight be demonstrated at a certain degree
       <em>
        beyond
       </em>
       the specified flight envelope. I believe for the 767 that would have been 20-25% beyond maximum V speeds. So we can safely assume structural failure will
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       occur within that safety margin.

       they're certainly not tanks, and they certainly have a breaking point. i seriously doubt any engineer with his career on the line would be as confident as you are. although that said airplane are designed to be about 1.5 times stronger then they need to be, so even at the max velocity you still have quite a bit of room, just pray you don't shock load anything.

       I'm seeing many comments like this ITT. The plane had been in a power dive for several minutes and only levelled off at the very final stage. It can attain that speed by diving purely from its weight (but it's very dangerous because of the stress it puts on the airframe).

       Vd (maximum dive velocity) is the highest velocity specified for the airframe. So it's a good reference for the highest speed that the aircraft

       The V speeds are not a physical maximum. They are a limit for standard operation taking into account many things such as standard maintenance and operational efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flight envelope is also designed with a significant safety margin.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's highly unlikely that 509mph exceeded that physical safety margin.

       I agree with your answer here.  I doubt if anyone actually knows the speed that a plane actually would break apart at.  I assume that speed exists, but I'm not sure even in a full power dive the plane would be able to reach that speed.  Yes it may cause structural damage and shorten the life of the airframe, but could a 767 reach the speed needed for it to catastrophically fail under its own power even in a full dive?

       "In the five minutes from approximately 08:58 when Shehhi completed the final turn toward New York City until the moment of impact, the plane was in a sustained power dive, descending more than 24,000 feet in 5 minutes 4 seconds, for an average rate of over 5,000 feet per minute."

      <p>
       Just because it levelled out in the last 30 seconds or so, doesn't mean it just loses all its airspeed. It had been diving for several minutes at a little beyond its safety limits. If planes weren't so over engineered it likely would have had parts falling off.

       Does the airframe simply rip itself apart if you exceed the limits?  Or are the max limits set because they are more concerned with more long-term effects on the plane?

       In my experience the aircraft starts to shake quite badly as soon as you exceed the limits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously you dont go faster than that because you start to shit yourself, but yes eventually you get control flutter and the aircraft will break apart in the air.

       They would be concerned with long term effects if you only exceed by a small amount.

       This is what a lot of people believe, but it's simply not true.  If the line between flying perfectly safely and "ripping itself to pieces" was just 10 knots then there would be something seriously wrong with the plane.  There have been plenty of instances where, say, a plane has found itself in a dive, exceeded those maximums, and recovered from the dive and landed safely without ripping itself apart.  Even then "ripping itself apart" is a fairly meaningless term.  I suspect that the first thing to go would be something like a control surface, and even then someone probably has to be moving the control surface to rip it off.  But you don't even have to be going over the max speeds to make that happen (
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_587">
        AA 587
       </a>
       for example)
      </p>
      <p>
       Another good example is the wing test of the Boeing 777:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai2HmvAXcU0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai2HmvAXcU0
       </a>
       In this test we can see the wing holding up to 154% of the maximum forces expected to be exerted on the plane during flight.  Planes, in general, are well over-engineered beyond their maximums.  The maximum limits are set so low so that the plane has a long lifetime and can have literally ten's of thousands of cycles over it's life without any appreciable wear-and-tear on them.

       That is closer to the truth.  The maximums are set well below what the "plain" is capable of handling.  They don't want to introduce even any slight wear-and-tear on the planes as that would escalate maintenance costs.  The differences between the arbitrary maximums they set and what the plane is actually capable of is a fairly wide gulf.  This is why crashes because of "wear-and-tear" are so extremely rare.

       (PilotsFor911Truth.org) - Much controversy has surrounded the speeds reported for the World Trade Center attack aircraft. However, none of the arguments for either side of the debate have been properly based on actual data, until now. Pilots For 9/11 Truth have recently analyzed data provided by the National Transportation Safety Board in terms of a "Radar Data Impact Speed Study" in which the NTSB concludes 510 knots and 430 knots for United 175 (South Tower) and American 11 (North Tower), respectively. A benchmark has been set by the October 1999 crash of Egypt Air 990, a 767 which exceeded it's maximum operating limits causing in-flight structural failure, of which data is available to compare to the WTC Attack Aircraft.
      </p>
      <p>
       Egypt Air 990 (EA990) is a 767 which was reported to have entered a dive and accelerated to a peak speed of .99 Mach at 22,000 feet. Boeing sets maximum operating speeds for the 767 as 360 Knots and .86 Mach. The reason for two airspeed limitations is due to air density at lower vs. higher altitudes. To understand equivalent dynamic pressures on an airframe of low vs. high altitude, there is an airspeed appropriately titled "Equivalent Airspeed" or EAS[1]. EAS is defined as the airspeed at sea level which produces the same dynamic pressure acting on the airframe as the true airspeed at high altitudes.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilots For 9/11 Truth have calculated the Equivalent Airspeed for EA990 peak speed of .99 Mach at 22,000 feet as the equivalent dynamic effects of 425 knots at or near sea level. This airspeed is 65 knots over max operating for a 767, 85 knots less than the alleged United 175, and 5 knots less than the alleged American 11. Although it may be probable for the alleged American 11 to achieve such speed as 430 knots is only 5 knots over that of EA990 peak speed, It is impossible for the alleged United 175 to achieve the speeds reported by the NTSB using EA990 as a benchmark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilots For 9/11 Truth have further studied if a 767 could continue controlled flight at such reported speeds. According to the NTSB, EA990 wreckage was found in two distinct debris fields, indicating in-flight structural failure which has been determined to have occurred a few seconds after recording peak speed. Based on EA990, it is impossible for the alleged United 175 to have continued controlled flight at more than 85 knots over the speed which failed the structure of EA990.

       There has literally been no vote manipulation on this post.  Which has literally been independently proven by 3 different users, including myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that vote manipulation doesn't exist in this topic can be further proven from the fact that, at the time of this writing, haltingstate's comment suggesting that vote manipulation was taking place currently has 167 points. If such blatant vote manipulation was taking place, I'm pretty sure that those of us who have debunked it would have much higher vote counts, and those claiming it would have much lower vote counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "vote manipulation" I see here are people voting for what they believe is the truth, and completely ignoring what the facts actually are.

       What are the facts then?  That someone can glance up to the top right corner of their Reddit page and see a percentage?   Well hot damn I guess I'm just "ignoring the facts" (overused cliche Bill O'reilly term).   If it were this easy to detect vote brigading then the purpose of vote brigading would be useless and dead (which we know it is not).  I'm just wondering how you are able to detect I.p. Switching programs and large groups of people with the same intent who communicate agendas in the shadows.

       I'm largely into gaming and recently in
       <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">
        /r/leagueoflegends
       </a>
       (most popular game in the world) unearthed a conspiracy between a group of content creators to up vote their own content while down voting anyone else's in order to ensure their content routinely made the front page on that sub.  There was no way to detect it as they were communicating via Skype and chat rooms before their brigades.   My point:  if a bunch of kids and young adults can figure out how to game the system for their benefit than so can adults, especially ones with monetary aid.  It's not we are ignoring the truth, we can just see a larger picture than you.  The only fact I'm missing here is that I shouldn't waste my time with ignorant know-it-alls.  Oops too late...

       You're ignoring the fact that this post was literally 100% approved when someone started crying about downvote brigades. Which, again, is documented. No downvotes at all existed at that time. All facts.

       But at least you're admitting that you're ignoring the facts. So you have that going for you.

       Where in any of my posts on this thread accused this specific thread of vote manipulation or down voting?  I can't and won't argue that this post was down voted beyond a 10th percentile.  I can argue that vote manipulation of comments is very easily disguised and if one wants, can easily bypass the current systems Reddit has to promote any message one wants without merit.  But go ahead and use something else someone posted to argue against me.  I'm curious as to why you argue with me over things I never stated?  I'm also curios as how your 1 month old account finds it's way to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       to argue against and poke fun of conspiracies?

       I would really say the elephant in the room is the lack of pentagon videos (and FBI agents seizing commercial property videos). Or how the twin towers were built with 2x redundancy and yet both collapsed into their own footprints.

       For me, the elephant in the room is who trained and funded the hijackers and who knew what they were up to and when.  Was Bin Laden the mastermind, or as a radical, did he make a  convenient scapegoat for the Saudis?  I don't think this question gets enough investigation.

       I have no doubt airplanes hit the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  I am convinced the towers collapsed due to structural failure caused by a combination of factors related to the aircraft strikes that are too numerous to list here.

       You ever hear of the book "The Looming Tower"? It answers the questions you have. It is written by Lawrence Wright and is an excellent, insightful read. He's the same author that wrote the Scientology book that the recent HBO doc was based on, he's featured prominently in the doc as well.

       Your comments are reasonable and thoughtful. I appreciate that. Just remember a 3rd building (building 7) collapsed on 9/11 and it was not hit by a plane. Still, even if the official coincidence story is all true, I absolutely agree that's still not reason enough to give up our freedoms and privacy.

       That is a great point. My father (an avid worshipper of the state) claims the pilots had access to computer simulators, which are fucking expensive unless I'm mistaken about something. After all, Bin Laden was being watched going back to '98.

       Have you seen the youtube clips of some documentary where they got experienced pilots to try the same maneuvers in a simulator but they found that it was extremely difficult (as in no one succeeded)? Also the supposed pilots were reported to be terrible at piloting aircraft.

       I do.  Never trusted them. We've had bases in Saudi Arabia for a long time. Our presence increased after the first Gulf War. I believe they tolerate that only so long as it benefits them. If the Saud regime didn't directly order it, they either turned a blind eye and let it happen or funded it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they wanted to get rid of Bin Laden because he was making trouble for the relatively Westernized Saudi Arabia?  Carrying out 9/11 gave them the chance to get rid of him and convince the U.S. to take out some other problems (Saddam)

       I've seen the evidence proposed and for me it just wasn't convincing enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my humble opinion, the mechanism for collapse was reasonable (falling debris starting a fire, the emergency water pipes being messed up by the collapse 370ft away and a subsequent uncontrolled 7hr fire), and I was not able to find compelling evidence that
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       undermined it for me.

       Building 7 was the first steel framed sky scraper in history to fall due to sprinkler system failure along with minor structural damage.  Also, in order for it to fall in the way it did (free fall speed into its own footprint) all of the steel support beams on the ground floor would have had to fail completely at the exact same time.  I don't see that happening because of sprinkler system failure and a few isolated fires. Architects and engineers for 9/11 truth.

       Not only the lack of videos at the Pentagon, but the fact that it has been conclusively shown that the few frames released from the security camera have been manipulated. One of the frames -- the key frame that should show the aircraft, oh what a coincidence! -- is out of sync with the others, and contains copy-and-pasted pixels from another frame. There really can be no doubt that somebody really doesn't want us to see what hit the Pentagon.

       Are you referring to the new pearl harbor? While it may be true the frame was altered, in that movie in the section about the frame by frame of the two released videos the narrator (or author) refers to "the tail of the plane" which is actually some trees or something that is visible in the other frames as well.

       Yes, that is a mistake; however, it doesn't discount the fact that a region of the image is identical in two different video frames from two different cameras, nor the timing discrepancy.

       So do you think the building was designed to topple like a tree instead? First of all, that wouldn't even happen. The second the centre of mass shifts the entire thing crumples like tin foil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, why would a building ever be designed that way?

       I don't believe it was designed specifically to fall in to its own footprint. Rather it was just an inherent part of the design. The outer skin of the building was the part of the building holding everything up, it was made of a thick steel skin that basically cages in the rest of the building. Beyond that the buildings really didn't just fall in to ita footprint. Plenty of the buildings fell to the side and fell on top of many of the buildings surrounding the wtc.

       The core of WTC 1&amp;2 was thick and strong. Redundantly thick concrete with more than adequate steel reinforcement. Irregardless of what happened to some of the floors, that core did not simply collapse. Yet if it did, as the official conspiracy theory states, where was it in the rubble? Nowhere to be seen. Google building collapse images. None of them show the concrete simply pulverized and disintegrated (other than those which were deliberately brought down, of course).

       WTF are you talking about? There is never

        anything

       in the design of a building allowing for its possible collapse. That's so counter-intuitive I can't find the words. You design buildings to stand. You don't design them with the potentiality of their collapse.

       It's always "former" and "retired" experts who point out such things, because their careers are over. How many 35-year-olds with kids and a mortgage say such things?  They know it was a big lie but don't want to get fired mid-career.

        the sound at the very least would be caused by the same thing - a massive rush of air.

      <p>
       Correct, but the key here is the pitch of the jet engine.  Commercial airliners have much lower jet wash sounding pitch because they are not pushing as much air through as a military jet engine would.   This is also known as the "blue note" aerodynamic noise.

       What is the "Fairbanks Clip" supposed to demonstrate, again?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally a tiny fraction of a second of sound before the first impact sound. Too little to compare to any of the other example jet sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what's that about audio being "removed"?

       The sound characteristics of those clips/planes are distinctly different.  If someone could take the Pepsi challenge and put a blindfold on, they could most likely tell you which of those two planes/videos are different.

       I'm not saying they sound exactly the same...but you are using less than 1 second of sound from your original video from a microphone on a camera hundreds of yards away to determine it's not a 747 sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying they can sound close enough.  Also, in my clip the plane wasn't going nearly as fast as the one that hit the 2nd tower and it was much closer to the microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the no sound in most of the clips...yea that is weird, I totally agree with you on that.  Will have to do some more digging.  That was a good find.

      <p>
       Bingo!  So then how could the ones that hit the towers go so fast?  That's what OP is saying here. They must have been modified with military grade engines to go so fast and make such noises.

       Im sorry but that max speed of velocity of 360 knots is way too low. If you do a simple search you can see plenty of sites say that it's optimal cruising speed is 533mph or about 460 knots. Having traveled quite a bit for work on these I can also attest to their speed, as I have arrived to my destination in times that would require the higher speed.

       it has to do with the altitude of the plane. The lower the altitude, the greater the atmospheric pressure, the greater the structural stress on the plane.

       It's not the pressure but the aerodynamic drag that slows down the plane.  Drag is much lower at higher altitudes.

       True, but that largely affects the efficiency of the aircraft, not so much max speed. Could those planes usually fly at those low altitudes to their destination? Heaven's no. The drag would burn their fuel up. Could those planes sustain such acceleration for less than a minute as the pilots gave the engines everything they got, pretty much forcing the plane to ignore the extra stress of the low altitude? It seems most likely.

       I flew a largerish jet for a while (707 airframe).  I agree with you.  The planes max speed was a built in safety margin.  Planes don't magically hit a wall (metaphorically) when they reach the barber pole.   There is a buffer to top speed in.  Things start getting very inefficient at those higher speeds, and damage from the aircraft will probably result.  Even though the top speed was limited in the 707 to around 0.87, I believe some pilot lost control of it and exceeded the sound barrier in a dive.  With that jet at altitude, with throttles at idle, I could hit the barber pole with a 1000 foot vvi descent.
      </p>
      <p>
       My experiences with Lears, was the problem with Mach tuck.  We could cruise all day long at 0.81, you could pull the overspeed circuit breaker and cruise at 0.83 (I did not do this).  At about 0.85 the airplane would start hitting critical mach and the wing would start loosing efficiency.  That plane would fly easily achieve its 310 knots airspeed limit at sea level.  Our limitation was the strength of the windshield could not take a bird strike about that speed.  The plane was comfortable at that speed.  This was the same model of jet that Payne Stewart was in.  Its alititude was limited to FL450.  But in that instance, the jet was found above FL510 with nobody actively piloting it.  A limitation is what you should never exceed.  But it is imposed limit made up by a guy in a desk.  And Paynes jet was near the speed of sound on its way down.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only real overspeed at low level at was in jet (t-37) that was limited to 275 kias.  We were late for a low level entry time and my instructor took the jet.  He set the power at 100% at takeoff and never pulled the throttles back.  So in the dive from about 6,000 feet to the entry point  at around 1500 feet altitude we hit 360 kias.  This was far exceeding the top speed of the jet.  At that speed the jet was barely controllable.  He had 2 hand on stick because the control forces were so heavy.  During the dive I was leaned back in my seat the entire time to preparing to eject.  I was a student and had no real voice to say much.

       You would reach terminal velocity (drag = max thrust) at some point, so the real question is "what is the terminal velocity of a 757/767 at sea level?". Sure it might fall apart, but that just leads to people derailing the conversation.

       Terminal by definition isn't under acceleration. Its free fall vs air resistance. Top speed isn't hitting terminal velocity its maxing your thrust out.

       It is when the thrust from the engines is the same as the drag from the air friction.

       Their whole calculation is comparing to a flight that hit .99 Mach as a baseline and saying that's equivalent to a slower speed at lower altitude just on math. It doesn't seem to take into account the fact that drag coefficient increases significantly, more than 10 times as much, as a plane approaches Mach 1 (hence why it's called the sound
       <em>
        barrier
       </em>
       ) causing additional stress to the airframe. That doesn't start to come into play until around .87, the drag divergent mach number, in a normal wing design which makes the whole comparison irrelevant to the 9/11 planes since 510 knots is nowhere near that number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Max speeds and altitudes published by Boeing are about fuel efficiency and flying safely (and so that they aren't liable for anything bad that happens beyond specifications). That clearly wasn't a concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ground speed also isn't the best measure to use for questions about drag stress. Commercial jets have managed ground speeds around or even above the speed of sound with big tailwinds, but the airspeed was still their normal cruising speed.

       Maximum speed for those planes at sea level is around 250 knots. Again, look it up. You have to be 30000 ft in the air to safely do 500+ knots.

      <p>
       For the most part, yes, it's the density of the air that factors in to the limits.  But it doesn't matter what altitude you are at.  The limits are typically set relative
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       the air densisty, which is why the limits are usually expressed relative to the IAS or mach speed as opposed to it's ground speed.

      <p>
       The Indicated Air Speed is simply the airspeed as indicated by the instruments on the plane.  When you are flying close to ground level your IAS will be the same as the relative ground speed.  If you are flying close to the ground at 300 knots, you a are probablly going about 300 knots.  If you are are flying at 30,000 feet and your insturments say you are going 300 knots, you are likely going 400, 450 knots relative to the ground.
      </p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, there's definitely still resistance (if there was no resistance, there would be no air, and planes can't fly without air.  That's not to say you can't send them higher, though, we sent a plane in to space for decades (btw, in that extreme instance the IAS on the shuttle would have shown 0, while the relative ground speed would have been 17000 mph!!))  We have designed many planes that can go higher than your typical wide-bodied commericial jet.  The U2 spy plane was designed to reach altitudes over twice as high!  But at those altitudes the air density was so low that the stall speed of the aircraft was about 10 knots lower than it's maximum speed!
      </p>
      <p>
       At cruising speed there's not a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       difference between the air pressure on the ground and at altitude.  at 30,000 feet you might see a difference of 150 knots between your IAS and what your relative ground speed is.

       Yes, but V speeds are specified in KIAS or KCAS which is effectively the sea-level speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who apply take the VMO as if it were at altitude and then apply pressure calculations to adjust for low level are misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       The V speeds are also a maximum standard operating speed, not a physical maximum. The FAA required that planes be tested to a certain margin
       <em>
        beyond
       </em>
       specified V speeds (I think it was 125% but I don't have the reference handy) - so an aircraft specified with a safe maximum speed of 420kts (Vd speed) was tested to 525kts.

       <p>
        Im sorry but that max speed of velocity of 360 knots is way too low.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree, 360 knots is the max in terms of typical usage of the aircraft, you don't want to take it up above that because it increases the stresses on the plane to the point that if you did that on a regular basis you would introduce too much wear and tear it would make flying the plane untenable
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       you could find yourself entering some bad turbulence while flying well beyond the max speed and at that point the combination of the two could damage the plane while in flight.  It's like, yeah, your car might be able to go 140mph, but you stick to 80mph on the highway because if you ran your car at 140mph all the time the stresses on the car would require you visit the mechanic quite a bit more often, not to mention that pothole you hit on the highway would be a lot more difficult to deal with.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you do a simple search you can see plenty of sites say that it's optimal cruising speed is 533mph or about 460 knots.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the relative ground speed as opposed to the indicated air speed.  This is something that confuses a lot of people.  They might be going 460 knots relative to the ground, but the instruments will read below 350 knots or so (because of the differences in air pressure).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Having traveled quite a bit for work on these I can also attest to their speed, as I have arrived to my destination in times that would require the higher speed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As long as you don't go over the max on the indicated air speed, the plane is within it's operating parameters, but at cruising altitude you can find yourself going quite a bit faster, relative to the ground, because of a lot of factors.  You can catch the jet stream which itself could add on 100 knots if you are lucky enough!  But the IAS will still read below 350.

       And why crash the supposed fake planes so far apart on time? Why set it up on such a way that by the second plane hits there are hundreds of cameras filming the scene? If you are going to fake it, you aren't going to want people filming it. If you are going to bring the buildings down with explosives, why wait hours to do it while everyone is watching?

       The faster it is moving, the harder it is to see. If you are using a fake plane, then you don't want it to be easily visible. Think about a baseball traveling 100 mph, it is hittable but you only see it for a split second. Throw a baseball 500 mph and you would have no chance to hit it and probably not be able to see it. A plane is larger so people could still see it but not for long and not clearly. Just my guess.

       I have a friend I went to school with who is currently a Navy pilot.  His dad was a military pilot and is currently a commercial pilot.  Even before 9/11 he was telling me about the system parameters for commercial jets that have fail safes for kamikaze pilots.  Nothing makes sense when it comes to the banks and speeds for this airliner; I am also a veteran.  We both are neutral in our bias and political outlook for obvious reasons.  The answers are out there if you know where to look.  At this point, it's too late.  The American people are on full-tilt with the 'official story.'

       They most definitely do not have fails safes for "kamikaze" pilots. One just intentionally crashed a jet into the alps.

       That was different - Lubitz adjusted the autopilot for lower altitude, and the aircraft duly responded and did what it was told.  It doesn't know that there are mountains underneath and that the pilot wants to deliberately crash.

       If he'd physically grabbed the side stick and tried to pull stunts, the Airbus's flight envelope protection mechanisms would probably have stopped him.  Boeing didn't have anything that advanced or as complex when the 757 first entered service.

       My statement is true.  There are fail safes; not all bases can be covered and yes, there will be cases when the system fails.  I'll take the expertise of a second generation pilot over an internet warrior, any day.

       Psychopaths are not random Keith Ledger Joker types, but actually people who behave in predictable ways. There's an excellent book about psychopathy, "The Psychopath Test" by Jon Ronson. Psychopaths don't engage in overly convoluted plots just because. Moreover, this isn't a scheme that one person could have arranged but rather a whole group of people. So they all agreed to both fake what planes were crashing in and rig the buildings?

       Really? Variants of this idea were around well before 9/11. It appears in a Tom Clancy novel
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_of_Honor">
        Debt of Honor
       </a>
       , and we knew from World War II that the Kamikaze were very effective and that part of that was not just explosives but the burning fuel. And in the run-up there were many serious discussions of this sort of attack. See

       I'm not talking about the concept of using planes as bombs. What I'm talking about is the plot with bunch of terrorist flying the planes all over the east coast for some 2 hours without NORAD noticing anything is amiss...

       Funny you mention "Debt of Honor," Clancy has been known to do a decent research for his novels (at least back then when he was actually writing them) and the feasible scenario he came up with was a experienced pilot pulling elaborate hoax giving him just enough seconds to crash the plane into Capitol without being intercepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the official story tells you the NORAD and all involved flight control personnel have shown incredible incompetence and blatant disregard for SOP on that day. Yet noone were ever as much as admonished - hell, some even got medals and promotions!
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet on many other occasions, (Stewart Payne event for a ready instance) the system seemed to work flawlessly... guess Allah really did help his jihad warriors!

       And Clancy is an author who if anything always overestimated the competency of intelligence and security agencies: it makes things look a lot more cool. Contrast his version of how things go with say how le Carre portrays them (who incidentally had more real world experience than Clancy).

       The 9/11 report actually addresses that (should have realized what you were talking about)- the alert time and intercept time were comparable in that situation. I think this is in Chapter 1, but I'd have to go and check.

       which indicates it is Footnote 121, which is apparently where it is, and that has a bunch of related analysis that expands on what was happening.  Someone really needs to make a nice searchable version of the report.  Maybe I should get a Kindle copy.

       Sure, it took a while. But there never were any indication of national security at stake in Stewart case. The initial loss of radio contact could be (from the air traffic controller POV) something as simple as radio malfunction. The first indication of a real trouble was the failure of the plane to change course towards Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, there still weren't any reasons to believe it's something sinister happening.

       Compare it to the flight 77, when we already knew "America is under attack," as Andy Card eloquently put it, NORAD and flight controllers on high alert and multiple Air Force bases close by...

       Well in this case, because I'm curious how people approach things, what their hypotheses are, and where they believe work should be concentrated, along with what models of reality they have. It actually is very important what people think. If one doesn't have the correct hypothesis behind something identified, then it might not even show up in an investigation if no one is looking for what would shed light on that hypothesis.

       This. People can't get their head around the possibility that something other than the government's official coincidence theory happened, so they force you to speculate on what actually happened. Speculation is a mug's game. Let's have an actual investigation that actually wants to discern what happened, and THEN we'll know. We aren't official investigators. We just know the official conspiracy theory doesn't add up and a new investigation needs to be initiated.

       Or how this ties in with WTC7 being rigged to implode, I remember you telling me that the plane that was taken down was most likely intended to hit tower 7. Now in light of your modified military remote operated drones idea, would you like to revise that?

      <p>
       "Which organization has the greater responsibility for acknowledging the elephant in the room? The NTSB, NASA, Boeing, or the AIAA? Have engineers authored papers, but the AIAA or NASA won’t publish them? Or, does the ethical responsibility lie not with organizations, but with individual aeronautical engineers? Have engineers just looked the other way?"

       Your strawman appears to be that you claim a person must have a theory to ask questions.  I believe a person can think critically and one of the the best parts is that you don't have to provide an explanation to ask questions about a supplied explanation.

       So, if I were, that would be (roughly speaking)
       <em>
        extrapolation
       </em>
       not
       <em>
        interpolation
       </em>
       . There is a distinction. Interpolation is within a range. Extrapolation is outside your initial range. So for example, if I know that a function is well-behaved and I know that f(1)=2, f(3)=4 and f(4)=5, it would be interpolation to say that f(2) is probably close to 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extrapolation would be if I knew that say f(1)=5, f(2)=10, and f(3)=15, and I concluded that f(4) is probably close to 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that in neither case by the way is anyone making a presumption: they've made a tentative
       <em>
        conclusion
       </em>
       , and in the case in question that's not even what happened, since I asked the OP if he believed something. If I had taken for granted that he did and ran with that that might have been a presumption.

       You do know that pretty much no one would answer "no" to that question, right? It is a great example of a question where the answer isn't going to tell you much at all. Of course,
       <em>
        I

       <em>

       are thinking critically, and OP thinks that they are thinking critically and so on.

        Flight "UA 175": An Incredible Journey
       </strong>
       (Pilots discussing the NTSB Report Released by FOIA request.)
      </p>
      <p>
       In August 2006 the NTSB, in response to a NSA FOI request, finally released details of the 9/11 flights.
      </p>
      <p>
       NTSB Releases 9/11 Flight Information
      </p>
      <p>
       When going over the report in reference to another thread it suddenly dawned on me how incredible a journey the flight of United Airlines 175 actually was.
       <a href="http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB196/doc03.pdf">
        Report Here
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The report includes a flight profile, a ground track, A pressure altitude graph derived from radar mode C returns, and a transcript of radio communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following is a "blow by blow" of the alleged plane's astonishing flight, taken from the report:
      </p>
      <p>
       United Airlines Flight 175 departed Boston Logan at 8:14AM
      </p>
      <p>
       It reached 31,000 feet at 8:33AM
      </p>
      <p>
       The final radio transmission was at 8:42AM
      </p>
      <p>
       Beacon Codes were changed twice within one minute at 8:47AM (possible point of a "radar swap")
      </p>
      <p>
       UA 175 started into a climbing turn to the South East at 8:51AM
      </p>
      <p>
       It reached 33,500 feet at 8:53AM
      </p>
      <p>
       UA 175 began its descent while continuing its turn
      </p>
      <p>
       It turned towards North East while its descent continued
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane was now headed towards WTC2 in a direction of North east (45 degrees) 
at what is termed point (G)
      </p>
      <p>
       Its altitude at this point was 25,000 feet at 8:58 AM
      </p>
      <p>
       It was at 24,000 feet at 8:59AM
      </p>
      <p>
       18,500 feet at 9:00AM
      </p>
      <p>
       15,000 feet at 9:01AM
      </p>
      <p>
       9,000 feet at 9:02AM
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane is presumed to have struck its target at a height under 1000 feet at 9:02 40 AM. Mission Accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       (END FLIGHT SUMMARY)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now point (G) where UA 175 starts heading straight for WTC2 is just east of Trenton, NJ. The targeted tower is approximately sixty miles away at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is incredible target acquisitioning, but just as incredible is the fact that according to the NTSB report, which was founded on three sets of radar data ( FAA, JFK Approach and USAF) the alleged plane covered the sixty mile distance in approximately 4 minutes and 40 seconds.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       This aircraft was traveling at 10 miles per minute or 600 knots average over 4.5 mins! Holy crap!
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that the plane was descending 24,000 feet in this last 4.7 minutes-- thus officially going well over the maximum speed in progressively thicker air for a sustained duration.
      </p>
      <p>
       So officially-- we have a plane descending a mile a minute, significantly over the maximum possible speed for the aircraft-- ALL officially done by a pilot who has never flown this type of aircraft before-- and somehow he manages to steer the plane perfectly to hit precisely a very narrow target (the WTC south tower)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, we have the admission from Boeing that a 767 simply can't go over 500 mph near sea level.

      <p>
       Is this true? The plane descended 8000 feet in 40 seconds? Can some pilots out there tell me if this is a reasonably attainable descent while also maneuvering to acquire a target? Terminal velocity for a bullet falling back down to earth is 17600 feet per minute.

      <p>
       It seems to me to be quite a feat to successfully navigate a plane and acquire the target at that rate of descent, but I'm no expert. Any well-qualified pilots want to chime in?

      <hr/>
      <p>
       They were trying to hit the WTC in the UA sim the very next day.. on Sept 12, 2001, so while they were aware the plane was travelling at high speed, obviously he would not know what the actual recorded speeds were yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were flying the simulator for a Boeing 737, a smaller and much more maneuverable aircraft, within the Vmo limit, or under 360 knots - he mentions the figure of 300 knots, which is considered at that altitude to be very fast, particularly as it relates to controlled flight and maneuvering/piloting in near sea level air density. As for the forces involved, which include both aerodynamic pressures due to airspeed and g-forces due to maneuvering, Dan mentions in the interview that they were "fighting the crash logic" when making the attempt at the "higher speeds" because it simulates the forces involved, and very accurately in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, he and his pilots were trying to hit the WTC South Tower at Vmo or below.. or 300-350 knots, max, and from what he said, closer to 300 and well within with the Vmo limit (360 knots)
      </p>
      <p>
       They couldn't go faster than that, past Vd (420), because the sim will then freeze and the screen will turn red due to the crash logic, which would require re-setting the simulator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, as far as controlled flight and maneuvering, and piloting goes, they were flying a 737, a smaller and much more maneuverable aircraft, at around Vmo (and less) and were unable to hit the target (south tower) unless and until they reduced the airspeed to near approach level speeds, which for a Boeing 767-200ER is around 142 knots and for a Boeing 737, around 130 knots.
      </p>
      <p>
       These were very experienced pilots with 1000's of hours of flight time in other aircraft types.
      </p>
      <p>
       After they tried it about 10 times, Dan himself was finally able to do it (fly the dive and final approach at the high speed of 300 knots and hit the target WTC South Tower), although he didn't say how many times he tried it before finally getting it just right with wing tips within the building perimeter (think of it like parking in or going through a separate garage in your car at full speed ++ out of a turn, but harder).

       "For a guy to just jump into the cockpit and fly like an ace is impossible - there is not one chance in a thousand," said Wittenberg, recalling that when he made the jump from Boeing 727's to the highly sophisticated computerized characteristics of the 737's through 767's it took him considerable time to feel comfortable flying."

       9/11 will never get press it deserves. I have a feeling the further and further we get from that date, the less likely any action will ever take place. If it were to get addressed and people put on trial, the laws that were made in the wake will still be there. It's a complete travesty all around.

       I'm as big a skeptic as anyone around here but I did some back of the napkin calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on this video we see the plane flying into frame around 5:53
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMQWzdc175A&amp;amp;t=5m52s">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The side of each tower was 208' and we see ~2 building lengths from the edge of the tower to the side of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes the plane from entry of the frame to the edge of the visible tower 1 second to travel ~2 building lengths or 416 feet.  416 feet per second is equivalent to 283 miles per hour.   Seems slow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well the speed this guy says at 360 knotts is 414MPH.  So with the back of the napkin calculation allows for and additional 133mph of wiggle room in the math.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plausible that the video is showing an actual 767-200.  Which is 159' and seems to also measure against the side of the building correctly.

       Yes. Altitude doesnt matter as long as nothing is in between radar and target. I dont have the specific data on me but I seem to recall they have radar data up until close enough until impact to show the ridiculous speeds.

       Back of the napkin calculations means just that...sketches.  Of course I didn't factor in elevation because it's not required in my example it's just a simple distance and time calculation which results in a number that is plausible for a plane of that type.

       I really don't know what you're trying to bitch about here or what your point is.  You're screaming about sea level and air density but you're not connecting it to anything.  You also posted this and I'm refuting it with some calculations that I've admitted are simplistic but yet you've made no attempt or effort beyond ridicule.  Typical tin foil hat nutter shit and if you want to move beyond those types of labels you're going to have to work a bit harder than you currently are.

      <p>
       (a) General. The aeroelastic stability evaluations required under this section include flutter, divergence, control reversal and any undue loss of stability and control as a result of structural deformation. The aeroelastic evaluation must include whirl modes associated with any propeller or rotating device that contributes significant dynamic forces. Compliance with this section must be shown by analyses, wind tunnel tests, ground vibration tests, flight tests, or other means found necessary by the Administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       (b) Aeroelastic stability envelopes. The airplane must be designed to be free from aeroelastic instability for all configurations and design conditions within the aeroelastic stability envelopes as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) For normal conditions without failures, malfunctions, or adverse conditions, all combinations of altitudes and speeds encompassed by the VD/MD versus altitude envelope enlarged at all points by an increase of 15 percent in
       <em>
        equivalent airspeed
       </em>
       at both
       <strong>
        constant Mach number and constant altitude
       </strong>
       . In addition, a proper margin of stability must exist at all speeds up to VD/MD and, there must be no large and rapid reduction in stability as VD/MD is approached.
       <strong>
        The enlarged envelope may be limited to Mach 1.0 when MD is less than 1.0 at all design altitudes
       </strong>
       , and
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) For the conditions described in §25.629(d) below,
       <strong>
        for all approved altitudes
       </strong>
       , any airspeed up to the greater airspeed defined by;
      </p>
      <p>
       (i) The VD/MD envelope determined by §25.335(b);
       <strong>
        or
       </strong>
       ,
      </p>
      <p>
       (ii) An
       <strong>
        <em>
         altitude-airspeed
        </em>
       </strong>
       envelope defined by a 15 percent increase in equivalent airspeed above VC** at constant altitude, from sea level to the altitude of the intersection of 1.15
       <strong>
        VC
       </strong>
       with the extension of the constant cruise Mach number line,
       <strong>
        MC
       </strong>
       , then a linear variation in equivalent airspeed to MC+.05 at the altitude of the lowest
       <strong>
        VC/MC
       </strong>
       intersection; then, at higher altitudes, up to the maximum flight altitude, the boundary defined by a .05 Mach increase in MC at constant altitude.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       So, let's see what happens when we apply an increase of 15% to the EAS for Max Cruising Speed of Mach .86 at 35,000 ft. alt.
      </p>

      <p>
       .86 Mach (VC) + .05 - is the same as the VD/MD of .91 Mach @ 35,000 ft., so it makes sense - for a

       @ constant altitude).
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: The aeroelastic limit for stability (and flight control) in an altitude-airspeed evelope is very different from the design ultimate structural load limit which is used largely for G-forces, and applies only in the wind tunnel for a constant altitude, and only for a very short duraction of 10 seconds before imminent catastrophic failure can and will occurr.

        The airplane was UA175, a Boeing 767-200, shortly before crashing into World Trade Center Tower 2. Based on analysis of radar data, the National Transportation and Safety Board reported the groundspeed just before impact as 510 knots. This is well beyond the maximum operating velocity of 360 knots, and maximum dive velocity of 410 knots.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'd like to put this into some context.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, what is the meaning of the maximum dive velocity, Vd? V speeds, and the loads aircraft must design at those speeds, are defined by FAR part 25, which governs the design of transport category aircraft. The dive speed of an aircraft (governed by part 25) must be such that the design limit loads will not be exceeded at that speed under specified conditions. The main concern with high dive speeds is that a vertical gust will cause aerodynamic loads that cause the aircraft structure to yield or fail. So part 25 specifies a gust profile for which it must be safe for the aircraft to penetrate at Vd.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is certainly inadvisable to operate an aircraft above Vd, because the structure may fail if a large enough gust is encountered. However, even a gust as large as that specified in part 25 will not cause a failure, since there is a factor of safety (1.5) built into the regulations. That's a factor of 1.5 in loads, not speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gust loads go as V times v, where V is the aircraft is the aircraft velocity, and v is the gust velocity. So for a given gust field, if the design limit load is reached at Vd, the design ultimate load (with the factor of safety) will be reached at 1.5 times Vd. (It's actually a bit more complicated, because the loads felt by the aircraft depend on the gust profile and aircraft dynamics, but the general idea is correct.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of all this is that an aircraft can certainly operate well beyond Vd, both because there is a factor of safety built into the definition of Vd, and because the aircraft may not encounter a gust as large as that specified in part 25.
      </p>
      <p>
       The converse is true as well --- it is perfectly possible for an aircraft to encounter a gust large enough to cause it to fail well below dive speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vmo is defined so that (among other things), Vd is not inadvertently exceeded due to recovery from an upset. So exceeding Vmo in this situation is really irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: The dive speed is the highest speed at which the aircraft is guaranteed to be structurally sound given a specified gust field, with a factor of safety. The aircraft may be structurally sound well above that speed.

       You're referring to the ultimate
       <strong>
        structural
       </strong>
       load limit (which deals primarily with g-forces), as opposed to the aeroelastic limit for stability (flight control), as per my post below.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, it's a design structural load limit to be held for something like no more than 10 seconds before structural failure is imminent, whereas the South Tower Plane maintained Vd + + speeds for well over a minute. The ultimate structural load limit only applies at a constant altitude, in the wind tunnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a
       <strong>
        <em>
         maneuvering
        </em>
       </strong>
       aircraft, the only margin (in the real world) for retaining flight control is between Vmo and Vd, and LESS, since the aeroelastic limit for an ascending altitude-airspeed filght envelope is VC (max cruise) + 15%.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you've offered for "context" is misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       To really understand the situation, we need to look at EAS or equivalent airspeed, as well as CAS, and see if it would exceed an
       <strong>
        equivalent aerodynamic pressure
       </strong>
       exceeding Mach 1.0 at higher altitudes. If so then it's definitely an "elephant in the room".

(transitional altitude to Mach number) for a maneuvering aircraft in a descending altitude-airspeed flight envelope (as simulated in the wind tunnel), is the VC or Max Cruising = 290 knots + 15%, or 333.5 knots CAS (calibrated airspeed)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's not true. The FAR you cite clearly says that the aeroelastic stability envelope must be
       <strong>
        at least
       </strong>
       15% larger (in equivalent airspeed) than
       <strong>
        Vd
       </strong>
       (not Vc) in normal conditions. That's
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       471 kt. It can certainly be larger, if the limiting factor on Vd is gust loading. The envelope must be 15% larger than (the smaller) Vc only for specified adverse conditions and failures.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Further,
        <strong>
         it's a design structural load limit
        </strong>
        to be held for something like no more than 10 seconds before failure is imminent, whereas the South Tower Plane maintained Vd + + speeds for well over a minute.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, it's a design structural load limit
       <strong>
        in the presence of a specified gust
       </strong>
       .  If there is no gust, simply flying at Vd or somewhat faster will have no ill effect on the aircraft, even for long periods of time. It's really dangerous, of course, because there could be a gust out there that would break the airplane.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To really understand the situation, we need to look at EAS or equivalent airspeed, and see if it would exceed an equivalent aerodynamic pressure exceeding Mach 1.0 at higher altitudes, if so then it's definitely an "elephant in the room".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is complete nonsense, and not what the FAR says at all. Speeds listed as v-speeds (such as Vd) are already in terms of EAS. Speeds listed as M-speeds are in terms of Mach number. There's no reason at all to convert dynamic pressure at one altitude to a Mach number at another altitude. Exceeding Mach 1 is bad, of course. But the aircraft in question was at Mach 0.77. The fact that the dynamic pressure at Mach 0.77 and sea level is greater than the dynamic pressure at Mach 1 and a higher altitude has no significance whatsoever.

       This isn't true at all and there's no reason to use Mach # below 17,854 ft. (where linear variation to the the Mach numbner line at 23,000 ft. and above). That's absurd, it just doesn't apply.

       Inversly, however, because the air is 2/3rd more dense near sea level than at 30,000 feet alt., a TAS (true airspeed) near sea level, in terms of yes, the equivalent aerodymamic pressure, will equate to a much higher TAS at higher altitude (total and equal number of air molecules passing through the pilot tube ie: pressure, at any given moment) [aerodynamic pressure], and thus EAS, and CAS then come into play and in fact both

      <p>
       EAS, CAS and TAS become equal at sea level and then vary with altitude, as the air becomes increasingly less dense (by 2/3's at 30,000 ft. than near sea level).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, a TAS of 510 + knots, at 1000 ft. alt. would equate to approx 722 knots TAS [or Mach 1.19] @ 22,000 feet, in terms of the equivalent aerodynamic pressure or equal number of air molecules passing through the pilot tube at each instant [pressure].

       How about we do this: Your argument is a little confusing to me. I'll restate it step by step as best as I can, and you can correct it as appropriate. Then we can discuss the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand your argument, it's the following
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The max cruising speed at 35,000 ft is Vc = 294 KCAS.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The plane had a CAS of 517 kt at time of impact. Let's call this Vi = 517 KCAS.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The aeroelastic load limit (let's call it Vae) is Vae = 338 KCAS = Vc x 1.15, because that what §25.629 requires.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At 294 KCAS, the total pressure is Pt = 11.38 inHG
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At 338 KCAS, the total pressure is Pt = 13.11, 15% higher than at Vc. This defines the total pressure aeroelastic limit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         At near sea level, and 517 KCAS, the total pressure is 43.09 inHg.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         43.09 is more than 3 times 13.11, and therefore holy shit, elephant in the room, etc.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Is that correct?

       For #2. [correction] the TAS is 517 (groundspeed with 7 knots headwind), and the
       <strong>
        CAS
       </strong>
       is
       <strong>
        507
       </strong>
       knots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that CAS reduces with higher altitude (plane has to fly a lot faster to fly in thinner air and thus CAS and EAS remain almost identicial than what they are at lower altitude for an equivalent aerodynamic pressure over the airframe), but that at and below 17,854 feet, the Vmo is 360 KCAS and the Vd, 420 KCAS. That it's measured in CAS is noteworthy and may put a fly in your ointment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aeroeleastic limit of a 15% increase in EAS to the VC at 35,000 ft (.88 Mach) = .99 Mach, simply shows that it's valid as the altitude-airspeed filght envelope aeroelastic limit for a maneuvering aircraft ie: 15% increase in EAS to the VC at all altitudes and/or a .05 increase in VC Mach # up to a max of Mach 1.0 at all altitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the Pilot Tube Pressure, i'm not
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       sure since i'm not an expert, but since we know that the air is 2/3rd's thicker near sea level than at 30,000 ft., it's not suprising that a CAS exceeding Vmo by 147 knots and Vd by 87 knots (fact), results in a Pilot Tube Pressure near sea level more than 3 times greater than for the aeroelastic limit, at 35,000 ft. alt. (also a fact).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear in mind that the max maneuvering limit or Va (would this be any different from the Max Cruising translated to low altitude? I suppose it would be) is 290 KCAS below 17,854 ft, so it looks about right ie: that Max Cruising at 35,000 ft = 294 KCAS.

       I still need to do some more work on the aeronautical calculator (which is entirely verifyable) later today and tomorrow to see how the Pilot Tube Pressure (impact and total) correlates with the aeroelastic limit
       <strong>
        [and Vmo and Vd limits]

       through ascending and descending altitudes, but i have a sneaking suspicion that it (aeroelastic limit for flight stability) won't vary to a large degree from 13.11 Hg, at all altitudes.

       Need to verify a little further, but aside from the plane's CAS being 507 from a TAS of 517, looks about right. Yes. [check].

       OK, given that that is the argument, I'd like to list (some of) the parts of the argument that I think are flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. In point 3, your argument is that the aeroelastic load limit is Vae = 338 KCAS. There's no basis in the data or regulations for that. In another post, you cite FAR §25.629. But that section places the aeroelastic limit at
       <strong>
        at least
       </strong>
       1.15 times Vd, not Vc. Since Vd (at the altitude in question) is 420 kt, that places the aeroelastic stability limit at
       <strong>
        at least
       </strong>
       483 kt. It is true that §25.629(b)(2) requires the aeroelastic limit to be only 1.15 times Vc, but only under the conditions of §25.629(d), which are
       <em>
        Failures, malfunctions, and adverse conditions
       </em>
       . None of those conditions existed as far as we know on the aircraft in question. So you're applying the wrong margin.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. Just to make the separate point, FAR §25.629 requires that the aeroelastic limit be
       <strong>
        no less than
       </strong>
       1.15 times Vd (or 1.15 times Vc in certain adverse conditions). That doesn't mean that that is the actual limit. The maximum permissible value of Vd depends on a lot of factors, including most prominently gust loads. So at one altitude, Vd may be determined by gust load considerations, and at another, it may be determined by aeroelastic or stability considerations. Given the certification numbers for Vc (really Vmo) and Vd, you can't infer what the aeroelastic stability limit is. Indeed, at high altitudes, Vd/Md and Vmo/Mno tend to be set by Mach number effects rather than dynamic pressure effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. Just because an aircraft doesn't meet the conditions for aeroelastic stability doesn't mean it will come apart. If the aeroelastic limit is flutter, then yes, flying in that condition for any length of time would lead to failure. But an aircraft may not meet the stability criterion for other reasons. For example, the stick force per g may be too high or too low, meaning (respectively) that large forces are required to control the airplane, or that the forces are too small making it easy to break the airplane with large inputs. But that doesn't mean the airplane is unflyable at that speed, it just means it's unsafe to fly at that speed. We all agree that the aircraft were flown unsafely.
      </p>
      <p>
       D. As to point 4, aircraft performance and dynamics depend on dynamic pressure, not total pressure. Sitting on the ground at sea level, the total pressure is about 29.96 inHG. By your logic, that number is almost 3 times higher than at the aeroelastic limit. So the aircraft should come apart sitting on the ramp before takeoff. You really want to use dynamic pressure in your argument, not total pressure. Dynamic pressure is listed as qc (impact) pressure on your calculator. You also mixed up mmHG and inHG, but that's a minor point. But dynamic pressure is essentially CAS squared, so there's no reason to talk about pressure at all; just use CAS.
      </p>
      <p>
       E. Most egregiously, you are taking the envelope limits at 30,000 ft, and applying them to flight at 700 ft. There's a reason that the 767 has its envelope specified both in terms of Vd and Md, and differently at different altitudes. At high altitude, Mach effects are limiting, and so Md is critical; at low altitude, dynamic pressure effects are limiting, and so Vd is limiting. Your basic argument is to take the Md limit at high altitude, convert it (incorrectly) to a dynamic pressure limit, and then apply that limit to the low altitude case. But it doesn't work that way. You need to start with the sea level flight envelope, because that's where the aircraft was flying. It's perfectly legitimate to ask whether a plane with Vd = 420 can fly at 517. But you can't learn anything about that by using the flight envelope at 30,000 ft, because the limitations on the flight envelope are caused by different mechanisms at different altitudes.
      </p>
      <p>
       F. It is true that 517 kt is above the Vd limit of 420 kt. But it's not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       far above it. You've used
       <a href="http://imgur.com/XQCQqgy">
        this diagram
       </a>
       a few times. It's a little misleading, because it shows structural failure above, below, and to the right of the flight envelope. Operate above the ultimate G limits of the aircraft, and it will fail, so having structural failure above and below the envelope is appropriate. However, to the right of the envelope, it should really read "structural failure possible in some conditions." Flying above Vd may not induce limit loads unless a gust is encountered. It's also possible that there's a failure mode (like the drag on the tail ripping it off) that would cause a failure. But there's a margin of safety built in.
      </p>
      <p>
       517 is 23% above 420. Normally aero loads go as velocity squared, but gust loads go as velocity times gust velocity. So at 23% above Vd, encountering the design gust would cause loads perhaps 23% higher than the design limit loads, but still well below the ultimate loads, due to the 1.5 factor of safety. (It's a little more complicated due to dynamic effects, but the basic point is correct.) No sane pilot eats into the safety margin, but flying 23% above Vd does not imply instant breakup of the airplane. Even aero loads that aren't gust dependent would be 1.23
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       = 1.51 times the design limit loads, and therefore barely at the ultimate loads.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question, which one can't answer from the data you provided, is what sets the Vd limit at sea level for this airplane? If it's set by gust loads, not aeroelastic stability, then the plane can certainly fly at that speed in the absence of large gusts. Doing so would be incredibly dangerous (there could be a gust, or a bird, or another airplane out there!) but hijacking and flying a plane into a building is already dangerous, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       G. In your most recent post (and in the flight envelope image), it's important to understand what Va is. Va is basically the speed below which you can't break the airplane with the controls, because the airplane will stall before it breaks. (That's an oversimplification, but close enough for this discussion. There was actually an accident soon after 9/11 where a pilot broke an airplane below Va by incorrect application of controls.) Above Va, a pilot could break the plane by pulling high Gs. Of course, airplanes fly above Va all the time and never break, because pilots don't pull high Gs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on what sets the Vd limit, Vd can be like that. Below Vd, gusts of a certain amplitude can't break the airplane. Above the airplane, such gusts
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       break the plane, but only if they occur. (Vd might also be set by other factors of course.) So it's not right to conclude that an aircraft that flies above Vd will break apart, only that it might. Go fast enough above Vd, it will break up, but you don't know what that number is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does seem that you are trying to understand the aerodynamics, and that's laudable, but I can tell you that your calculations and arguments aren't correct. Deets' conclusion might or might not be right (I think it's wrong), but your calculations simply don't support his argument. I'm sorry, but despite your sincerity, it's just silly to quote the total pressure of 43.09 inHG and sarcastically say "holy shit, there is an elephant in the room," as if that number had any importance at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: Keep the discussion limited to the flight envelope at sea level, because that's all that matters for flight at sea level. In that case, V=517 is inadvisable but may be possible if Vd=420.

       For altitudes below 17,854 ft. alt. the Vmo and Vd are limited by 360 KCAS and 420 KCAS, so we'll stick with that then, and ignore comparisons of equivalent airspeed and dynamic pressue to altitudes above the Mach line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the TAS of 517 = CAS of 507, so that's what we'll be working with.

       8000 feet per minute? whoa that's crazy!
      </p>
      <p>
       For our purposes we'll go with the descent from 12,000 feet to 1000 ft. wherein a groundspeed of 500 - 520 knots was maintained, but with the headwind NNW of 7-10 knots that will give us a TAS of 507-527, with an ACCELERATION? post-dive (is that even possible for standard engines at such an airspeed?) to retain the 517 + TAS at the lower altitude. In every case TAS will be converted to CAS. We can then look at the Pilot Tube Pressure readings as a point of comparison for the corresponding CAS between Vmo, Vd, and the plane in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for the most part, at all altitudes, aerodynamic pressure over the airframe is the main factor, transonic effects aside. Therefore i wasn't totally out to lunch in terms of where i was going with the comparisons of low to higher altitude, bearing in mind that Mach 1.0 remains the hard outer limit at all altitudes as per the FAR.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, if the EAS and CAS would lead to an equivalent aerodynamic pressure at higher altitude that would exceed Mach 1.0, then there's the hard limit, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you refer to Vd + 15% i thought that only applies at
       <strong>
        constant altitude
       </strong>
       and not within the context of an altitude-airspeed flight envelope.. however you may be right about normal vs. adverse conditions causing failures. I believe that it's the VC + 15% that allows for wind gusts, not the Vd limit, which leaves little or no room for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that we're talking about a maneuvering aircraft here, not one flying at a simulated
       <strong>
        contant altitude
       </strong>
       in the wind tunnel, which is why i chose to use case 2 with the VC + 15% instead of Vd + 15%. Just seems more realistic or appropriate for the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to add: We'll also have to use Pilot Tube Impact Pressure, not Total Pressure, you're right, my bad (thanks for the correction).

      <p>
       No. High dynamic pressures are bad, and high Mach numbers are bad, somewhat independently. That's why at low altitudes, the limiting speeds are Vmo/Vd (because they are CASs), and at high altitude the limiting speeds are Mmo/Md. If your surmise were right, then there would only be V limits, and not M limits.

      <p>
       No, read the advisory circular I referenced before. For a given altitude and airspeed right at the boundary of Vd, you have to be able to (a) hold the altitude constant and increase the speed (and therefore the Mach number) by 15% and still have stability, AND (b) hold the Mach number constant and increase the equivalent airspeed by 15%, which actually requires that the altitude be decreased. The requirement holds at each point in the envelope.

      <p>
       I think you're conflating a couple of different things. Vd has to be greater than Vc by (I think) 20%, or a lower number if there's a flight test to show that a certain type of upset won't result in exceeding Vd if the upset starts at Vc. The idea is that if upset by a gust or some other cause, the aircraft won't inadvertently exceed Vd. What I was referring to is a requirement that a vertical gust not break the airplane, a real concern when flying that fast.

      <p>
       OK, but that's not what the regulation says. The regulations require more stability / strength than you are assuming. They require stability and strength beyond Vd, and then they require that you cruise no faster than Vc so that you don't inadvertently exceed Vd. Whether it makes sense or not, the airplane is more capable (if it meets the regulations) than you are giving it credit for. And it may be even more capable than the regulations require.

       Yeah, a bit, but maybe not as much as you think. A standard glide slope, which is pretty shallow, is 3 deg. 8000 FPM at 500 kt is 9 deg; steep, but not impossibly steep. 3-4000 FPM descents at lower airspeeds are not uncommon, so the flight path angles are comparable.

      <p>
       I think you're parsing the report wrong. See figure 2 in the pdf you linked. There was no post-dive phase. It was in a 4000-8000 FPM descent all the way to impact. They would need to do so to maintain the airspeed. If a pilot wanted to execute the best attack against the tower, one reasonable procedure would have been to (1) choose a preselected altitude, and fly west at that altitude until abeam the tower, and then a predetermined distance (time) past that abeam point. (2) turn a base leg, then a direct leg toward the tower, much like a landing approach, at a constant (high) descent rate to maintain airspeed. (3) Once lined up with the tower, keep a specific point on the windscreen pointed at the center of the tower. Maybe also (4) adjust the throttles to maintain as high an airspeed as possible, perhaps at Vd or even above. There would never be a point of leveling off, since that would only slow the aircraft down, which was not desired. It appears that the pilot actually climbed at the start of the base leg, which may have just been poor piloting. It also appears that the dive steepened as they approach the tower. That could have been due to choosing the wrong aim point. It would also account for the very high impact speed.

      <p>
       Would there be thrust capacity at such a speed do you think? The acceleration occurred at the very end of the dive, and while levelling out on final approach (albeit at the end of the dive). Thrust capacity in such a configuration, at a speed already 80+ knots over Vd - Do you really think that's possible for standard engines?
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally, even to acheive Vd the aircraft has to be in a fairly steep dive even to hit that speed (420 KCAS) because parasitic drag has already overcome thurst ie: no thrust capacity at pre-Vd speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw, thank you for this exchange it's been very helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to look at this will be data point by data point in a comparative analysis running backwards through the entire final turning and diving phase, moment by moment in snapshots, through the ascent to the point of impact with the south tower.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll offer the whole picture, with TAS, CAS, EAS, Mach#, Impact Pressure, from the perspective of Vmo, Vd, and
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       plane, through the same altitude range, moment by moment. Fortunately, all those data points are available. It'll just take a while and a lot of work putting it all together, but you've given me some very good ideas for future research and presentation.

       So we're supposed to think that this is a no brainer for a learner-novice who's never flown the real thing before in his life?
      </p>
      <p>
       The target aquisitioning is incredible, with the plane reaching the end of the arc of it's dive about right at the point of impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, to have retained relatively constant speed through the dive also meant that "he" was continually adjusting the throttle (slowly pushing it forward and throttling back) throughout the entire dive phase to hold a certain critical speed, with the whole dive exceeding Vmo, and much of it, Vd, even by a wide margin, particularly as the aircraft descended into the lower strata of the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heading adjustments also indicate maneuvering througout for targeting purposes. Thus the plane was controllable, even at up to 150 knots over Vmo, when controls and control surfaces ordinarily become unresponsive and subject to flutter and all kinds of other problems at such a speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's believable the official story, not in light of the data.

       These alleged hijackers were terrible pilots, abysmal, whereas this type of flying is off the charts, literally and in every way.

       What attitude is that?  Looking for facts to corroborate something that I found deeply interesting -- and reporting back that I had found evidence to the contrary?

       I first looked on Boeing's own site for specifications but couldn't find it.  Point me to where Boeing states different specifications and I'll edit the wikipedia page to reflect the correct information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the actual information, straight from Boeing?  Because right now, with the information I could find, it does in fact appear that the aircraft was flying well within its capabilities.

       That document seems to talk about "Maximum Operating
Limit Speed that may not be deliberately exceeded in any regime
of flight (climb, cruise, or descent) except where a higher speed
is authorized for flight test or pilot training operations".
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it's the functional equivalent to a speed limit sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it indicates that the aircraft is capable of higher speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's safe to assume that a hijacker who has already killed and stolen an airplane, would also be willing to fly it beyond the legal speed limit.

       I'm sure he's wicked smart.  But it looks like he's conflating speed limit with the airplane's max speed.  Maximum operating velocity appears to be the fastest a commercial pilot is allowed to fly an aircraft that is capable of much higher speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminals who have stolen airplanes are likely to also break speed limits.

       It's really not that complicated.  Either the plane can or cannot fly at a given speed.  And to think that the max speed of a plane is more than 100mph slower at sea level than at altitude is frankly, kinda funny.  A 7mph difference I'd buy, but I'd expect it to go the other way -- with the highest speed happening close to terra firma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I'd love nothing more than for there to be another attack vector to the crazy conspiracy theory that is the official story.  But this just doesn't look like it qualifies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And taking the "it's not my job to educate you" approach is uninspiring.

       Air density at cruising level is generally roughly 1/3 what it is at sea level. In other words, at sea level, the stuff the aircraft is travelling through is 3 times as thick. Just imagine yourself walking through water and then Jelly.

       Obviously, this results in huge speed differences,

       than the 100mph you laugh at.

       Im at work and on mobile, so no I dont have time to educate you. Another guy was going into it in great detail about a week ago, I'll try remember his username and point you to those discussions rather than rehashing it.

       So you're suggesting that a Boeing commercial airliner will fall apart in the air if it goes slightly faster than normal?

      <p>
       Those fucking things are seriously tuff tuff tuff.
      </p>

       I grew up around them -- my dad flew 7-3s for most of my childhood and graduated to 7-6s after I had left home.
      </p>
      <p>
       And unless all the grownups in the pilot's lounges were just lying their asses off, the good folks at Boeing build insanely strong and resilient aircraft.  You know, like strong enough to take a turn that'll compress your fucking spine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm not trying to use that in my argument because it'd be yet another appeal to authority -- and we've already had plenty of that.

       But seriously, the air the engines intake and output is also thicker closer to the ground.  It's not as if the only effect of thicker air would be increased drag.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it, the reason jets cruise so high is for fuel efficiency -- not that the planes are physically incapable of flying faster closer to the ground.

       It's more evidence that the official story is bs, and that they likely were military grade planes disguised as commercial ones.  There's also a compartment on the bottom that emits a bright flash as it strikes the tower, and that compartment is not on the model of the plane they claim it to be.  I think it sends a missile into the building, myself. In Plane Sight

       No, the charges were for taking down each level, I think the missile may have softened the building so the plane doesn't just smack it and make a mess, but goes within.  There are many who know more about it than I, though.

       A quick search showed that the maximum cruising speed for that plane is 493kt. I understand that's at altitude but still that's way higher than the stated max dive speed of 410kt and not far below the 510kt that the radar showed the plane being at when it struck the building.

       Now, for those of you who, in examining this data, might simply conclude that the NTBS Radar Data MUST be wrong and in error, please keep in mind that the NTSB used ASR radar from EWR, JFK, LGA, HPN as well as RADES for their analysis. The NTSB also did a video speed analysis which corresponds to their radar data study.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who feel the radar may be wrong therefore should not fly in or out of the NYTC terminal area as the same radar is used daily to assign speeds and vector aircraft for approaches to EWR, JFK, LGA and HPN.

       So we're supposed to think that this is a no brainer for a learner-novice who's never flown the real thing before in his life?

      <p>
       The target aquisitioning is absolutely incredible, with the plane reaching the end of the arc of it's dive about right at the point of impact (to within a second) to come perfectly level with the ground, with the nose dipping through the final turn into the building at a slight angle to just miss the core and eject

      </p>
      <p>
       Also, to have retained relatively constant speed through the dive also meant that "he" was continually adjusting the throttle (slowly pushing it forward and throttling back) throughout the entire dive phase to hold a certain critical speed, with the whole dive exceeding Vmo, and much of it, Vd, even by a wide margin, particularly as the aircraft descended into the lower strata of the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heading adjustments also indicate maneuvering througout for targeting purposes. Thus the plane was controllable, even at up to 150 knots over Vmo, when controls and control surfaces ordinarily become unresponsive and subject to

       I don't think it's believable the official story, not in light of the data and what might be thought of as aeronautical forensic evidence, which when combined with proof of the explosive CD of the twin towers is rather damning to the official story narrative.

       These alleged hijackers were terrible pilots, abysmal, whereas this type of flying is right off the charts, literally and in every way and you don't have to be a pilot to fully appreciate it, although any commercial airline pilot taking a good look at this would have to admit, at the very least that it was a highly

       But the cruising speed is 480 knots and the max is rated at over 500 knots... the fastest 747 speed record is 742 knots set Oct. 17th 2007....
Edit:
Haha silly me. Talking about 747a when I should be talking about 767... Numbers don't change much though. Cruise: 470 knots, max: 490 knots, record: 618 knots

       A good point, and a nice try.
      </p>
      <p>
       TAS = Groundspeed +/- windspeed vector.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wind on Sept 11, 01, was a headwind of about 7-10 knots N/NW (visible with the smoke drifting from the North Tower)
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, for a groundspeed of 510 knots, the TAS would be about 517 to 520 knots. This would give a CAS of about 507 knots, or 147 knots over the Vmo of the 360 KCAS and 87 kts over the Vd design dive limit  of 420 KCAS.

       This has been sent to me, and been copied from a forum, so use with caution and a grain of salt. Some of these are corroborated by the archive link, so you can be quite confident about it. Additional info: pilots will usually assume 31510KT on the northern hemisphere, as a rule of thumb. It's been pretty average standard wind conditions that day, it seems, so not much you can do wrong on that front if you calculate with NNW @ 7-10kts. (I used 7 to err on the side of conservative.

       means La Guardia Airport, on the 11th of the month, at 13:51 UTC (which is 9:51EST, I believe), the wind came from 340° (because 360° is North) at 09 knots.

       I've looked into this evidence in great detail. It's credible, and, moving backward from evidence of CD of the twin towers, it's more than credible.

       What, did they have the buildings all set for demolition and only required successful hijackings and piloting to the target by learner/novice pilots, in the case of the south tower plane, at Vmo + 150 knots?

       Um what the fuck? I simple google search shows the plane cruises at 458 knots. That's cruising not at max power, so if you were going full throttle in a decent it could easily hit the speeds that it did. I am aware of what true airspeed is incase anyone wants to make that argument. Source: Am pilot.

       You've away had multiple pilots tell you that are making crap up yet continue to repeat the same lies. Vmo is not a structural limit. It is a bird strike limit of the windows. Citing Vmo after you've been repeatedly told it's not a factor means you have a mental defect of some type. I think we can all agree that suicidal people are not concerned about a windshield's ability to withstand a bird strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, above, the same old information had been repeatedly provided refuting your invalid interpretations, knowing full well you are incorrect. You are by definition a troll.

       You don't read. I listed the design dive limit speed first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vmo isn't just for bird strike, but as to do with stability characteristics. The maneuvering speed is 290 knots, and then the outer flight envelope, for a maneuvering aircraft resides between the Vmo and Vd (360-420 KCAS), with very little margin if any beyond that, for a maneuvering aircraft that's stable and in flight control (without loss of stability).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pilots themselves did not tell me i was making crap up, those were trolls from another part of reddit who wanted to try to bias any pilots who did weigh in, which were almost none and no heavy commercial pilots, except one who simply said that legally, they can't fly above 250 knots TAS below 10,000 ft. for non-millitary.

       This was all previously addressed in your previous garbage post. ATP, test pilots, and engineers all disagree with you...and you know it. No need to rehash what you already know and ignored. The level of cognitive dissonance you reveal is truly amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last time you posted this garbage I did some searches. Was trivial to invalidate most everything you state - via ATP (with time in type) statements, test pilots (time in type) statements, and even engineers. You horribly misunderstand or purposely distort reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worst case here, I literally have more credibility than your plea to authority of the guy you reference above. He has no relevant credibility on the subject. Zero. At least I'm an actual pilot. Which further makes this a garbage post.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're clearly a smart guy and we both know what you're doing. The layman's term is, "baffle them with bullshit." Providing tons of links doesn't prove your point, though you've likely convinced some who don't know any better with your bullshit.

       You are concerned with the normal operating limits, you can dive (or even a decent) a plane and make it go way beyond what it's "safe" to do. The reason people don't exceed these speeds is because it's dangerous but if you are flying into a building safe speeds don't matter.

       355 comments? seriously?

      <p>
       the "elephant in the room" --&gt; could a 767 possibly fly that fast or did it have to be modified with a beefed up structure and engines.... just so it could be flown unnecessarily recklessly to the brink of destruction... just so you could have this argument?
      </p>
      <p>
       cause drones fly straight and level. suicidal pilots fly reckless.
      </p>
      <p>
       and they aren't discussing AA11. they're discussing 175, the 767 they have on video. with radar data. with videos showing engines sounding like they were gonna explode.
      </p>
      <p>
       it almost missed the building it was going so fast.
      </p>
      <p>
       so are they "impossible maneuvers" or is there video and radar data of the aircraft doing the impossible maneuvers?
      </p>
      <p>
       a drone wouldn't hit like this:

      </p>
      <p>
       a drone would hit it square.
      </p>

       what is it going to be? cause it's 2015 and it's clear these children don't even know anymore which toys are theirs to pick up and go home with.

       Not neccessarily, no it wouldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, i think if you're a high precision drone aircraft (pilot) you'd want to try to hit it to both penetrate the building perimeter while just skirting the core, and that you'd try to hit it like

       No the targeting was absolutely exquisit for achieving the desired outcome. Even hitting at the much lower level and across multiple floors through the final turning maneuver.

       It wasn't a case of "he almost missed the building", no i don't think so. No it was absolutely perfect, flawless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the building hit lower although hit second "fell" first, with the other building following suit in precisely the same manner about a half hour later (burned longer, less weight loading above the impact area) -

       I'm not saying they sound exactly the same...but you are using less than 1 second of sound from your original video from a microphone on a camera hundreds of yards away to determine it's not a 747 sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying they can sound close enough.  Also, in my clip the plane wasn't going nearly as fast as the one that hit the 2nd tower and it was much closer to the microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the no sound in most of the clips...yea that is weird, I totally agree with you on that.  Will have to do some more digging.  That was a good find.

       I can think of many instances where a plane's hydraulics were compromised and that left the pilots controlling the plane only with differential thrust using the engines, in a case like that the pilot would want to be able to use the full thrust of the engine.  It is an extremely difficult way to control the plane, and it usually doesn't end well.  JAL 123 is a fairly famous example,

       There is not one instance where a 767 exceeded those speeds and had an accident.

       Plus, the speeds people need to recognize are the VNE speeds. Most V speeds are overmarked for safety reasons and have a built in buffer.

       I do.  Never trusted them. We've had bases in Saudi Arabia for a long time. Our presence increased after the first Gulf War. I believe they tolerate that only so long as it benefits them. If the Saud regime didn't directly order it, they either turned a blind eye and let it happen or funded it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they wanted to get rid of Bin Laden because he was making trouble for the relatively Westernized Saudi Arabia?  Carrying out 9/11 gave them the chance to get rid of him and convince the U.S. to take out some other problems (Saddam)

       Have you seen the youtube clips of some documentary where they got experienced pilots to try the same maneuvers in a simulator but they found that it was extremely difficult (as in no one succeeded)? Also the supposed pilots were reported to be terrible at piloting aircraft.

        Mr.Deets' conclusion was that, based on the evidence, there are a lot of oddities about the flight characteristics and there should be more investigation.

       There are no oddities. A 767 flying at those speeds is perfectly reasonable and possible. What Mr. Deets needs to do, and
       <strong>
        should've done if he wants to be taken seriously by his engineering peers
       </strong>
       , is come up with a Finite Element Analysis using Catia, SolidWorks or program of his choice, showing that given the parameters of the flight data, would cause enough stress and strain on the airframe to where it would cause great structural compromise. However, the plane did indeed fly into the building, so we can conclude that the planes structural integrity didn't compromise, thus was capable of flying at those speeds.

       Its not when you have no proof.
