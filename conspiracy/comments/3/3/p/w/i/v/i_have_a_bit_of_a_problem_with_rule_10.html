       Doesn't that seem like a bit of a totalitarian rule for a subreddit like this? Sure you could say it's only for "attacks" but who is making the judgement call here? What if a constructive critique of a mod is viewed by that mod as an attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remove that rule. Allow the community to openly criticize the subreddit, the users, and ESPECIALLY the mods. This rule seems to go against everything this community believes in.

       I understand your sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allow me to explain my PoV on the rule and why I think it belongs and then I would like to hear your feedback after you've read over my PoV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rule 10 is used to keep trolls from constantly disrupting the flow of information in this sub by attacking the users, calling them names, insulting their intelligence, accusing them of being Nazis/Jews/Zionist/shills/trolls etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       A constructive criticism shouldn't need to include personal attacks and insults, they tend to be more constructive without such nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods here are under constant attack by people who aren't interested in the subject matter covered by this sub,  those people want conspiracy to become conspiracy-lite where a whole swath of controversial subjects are forbidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as "attacks against the sub" are concerned, IMO comments like "oh conspiracy is the armpit of the internet" or whatever negativity can be injected doesn't serve a useful function here.  If you dislike this place then save yourself the heartache and don't visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Criticism of the mods is 100% welcome.  Calling the mod you don't like a Nazi or a moron, like calling any user that, is simply not welcome here.

       That's all fine but at what point does it become about disrupting the flow of information YOU want vs. the flow of information in general?

      <p>
       Yes, I agree with that. HOWEVER sometimes it can be relevant. For instance, if I made a post accusing you of being antisemitic would it be removed? It's a personal attack about your personal views, but it's particularly relevant in a sub that regularly discusses Jewish people and Jewish history. Your personal views could possibly cloud your judgement as a mod. I'm not saying you are antisemitic I just bring this up because I know it's a complaint that has been made about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with the sentiment of the rule, but I feel like it leaves way too much open to a mod's discretion. What constitutes an attack, you know? A personal attack can be 100% correct and 100% relevant to a discussion. It also comes off as hypocritical in a subreddit that is all about anti-censorship and transparency.

      <p>
       Again I agree in spirit, but just don't understand why it needs to be removed. You claim in another response here that downvotes don't work. But I see it working all the time. I love to read the bottom of comment sections. I constantly see the worst kind of shit at the bottom of comment sections here, a lot of which would fall under the umbrella of Rule 10. A lot of it would also fall under Rule 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the questions I've posed here you'll never be able to satisfy with an answer. The MAIN point I'm trying to make and the main problem I have with the rule is that it's people censoring information about themselves. It's you censoring an attack on you. It's a slippery slope from keeping discussion relevant and polite to keeping people from talking about you. And that's what I mean when I say you can't satisfy some questions with an answer. You can say that you and the rest of the mods would never abuse the rule, but this is a community for skeptics. I would bet big money that this rule has probably already been abused, and I would bet even bigger money that this rule WILL be abused in the future.

       We don't moderate content except in extreme cases like the digital cartel fellow who has schizophrenia and is being toyed with like a pet monkey by reddit trolls.  We don't allow that stuff here because it is objectively wrong and constitutes a weird form of cyber bullying where a sick man who has delusions of being the messiah is being make-believe worshipped by trolls for the lulz.  Normally we simply moderate behavior to uphold a standard that seems to make this sub a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as information flow, anything goes except satire, all-caps, Facebook (because of personal info ToS problems), and anti-conspiracy stuff (there is a sub for that and this isn't it).

       Sure it absolutely can be 100% correct and 100% relevant but it still does more harm than good to the prospects of having a discussion.  It doesn't matter if a user is antisemitic, anti-white, anti-black, anti-government, a liberal, a Republican, a Democrat, a libertarian or Vladimir Putin...  if they can have a discussion here without using slurs or making personal attacks then they are welcome to post here.  Trying to shut someone up because you don't like their questionable ideological beliefs isn't having a discussion, its shouting someone out of the room.   Having a conversation with someone who has bad prejudices isn't the end of the world, you might learn something that helps you understand their malfunction and they might learn something that helps them let go of their prejudice... people like that have recanted before!  But we can't do that if an army of concern trolls run the show around here.

       If we didn't remove them they would dominate every comments section.  You do see down votes working some of the time, often our community handles shitty posts/comments on their own.  The mods don't really need to do much with those, its the ones that get vote brigaded from somewhere else that rise to the top and derail the discussion that we step in and remove.

       People are called shills and insulted all the time. There are full posts where users are called out for being supposed shills. Users who doubt any theory aside from the most asinine ones are insulted, mocked and called trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a recent conversation, I was called a shill multiple times simply for questioning the dodgy criteria with which users here identify shills. Why weren't those users warned or banned? If I remember correctly, I did report them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only mod action I've seen in regards to my comments was the removal of a comment after a user called me a sociopath for having a different opinion. I was thankful for the action, but the comment was one of many (I was accused of being a shill, a pervert, a troll etc), and the user continued in their tone, unwarned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm not the only one subject to this. All you have to do is counter the accepted opinions of members here to experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given your history of banning people for calling out racists and your recent banning of people just for disagreeing with you (which got you temporarily removed), Do you expect anyone to believe this rule is being enforced fairly and without bias?

       Yes I ban people for calling out racists, all also ban racists for using slurs.  You probably only hear about one of those scenarios because you're personally more concerned about that side of the issue.  The racist crowd often accuse me of being a Zionist Jew for banning them when they break the rules, the SJW crowd accuses me of being a racist when I ban them for breaking the rules.  Its two sides of the same coin.  They are all breaking the rules! And I take no prisoners!
      </p>
      <p>
       The two people o banned recently that got me removed were breaking the rules.  You don't go around calling people Nazis because you don't like them.  The other mods agreed with me on this and I was reinstated.  It was actually one of the subjects of the debate among the mods about my removal, those users did in fact break the rules!

       2 months ago. Also you should check the context. You would have seen that op was purposely misinterpreting anti corruption measures against netenyahu as the complete opposite. It was more of the anti Semitic trash that makes this sub look bad.

       I never tried to do such a thing. If you read my post you would see the issue I had was that it was a blatant lie and misinterpretation of what they were doing. And I never asked for it to be removed. I addressed it in the thread. So nope, no moral authority here.

       The irony here is that you are criticizing me for trying to get something I don't like removed (which is completely false) when the discussion is about you removing me because you don't like what I said.

       Considering that if you took it up with some mods who have shown to be corrupt.......likely ensuring that a potential complaint never gets addressed and or resolved....yes.  I agree.  Not outing them out in the "public" and "doing the right thing" could result in a legit complaint not going anywhere.

       Was this rule always there?  I am clearly guilty of not keeping up on rule changes if it was recently added.

       You know what's funny? The rule was put in after the fiasco caused by
       <strong>
        Flytape

       .

       You know, that person who
       <em>

       be a mod because they act impulsively on their feelings and ban people, delete threads, and are generally an unpleasant person? Funny that we can't criticize the mods or their choices when they reinstated someone who the

       I mean he brings up a decent point. Flytape is the center of quite a bit of drama. I'm not a
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       regular anymore and I'm certainly not a huge follower of subreddit drama, but even I have heard a lot about Flytape. I'm also a subscriber to the belief that where there's smoke there's fire. It's certainly interesting that he was the first mod to reply to this post and he's ALL OVER this post defending the rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's because he's a dedicated member of the community and a vigilant mod. Maybe it's because he's abused the rule in the past or plans to abuse it in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is, we should be allowed to have this discussion especially here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       without fear of having our posts removed or being banned. We shouldn't be discouraged from calling out users and especially mods, and that's exactly what this rule does.

       Aren't we being allowed to have this discussion right now? And I'm not even sure if "allowed" is the right word to use there. We're able to.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think rule 10 is there to deter users from having rational or reasonable discussions, and I'm not sure it's fair to read it that way. The fact that we're all having this conversation should be evidence of that. Rather, it's to deter users from "attacking" other users, this sub, and the mods thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling another person's actions or beliefs into question isn't an attack. Calling someone else a Nazi, or a troll, or a fucktard, or a shill (though that last one might not apply to me for obvious reasons), simply because you disagree with them, certainly is.

       I didn't say that it was bad, just that it was interesting. You're incredibly active in this post, almost a third of the comments in here so far are from you. You also happen to be surrounded by drama related to the topic at hand. It seems overly defensive to me. Maybe you're just being a super active mod.

       I basically said as much to you. There's no way you can satisfy all the questions, and there's no way you can prove that you never have and never will abuse the rule. Maybe that's not fair but it is what it is. That's partly why it's a bad rule. It relies on us trusting the moderators, in a community of skeptics. It also forces moderators of an anti-censorship community to censor the community.

       Alright man, I know you don't like me but this is total rubbish.  Rule 10 was here before I was ever a mod, 9000sins put that rule in place when we had like 40,000 users.  This comment is reaching so far that I actually laughed a little.

       It's counterproductive to have posters attacking individuals in this sub on a personal level, merely due to the opinions those individuals express on general issues. Just because someone posts information you don't want to hear, or don't want anyone else to hear about, should not be a license to call them names, or accuse them of various evils.

       I think it's pretty much there to keep people from merely attacking one another, or groups as a whole, rather than having constructive conversations about things. If you look at how it's enforced, this seems to be the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look in the links in the sidebar, they have a pretty transparent system going, in that removed topics are logged.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my personal experience, on the occasion when I inquired as to why another user's posts were being removed, the mod team was very quick to follow up with an answer to my inquiry and even went what I'd consider the extra mile to ensure full transparency on that particular matter.

       But why is it necessary at all? Downvotes will sort out ridiculous attacks. Redditwide rules will sort out people trying to post personal information or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a rule left up to the mod's discretion, which is especially dangerous when part of the rule centers on discussions about moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not accusing anyone of anything just yet. But I think it's an unnecessary rule that will eventually lead to abuse of power and unfair censorship. I would fight against a rule like that on any subreddit, but ESPECIALLY here.

       Well we have mod rules that allow mods to override another mod's action and this seems to sort out the Lion's share of that type of stuff.  We are all humans so we do make mistakes.

       Downvotes don't sort out ridiculous attacks. I have literally seen someone tell a user on this subreddit that they hope their kids get autism from following their doctor's recommended vaccination schedule. I believe it was at +3 before it was removed by the moderators.

       I agree with this. The rule is there to keep the discussion focused on the topics, and name-calling always detracts from that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed the involvement of exactly one mod on this subreddit, and that's only because he and have very different opinions on the same pet topic so his name frequently pops up responding to me, and vice-versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's exactly as it should be - when mods are doing it right, you shouldn't really notice their presence or actions.

       For as much as this sub might get shit on by the general reddit population, it absolutely has the best mods.

       Rule 10 is hardly ever enforced anyway so I wouldn't get all bent out of shape about it. People criticize the sub all the time and everyone who disagrees with the circlejerk gets branded a shill on the regular but there is rarely anything done about it.

       The community can criticize one another. It happens here frequently, but what you are calling for is for the community to be allowed to ATTACK. No one is stopping any users of this sub from doing what you say,  except yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how your post is allowed to stay up? It is a critique of is sub and you are not attacking. Your post is an example of how this sub can openly critique the moderators without fear of repercussions.

       I don't have a problem with deleting comments that are irrelevant personal attacks. My problem is in the mod's interpretation of the rule. What happens when someone is posting relevant and true information about a mod and they decide it's an attack? Subjective rules that give mods the power to censor posts/comments about the mods are not a good idea.

       That's when such comments get deleted and, if repeated, the user gets banned. And that happens here way more than you might realize. No mod would or should allow slanderous lies about them to remain undeleted. Nor do we allow that to happen to the regular users here if we see it.

       FACT: This rule has been repeatedly questioned (I'd guess an
       <em>
        average
       </em>
       of about once a month - considering it was questioned weekly the first few weeks) ever since it was single-handedly written and implemented without any moderator or public discussion by....
       <a href="/u/9000sins">
        /u/9000sins
       </a>
       - who was, at the time, constantly being criticized for being a fascist tyrant. (He had been pushing for the removal of all moderators listed above him - including
       <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">
        /u/illuminatedwax
       </a>
       and 2 others, now retired.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The only result of the criticisms has been the "tweaks" to the language. The end result is the same:
       <a href="/u/9000sins">
        /u/9000sins
       </a>
       implemented fascism, while being a fascist tyrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Supplemental FACTS: One of the original mods (ranked only under
       <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">
        /u/illuminatedwax
       </a>
       - which is a reddit-owned account, not an actual user), came out of hybernation, fired all of the mods (including
       <a href="/u/9000sins">
        /u/9000sins
       </a>
       ), deleted these crap rules, and confronted illuminatedwax about what was happening here with a very pointed self-post about all of this. This mod was convinced to resign, and
       <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">
        /u/illuminatedwax
       </a>
       reinstated the fired mods -- with
       <a href="/u/9000sins">
        /u/9000sins
       </a>
       at the bottom of the list. Within a matter of days (couple weeks at most),
       <a href="/u/9000sins">
        /u/9000sins
       </a>
       had convinced all of the other mods to step out of his way while he climbed back to the top of the mod list, just under
       <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">
        /u/illuminatedwax
       </a>
       . Then,
       <a href="/u/9000sins">
        /u/9000sins
       </a>
       got busted for posting CP (which he claimed he thought was "midgets")... and ... reinstated again, a few weeks later after the dust had settled - without any input from the public... and proceeded to climb up through the ranks again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The identity of the mod who busted 9000sins for being a fascist tyrant and fired all the mods has been deliberately left out of this comment in order to respect his desire to never be involved in this farce of a subreddit again.

       Fact: donbueno was inactive and never did shit to help the sub.  When he removed all the mods under him and removed the rules we had in place the whole subreddit immediately turned into a shit show.
      </p>
      <p>
       He came out of reclusion with zero discussion and removed all mods because HIS opinion was different.  That is the definition of tyranny!  9000sins and the rest of the mod team had a long and detailed discussion about limiting account age before it was actually done, that is the definition of cooperative rule!

       as I said, he came out of hybernation. his account had been idle for about 10 months when the new mods were hired and about 15 months by the time he came out of hybernation to stop 9000sins.

       That's sort of an exaggeration since the entirety of that period of time was about 4 days - not enough time for the sub to change in any significant direction.

      <p>
       the account age issue is not part of this discussion. changing the subject to a different rule to show how "cooperative" 9000sins is... is just a shameful, deceptive distraction from the facts here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape, I'm not sure why you continue to embarrass yourself by confronting me over my knowledge of this sub. I was a mod here (and resigned because of 9000sins) LONG before you were ever even considered for the job of licking his boots.

       Nope. Just more of the defamatory anti-rConspiracy mythos ginned up in SRD. If a reddit account ever posted CP do you actually think that they would still exist? Amazing how gullible some people seem to be...

       False. I posted an image to
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       that was called out as CP, but in my opinion, and everyone else who I showed the image to personally that day including my girlfriend it most definitely was not. Also, why was I allowed to keep my account and also why didn't law enforcement get involved? It's not like I make my identity a secret or anything. I make music under the same name and I am known locally by my username.

       Okay. I feel the need to chime in here. I understand the frustration with rule 10, so I will try to explain our reasoning and why it was implemented in the first place. Believe it or not we have a serious troll problem here. Like, really really bad. This rule was implemented to in order to have a rule to point to when banning problem users. This rule has always been selectively enforced and completely at the discretion of the moderator team. It is only used in extreme cases with the most problematic users. You can call me a facist or whatever, but most of the people talking negatively about me have no idea of a what prompted the rule and don't seem to have a full understanding of the course of events that led us as a mod team to implement this rule and enforce it. Also the users saying I submitted CP, that is also incorrect. I have children myself and I would never contribute to the exploitation of a child. That shit is sick and wrong and it's also an easy way to discredit anyone. I'm not claiming that my account was hacked. It wasn't. I posted the image in question. I was at my girlfriends' work and one of her co-workers found the image in question ON FACEBOOK, and I personally posted it to
       <a href="/r/wtf">
        /r/wtf
       </a>
       . To me and my gf's coworkers the image was clearly an obese midget posing for a topless photo, but a few others on reddit disagreed and claimed that the image in question could have been a minor. Personally I didn't think that could possibly be the case, but in retrospect it was a mistake for me to repost that image. I only saw it once briefly before I posted it. I tried later to look at the image to see why everyone was saying it was cp, but it was gone from Facebook and from imgur.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that I tried to log back in to my reddit account but it was locked. I contacted the admins, and apparently they agreed with me that the image was pretty ambiguous and that my account could be reinstated as long as I wouldn't post that kind of material any more. This eventually caused me to lose my mod spot here at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , and I had to convince the mod team that I was not hacked or comprised and that I am really innocent of the charges put against me. Also, to any doubters, don't you think that I would have had some kind of legal trouble if I really did what I was accused of? I would hope so. People that exploit children are the scum of the earth and that is part of why I am here as a moderator on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for the accusations of fascism. As many of you know I was the first of the new mod team some years ago just below donbueno and illuminatedwax. I put many, many hours of hard work and dedication to build this subreddit up into what it is today. I coded a lot of the old CSS myself and made most of the sidebar images and icons that graced this sub for a long while. I engaged the community and asked them what they wanted to see and what kind of changes they wanted. This sub was my baby for many years. When donbueno stepped in and removed the whole mod team it was because we decided that we were tired of being trolled by one day old accounts so we used automod to remove posts from users less than 3 days old. He thought this was going too far and instead of a discussion he simply removed the entire mod team. This person may have had  a hand in the beginning of this sub, but he hasn't been active here for you way longer than I have been a mod here. He never talked to us or did any kind of moderation here at all. This was his one and only action for the entire 4 years I have been here. He was subsequently removed and the entire mod team was reinstated by illuminatedwax.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the incident with my account getting banned and being reinstated my name slipped down to almost the bottom of the mod list. I no longer have much authority here, and this was probably by design. I am dangerous to those who wish to silence us. I have since taken a back seat to the other moderators here and let them handle most of what happens here. I have 3 kids to take care of every day so almost all of my spare time these days is spent relaxing or playing video games. Hell I don't even have time to record music anymore. I used to pump out 20-50 songs a year, but recently that number has dropped to maybe 1-3 a year. I do plan to someday make a comeback here when my baby is a bit more grown and I have some more free time. But for now I am the farthest thing from a fascist. I have been taking a hands off approach for about a year now. I almost expected a wave of changes here after a while but it never happened. The current mod team is great and they do an awesome job of maintaining the sub and managing the community. You guys have excelled and I couldn't be more proud of what I have done and we have accomplished together. I wish I had more time and energy to give you.
      </p>

       I love all of you. Even those of you that hate me.

       Look, we can't have a completely free and open forum here because shills and trolls fucking ruin it. It's just that simple. If all people here conducted themselves with honesty, yeah, then we could drop the censorship (of which there is already very little.)

       It's really the most...I want to say "ironic" thing about this sub. The mods and power users claim this is a thinking ground for top minds and whatever, but then thinking outside the hivemind results in ridicule, vote-brigades, bans, etc. And of course pointing this out never does anything, as the users have no say over what the mods do. So the power trips shall continue unabated :(

       Let's take the current stickied post as an example. It's a post asking for nominations for best all-time content. Two or three users took the opportunity to start bashing the mod team and it ended up with several pages of completely off-topic personal attacks and arguing about the mods. It got to the point that one had to scroll though page after page of crap to get to the actual links people were nominating. That's a huge distraction for readers and a turn-off for any new subscribers. So, all of those comments were removed.

      <p>
       When you click on a link about a certain topic, do you want to see pages and pages of off-topic arguing about what users or mods are good or bad? Or would you rather read about the topic at hand?

       If the most important content on

       is unilateral mod actions against the will of the sub, how is that not suppose to be highlighted?

       That is some best-of-all-time

       Its content shows how this sub, along with most other important subs, are being white washed by those with the power to do so.

       That obviously means that your answer is
       <em>
        yes
       </em>
       , you do "want to see pages and pages of off-topic arguing about what users or mods are good or bad".

       I and the rest of the mods disagree with that.

       Why did the goalposts change from a specific topic to a broad one? Why did you obfuscate. The topic is relevant to a mod's actions only, not that of a user.

       If you aren't willing to adhere to your own goalposts this conversation is meaningless.

      <p>
       If certain moderators are in the running for
       <em>
        best all-time content
       </em>
       , as deemed worthy by users of the sub, I see no problem letting the users choose (with the up vote / down vote buttons ) which content is worthy of
       <em>
        best all-time content
       </em>
       .

       No matter how hard you try, you won't succeed in your attempt to conflate personal attacks against mods with actual "content".
      </p>
      <p>
       I just can't even understand why some people are so vehemently against posting actual content, following the rules, and commenting civilly (that's not to say you personally haven't been civil here, only that some aren't). On the other hand, I do know that the majority of people that do that are here to do their best to destroy this sub (again, not referring to you). You'd be amazed at how many times we've received such threats through modmail. One person even claims to have a "thousand" alt accounts already set up. I know of at least a dozen of those accounts that have been banned here and shadowbanned. It's a never ending battle.

      <p>
       That's when such comments get deleted and, if repeated, the user gets banned. And that happens here way more than you might realize. No mod would or should allow slanderous lies about them to remain undeleted. Nor do we allow that to happen to the regular users here if we see it.
