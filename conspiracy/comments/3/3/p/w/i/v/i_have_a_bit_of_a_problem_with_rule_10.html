<p>Doesn&#39;t that seem like a bit of a totalitarian rule for a subreddit like this? Sure you could say it&#39;s only for &quot;attacks&quot; but who is making the judgement call here? What if a constructive critique of a mod is viewed by that mod as an attack? </p>

<p>Remove that rule. Allow the community to openly criticize the subreddit, the users, and ESPECIALLY the mods. This rule seems to go against everything this community believes in. </p>

<p>Allow me to explain my PoV on the rule and why I think it belongs and then I would like to hear your feedback after you&#39;ve read over my PoV.</p>

<p>Rule 10 is used to keep trolls from constantly disrupting the flow of information in this sub by attacking the users, calling them names, insulting their intelligence, accusing them of being Nazis/Jews/Zionist/shills/trolls etc etc.  </p>

<p>A constructive criticism shouldn&#39;t need to include personal attacks and insults, they tend to be more constructive without such nonsense.</p>

<p>The mods here are under constant attack by people who aren&#39;t interested in the subject matter covered by this sub,  those people want conspiracy to become conspiracy-lite where a whole swath of controversial subjects are forbidden.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;attacks against the sub&quot; are concerned, IMO comments like &quot;oh conspiracy is the armpit of the internet&quot; or whatever negativity can be injected doesn&#39;t serve a useful function here.  If you dislike this place then save yourself the heartache and don&#39;t visit.</p>

<p>Criticism of the mods is 100% welcome.  Calling the mod you don&#39;t like a Nazi or a moron, like calling any user that, is simply not welcome here.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all fine but at what point does it become about disrupting the flow of information YOU want vs. the flow of information in general? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I agree with that. HOWEVER sometimes it can be relevant. For instance, if I made a post accusing you of being antisemitic would it be removed? It&#39;s a personal attack about your personal views, but it&#39;s particularly relevant in a sub that regularly discusses Jewish people and Jewish history. Your personal views could possibly cloud your judgement as a mod. I&#39;m not saying you are antisemitic I just bring this up because I know it&#39;s a complaint that has been made about you. </p>

<p>I agree with the sentiment of the rule, but I feel like it leaves way too much open to a mod&#39;s discretion. What constitutes an attack, you know? A personal attack can be 100% correct and 100% relevant to a discussion. It also comes off as hypocritical in a subreddit that is all about anti-censorship and transparency. </p>

<p>Again I agree in spirit, but just don&#39;t understand why it needs to be removed. You claim in another response here that downvotes don&#39;t work. But I see it working all the time. I love to read the bottom of comment sections. I constantly see the worst kind of shit at the bottom of comment sections here, a lot of which would fall under the umbrella of Rule 10. A lot of it would also fall under Rule 1. </p>

<p>Some of the questions I&#39;ve posed here you&#39;ll never be able to satisfy with an answer. The MAIN point I&#39;m trying to make and the main problem I have with the rule is that it&#39;s people censoring information about themselves. It&#39;s you censoring an attack on you. It&#39;s a slippery slope from keeping discussion relevant and polite to keeping people from talking about you. And that&#39;s what I mean when I say you can&#39;t satisfy some questions with an answer. You can say that you and the rest of the mods would never abuse the rule, but this is a community for skeptics. I would bet big money that this rule has probably already been abused, and I would bet even bigger money that this rule WILL be abused in the future. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t moderate content except in extreme cases like the digital cartel fellow who has schizophrenia and is being toyed with like a pet monkey by reddit trolls.  We don&#39;t allow that stuff here because it is objectively wrong and constitutes a weird form of cyber bullying where a sick man who has delusions of being the messiah is being make-believe worshipped by trolls for the lulz.  Normally we simply moderate behavior to uphold a standard that seems to make this sub a better place.</p>

<p>As far as information flow, anything goes except satire, all-caps, Facebook (because of personal info ToS problems), and anti-conspiracy stuff (there is a sub for that and this isn&#39;t it). </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Sure it absolutely can be 100% correct and 100% relevant but it still does more harm than good to the prospects of having a discussion.  It doesn&#39;t matter if a user is antisemitic, anti-white, anti-black, anti-government, a liberal, a Republican, a Democrat, a libertarian or Vladimir Putin...  if they can have a discussion here without using slurs or making personal attacks then they are welcome to post here.  Trying to shut someone up because you don&#39;t like their questionable ideological beliefs isn&#39;t having a discussion, its shouting someone out of the room.   Having a conversation with someone who has bad prejudices isn&#39;t the end of the world, you might learn something that helps you understand their malfunction and they might learn something that helps them let go of their prejudice... people like that have recanted before!  But we can&#39;t do that if an army of concern trolls run the show around here.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If we didn&#39;t remove them they would dominate every comments section.  You do see down votes working some of the time, often our community handles shitty posts/comments on their own.  The mods don&#39;t really need to do much with those, its the ones that get vote brigaded from somewhere else that rise to the top and derail the discussion that we step in and remove.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are called shills and insulted all the time. There are full posts where users are called out for being supposed shills. Users who doubt any theory aside from the most asinine ones are insulted, mocked and called trolls.</p>

<p>In a recent conversation, I was called a shill multiple times simply for questioning the dodgy criteria with which users here identify shills. Why weren&#39;t those users warned or banned? If I remember correctly, I did report them.</p>

<p>The only mod action I&#39;ve seen in regards to my comments was the removal of a comment after a user called me a sociopath for having a different opinion. I was thankful for the action, but the comment was one of many (I was accused of being a shill, a pervert, a troll etc), and the user continued in their tone, unwarned.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not the only one subject to this. All you have to do is counter the accepted opinions of members here to experience it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes I ban people for calling out racists, all also ban racists for using slurs.  You probably only hear about one of those scenarios because you&#39;re personally more concerned about that side of the issue.  The racist crowd often accuse me of being a Zionist Jew for banning them when they break the rules, the SJW crowd accuses me of being a racist when I ban them for breaking the rules.  Its two sides of the same coin.  They are all breaking the rules! And I take no prisoners!</p>

<p>The two people o banned recently that got me removed were breaking the rules.  You don&#39;t go around calling people Nazis because you don&#39;t like them.  The other mods agreed with me on this and I was reinstated.  It was actually one of the subjects of the debate among the mods about my removal, those users did in fact break the rules!  </p>

<p>I never tried to do such a thing. If you read my post you would see the issue I had was that it was a blatant lie and misinterpretation of what they were doing. And I never asked for it to be removed. I addressed it in the thread. So nope, no moral authority here. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s a dedicated member of the community and a vigilant mod. Maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s abused the rule in the past or plans to abuse it in the future. </p>

<p>Point is, we should be allowed to have this discussion especially here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> without fear of having our posts removed or being banned.

The fact that we&#39;re all having this conversation should be evidence of that. Rather, it&#39;s to deter users from &quot;attacking&quot; other users, this sub, and the mods thereof.</p>

<p>Calling another person&#39;s actions or beliefs into question isn&#39;t an attack. Calling someone else a Nazi, or a troll, or a fucktard, or a shill (though that last one might not apply to me for obvious reasons), simply because you disagree with them, certainly is. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I basically said as much to you. There&#39;s no way you can satisfy all the questions, and there&#39;s no way you can prove that you never have and never will abuse the rule. Maybe that&#39;s not fair but it is what it is. That&#39;s partly why it&#39;s a bad rule. It relies on us trusting the moderators, in a community of skeptics. It also forces moderators of an anti-censorship community to censor the community. </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s exactly as it should be - when mods are doing it right, you shouldn&#39;t really notice their presence or actions.</p>

<p>For as much as this sub might get shit on by the general reddit population, it absolutely has the best mods.</p>

<p>No problem there. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when such comments get deleted and, if repeated, the user gets banned. And that happens here way more than you might realize. No mod would or should allow slanderous lies about them to remain undeleted. Nor do we allow that to happen to the regular users here if we see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FACT: This rule has been repeatedly questioned (I&#39;d guess an <em>average</em> of about once a month - considering it was questioned weekly the first few weeks) ever since it was single-handedly written and implemented without any moderator or public discussion by.... <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> - who was, at the time, constantly being criticized for being a fascist tyrant. (He had been pushing for the removal of all moderators listed above him - including <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> and 2 others, now retired.)</p>

<p>The only result of the criticisms has been the &quot;tweaks&quot; to the language. The end result is the same: <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> implemented fascism, while being a fascist tyrant.</p>

<p>Supplemental FACTS: One of the original mods (ranked only under <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> - which is a reddit-owned account, not an actual user), came out of hybernation, fired all of the mods (including <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a>), deleted these crap rules, and confronted illuminatedwax about what was happening here with a very pointed self-post about all of this. This mod was convinced to resign, and <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a> reinstated the fired mods -- with <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> at the bottom of the list. Within a matter of days (couple weeks at most), <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> had convinced all of the other mods to step out of his way while he climbed back to the top of the mod list, just under <a href="/u/illuminatedwax">/u/illuminatedwax</a>. Then, <a href="/u/9000sins">/u/9000sins</a> got busted for posting CP (which he claimed he thought was &quot;midgets&quot;)... and ... reinstated again, a few weeks later after the dust had settled - without any input from the public... and proceeded to climb up through the ranks again.</p>

<p>The identity of the mod who busted 9000sins for being a fascist tyrant and fired all the mods has been deliberately left out of this comment in order to respect his desire to never be involved in this farce of a subreddit again.</p>

<p>as I said, he came out of hybernation. his account had been idle for about 10 months when the new mods were hired and about 15 months by the time he came out of hybernation to stop 9000sins.</p>

<p>That&#39;s sort of an exaggeration since the entirety of that period of time was about 4 days - not enough time for the sub to change in any significant direction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>How is this unlike 9000sins implementation of rule 10?</p>

<p>the account age issue is not part of this discussion. changing the subject to a different rule to show how &quot;cooperative&quot; 9000sins is... is just a shameful, deceptive distraction from the facts here. </p>

<p>Flytape, I&#39;m not sure why you continue to embarrass yourself by confronting me over my knowledge of this sub. I was a mod here (and resigned because of 9000sins) LONG before you were ever even considered for the job of licking his boots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay. I feel the need to chime in here. I understand the frustration with rule 10, so I will try to explain our reasoning and why it was implemented in the first place. Believe it or not we have a serious troll problem here. Like, really really bad. This rule was implemented to in order to have a rule to point to when banning problem users. This rule has always been selectively enforced and completely at the discretion of the moderator team. It is only used in extreme cases with the most problematic users. You can call me a facist or whatever, but most of the people talking negatively about me have no idea of a what prompted the rule and don&#39;t seem to have a full understanding of the course of events that led us as a mod team to implement this rule and enforce it. Also the users saying I submitted CP, that is also incorrect. I have children myself and I would never contribute to the exploitation of a child. That shit is sick and wrong and it&#39;s also an easy way to discredit anyone. I&#39;m not claiming that my account was hacked. It wasn&#39;t. I posted the image in question. I was at my girlfriends&#39; work and one of her co-workers found the image in question ON FACEBOOK, and I personally posted it to <a href="/r/wtf">/r/wtf</a>. To me and my gf&#39;s coworkers the image was clearly an obese midget posing for a topless photo, but a few others on reddit disagreed and claimed that the image in question could have been a minor. Personally I didn&#39;t think that could possibly be the case, but in retrospect it was a mistake for me to repost that image. I only saw it once briefly before I posted it. I tried later to look at the image to see why everyone was saying it was cp, but it was gone from Facebook and from imgur. </p>

<p>After that I tried to log back in to my reddit account but it was locked. I contacted the admins, and apparently they agreed with me that the image was pretty ambiguous and that my account could be reinstated as long as I wouldn&#39;t post that kind of material any more. This eventually caused me to lose my mod spot here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and I had to convince the mod team that I was not hacked or comprised and that I am really innocent of the charges put against me. Also, to any doubters, don&#39;t you think that I would have had some kind of legal trouble if I really did what I was accused of? I would hope so. People that exploit children are the scum of the earth and that is part of why I am here as a moderator on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Now for the accusations of fascism. As many of you know I was the first of the new mod team some years ago just below donbueno and illuminatedwax. I put many, many hours of hard work and dedication to build this subreddit up into what it is today. I coded a lot of the old CSS myself and made most of the sidebar images and icons that graced this sub for a long while. I engaged the community and asked them what they wanted to see and what kind of changes they wanted. This sub was my baby for many years. When donbueno stepped in and removed the whole mod team it was because we decided that we were tired of being trolled by one day old accounts so we used automod to remove posts from users less than 3 days old. He thought this was going too far and instead of a discussion he simply removed the entire mod team. This person may have had  a hand in the beginning of this sub, but he hasn&#39;t been active here for you way longer than I have been a mod here. He never talked to us or did any kind of moderation here at all. This was his one and only action for the entire 4 years I have been here. He was subsequently removed and the entire mod team was reinstated by illuminatedwax. </p>

<p>After the incident with my account getting banned and being reinstated my name slipped down to almost the bottom of the mod list. I no longer have much authority here, and this was probably by design. I am dangerous to those who wish to silence us. I have since taken a back seat to the other moderators here and let them handle most of what happens here. I have 3 kids to take care of every day so almost all of my spare time these days is spent relaxing or playing video games. Hell I don&#39;t even have time to record music anymore. I used to pump out 20-50 songs a year, but recently that number has dropped to maybe 1-3 a year. I do plan to someday make a comeback here when my baby is a bit more grown and I have some more free time. But for now I am the farthest thing from a fascist. I have been taking a hands off approach for about a year now. I almost expected a wave of changes here after a while but it never happened. The current mod team is great and they do an awesome job of maintaining the sub and managing the community. You guys have excelled and I couldn&#39;t be more proud of what I have done and we have accomplished together. I wish I had more time and energy to give you.  </p>

<p>I love all of you. Even those of you that hate me. </p>

<p>If you want to sit here and make the case that there aren&#39;t real users out there that wish to see the sub subverted entirely, make your case.</p>

<p>The way I see it, someone has to take out the willfully disruptive users. </p>

<p>Hang around here long enough and you&#39;ll find the same accounts month after month playing &quot;babe in the woods.&quot; </p>

<p>Forum manipulation is real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really the most...I want to say &quot;ironic&quot; thing about this sub. The mods and power users claim this is a thinking ground for top minds and whatever, but then thinking outside the hivemind results in ridicule, vote-brigades, bans, etc. And of course pointing this out never does anything, as the users have no say over what the mods do. So the power trips shall continue unabated :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take the current stickied post as an example. It&#39;s a post asking for nominations for best all-time content. Two or three users took the opportunity to start bashing the mod team and it ended up with several pages of completely off-topic personal attacks and arguing about the mods. It got to the point that one had to scroll though page after page of crap to get to the actual links people were nominating. That&#39;s a huge distraction for readers and a turn-off for any new subscribers. So, all of those comments were removed.</p>

<p>When you click on a link about a certain topic, do you want to see pages and pages of off-topic arguing about what users or mods are good or bad? Or would you rather read about the topic at hand?</p>

<p>That is some best-of-all-time <em>content.</em> Its content shows how this sub, along with most other important subs, are being white washed by those with the power to do so.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t willing to adhere to your own goalposts this conversation is meaningless.</p>

<p>If certain moderators are in the running for <em>best all-time content</em>, as deemed worthy by users of the sub, I see no problem letting the users choose (with the up vote / down vote buttons ) which content is worthy of <em>best all-time content</em>.</p>

<p>I mean, it was addressed to the users, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No matter how hard you try, you won&#39;t succeed in your attempt to conflate personal attacks against mods with actual &quot;content&quot;. </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t even understand why some people are so vehemently against posting actual content, following the rules, and commenting civilly (that&#39;s not to say you personally haven&#39;t been civil here, only that some aren&#39;t). On the other hand, I do know that the majority of people that do that are here to do their best to destroy this sub (again, not referring to you). You&#39;d be amazed at how many times we&#39;ve received such threats through modmail. One person even claims to have a &quot;thousand&quot; alt accounts already set up. I know of at least a dozen of those accounts that have been banned here and shadowbanned. It&#39;s a never ending battle.</p>

<p>No problem there. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when such comments get deleted and, if repeated, the user gets banned. And that happens here way more than you might realize. No mod would or should allow slanderous lies about them to remain undeleted. Nor do we allow that to happen to the regular users here if we see it.</p>
