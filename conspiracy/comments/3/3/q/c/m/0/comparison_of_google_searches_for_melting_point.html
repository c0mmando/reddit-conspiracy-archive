       Google offers the temperature of burning jet fuel in Fahrenheit (1500Â°F) &amp; the melting point of steel in Celsius (1510 degrees C) making them look like nearly the same temperature. Perhaps is algorithmic coincidence... but it sure seems funny to me. Thought others on this sub might be intrigued.

       I believe that the code it uses to display those results pulls data and text from the top "hit" in each search. Google is simply reproducing other people's data, neither blurb was written by them.

       It just plain didn't get hot enough to even weaken steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone on the other side debating me here last week,  claimed that high winds made the kerosene burn at it's hottest because of the height of the holes in the buildings and the high winds there.
      </p>
      <p>
       To prove that was not happening, I showed a recording of Fire Chief Orio Palmer talking on his radio from the 78th floor of the south tower and thereby proved that  there was not enough high temperature in the air to keep Chief Palmer from speaking  at length and that there was no wind noise on his radio transmission that would indicate that there was air rushing into the building to feed the 'steel weakening' fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       There exists even stronger proof that there was no steel weakening heat in the South Tower, where Edna Cintron stood in the hole, the air inlet, of the North Tower proving that the frame of the building was not hot enough to keep her from wrapping her arms around it and most importantly that there was no steel weakening, wind forced, kerosene or furnishing fire in the north tower because her position was where the air would have to be sucked into the building and yet her very long hair was NOT blowing in that allegedly rushing air.
      </p>

       Links for each segment of this comment are  available but I'm in danger of overposting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit, Ok I guess I need to prove what I say again. Here are links.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orio Palmer describe conditions on the 78th floor of the south tower.

       Edna Cintron stands in the air inlet   holding  on to the weakened  frame of the  north tower.

      <p>
       Her very long hair is NOT blowing and she is holding on to the frame of the building.

       Here is expert testimony as to how hot it might be possible to heat the frame of a single floor under perfect conditions where no fuel burned outside and the air flow was perfect.

      <p>
       The only possible conclusion unless you are under psychological conditioning is that the anomalous heat  seen in the debris piles was generated by the demolition of the building
      </p>
      <p>
       The debris consisted of shrapnel made by explosives NOT layers (pancakes) made by a gravity collapse

       it's a psychological response caused by the teachings of Edward Bernays who taught that all that's needed to get the public to adamantly defend whatever story is wanted is to have 'experts' repeat  their propaganda idea in the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the majority of the public the steel in all 110 stories of the two towers   suddenly had no power to support weight whatsoever and collapsed because it became weakened in temperatures that would just barely cook a pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the population will defend to the death any idea the government floats through this method. I forgive them but they are exasperating.

       Nonsense. You picked few examples from your conspiratard media  and now you are parroting that thinking that you are some amazingly smart fighter for truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might surprise you, but I actually don't claim that the official story is correct. I don't even care too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I critically look at the official explanation, I too can find lots of holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, unlike you, I can apply the same critical evaluation to various alternative theories as well. And when I do, I see even more holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       To your main point - you are arguing that there was no air current that would fuel the fire in the elevator shaft. Well, answer to that is something that everybody with the basic knowledge of physics could answer. Or anybody who spent more than 5 minutes studying fire fighting fundamentals. Or anybody who is honestly trying to find an answer and is not being an intentionally thick conspiratard.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, when a fire burns in elevator shafts, or any other vertical spaces, the air is being brought to the fire through convection. Heated air raises and is being replaced by oxygen-rich colder air that fuels the fire. So the air circulation went up and down through the elevator shaft up to the point of impact where the elevator shaft was breached. There was no need for any of your witnesses to feel a breeze or heat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, read up on the fire fighting fundamentals and on convection:

       Air was not sucking in through the lobbies as shown in video's from there. The people who were in the towers were in the towers not in someones imagination. Air was not sucking in through the holes. There was no superheated fire in the elevator shafts . The elevators were working at least to the 41st floor right up to the  within 15 minutes of the collapse of at leas in  the south tower.

       <p>
        'About 14 or 15 minutes before the south tower collapsed, a group of people who had survived the plane's impact began their descent from the 78th floor. As they departed, Chief Palmer sent word to Chief Edward Geraghty that a group of 10 people, with a number of injuries, were heading to an elevator on the 41st floor. That elevator was the only one working after the plane hit"

       I'm quite familiar with the fundamentals of convection thank you but you are mistaken.
Your 'air going up and down ' in the elevator shafts is inaccurate because  once the air was used for burning ( kerosene after an hour?) the oxygen is depleted and fresh air is needed to replace the depleted oxygen source. Neither was air rushing in through the lobbies as seen in the video's from there. All in all you and others who only think about official explanations are far more interested in attacking me than in actual evidence about what actually happened rather than in a theory based on what they think was invisibly happening.

       You are obviously not getting the fundamentals of convection if you think that the air would have had to rush through the lobbies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't explain it any simpler - because of convection the oxygen rich air would be coming from the top. Not the lobby. Top.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, not all elevators were working up to the collapse. You are now making shit up.

       OK So lets go with it came from the top. The doors to the roof tops were both weather tight and locked. How much air do you suppose came in through them?
      </p>
      <p>
       At least one elevator worked right up to the collapse as you would have heard if you had the courage to listen to the audio recording of the fireman who became trapped as the building began to move

       Sure. Some out of 106 elevators worked. Have you ever looked at WTC floor plan and how many elevators and elevator shafts were there? Based on your statement, you obviously didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your other point is nonsense again. Why are you talking about roof tops? At floor 80 or 81, fuselage of the plane has breached some of the elevator shafts. That's how the fuel got in. And that's where all the air required for fueling fires could have come in.

       Your idea is nothing but an idea. With your comments you proved that you never really researched any of this. You adopted some semi-baked idea you found on the Internet and then you started parroting it. Lucky for you, nobody else will read this thread, so you can continue disingenuously repeating it on the Internet and basking in the admiration of other "free thinkers" that refuse to actually think.

       You started with "there was no air coming to the fire". I demonstrated that your research is faulty because there is a very simple explanation about how air could have come to the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you switched to "there was no steel weakening" and you claim it without any evidence for it. Based on your track record in research and critical thinking, I think I'll remain skeptical of your statements.

       I have no clue what really happened. I don't claim bush administration narrative is the correct one. There might as well be a conspiracy.

       All I'm saying is that conspiracy theorist need to do a better job in proving it, because so far the official narrative with all its gaps still explains the events much better than all the other ideas being spewed on this forum.

      <p>
       I don't want to convince you that a conspiracy didn't happen. I want to encourage you to be a bit more critical of everything - not just the official narrative, but also of every conspiratard youtube video and writing.

       You are making very definitive statements, but you don't have any more evidence than me. Your claim is that there no air. You can't definitely claim that without evaluating every possible scenario and proving that they didn't happen.

       I obviously have sound information or you wouldn't have to keep changing your argument.
The frame was cool enough to touch. The air was cool enough to breathe. There was no visible inward air flow . The smoke drifted too slowly for a high wind situation. The air should have followed the direction of least resistance. There was no air coming in from the 'top' what you have is all invisible .

       What frame was cool enough to touch? Somebody touched "frames" of all elevator shafts?

       Inward flow would have happened on the floor 80 or 81 where the fuselage breached the elevator shaft. Unfortunately, there wouldn't be any witnesses for that.

       There doesn't need to be high wind outside of the building for my theory to work.

You just might be right! 9/11 really happened, but then the establishment and big corporations keep introducing doubt to it, sending "experts" that can prove that 9/11 was a conspiracy, all in order to incite a revolution that would give them an excuse to get rid of their enemies and make them some money.
