<p>Becoming corporations would bring equality to the US system in that regard. Resolving disparity in letter should be the least that the US Government could do.</p>

<p>Is the US Government following its founding documents?</p>

<p>Should people become corporations? Would that do anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to undo what has been done through legalese I might add, is to have a constitutional convention and remove the 14th amendment. It is the vehicle of our enslavement. You are correct 100% after five years of toiling about to understand why the government could so easily thumb their nose at the constitution I had to know how, why, and when this happened. I have satisfied my urge to understand fully what happened. It was hidden in the legal wording of an amendment that if you demanded it be removed, you would be labeled racist, because that amendment supposedly freed the slaves, but it did not. The slaves just had new owners and everyone born afterwards would be a slave as well. 
State and federal citizenship for all persons regardless of race both born or naturalized in the United States was reaffirmed.
No state would be allowed to abridge the &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; of citizens.
No person was allowed to be deprived of life, liberty,or property without &quot;due process of law.&quot;
No person could be denied &quot;equal protection of the laws.  The key words here is when the US citizen was created, the federal government took their god given rights away and replaced them with privileges handed out or taken away at any moment it wishes. It wasn&#39;t until they killed civics classes in public schools do they start to slowly let the public in on this secret. By now most Americans could give two shits about their rights. I will provide you with several links that may guide you to this conclusio n as well. I have shown my evidence to a law professor and a corporate lawyer, both of which have said my knowledge is perfectly acurate, and agree that it would be the only reason for how the government has been able to sidestepped that parchment.  <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c-W5fGCAzOkhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=97wfeFPXuZE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c-W5fGCAzOkhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=97wfeFPXuZE</a> <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JnRJ8R7ccy8https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wp-48d_jSb4https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6P318bELif8">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JnRJ8R7ccy8https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wp-48d_jSb4https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6P318bELif8</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are indeed keen to observe the implicative side of the ammendment 14, by granting some things they imply a limitation to those things, and then the government builds around that malformation.</p>

<p>Most people see one thing and nature proves reality.</p>

<p>You can resolve 14 in any way repealing, adding an ammendment, etc. People would feel more comfortable keeping 14 yet fixing further by adding a new ammendment. </p>
