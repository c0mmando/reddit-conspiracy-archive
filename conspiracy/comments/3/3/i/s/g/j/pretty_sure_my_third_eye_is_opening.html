       Sometimes my perception will get
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       clear. I'm able to see/feel/intuit the interconnectedness of everything without thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I was just watching an Eminem concert video on youtube. I perceived that most of the crowd was voluntarily enslaving themselves to 'Em. They were in awe of his superior awareness/talent, literally bowed down, and fed him energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is television. Sometimes I watch television and it will look blatantly artificial, crude, and weaponized. Kind of like I'm watching Soviet or North Korean propaganda or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this sounds insane, but the all seeing eye symbol is starting to make a lot of sense to me. The matrix is 100% real. Also, I expect some will accuse me of being egotistical for this post. This isn't meant to be about me; I'm curious to hear if other people have had similar experiences, or if any one had more information about the third eye/spiritual awakenings in general. Thanks guys!

       Exactly this. I'm honestly starting to wonder how deep the rabbit hole goes; everything seems to be manipulated by those at higher awareness.

       Seems reasonable enough... considering... but how can I possibly confirm this information?

       Why are
       <em>
        you

       so convinced by it? Seems like there are tons of other plausible theories as well.

       NO i think its people with lower forms of awareness that are trying to keep the game going. to vibrate at a higher awareness you have to leave behind lower vibratory thoughts and actions.

       Agreed. Everything in the media seems transparently manipulated and manipulative. But I think it's just becoming more obvious overall, and more people are seeing through it. That's why they're gravitating to places like this and why TPTB are having to push back so hard on social media, blogs and Reddit-type spots

       I've developed the ability to improvise music though multitrack recording of straight improv over a 1 hour session. I use an approach that is like Douglas Adams flying, throw yourself at the ground and miss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I play anything until it settles into something, then when I add each successive instrument on a new track (playing off of what's there, so far), it settles in closer to a composition. It goes drums, keys, bass, guitar, all improv, one take. Then I chop it up to sub sections where something good happened, and I end up with a CD that I play in my car.
      </p>
      <p>
       The music comes from nowhere, (third eye?) and I just witness / transmit it. I am barely, if at all, involved in thinking.  Different versions of songs and themes reoccur across albums, and I can recognize things like different leads from artists that have influenced me, but, I wasn't thinking to play it, consciously, and usually don't recognize whose "ghost" it is, until replay.
      </p>
      <p>
       It plays best when driving or concentrating, so that it is experienced peripherally. It is best when it takes you somewhere and you didn't even realize you were listening to music; what you're doing is just happening with the music.  Some songs take a minute or two to get to any sensible point and define themselves as a song.  Earlier on, I kept that in as part of the story of the song, later sessions, I chop it out, to make it more listenable for normal people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people would not get the esoteric nature of the thing, so it's not easily listenable.  I love to listen to the stuff. When I get bored I make a new one, but it's always kind of scary because I never know what might happen.

       I suppose you could call it a third eye, metaphorically speaking.

       Its a product of 'waking up' that you see things for what they really are. Nothing magical or mysterious about it.

       I see like this all the time, man this is the post I've been looking for, the energy feeding the cultists knew about how "energy" works it's kind of like giving your attention to something, well that's just an example, them knowing that you're giving that to them gives them power, man I wish I knew how to explain this to where everyone could get it. The government isn't stupid like everyone thinks they are, they do this shit on purpose, but everyone's like kind of defending them without even knowing it which is where the "matrix effect" comes from, they're like oh no they could never do that, well they are and they know what they're doing and they don't give a shit about anyone. It's really crazy out there and reality is looking stranger than fiction nowadays, but this post gave me some hope for something, I just don't know what that something is yet. Over the millennia there have been people contacted from "extraterrestrial beings" and just worship them as "God's" simply because they can do things that we cannot, I wish I could go into more detail but I'm afraid most people wouldn't understand, but with all this collective data it just makes sense to me.

       No offense, but I don't think your pineal gland is open.  What you are experiencing is an awareness to the larger reality or as you stated the matrix, stimulated by critical thinking and observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nikola Tesla could hold visions in his mind which led to many of his inventions, see colors that others could not see, and search his dreams for technical answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Walter Russell while on his walk exploring nature, as he did everyday, was struck with foresight, a lucid dream lasting 2 days, where he saw the inner workings of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edgar Cayce, the most famous American psychic, gave many accurate readings while in self-hypnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rudolf Steiner gave many lectures on a large number of subjects, he believed his insight came from the  spiritual world that is accessible to pure thought only through the highest faculties of mental knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Charles Steinmetz, a great mathematician and mystic said the following-- "Spiritual power is a force which history clearly teaches has been the greatest force in the development of men. Ye. we have been merely playing with it and never have really studied it as we have the physical forces. Some day people will learn that material things do not bring happiness, and are of little use in making people creative and powerful. Then the scientists of the world will turn their laboratories over to the study of spiritual forces which have hardly been scratched".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people I stated here were considered mystics, and I could continue sighting examples, but I'm sure you see my point.  You may be more aware, but your third eye is not open or you would be experiencing similar behaviors like the true mystics I listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again no offense, but only those who have dedicated themselves and their minds for the better of mankind become enlightened mystics, meaning their pineal gland and chakras are opened with a balance of love and knowledge.  This usually requires a lot of deep emotional/philosophical thought, coupled with a good educated mind steeped in the quadrivium.  All the great mystics I've read about seem to have this in common, except for an occasional few.

       None taken. This is the kind of reply I was looking for. I'm going to read up on some of the mystics you mentioned. I agree I have a long way to go, just I've had some glimpses 'behind the veil' and it's really cool.

       It's a good emotion to experience, and we all have the ability!
      </p>
      <p>
       You may want to look into the Theosophical movement in the late 1800's, which coupled spiritual knowledge along with scientific understanding-- "Science and Mysticism".  They do not hold the key to ultimate knowledge an understanding, you already have all that you seek, but it needs your maturity and growth before you can unlock it, which can happen at any stage in ones life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe however, the movement itself manifested a few talented individuals, such as Jiddu krishnamurti, who had a deep understanding of emotional thought.  Theosophists from that period, were also very involved with scientific studies, writing books such as occult chemistry, or like Rudolf Steiner's book titled Agriculture.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I stated early, no offense to you because I myself do not have a full understanding of the pineal gland and its potential. But I've been researching these thoughts for several years now, and I've experienced a few enlightening glimpses 'Behind the Veil' as well.

       Yahweh gave Henery Clifford Kinley a vision and a revelation of the purpose and plan of all. Actually he would be the 7th trumpet. The book is everything explained. He did write a condenced version at first i believe it was between 25-70 pages. The words in it had to be defined and flthose defined in that a university professor said it would take him years to digest and get through just half of it. He then rewrote it into the 300pg one. Heres a small exerpt This book, entitled "ELOHIM THE ARCHETYPE (ORIGINAL) PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE ", is written and composed of the Volumes entitled, "ELOHIM THE ARCHETYPE PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE", "THE MYSTERY OF YAHWEH", "THE MYSTERY OF INIQUITY", AND "THE MARK OF THE BEAST", "THE MISSION OF JOHN THE BAPTIST AND YAHSHUA, THE MESSIAH", AND "WHOSE BUILDER AND MAKER IS ELOHIM".  It is the First and probably the Last Manuscript that I will write in my Lifetime, as pertaining to ELOHIM and to HIS ULTIMATE PURPOSE, which has functioned down through the PAST and the PRESENT Dispensations and Ages. The Sum Total of these Written Volumes expresses my True Understanding of the True Inspired Writings of Moses and the Prophets in reference to ELOHIM, THE TRUE "SON OF YAHWEH" and Satan, or THE ANTI-MESSIAH, THE TRUE "SON OF PERDITION".  Yet, this Understanding is NOT of my own, for in the year 1930, I, Henry C.  Kinley, was caused to BEHOLD A GREAT PANORAMIC VISION, and in the same day, Friday at 9 o'clock of the morning of June 6, I also in turn received a DIVINE REVELATION of the SPIRITUAL MEANING OF THE VISION.  It is this PANORAMIC VISION AND PANORAMIC REVELATION of the DIVINE PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE, given to me by YAHWEH, which I have expounded upon, through Charts and Writings to my associates which in turn, has qualified them to detect, identify, and to prove the Existence of YAHWEH ELOHIM, THE MYSTERY OF INIQUITY AND THE MARK OF THE BEAST. This GREAT and POWERFULLY PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE REVEALED YAHWEH ELOHIM to me for the FIRST time in my Life, REVEALED HIM AS HE REALLY EXISTS:  AS THE ONE AND ONLY UNIVERSAL SPIRIT and ARCHETYPAL PATTERN OF THE UNIVERSE.  In Presenting and Explaining this Stupendous "VISION AND REVELATION" to you, the Reader, I presume that YOU are honest, sincere, and earnest in YOUR extensive and intensified search for the TRUE ELOHIM OF THE UNIVERSE.  I further assume that you, like millions of other human beings throughout the world, TRULY want to KNOW YAHWEH AS HE REALLY "IS" or as HE ACTUALLY "EXISTS".  My ONLY Purpose in writing this Book is to try to help YOU Find and Know YAHWEH for YOUR OWN PERSONAL SATISFACTION AND CONSOLATION. "    Thats a pretty good summary if you ask me.
