       Conspiracy theorists have been mocked for so long its time for us to stand up and assert our victories. Conspiracy theorists and critical thinkers are winning in the formation of their world view but not in their public relations. To remedy this here I propose one of the mods create a "The Conspiracy Theorists were right!" or perhaps "Conspiracy Deniers are fools!" post and sticky it to the top of this sub permanently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure there are crazies in this sub who do imagine things too far out. But given the amount of lies and corruption that has come out it is relatively much more reasonable to err on the side of the conspiracy theory! So it is among those who never visit
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       where most of the fools/crazies reside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet still, conspiracy theorists are mocked with abandon even today despite all of the evidence that we have consistently been more right, more often, on the most important topics! We need to push our own PR and stand proud on being conspiracy theorists. So this sticky post should include a collection of the best "We told you so" conspiracy facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF! Just look at the basic list I've started below and its just so far in favor of our world view that corruption is pervasive and criminals are conspiring everywhere to capture governments and corporations. Its absolutely ridiculous in these times that anyone dare mocks all conspiracy theories without applying their own critical thinking and investigation! So lets go after these "conspiracy deniers" and turn the tables!

        http://www.ae911truth.org/

       I agree its a great idea that we should use the side bar. But if we are to raise the status of the "conspiracy theory" label we need to be extremely conservative. Although
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org">
        www.ae911truth.org
       </a>
       is brilliant it is not respected among those who we need to win over. Since there is a plethora of of material amongst their sources that vindicates conspiracy theories, we need only stick to them for the main PR thrust. So we only need use their own sources against them.

       Any mistake they make now is amplified through the power of the internet. Most people are aware of the term false flag and why they're beneficial to governments.

       Yes we are winning in the formation of our world views. Now is the time to consolidate this momentum for our PR particularly to combat the negative label of "Conspiracy Theory". We need to win back respect for this label so that it can no longer be used as a pejorative. We sticky a post that raises the "Conspiracy Theory" label (with extremely conservative sources) to a higher level of respect. Perhaps calling conspiracy deniers fools is too much but at least we can ask them: "Really your a Conspiracy Denier even after all that's happened?"

       Smuggling and brokering tea was big business, making certain Americans rather wealthy. When the Tea Act opened up America to the East India company for legal sale of tea it threatened the huge business done by the smugglers and brokers. The tax itself was the wedge used by moneyed interests to sell the revolution to the public; what it really was about was ensuring that competition from the East India company wouldn't cut into the huge profits of the brokers and smugglers, who backed the revolution.

       Being right is not a victory. 'Twould be better if we were all wrong and the only thing that wasn't sunshine and roses was what lurked in our imaginations.

       No one is mocked for planning how to survive a zombie apocalypse. It's seen as an entertaining thought exercise. If only they were all like this, eh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, mocking people who don't agree with you isn't encouraging critical thinking, it's encouraging group think. People who don't believe in conspiracy theories aren't our enemies - if they don't believe in them, it's unlikely that they're conspiring. They're just people like you and me, there's no reason to call someone a fool for believing/not believing a particular thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       We want people to come to their own conclusions, not be mocked or bullied into agreement, eh? If we all try our best to provide what we think is the truth, even if we're wrong, we'll eventually get there, won't we?

       I agree with your sentiments and I don't think we should mock people. My "Conspiracy Deniers are fools" comment was a bit too much. But we need to stand up for the "Conspiracy Theory" label and defend it so that it is respected rather than used freely as a pejorative.

       This is a good idea, however if I may add one suggestion.  Whatever things we sticky, we must be EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE in choosing.  A post like this would be aimed at the most hard core skeptics, and a post of ONLY reputable sources and 100% verified facts would go much farther than a ton of info, some of which could be denied if shown to a big enough skeptic.

       Absolutely! That's a major point I am making. We don't need controversial sources. We can raise the PR status of conspiracy theorists by using "EXTREMELY CONSERVATIVE" facts and sources.

       I understand that but we need to undo the damage caused by the tainting of "conspiracy theorists" with negativity. I think perhaps calling people fools IS over shooting but we should at least be able to question: "Seriously, you are a Conspiracy Denier?" as a retort. This turns the tables on the "Conspiracy Theorist" label.

       That's a choice that you have and I respect that, but personally I would prefer not to use the same weapon that they have used against us. If we darken the line between us, we will only make it harder for people to cross.

       I like the idea of taking back the term "conspiracy theorist," but I don't think mocking people whom might not be on board is the right move. So "Conspiracy Theorists Were Right!" gets my vote.

       Phrase needs to be more catchy. The term 'conspiracy theorist' isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a superbly easy rebuttal to the phrase:
      </p>
      <p>
       "a broken clock is right twice a day"
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't boast victory about correct claims or predictions when there's posts here making wrong predictions or claims about
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       that happens.
