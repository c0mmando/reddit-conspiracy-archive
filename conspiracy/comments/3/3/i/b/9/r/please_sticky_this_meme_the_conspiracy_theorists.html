        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Please sticky this meme or something similar: &quot;The Conspiracy Theorists were right again! Conspiracy Deniers were wrong. Again.&quot; </p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists have been mocked for so long its time for us to stand up and assert our victories. Conspiracy theorists and critical thinkers are winning in the formation of their world view but not in their public relations. To remedy this here I propose one of the mods create a &quot;The Conspiracy Theorists were right!&quot; or perhaps &quot;Conspiracy Deniers are fools!&quot; post and sticky it to the top of this sub permanently. </p>

<p>Sure there are crazies in this sub who do imagine things too far out. But given the amount of lies and corruption that has come out it is relatively much more reasonable to err on the side of the conspiracy theory! So it is among those who never visit <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where most of the fools/crazies reside.</p>

<p>Yet still, conspiracy theorists are mocked with abandon even today despite all of the evidence that we have consistently been more right, more often, on the most important topics! We need to push our own PR and stand proud on being conspiracy theorists. So this sticky post should include a collection of the best &quot;We told you so&quot; conspiracy facts. </p>

<p>WTF! Just look at the basic list I&#39;ve started below and its just so far in favor of our world view that corruption is pervasive and criminals are conspiring everywhere to capture governments and corporations. Its absolutely ridiculous in these times that anyone dare mocks all conspiracy theories without applying their own critical thinking and investigation! So lets go after these &quot;conspiracy deniers&quot; and turn the tables!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree its a great idea that we should use the side bar. But if we are to raise the status of the &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; label we need to be extremely conservative. Although <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org">www.ae911truth.org</a> is brilliant it is not respected among those who we need to win over. Since there is a plethora of of material amongst their sources that vindicates conspiracy theories, we need only stick to them for the main PR thrust. So we only need use their own sources against them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we are winning in the formation of our world views. Now is the time to consolidate this momentum for our PR particularly to combat the negative label of &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot;. We need to win back respect for this label so that it can no longer be used as a pejorative. We sticky a post that raises the &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; label (with extremely conservative sources) to a higher level of respect. Perhaps calling conspiracy deniers fools is too much but at least we can ask them: &quot;Really your a Conspiracy Denier even after all that&#39;s happened?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smuggling and brokering tea was big business, making certain Americans rather wealthy. When the Tea Act opened up America to the East India company for legal sale of tea it threatened the huge business done by the smugglers and brokers. The tax itself was the wedge used by moneyed interests to sell the revolution to the public; what it really was about was ensuring that competition from the East India company wouldn&#39;t cut into the huge profits of the brokers and smugglers, who backed the revolution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being right is not a victory. &#39;Twould be better if we were all wrong and the only thing that wasn&#39;t sunshine and roses was what lurked in our imaginations.</p>

<p>No one is mocked for planning how to survive a zombie apocalypse. It&#39;s seen as an entertaining thought exercise. If only they were all like this, eh?</p>

<p>Also, mocking people who don&#39;t agree with you isn&#39;t encouraging critical thinking, it&#39;s encouraging group think. People who don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories aren&#39;t our enemies - if they don&#39;t believe in them, it&#39;s unlikely that they&#39;re conspiring. They&#39;re just people like you and me, there&#39;s no reason to call someone a fool for believing/not believing a particular thing.</p>

<p>We want people to come to their own conclusions, not be mocked or bullied into agreement, eh? If we all try our best to provide what we think is the truth, even if we&#39;re wrong, we&#39;ll eventually get there, won&#39;t we?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Phrase needs to be more catchy. The term &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; isn&#39;t. </p>
