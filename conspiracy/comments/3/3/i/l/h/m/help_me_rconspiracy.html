       I am a 18 yr old male heading to Hillsdale College this fall for a poli-econ degree. For years now I've known our country is nothing like it appears to be. Naturally, some interesting conversations have happened with my financially top 1% parents (not top .01%, please don't hurt me). While I have done my best to have every belief I hold grounded in facts and reason, I am typically laughed off as just a kid who doesn't know what I'm talking about. As my parents are people who would continue to support trickle down economics, how the hell do I get them to see reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: So should I stop trying to convince them, and keep trying to better my own knowledge?

       You probably can't.

       One thing you could do is ask them what they would do if all of a sudden their businesses became 10% more profitable. What percentage of that 10% would they share with their employees?

       If the answer is none or small, I might even say that if it's half or less, that proves that trickle-down doesn't work (though their cognitive dissonance won't let them believe that's what it means).

       Some would say the economy would work better if that 10% were invested in new technologies.  Just giving away money isn't the answer.

       You're always going to be their child.  I imagine words will fall short for a few more decades if not forever, and you're going to have to live your ideology and accomplish relevant things before they bat an eyelash.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've got to understand that they think you're naive and you probably are...even if you're right about this whole "systems of oppression" bag.  They think as soon as you start to suffer you're going to recant. It's the usual pattern, likely what they and their peers went through, and they're waiting for you to fall in line in your own good natural time.  Not following suit is a great place to start.

       If they are willing to learn then have them watch you tube videos. They are much aligned by the conspiritards because they work. Limit your discussion to one small but convincing topic and see if you can turn their understanding on that .

       try a conspiracy into your fathers line of work or major interest.  If he is a history buff he may be more open to the old conspiracies and that will lead to more openness in the long run.
 Above all , if he doesn't want to talk to you about your interest or about his interest that coincide with your interest, then he may just not be interested .

       My best advice is to become more comfortable with the idea of tough love. It isn't your job to educate and take care of your parents. You also have to be honest about their intentions in life; it's possible that they are purposefully choosing to remain ignorant and have been for some time. One of the hardest parts of swallowing the 'red pill', in my opinion, is that it forces you to look at family members objectively. Once you're there, though, then you can
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       begin helping them by setting a good example and being strong. We're all connected, so if you start balling out it will rub off on them and they will intuitively start to pick up on the truth.
      </p>

       18 is an exciting age. It's hard, but you need to start real boundaries with the parents and become a man. Good luck!

       I would advise to stop trying to convince them nor make them "see reason". It's their reality, not yours. I think the best you can do if point out that, maybe, the means are in contradiction with the end and let them work it out on their own, if they are so inclined.
      </p>
      <p>
       The contradiction may lie with the fact that the country (that is nothing like it appears to be --your words) pretends to be all about life, liberty, and property. It is in order to secure those self-evident things that a government was instituted in the first place. Meanwhile, that same government is now threatening to take away, or actively taking away, the same things it was instituted to protect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end being securing those rights. The means are to threaten or take away those same rights. The means are in contradiction with the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       That sais, I think you would do well to realize, understand and accept that you don't know everything. I used to know everything as well; I was also 18 years old once. ;) True knowledge and reason can start once you have accepted the fact you know nothing. Nothing at all, really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, about that ~trickle down~ thing; I would recommend you read an essay by Frederic Bastiat called "What is seen and what is not seen". Readily available online. Altho it does not directly address trickle down economics, it does contain quite a few important points to think about. You will definitely be better off having read and understood it than without.
      </p>

       Best fortune to you, my friend.

       You can't.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can say things that might lead them to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if they mention 911 respond with something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well I wouldn't believe it was a set up unless I found out something ridiculous like the CIA created al qaeda."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then just leave it, there is a chance that later they will discover that indeed al qaeda was created by the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try this technique on various subjects. Don't get involved in arguments, just try to lead them to the truth.

       You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink. It's a tough pill to swallow and it annoys all of us from time to time, but it's the truth.

       As far as expanding your own knowledge, listen to Bill Cooper's
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYGFfvhnV2k&amp;amp;list=PLF05201F9DA35C234&amp;amp;index=1">
        Mystery Babylon
       </a>
       series, all 43 hours of it, then go out and verify for yourself what he is saying. As Bill always said, you should listen to everyone, read everything, and believe nothing unless you can prove it in your own research.

       You have a tough row to hoe there; why would someone exchange lies that work in their favor for truths that don't. The richer they are, the harder they fall.

       I mean, they are probably just stunned by what they see as ingratitude. Who knows what they went through to get you where you are. Just try to make sure you separate your disillusionment with government from your feelings towards your parents. I mean, in all seriousness they are probably just going to think you're attacking them even if you're not. I don't know if that helps.
