       So I don't believe that 9/11 was perpetrated by the US government, chemtrails are poisonous, vaccines cause autism, and fluoride in water is a attempt to mind control and is the result of medical experiment on the population. I just want to have a

       <strong>
        proved

       So it's OK if the government does something illegal and harmful to a small subset of the population because it's just a small subset of the population?

       If it is for the greater good for the world as a whole, then I am fine. If the government has to say, experiment on 100 people to figure out the AIDS vaccine, would you be calling your government immoral?

       If it did so without informing those 100 people what would happen and giving them the option to opt out, damn straight that's immoral.

       Let's say that your kid (or you) goes to school and buy a school lunch. 5% of those lunches are tainted with cesium 137. Nobody told anyone about this, mind you, because it's a "double blind" study or some such bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say your kid (or you) got the tainted food and died after a few weeks of agony. Then when that death occurred, the CDC came around to collect the corpse.

       You good with that?

       Of course not. Its personal. If i tell you 100 kids from across the 50 states got given Cesium 137 and you don't know who they are, and are for say a new cancer treatment. I go real low, by saying this, but most likely 70% of the population will be okay with that. 13,397,159 people living with all cancer sites in the United States. People have donated millions to find a cure.

       No its not okay to harm people randomly without consent. But ever since say the 1980s human experimentation without consent has been mostly abolished in every first world country. If the government asked me to help them and they gave me a list of side effects and didn't like them, then I would decline. yes it unethical, but when in recent years has this been preformed?

       At least as recently as

       This guy is not worth our time. I doubt he's real. He's either VERY uninformed or a flat out shill.  A lot of energy wasted on this thread, IMHO.

       That link is political scandals. They are minor compared to the things the government does.  The governments job is not getting interfering with it. it would be corrupt if the government instead only employed by say Republican Anti-gays who only work for the farmers of America (I love my damn milk) and do not care for the opinions of the nation.

      <p>
       It's government agencies selling guns and drugs back and forth with Mexican cartels. It's insider info trading with other government agencies to affect law passage. It's gaming the tax system to literally steal money from poor people. It's getting government funding for lavish corporate retreats. It's taking bribes to vote on the passage of a bill or a court ruling. It's falsifying petitions to elect members of Congress. It's torturing and killing people with absolutely zero oversight, and lying about it under oath with absolutely zero consequences. It's twisting and fucking the letter of the law into irrelevance. It's tax fraud it's campaign fraud it's lying under oath it's corruption. Through and through. How can you not see that?

       People like you make it hard to have absolutely any optimism about anything anymore.

       Again, there's a major difference between having a difference of opinion and being objectively wrong. No one is burning you at the stake, but right here, right now you yourself are choosing to remain ignorant.

       Thanks for speaking for the sub. If I was wasting your time why are you still commenting? I am assuming you want me to agree with you and say i am a troll. And I guess 65 people don't care, as they commented looking for an answer.

       And I know how the hell wikipedia works. Im not going through the whole page to pick out which is info is from who. You specifically linked wikipedia, and saying

       gave me the examples.

       Okay. Thanks for speaking for my attitude. I guess being nice is not the right thing to do around you, and anyone who you perceive incorrect is not someone who should live on and be happy. If I to have my opinion and don't admit I am wrong. I fucking said I hope you have a good life. But nope, I am a closed minded asshole who doesn't want to be proven wrong.

       I never said anything like that you shouldn't be happy. You're still denying what are literal facts. I gave you a list with hundreds of examples, if you have any counter evidence that the government is not corrupt I would love to see it, but until then you're just blowing smoke out your ass.

       This is absolutely a batshit insane twist of "logic"

       The scandals are the government. That's the government in action. These are government officials, government agencies, federally appointed judges. These are scandals about laws being passed, voting manipulation, bribery, and manipulation of the actions of our government. You can't separate the two and pretend like all these scandals are just whatever and don't/haven't had any relation to our government.

       This is why nothing will ever change. This is exactly why it's so easy for people to manipulate, extort and control other people. So long as you have your cash and mcdonalds and netflix you couldn't be dicked to do or think about anything else.

       Do you understand that most everything you see on TV is controlled propaganda? Not just the news, but drama, sitcoms, sports, etc. Once you realize this, a whole lot will fall into place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start paying attention and you'll notice the inconsistencies. Stories change day to day without notice. It's pretty bad. For example look how many times Russia has "invaded" Ukraine and look at the evidence presented -- keeping in mind we have satellites that can read the numbers off a penny.

       I'm sure there are better-developed arguments than mine, but just off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sports serve as a proxy conflict. It gives soft, sedentary folks a reason to feel they're involved in some greater battle -- while doing
         <strong>
          nothing
         </strong>
         themselves.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They chew up an awful lot of mental bandwidth. To really get into, say, American football, you have to not only learn the rules, but you have to learn all the teams, their strategies/tactics, the important players and coaches, the history... Then you gotta spend all your spare time watching the damn games... It's so much crap to fill your head, there's no space for, say, current events in Ukraine.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They're an easy way to emotionally manipulate mass numbers of people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They slip in straight up military propaganda ("We want to thank all of our armed service members both here and abroad..." while FA-17s fly overhead...) and domestic propaganda ("On this anniversary of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, we want to remember...") here and there. It just helps complete the propaganda veil.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>

       Maybe somebody will have a book recommendation if you want more in-depth info.

       If you find a website saying A is true you will assume A is untrue unless the website has some magical authority given to it by.... What exactly? Double blind peer reviewed placebo controlled studies? Because those don't exist if you want to debate vaccines or most things really. And even when they do, there still is no assurance of validity.

         There were no "major" fires. Worse fires have engulfed other skyscrapers which did not collapse.

       The one you listed I know of is JFK and Mk-ULTRA. The president was shot by one man, and the evidence to support it overwhelms the weak evidence of government assassination. And I think MK-ULTRA was torture or something? I don't really know much about the topic, can you remind me?

       The JFK single shooter theory doesn't work because JFK was hit with two different bullets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The supposed "magic bullet" that would have been fired from Oswald's Carcano carbine is a big, very heavy, 6.5mm solid round. These rounds do what it says in the report, they stay in mostly one piece all together, they penetrate cleanly and exit cleanly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The round that blew apart JFK's head was not one of these rounds. They found several hundred tiny fragments of a bullet in his head. It hit, and fragmented violently. This is really obvious basic ballistic facts.

If current laws generally remained in place, federal debt held by the public would decline slightly relative to GDP over the next several years, CBO projects. After that, however, growing deficits would ultimately push debt back above its current high level. CBO projects that federal debt held by the public would reach 100 percent of GDP in 2038, 25 years from now, even without accounting for the harmful effects that growing debt would have on the economy (see the figure below). Moreover, debt would be on an upward path relative to the size of the economy, a trend that could not be sustained indefinitely.

       What people admitted to lying, the millions? People wanted it because of Al-Queda and terrorist groups. Also, that poll reflects peoples views

       Bush, Cheney, Powell, Rice, the CIA, etc. I linked one of Bush admitting he lied. Millions of Americans were lied to about al Qaeda and terrorist groups. Al Qaeda did not exist in Iraq in a significant way until after the US invasion.

       Just watch building 7 at ground zero fall. All three buildings collapse at approximately free fall speed. Never in history has a metal framed structure collapsed let alone three separate buildings! George Bushes bother controlled security at the world Trade Center what a coincidence. Controlled demolition is irrefutable and examples of this occurring can be seen in pictures of the ruble taken the following days after the event took place. You can clearly see markings identical to controlled demolition in the aftermath of 911. Military grade Nano Thermite was also found in dust samples from the ruble. I suggest you read declassified documents Operation north woods pure proof that our government plans terrorist attacks. False flags terrorism is a tool of the elite to control the masses please wake up to this fact immediately so we can protect ourselves from the enemy within. A very good documentary on youtube is JFK To 911 Everythings A Rich Man's Trick. By the way if the government can pull off 911 then you better bet they do much worse than that.

       All it takes is a smart mind and some research on war and the military industrial complex and mk ultra , cia manipulating the news. All the propaganda to make people think a certain way. The amount of horrible things we do in and for war. Who we actually help and why and what regime changes we are apart of. The homeland security painting patriots as terrorist or extremist all the HIDDEN stuff they do without talking about why. Such as all the round of ammo they bought. Them painting veterans as a big issue because they won't let their constitution be abolished. The patriot act , the complete lack of respect for its people and our constitution and the big effort to completely change it and try to bring in a totalitarian world leader by force and trickery. I can keep on going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't even think of the last thing the government did that is actually good. Besides welfare.they are a criminal organization with the means and power to brain wash people into thinking its normal to give up your authority to ANYONE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best part about all this. Is I KNOW I'm right unless I'm a skitzo and completely crazy I know what is morally good and what is bad. I don't need anyone to agree with me for me to know when wrong is being done.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your not a troll. I seriously hope you look up and research enough things with a open mind. You will find your golden egg that will be your (ah-ha)moment. And you will be amazed how you didn't see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you best of luck. Sorry I couldn't write a more legible response. I'm on my phone. If you truly want to be shown maybe not the whole truth but at least not lies. It's there. And it's waiting. You have to be in the right place in mind for everything to click I feel as its such a different base of what you have been programmed to think since birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was lucky in a way and was a out cast and never did good in school and never listened. This has helped me not be as programmed as a lot of people and allowed me to see through the systems walls for what they truly are. I never was a part of the mainstream society so I didn't have to break out of much programming at all.i feel for older people ESP it's really hard because they grew up with a much different belief and it's not easy to counter act the brain when it tries to keep its current paradigm
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way someone who is actually seeing these things for what they truly are and without any United States of America brainwashing and not see that the government is corrupt is if they are of the those people who is either Brainwashed and or is all for this world domination wartime military police state get them other people because we're better type of mind state.

       First of all, you should refrain from lumping us into one big group.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'd say pretty much everyone here agrees 9/11 could absolutely not be carried out without inside help and there are hundreds of 'small' pieces of evidence which support this, most of us dont think vaccines cause autism, most of us dont believe in chemtrails, and while we dont want mass medication of the population via the water supply that doesnt mean we think fluoride is for 'mind control'.
