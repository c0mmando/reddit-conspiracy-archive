       Fuck knows; we've been thrown a curve ball with more than the main three parties in the debates; I just hope people realize that the Greens, SNP and Plaid Cymru would be epic in power together. The Welsh need to entirely elect Plaid Cymru the Scots the SNP and then England just needs to remove it's head from its arse and realize old parties are the true wasted votes. I'm not ruling Cameron having a second term out though; you saw the Scottish referendum fuck ups here so I kind of expect the same shit to happen again.

       A mildly xenophobic distraction from the truth. Not that i dont understand the reasoning behind choosing to vote for them; i am just fully aware of the larger picture and it would look a whole lot better with a coalition government between these parties. I also think these three wonderful women would make a fantastic team to lead our country.

       Should we say it's democratic, when videos of the vote counting displays it may have been rigged? Not sure if you remember the footage posted here when it happened.
      </p>

       As I said England needs to realize the old parties are non progressive parties which are the true wasted votes.

       That's the greatest scandal about our 'representative democracy', it doesn't exist; especially in the uk, who gave the common man the vote again? Oh yeah it was the 1%, the only way they would even allow us it is if it was rigged from the word go

       If you believe in a fair and equal society they aren't the way to go otherwise medicinal users of cannabis wouldn't be persecuted for choosing what they ingest to treat their condition. Not fair, not just, not warranted and the age old idea it's to pretect our children; how well has that worked out? It's easier to pick up these days than it is to buy fags and a pint. How many

       because of where it lies on the periodic table it means it has a lower boiling point; flourine is an extreme electrophile and more dangerous than chlorine when it comes to causing cancer, a small quantity of alcohol would be a whole lot more healthy for all of us including our children.

       Right... So what evidence of it being a carcinogen do you have?

       Also leaving it to evaporate surely wouldn't work. It is in solution and you might evaporate some of it (not that there is a lot of it in any case) but you will also evaporate water.

       where it lies on the periodic table along with all the other electrophiles; it actually will rip off an electron from any molecule it can to fill its out shell of electrons so there are 8 instead of 7, bacially the reverse of putting lithium or potassium in water where the atoms rid themselves of the outermost electron because there is only one electron in the outer shell. Atoms like having a full or half full outer shell; preferably half and then like gold and platinum will be unreactive but still subject to the natural radioactive decay (platinum turns into gold if you didn't know) if you want more information read up on valancy and electrophiles
      </p>
      <p>
       fluorine is dissolved in the water just like CO2 in coke it will boil off; its just not so lively as coke because there is less fluorine ppm than there is CO2 in coke. the boiling point for flourine is -188.1 °C, so yeah it will evaporate a whole lot easier than water which boils at 100°C

       Radioactivity is not required for cancer, any molecule or element with an empty spot in any outer shell will bond with another molecule or element; in this case they can bond with DNA altering the molecule and therefore corrupting the DNA strand, if it happens too many times to the same stand in the right places then you get the tumourous cancer we all know.

       I have to admit something, I was partially wrong by saying platinum will turn into gold; it will with fusion but not radioactive decay, gold will turn into platinum however if it loses a proton: ie fission. Platinum itself is called a noble metal due to its atomic stability although it can undergo alpha decay where it emits alpha radiation.

       If you believe in a fair and equal society they aren't the way to go otherwise medicinal users of cannabis wouldn't be persecuted for choosing what they ingest to treat their condition. Not fair, not just, not warranted and the age old idea it's to pretect our children; how well has that worked out? It's easier to pick up these days than it is to buy fags and a pint. How many
       <del>
        more
       </del>
       (you can only die from a cannabis overdose by consuming 15 lbs in 15 mins) children die every year from alcohol? a government controlled substance; a drink we only traditionally consumed because we knew we wouldn't die from drinking it (would much rather have alcohol in my water than fluoride though)
