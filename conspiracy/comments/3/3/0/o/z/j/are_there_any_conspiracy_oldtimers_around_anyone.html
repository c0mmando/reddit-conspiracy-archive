       George HW was 'just' an anonymous VP to us. Kissinger once told: "a father had two sons. One went to sea, the other became vice president. Of neither one was ever heard again"

       UFO and Bermuda triangle was VERY hot in the 70's because of (mainly) two influential authors: Charles Berlitz and Erich von DÃ¤niken. That inspired wave after wave of conspiracy/ufo/CIA etc. books.

       European union was European Community in my youth. North American union is unknown here to this day.

       The murder of Presidential candidate Robert Kennedy.
After JFK, after dr. King, this senseless murder became the Trifecta of despondence for many people around the world. It wa SO the END of an era where still everything was possible and we had to wait for two generations to get some of that hope back...
To get a real close feel for this you could listen to this mix by Tom Clay - What The World Needs Now

       I still can't listen to the end where Edward K. speeches:
"Some men see things as they are, and say 'WHY?'
My brother saw thing that never were and said 'why not?' "
without tears in my eyes 
(I'm 54 and live in Holland)).

       Personally I became interested conspiracy stuff in the 80s because of the sixties assassinations and the CIA. I knew about MKULTRA earlier than a lot of people because my university was a major site of MKUTRA research not to mention CIA weapons development.
I developed a big interest in researchers from the sixties who published in underground papers and magazines like Paul Krassner's The Realist, Ramparts, The East Village Other and many others. They are still very readable and depressingly relevant and I encourage anyone to seek them out especially since a lot of these publications are reappearing on the web in digitized form.
Mae Brussell's radio show was great. Still worth listening to and every bit as controversial as it was thirty or forty years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for UFO stuff, as far as I remember, there was a shift in the 90s to that being about abductions and government intrigue. Into the 80s, although people started to talk about Roswell and Area 51, UFOs were still largely considered benign.
No one cared about Bush pere when he was VP, but everyone started talking about the New World Order as soon as he became Prez. I still don't think people have ever focused anywhere near enough on his tenure at the CIA. He oversaw a transition to electronic warfare/surveillance which defines our current world.
Then of course there was a huge amount of focus in the 80s on satanic cults in the aftermath of the son of Sam and Jonestown.

       George Bush as the VP was pretty quiet, later to find out he had his hands all over the Iran Contra scandel, but during the time it was a parade of generals testifing including Ollie North all with the same answer, "I refuse to answer on the grounds it might incriminate me"
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that he was known or thought of as the Whimp president. Little did we know then what a demon he was.

      <p>
       Other than some tv specials every now and then, UFO's weren't that big as far as I remember,
      </p>
      <p>
       The event that made me think twice was the Iran Contra.  That was the main pre 90 scandal I remember.  Even then the media didn't delve to far into it.  The internet has really opened information to flow out uncrontrolled opposed to the carefully scripted news from the MSM

       I'm 40, so in 1990 I was 15, but my dad was steeped in conspiracy theories for most of his life. He was a Vietnam Vet who was raised in extreme poverty, then was drafted, and came back from his experiences radicalized. He became a active anti-war activist, marched with the Black panthers in shutting down Yale University for a day in 1970, and held on to his views long, long after the 60s were over. He kept a large library of books about the CIA, Vietnam, the JFK assassination, the MLK assassination, other nefarious conspiracy theory-type stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       In those days, the JFK assassination was still THEE big "conspiracy theory." The 80s was a rich and fertile time for books, documentaries, etc. on the JFK assassination. It seemed like every couple months there were revelations about the incident that were coming out - i remember in 1988, when there was a memo someone found that implicated then-president-to-be G.H.W. Bush as a CIA agent who needed to be briefed on Lee Harvey Oswald. I remember seeing "60 minutes" segments about Warren Commission skeptics who weren't being ridiculed for their beliefs - they were given a lot of air time and a lot of credence and the media presented their stories with a minimum of condescension.
      </p>
      <p>
       That changed after Oliver Stone's "JFK" film. For a little while, after the release of that film in late 1991/early 1992, there were a whole GLUT of articles in the press and in the media about the assassination and its various theories, but there was also a lot of pushback. There were vicious editorials and op-ed pieces in Newsweek and other outlets condemning the film and blanket-condeming the idea of conspiracy theories in general. About a year later, Gerald Posner's "Case Closed" came out and Posner became the media's fair-haired boy on the JFK killing because he "bravely" (their words) went against the tide and proclaimed that there was no conspiracy. The waters have been muddy in this area ever since - before Possner's book, it seemed like there might be some movement toward disclosing all the gov't's info on the JFK killing, but since then, it's been a lot easier to lump JFK assassination conspiracy researchers in with Bigfoot believers and UFO cultists and chemtrail believers and the more "out there" of the woo-woos on the conspiracy fringe. I can't help but feel like this shift was intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of UFOs, my brother was a subscriber to MUFON and pre-internet, much of the conspiracy community involved in UFO research communicated via small-press magazines and self-published zines and pamphlets. Most of the books that existed were either of the sleazy, cheapo paperback variety and contained sensationalistic bullshit and hype; or they were stright up debunkings a la Philip Klass. The "Roswell" mythology got its start with the publication of Moore/Berlitz's "The Roswell incident" in 1980 (?), but it didn't really pick up steam until the end of the 80s, when there was an "Unsolved Mysteries" segment about the incident. If you asked someone in 1987 about "roswell," they'd have no idea what you were talking about unless you were a serious UFO dude. After that, Roswell seemed to attain legend status.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, I think that the conspiracy research community owes a great debt to the show "Unsolved Mysteries" for covering these kinds of topics in the mainstream, and with a modicum of seriousness when no one else would. They tackled a whole bunch of "conspiracy" themed stories and brought them to the attention of the masses, like the Rendalsham Forest incident and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other side, the 80s was also the era of "Satanic Panic." It seemed like every few months there was a daycare center being investigated for child molestation accusations, or some teenage metalhead was killing himself because of Satan, or Dungeons and Dragons was going to turn your kid into a Satan-worshipper. It was a kind of absurd time. We didn't have access to snopes or any of the debunking sites, nor did we have access to conspiracy websites or InfoWars or any of that stuff. So everything sort of existed in this queasy sea of "Do we know? Can we be sure? How do we get proof?" Everything was a rumor or an urban legend and no one could locate the source of a lot of the conspiracy stories you'd hear.|
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, in 1988, all of a sudden you were hearing a lot of conspiracy theories about how Elvis Presley faked his own death and was still alive. People
       <em>
        really believed that bullshit
       </em>
       . It seemed as plausible as anything else, and it was kind of fun to speculate, so why not? No one was making any kind of effort to establish the credibility of many of these kinds of rumors or urban legends, they were just running with them because it was kind of fun and scary, i guess. It was just a MUCH different time.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Never heard of "al-Queda" until about 1999-2000 or so. In the 80s we worried about Russia. Ever seen "The Day After?" Yeah. That's what we were all afraid of - and for good reason. Regan was war-mongering tough guy dickhead who kept ramping up our nuclear arsenal. People loved the guy, but he was an evil son of a bitch. We were not afraid of terrorism. A 9/11 style attack was just not on our radars back then. It just didn't seem like a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - the Iran-Contra "scandal." On its face, it was obvious that the gov't was lying and knew that the intellgence community was trading arms for hostages and delivering and selling drugs around the world and domestically - but because Oliver North was so damned handsome and charismatic and he was the center of those trials (whcih were broadcast EVERT DAY on at least ONE of the three big TV networks), everyone involved got off easy. It should have been Watergate, part 2, and it should have brought down the existing powers that be, but the public were
       <em>
        charmed
       </em>
       by north instead. It was a shameful time, and this in particular stood out for me as evidence that people will willingly bury their heads in the sand and only hear what they want to hear when presented with unpleasant truths. Frankly, the 80s kinda sucked.
      </p>
      <p>
       "European Union?" Hadn't heard of it until the early 2000s, again. None of this stuff was a "thing" until very recently. Pre-1990 we were still re-hashing the mistakes and the shadowy corners of the past (which is why there were so many Vietnam-themed films and TV shows and why the JFK assassination was such a hot topic). We were still dealing with the fallout and backlash that follwed Watergate and the Church and Pike Committees. European unification seemed like a distant possibility but not realistic. The fall of the Berlin Wall changed a lot of that, but that was really just a brief spasm of optimism circa 1991-1992. That was an interesting few years there; however, things seemed to lurch back in the other direction once Newt Gingrich took over the House in 1994. This followed Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc. Then all of a sudden there were a whole bunch of silly and time-wasting conspiracies on the right centered on the Clintons and the ATF and Whitewater, etc. which were obvious bullshit - but it seemed to seasoned observers that what was happening was that the mainstream right wing was co-opting the language of political paranoia that had been pretty much the sole province of the American Left since the JFK assassination. Like I said, the waters have been pretty muddy ever since then.

       The fact that North is not only walking around free, but hosting news programs... Makes me feel despair sometimes.

       First, I wasn't sure if you were being literal with "locked up".  Second, and don't say anything to doxx yourself, I was wondering what behaviours you exhibited for which they would lock you up.  I imagine that they couldn't do it for discussing such matters unless someone was acting a bit too, please don't take this the wrong way, passionate about it.  I get how upsetting much of it is.

       I didn't really look into this stuff until the mid '90s, but I can give a little historical background on 2 points:
      </p>
      <p>
       The oldest forerunners of the EU were the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community from 1951 based on limited trade integration (a big aim of the ECSC was to balance the respective coal and iron access of France and Germany which had precipitated many invasions as lots of both are required for steel and hence warfare).  There was incremental progress afterwards and the term European Union was adopted in 1993 in the Treaty of Maastricht, though the term was undoubtedly bandied about some years before '93.  (I took a class on this stuff once).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term al Qaeda was actually formalized by the FBI who had heard it used referring to a database of people rather than a coherent organization in intercepted transmissions.  They presented it in the prosecution of the 1993 WTC bombing so that they could use the provisions of the Riot and Corruption Act (RICO) to charge them as members of a criminal syndicate.  Thus the name would have gained limited popular use in '94 but probably gained a lot more public awareness after the USS Cole and Tanzanian embassy bombings in 2000.

       UFOS:
 i remember hearing about the Betty/Barney Hill incident (1961), because of my age i didn't know about MJ12 then,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCVsPlRKgTc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCVsPlRKgTc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       so the idea of something from another planet was really intriguing to people. the book was a best seller, i read it, later, we subscribed to a sci-fi magazine called
       <em>
        Omni
       </em>
       1978, that had a lot of info,
      </p>
      <p>
       "Omni was founded by Kathy Keeton and her long-time collaborator and future husband
       <em>
        Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse magazine
       </em>
       .[6] The initial concept came from Keeton, who wanted a magazine "that explored all realms of science and the paranormal, that delved into all corners of the unknown and projected some of those discoveries into fiction."

      <p>
       i read about the NYC UFO abduction in Omni, i guess because i lived in a family that were constant readers (metaphysics, esoteric, &amp; Stephen King fans, as well), there were often discussions about UFO's.
      </p>
      <p>
       wasn't aware of the EU until much later, probably in the late 90's, as it was mentioned more in the news,
      </p>
      <p>
       knowledge of the North American Union, which i really didn't pay attention to until i started hearing about trade agreements, even after reading various different subjects i was still "plugged into" MSM, wasn't aware of tv being used as mind control,
      </p>
      <p>
       "NEW YORK â It was in last yearâs State of the Union address that President Obama announced an ambitious trade agreement negotiated behind closed doors with North American and Pacific Rim nations â the Trans-Pacific Partnership â that drew little attention."

      <p>
       "On January 2, 1988, leaders of the United States and Canada met to sign the first major agreement in decades designed to comprehensively lower trade barriers between the two countries. Since the 1850s, American and Canadian politicians had striven to lower or eliminate trade barriers between the two countries, with uneven success; the first such agreement, the Elgin-Marcy Treaty of 1854, was torpedoed by the United States only 12 years later in retaliation for British support of the Confederacy during the Civil War, and successive efforts over the years at eliminating various protectionist policies inevitably fell prey to cries of protectionism or favoritism on one side or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       But 1988âs Free Trade Agreement (FTA) would be different, leaders in both countries assured their respective citizenries. This time around, trade barriers would be lowered across the board, and protective tariffs and other barriers become a thing of the past. Moreover, Americans and Canadians received glib assurances that the agreement would in nowise jeopardize the sovereignty or independence of either country."

       not until Bush 1 &amp; 2 became POTUS that i started to research online &amp;
       <em>
        wake up
       </em>
       , of course i always believed that JFK's assassination was planned (i was a child when that happened), many people thought so, but no one really fought to get to the truth at that time, family &amp; friends always talked about the mess politicians made,
      </p>
      <p>
       al-Qaeda (&amp; bin Laden) became news "worthy" in the Bush administration &amp; i will always associate them with Bush 2 &amp; 9/11,
      </p>
      <p>
       the final wake up call came when Bush 2 was POTUS, at least that was when i realized the bs was deep, i began reading alternative news, reading more online, actually seeing how truths were being distorted, 
imo, the internet was the catalyst to change.

       i don't think i'd ever heard the term 'al-Qaeda' until after 9/11 when the media went apeshit. that's always been something that bothered me because in discussions in the 1990s i don't believe we ever really used it

       Shortly Before February 1996: 
Michael Scheuer is running the Islamic Extremist Branch of the CIAâs Counterterrorist Center at the time and had suggested creating a station to focus just on bin Laden. The new unit, commonly called Alec Station, begins operations in February 1996. The 9/11 Commission will later comment that Scheuer had already ânoticed a recent stream of reports about bin Laden and something called al-Qaeda.â [9/11 COMMISSION, 7/24/2004, PP. 109

       double agent Ali Mohamed revealed the name (al kaÃ­da) to the FBI in 1993. The term will first be used by the media in August 1996.

       My experience of Bush was that the media was saying above all else that he had excellent foreign policey decissions but sucked at domestoc issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first I heard of All Quaeda was after the 911 episode.  I would probaly guess they were meantioned earlier but they werre more of a foot note than real events.   From shock of two buildings collapsing we all wondered 'who' these people were.  We all learned as much as possible and it all came from the news media and government.  There was a strong sense of wanting retaliation .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the UFO there was a lot of people who believed there was a big cover up.  Since that time, I suppose if people were like me,  they began to question if it wasn't more of a deversion to hide something even greater,  after awhile we couldn't tell what was a real event and what event was created by our own government just to discredit the truth by making sighting outrageous.   With me, I backed away from it all and figured if aliens were here I say welcome.  (they haven't hurt us yet :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of what me and my friends thought about in conspiracies was JFK, his brother, Martin Luther King deaths and the space moon walk being a pissible hoax.  And of course Aliens.

       do you have any decent sources for info/background/history of these types of group?  i guess i always knew these types of groups existed but i never paid much thought to them, but a quick google search and wiki read through has me interested in learning a bit more.

       I was advised around that time that there would be an attack on domestic airliners involving shortbladed weapons for the purpose of taking over the aircraft and using it for a suicide mission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was further advised to fly wearing full-grain leather and to carry thick magazines that could be used to shield my forearms under the leather.

      <p>
       Anyone with a similar background is likely to recognize that advice.

       Inappropriate is a more apt description. I was given the opportunity to get into that whole thing and chose against it. It would be inappropriate for me to speak much about it.

       The major narratives that we circulate to control the population have both villains and heroes. If you find the heroes and get any of them to talk, you'll find that 911 was surprising only in that it took so long.

       Mid 80s with Reagan all one heard was how the enemy was communism and the USSR. Once communism fell there was a brief lull where the USA had to look for a new enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       90's was the rise of the "terrorist", culminating with the twin towers downfall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like "terrorists" are the perfect enemy, a phantom who can never be caught (and in most instances does not exist), and a ready excuse to invade countless countries which have resources the USA craves.

       I found ''None Dare Call It Treason'' in 1984, at 20 years of age.
       <br/>
       I poked around after that somewhat. Then I met a very well researched conspiracy buff in 1986 who seriously clued me in.

       The formation of the UN is a great learning area.

       My experiences are pretty similar to those of what others have posted. My perception was that Bush was the mold of Reagan: pitched as this sort of protector of American values or a call-back to romanticized perception of the 50s. However, people seemed much more aware of the activities of the CIA. As others have mentioned, the JFK assassination was a huge point of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       UFOs were also a point of discussion. While I had read books, Unsolved Mysteries really fueled my fascination in UFOs or its legitimacy. I do think we have returned to a period of skepticism. I think this is partially related to the UFO community being so insular...that made it difficult for it to mature or be passed on to the "next generation". In general, people have just bought into the idea that UFOs are laughable or have been explained away.

       So far as the EU, I heard about them during the same time as they became news. I recall some concerns about globalization being raised, particularly when things like NAFTA were becoming news. Al-Qaeda I also heard about when they became mainstream news. Of course, the whole funding of the mujahideen in Afghanistan was known (I don't recall if commonly discussed though) but the need to confront the Russians was also much more dominate...what 'terrorism' has become now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest pre-1990 event for me was also Iran Contra. Watching North testify, and the multitude of discussions that flowed from the details coming about, really unveiled that shadowy underbelly. It seemed like, and this might be rosy-reflection, within personal discussions these topics just came up more often. It seems rarer for people to broach these subjects now...a sort of fatigue.
