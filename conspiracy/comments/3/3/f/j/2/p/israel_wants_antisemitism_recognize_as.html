       Attorney Alan Baker, Israel's former ambassador to Canada and a legal adviser to the Foreign Ministry wants antisemitism to be treated as an international crime. In a new Israeli initiative, Baker is proposing that international courts be used to combat global hate crimes against Jews. Baker has drafted an international convention calling on the "Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Antisemitism." The Convention, which is drafted in the manner of classical international anti-terrorism treaties and those for other crimes, will allow countries to cooperate and exchange information with others, in order to extradite those suspected of acts that meet the definition of antisemitismâ€¦

       Israel wants international law when it suits their interests, doesnt want international law when it doesnt suit their interests.

       Yeah, that's a nice way of seeing it. When they comply with international law, then they can make recommendation for new international laws. Shouldn't take too long... they have what, 122 UN regulations they need to action?

       Does this whole anti-anti-semitism include protecting Arabs, Assyrians and Arameans too?

       Might as well call it anti-Jewish or Anti-Zionist (there is a difference) than making a blanket term specific to one group.

       I would hate any group of people that dominate through media manipulation, infiltrate &amp; control other sovereign governments, steal land, kill their neighbors  and make it a crime to criticize the said group.  Jews as a whole are ok, but fuck these Zionist scum. Fuck the people that allow these Zionist pigs to speak on their behalf.

       If you're ever in doubt as to who rules over you, just ask yourself who you are not allowed to criticize. Jewish people have disproportionate ownership of finance and the media, where our time and effort and our perceptions of reality are managed. Why? Why can't I even ask why without being called a nutcase antisemite? Why does this group have a country formed by an ongoing land theft called zionism? Why does this country have so much influence over our presidents and representatives via AIPAC? How come they get away with things that other countries could not? Stealing nuclear material? No problem. Bombing our Navy? Whoops! Just ignore the people on the boat, they lie when they say that it appeared intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that Jews run the world. I think the psychopaths that do run the world find great utility in using Jews as a buffer for criticism, a scapegoat, one that can be easily defended by mentioning the Holocaust or antisemitism. Honestly, I think the vast majority of Jews has been wronged by these men from families with familiar names that instantly, predictably, elicit ridicule. It's all just part of their strategy of obfuscation of accountability and responsibility for their own power. It works well. They get us to manage each other to keep us away from their self-interests.

       i think a lot of PWO camps that were very poorly supplied in the last month of the war happened, but as far as the official 6 million jews being exterminated story, the more you research the more it smell like a huge crock of horse shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       did a lot of people die in the work camps? sure but a large amount of the blame for that is due to the allies wiping out supply lines to them. German people were eating horses why would any one expect the POW's to be fat and healthy when they rolled up to the fucking gates?
      </p>

       what makes more sense a sinister plot of which no evidence or documents have ever been found, to start a world war just to wipe out all the jews for what exact reason?

       that a bunch of prisoners who spent months/years in forced labor camps due to not supporting the current government embellished their stories to make sure their captors were demonized and hung for it after they had been freed?

       But "it" is not an
       <em>
        it
       </em>
       -- the "holocaust" is a whole collection of separate events that took place during the years of WW2 that affected the Jews of Europe. The events were selected after the fact, gathered together, and labeled "T-H-E Holocaust" by the Jews, for their own purposes. Many of those events are fictional. Many are distorted or exaggerated. There is no "it" to the Holocaust. The Holocaust is a network of mythology, partly based on truth, partly based on lies.
