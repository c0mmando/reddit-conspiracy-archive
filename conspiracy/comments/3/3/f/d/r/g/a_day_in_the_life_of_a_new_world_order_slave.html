Drugs treat Disease and make you better.
Vaccines prevent Disease.
Humans are Animals and there is No God, or Sin.
War, Drone strikes and Abortion is Not Murder, just getting rid of a problem.
&quot;Food&quot; is what you buy and eat from a Restaruant, Grocery Store or vending machine.

    <div class="md"><p>I am with you man really I am. Thing is that our society is way to tipped so others will never enjoy life. Living and surviving is really different. Some just can&#39;t live. </p>

<p>Its a fucking shame too. Their are kids out there that are fed fast food all the time cause their parents are just unable to do better. Its not us within the sub that are worried about it. We are worried about it for others. </p>

<p>I know I am anyways. Not saying you should or shouldn&#39;t just that you should realize what you said and how fucked up it really was.</p>

<p>Now if you still don&#39;t give a fuck then that&#39;s fine. You are probably in the wrong sub. </p>

<p><em>lights open to a pale MAN sitting at a computer.  His clothes are bland, art on the walls are meaningless forms.  Everything is organized according to size.</em></p>

<p>MAN: <em>speaks while typing</em>  Oh, I LOVE that!  Yes!  You are so right.  If you were here right now, I&#39;d so hug you!&quot;</p>

<p><em>door suddenly opens and a man enters dressed the same as MAN is pushing in boxes on a cart.  MAN sits rigid and emotionless while man carries out his duties filling MAN&#39;s shelves with food.  One man leaves, MAN continues his conversion with his computer...</em></p>

<p>MAN:  You&#39;re so right, we really need to get together.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe the most important piece of this is &quot;humans are animals and there is no God, or sin.&quot; This is the ultimate goal of the NWO. It has been the plan for thousands of years. I think the time is now that the Evil in this world has come to the pinnacle of it&#39;s power and is out to destroy our Souls, which will continue on into eternity!! You can kill my body, but you can&#39;t take my Soul unless I willfully relinquish it to the Powers of Evil. Keep the Faith!! </p>

I do think very soon we will all witness a supernatural/enlightening event that will help to confirm the real presence of God. It will be so impressive that we will not be able to explain or justify the event. Just keep your mind open to the possibility that anything is possible!!</p>

It only matter in meta data for population. Or out of the ordinary behaviour. Which in any case is always a balancing act between whats right whats needed and who gets to make thise choices. </p>

<p>Its all scary and controlling big brother ish if highlighted that way. But then again propaganda of any kind is always written from a single point 9 view and agenda. Exactly what I try to avoid, and everyone should just have all information not what who and when wants you to have. May it be &#39;them&#39; or &#39;us&#39;</p>
