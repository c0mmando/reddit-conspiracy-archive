<p>There&#39;s a growing list of massive censorship surrounding the topic of vaccination. I noticed months ago that <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2umzpl/the_rall_front_page_is_covered_with_vaccine/">the dialog was a false divide between &quot;all vaccines&quot; and &quot;no vaccines&quot;</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32tyjn/the_mods_at_rmedicine_shadowdeleted_my/">The mods at /r/medicine shadow-deleted my meta-research post about legitimate issues with vaccines, claiming it was based on a personal agenda. Meanwhile their frontpage had a doctor trying to raise political support for SB 277 to make vaccinations mandatory for school-children in California.</a>. They made sure to tell me I had mental health issues before banning me completely.</p>

<p><a href="/r/AskScience">/r/AskScience</a> shadow-deleted my <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/32uxnx/can_someone_explain_why_each_of_these_10_facts/">10 researched facts</a> when I asked for legitimate opinions. They have refused to provide a reason for the deletion.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/32p9bz/searching_for_the_truth_about_vaccines/">10 facts on /r/conspiracy</a>, where the post received gold.</p>

<p>So far two accounts made specifically to follow me and argue this topic, <a href="/u/Antivaccination">/u/Antivaccination</a> and <a href="/u/PlaceboReponse">/u/PlaceboReponse</a>, have been deleted. If you&#39;re bored you can follow the history of my arguments about this topic in the past few weeks and see a graveyard of deleted comments.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let anyone tell you what to think. If you&#39;re new to this subject, please watch watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLrqmvjrIjI&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLgH2vCx5TOgX5upobA1NO--PyE60CLlVa">lecture from a doctor on their personal experiences with how vaccines interacted with their specialty</a>.

<p>Vaccines are amazing medicine.  Smallpox was quickly eradicated thanks to <del>Pasteur</del> Jenner.  I just don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s all changed so much since I was a child.  It&#39;s not like you go to an internist and they&#39;re pushing vaccines on adults.  &quot;Looks like you were born in 19XX, so I wanted to let you know that there have been two new vaccines introduced since you went through the schedule, one for X and one for Y.  X has an incidence of about #%, while Y is fairly communicable despite being rare.  I recommend you get Y if you ____, and X as a matter of general health.&quot;  I hope there are doctors like this, but I haven&#39;t met one or heard an anecdote describing one.</p>

<p>Do you even hear yourself?  This is a nonsense term.  What kind of moron would &quot;deny&quot; that the climate changes?  The climate is changing, has always changed, and always will change - this is obvious.  So &quot;climate change denialism&quot; is a meaningless propaganda term and you should probably stop using it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also funny how it&#39;s become &quot;climate change&quot; in recent years - guess &quot;global warming&quot; was starting to lose traction after two decades of failed models.</p>

<p>Nope. The reason the term climate change is used, is that the Earth isn&#39;t just getting warmer. The oceans are getting more acidic, weather patterns will change, more droughts, extreme weather, etc. In fact, the term climate change has always been more popular in the scientific literature, all the way back into the 1970s. <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-change-global-warming.htm">Source.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course &quot;climate change&quot; is more common.  As I explained, it&#39;s obvious that the climate has always been changing - so I&#39;m sure that term is more popular even further back than the 70&#39;s.  But as you&#39;re no doubt aware, the &quot;global warming&quot; meme was everywhere when it came onto the scene a few decades ago.  It&#39;s only in the last couple years that the term has switched back to &quot;climate change&quot;, which is unfalsifiable and misleading because, again, the climate is and has always been changing.</p>

<p>Because when people like you say &quot;climate change&quot;, you&#39;re referring to &quot;man-made climate change&quot; aka what used to be called global warming.  Since the climate is and always will change regardless of what humans do or do not do, the term is unfalsifiable and misleading.</p>

<p>This is anti-logic.  The burden of proof lies on those making the claim.  So if the claim is that humans are the main cause of changes in climate, that claim needs to be proven.  The huge majority of the models created over the last few decades regarding this subject have been wildly inaccurate.  The IPCC has been caught manipulating their data multiple times.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right that the burden of proof lies with those making the claim. And scientists have provided a mountain of evidence that humans are changing the climate. Since that evidence has been provided, its you to deniers to come up with evidence in support of their hypothesis.</p>

<p>This shows that you have a misunderstanding as to what climate is. What you described is weather, the change on a day to day basis in a specific location on the planet. Climate is the average over decades all over the planet. So it actually isn&#39;t possible to see the climate change every day of your life. Maybe over a life time, but not every day. This misunderstanding shows that you are uninformed on even the most basic concepts of climate change. Please read up and research more on this topic before discussing it.</p>

<p>Climate change is a falsifiable theory. Just show some evidence that the climate isn&#39;t changing. Simple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has been no significant effort to refute the scientific claims of global warming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because there is a massive scientific consensus on the subject and all the evidence points toward man made climate change. Anyone who tries to refute these claims is going to fail.</p>

<p>Could you please point me to an instance where scientists have done any of those things? </p>

<p>What you need to understand is that yes, climate change is a politically charged topic and a lot of people are emotionally and politically invested in it. However, this is separate from the science of climate change. The science is completely sound and while you may disagree with political solutions such as carbon credits, the problem still exists. So if you want to discredit climate change, you won&#39;t do so by attacking any of the politics surrounding it.</p>

<p>This is just an analogy, but I think you see my point. Political solutions are just that, political. They are unrelated to the scientific data. And the science points to man made climate change. You may not agree with current solutions, but that is no reason to not believe in the problem.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>An interesting analogy you have chosen... interesting indeed, for it is every bit (or more) as important to measure the probable OUTCOME of the proposed &quot;solutions&quot; to a given &quot;problem&quot; as it is to acknowledge the problem itself.</p>

<p>In 1964, LBJ launched his &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Poverty">War On Poverty</a>&quot; in the midst of the Civil Rights era... and what happened?</p>

<p>Has poverty been effectively reduced in the US - as measured by the income gap between the Wealthy and the poor? Has the Middle Class grown, or has it shrunk?</p>

<p>From a political perspective, the easiest way to reduce OBESITY in the US would be to officially (and upwardly) redefine what OBESE means, would it not?</p>

<p>Politics and science are largely incompatible. Unfortunately politics has a MUCH larger influence on &quot;Science&quot; than the reverse, so if you are a believer in Anthropogenic Climate Change, I would suggest that you be VERY wary of those that champion your position AND THEIR PROPOSED SOLUTIONS, because if the &quot;War On Poverty&quot; (and the War on Drugs, etc) has taught us anything, it is that politics WILL leverage well-intended people to serve nefarious agendas.</p>

<p>You call yourself &quot;Skeptitron&quot;. Are you truly a &quot;skeptic&quot;, or are you just schlepping water for the political elites?</p>

<p>How many ways can I share the same information?

<p>Do you want to talk about polio <a href="/u/JohnOBrosley">/u/JohnOBrosley</a>? Can you specify which polio you would like to discuss, given that the definition clinically changed in 1955 so as to cause a pre-determined decrease in the incidence rate coinciding with the sale of the vaccine?</p>

<p>Do you want to talk about the Cutter incident then, if polio is a case that you&#39;re familiar with?</p>

<p>Actually good science requires consensus. If a scientist&#39;s results can not be replicated by other scientists, its not good science. The fact is, the vast majority of the data we have on the subject agrees that climate change is man made.</p>

<p>The fact that the majority of people are only exposed to one viewpoint proves that there&#39;s a political motivation behind the climate change movement.</p>

<p>Let me get this straight, you&#39;re saying that because some politicians have proposed solutions to a problem, that problem just doesn&#39;t exist in the first place? The government has proposed many solutions to poverty over the years, does this mean that poverty doesn&#39;t actually exist?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting analogy you have chosen... interesting indeed, for it is every bit (or more) as important to measure the probable OUTCOME of the proposed &quot;solutions&quot; to a given &quot;problem&quot; as it is to acknowledge the problem itself.</p>

<p>In 1964, LBJ launched his &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Poverty">War On Poverty</a>&quot; in the midst of the Civil Rights era... and what happened?</p>

<p>Has poverty been effectively reduced in the US - as measured by the income gap between the Wealthy and the poor? Has the Middle Class grown, or has it shrunk?</p>

<p>From a political perspective, the easiest way to reduce OBESITY in the US would be to officially (and upwardly) redefine what OBESE means, would it not?</p>

<p>Politics and science are largely incompatible. Unfortunately politics has a MUCH larger influence on &quot;Science&quot; than the reverse, so if you are a believer in Anthropogenic Climate Change, I would suggest that you be VERY wary of those that champion your position AND THEIR PROPOSED SOLUTIONS, because if the &quot;War On Poverty&quot; (and the War on Drugs, etc) has taught us anything, it is that politics WILL leverage well-intended people to serve nefarious agendas.</p>

<p>You call yourself &quot;Skeptitron&quot;. Are you truly a &quot;skeptic&quot;, or are you just schlepping water for the political elites?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also funny how it&#39;s become &quot;climate change&quot; in recent years - guess &quot;global warming&quot; was starting to lose traction after two decades of failed models.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. The reason the term climate change is used, is that the Earth isn&#39;t just getting warmer. The oceans are getting more acidic, weather patterns will change, more droughts, extreme weather, etc. In fact, the term climate change has always been more popular in the scientific literature, all the way back into the 1970s. <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/climate-change-global-warming.htm">Source.</a></p>
