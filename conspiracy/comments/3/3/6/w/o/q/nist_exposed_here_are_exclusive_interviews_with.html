         Architect Richard Gage talked about his group, Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, which claimed that the World Trade Center was brought down by explosive demolition on September 11, 2001. The group was founded in 2006 and said its mission was to “expose the official lies and cover-up surrounding the events of September 11, 2001 in a way that inspires the people to overcome denial and understand the truth.” Mr. Gage spoke via video link from San Francisco, California:

       WTC 7 + the NIST report are the 2 most explosive conspiracies that completely blow the lid off everything -- credibility and sources are key when approaching this touchy subject.  If we stick to exposing the NIST reports as fraudulent, we cannot be subverted.

       I'm concerned the focus of this subreddit is steered in the wrong direction by a mod clique behind the scenes who want to push their own agenda, which ends up poisoning the well, or shifting focus from this sourced material.

       Anybody with a well functioning brain can tell these buildings did not collapse. Steel CAN'T get melt in such a short amount of time. You need to use over 2000°c at specific points to even get the steel wobbly in such a short period of time. Again, thermite is a good thing to use for this. 
Anyone saying, that it did not get destroyed by a controlled demolition is in fear, facing the truth.
The fact that MANY scientists, engineers, physicists are opposing each other should already ring a bell and that THEY CAN NOT produce a clear statement on how the buildings collapsed.
BUT everything makes SENSE, if you think about controlled demolition. Everybody labeled as "Truther" knows it. The others too but they don't say it. Sadly.
The FBI, or rather the american government is corrupt as hell Iam still wondering why the citizens of america did not wake up yet after all the cases that have been "opened" and clarified, after all the incidents that have happened and all the cases where it just doesn't make any sense. WAKE UP! You only harm yourself!

       If people understand what "free-fall acceleration" means, then they understand that the collapse of WTC7
       <strong>
        could not have happened
       </strong>
       the way NIST claims it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free-fall acceleration means two things: that the object is doing
       <em>
        nothing at all
       </em>
       besides
       <strong>
        falling
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        accelerating
       </strong>
       .  That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, it is doing no crushing of the structure beneath it.  If it was, it couldn't reach free-fall.  Free fall implies nothing below providing any resistance whatsoever, and it's (clearly) physically impossible for a standing steel structure to provide no resistance.

       Not forgetting anything, simply explaining what free-fall acceleration means to those who may not be aware which is that the object is doing
       <strong>
        nothing
       </strong>
       besides falling and accelerating.  So no crushing of any kind can be occurring, because then that wouldn't be free fall.

       No. Strictly speaking, free fall is any object falling under the force of gravity. It says nothing about resistance. For example, air resistance is commonly ignored. Also, when you have a huge mass with tons of inertia, the floors basically become crumple zones. As each floor yields, contributing to the total free falling mass, each subsequent floor matters less and less. You quickly wind up falling at the speed of gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real problem is, most people simply can't relate to the large values here and life experience is wholly inadequate to comprehend the observation.

       You misrepresent the concept of inertia. Allowing your assumption that the top section began to fall as a unit (i.e. a couple hundred columns gave up in an instant), it will have downward inertia (tendency to remain in motion); but the lower section has inertia too (tendency to remain at rest).
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of energy in the system is constant. The top section has potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy (downward acceleration) and energy of deformation (impacting and destroying the lower section).
      </p>
      <p>
       The more work (crushing) it does, less energy is available to overcome the inertia of the lower section. Since each floor was built more massive than the one above it, it takes more energy to destroy each floor, even as less and less energy is available to do the work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your theory, that as more work is done, more energy is available, is simply not true.

       I'm sorry but you are wrong.  Free fall means that the object is doing no work besides
       <strong>
        falling and accelerating
       </strong>
       .  The object is "in free fall".  There can be no resistance of any kind, whatsoever, under an object in free fall.  If there is, then the object isn't
       <em>
        only falling and accelerating
       </em>
       but is also working to crush what's beneath it, and is thus not in free fall.  If you don't understand this concept then I don't know what to tell you.

      <p>
       Even if this is true, it still can never reach free fall speed unless it's
       <em>
        free falling
       </em>
       .  If it's crushing the structure beneath it, then it isn't free fall and never can be.  Do you understand?  Free fall means no work whatsoever is being done besides falling and accelerating, I don't know how much more clear I can make it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to be a dick but perhaps look up what free fall means when it comes to the study of physics.

       If I drop a 20 ton boulder on you, it absolutely will fall according to gravity, as if you were not there. According to your poor understanding of physics, your body will effectively prevent this.

       Dude.  Look up what free fall acceleration means.
       <strong>
        No work at all
       </strong>
       besides falling and accelerating.  Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your example above, no.  What would happen is that the boulder would crush you, but it would not do so at free fall acceleration.  It may get
       <em>
        close
       </em>
       to free fall, or it may reach free fall
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       crushing you, but it would not be free falling
       <em>
        while
       </em>
       it was crushing you.  Why?  This is simple - because free fall means it is
       <strong>
        only falling and accelerating
       </strong>
       , so no work can also be being done to crush anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up what free fall means, I don't know what else to tell you.  It seems like you just aren't getting it for some reason.

       Cool man.  I can only tell you that you're wrong and that free fall means the object is only
       <strong>
        falling and accelerating
       </strong>
       .  No crushing of any kind can be occurring while an object is in free fall.

       Nice avoidance of very basic physics.  Cheers.

       I see a lot of youtube interviews, but I am wondering if all of these people with these qualifications have to tried to publish anything scientific regarding their issues with the report on a more detailed level? Many of the ideas I've seen discussed in this video seem to take things from a very broad perspective. I'd like to see the technical analysis that led them to these conclusions in the form of articles. Have any of them been published (I am already aware of the "journal of 9/11 studies", I didn't find much in terms of engineering related papers). Anyone have a link for any of these?
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that, I am most interested in an alternate model demonstrating the controlled demolition. Given that NIST used video/photo footage and blueprints to construct theirs, I would think that someone with a controlled demolition hypothesis would be equally as capable of producing a model to show that. They could get into more detail, theorize on explosive placement, demolition physics etc. Anybody got a link?

       The NIST report is unscientific and fraudulent.  A new independent investigation is required to answer all of our questions -- including yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/301e6t/breaking_news_nist_maintains_that_wtc_7_collapsed/">
        NIST maintains that WTC 7 collapsed due to fire acting upon the 13th floor &amp; A2001 girder. But — NIST omitted flange-to-web stiffeners on the south end of the girder A2001. These omitted stiffeners would prevent the girder flange from folding when the girder web moved beyond the seat.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30mmj3/911_coverup_nist_says_shear_studs_were_not_used/">
        They also said shear studs were not used on WTC 7 girders — and claim the 13th floor A2001 girder was pushed off its seat at column 79 by 'thermally expanded' beams. If shear studs had been used on the girders, it would have been impossible for the beams to push the girder off its seat.

       No, I want the truther model. I want the model that shows a controlled demolition. Even if NIST's report is not good enough, I want the one that demostrates the controlled demo.

       I addressed this already. AE911 Truth has taken in plenty of donations. Also, members of the University of Edinburgh were able to analyze the collapse with presumably less money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is: No matter what you think about the NIST report, as of now, no report has been produced to demonstrate controlled demolition. This has not dissuaded members of AE911truth and other sources to claim this. You would think they would wait to make a claim until they properly demonstrated it. You may think the NIST report is flawed, but the truth movement stands on even lower ground at the moment.

       It was a legal transcript because a couple of engineers constructed their own analysis and gave testimony at their trails. I posted it merely to show that it is possible to study the collapse without NIST's budget. Because I don't have the full paper in scientific form, I don't claim anything that it is any sort of authority.

       <strong>
        That doesn't prove a controlled demolition in any way

       . Unless you can show me a technical report detailing the controlled demolition theory that accounts for the relevant details of the collapse, I see no reason to conclude it.

       That is the only thing I am arguing. That is it. The pathological need for people in this thread to continue to try and attack other theories rather than defend their own is rather eye-opening.

       NIST being wrong doesn't prove CD - trivially true, but it doesn't leave many other options.

       The hilarious part is that he keeps crying that proving NIST wrong doesn't prove CD, and you need all this precise evidence to do so - and then his entire argumentative style is trying to prove fire theory by attacking CD, not by producing any evidence whatsoever for any other theory. Says he's undecided, but this is obviously deceptive. Geez are there really people like this in real life? Don't let this piece of filth trick you into wasting your time. He's neither honest nor sincere.

       A new breed, wonder why he cares so much about the "truthers" proving the demolition theory. He comes across like he's disagreeing with the OFFICIAL report — yet he continues to dance around the fraud in the government narrative and focuses on arguing with "truthers" on reddit. Lol

       Just so you know, that rage you feel right now is one sided. I do not think any less of you for not sharing my opinions, nor would I attempt to diagnose you with an sort mental illness based on this thread.

       I will say that if you find yourself getting this worked up because someone challenged your beliefs, you may want to consider what that reaction says about your openness to ideas. Seems like you are pretty dug in there bud.

       If framing it that way makes you feel better about your behaviour in this thread (all the name calling etc) go for it. I was simply expressing that I found it funny how you guys are frothing at the mouth over an internet disagreement in which I made no unprovoked discriminatory comments to you.

       If you want to call that creepy, go for it. I disagree of course (sorry, i know how much that bothers you). Sometimes you just have to laugh at the behaviour of others, especially when said behaviour reaches such hysterical levels.

       Simply Astounding... Like holy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       First off:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        proving that all core columns were simultaneously removed, which can only be achieved with demolition
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bullshit assertion. Give me the calculations, give me the model. Show me scientifically. I do not buy your assertion that the collapse that occurred was only possible through a controlled demolition. I would support it if you actually had some science to back it up. Don't say "Newtonian Physics", as this simple, cop-out explanation completely ignores the collapse process in which it is clearly visible that there is some sort of progressive collapse. You can see the west-side interior columns give out, as evidenced by falling penthouse and breaking windows along that side. You can then see the interior progressively give way. All this is completely visible and absolutely fucks your assertion that all the columns were removed simultaneously. It is disgustingly obvious that isn't what happened, and the fact you would try to say otherwise is laughable. Have you even watched the collapse? Do you even know the structure of the building?
      </p>
      <p>
       One last try...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The fact that NIST may not be correct doesn't prove a controlled demolition in any way.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now please just stop. Every time you post you completely distort my position and I feel obliged to correct you and it is getting annoying. There are probably a dozen threads right now just waiting for your link-spam and enough people in this sub to reinforce your assertions that you can forget I exist. I won't respond anymore.

       A detailed theory that shows how a demolition could take down the building in the manner seen. That way, other engineers could analyze the conclusions and see if the conclusions meet the evidence. It's the scientific process. If you want to demonstrate how a building fell down you need to show it in detail, not just make vague claims.

       I agree, if circumstances permitted such an undertaking I would look forward to it too. NIST should have had the best access to the physical evidence that would be needed to give credence to any claim about the specifics of the collapse or demolition, but you believe them despite the fact they cited little to none in their investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you ask for a report on a common phenomenon from people who had no access to the physical evidence that's more detailed than the one you got from the people who had everything in their favor purporting to show a new, unprecedented phenomenon happening three times in the same day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vague statements? Please. "Global collapse was inevitable" is all you got as an answer to why two of the tallest buildings on the planet disintegrated themselves in seconds and left craters that burned for months.

       I don't believe I said that. In fact, I've stated that I too have problems with the report.

       So, I'm not sure how you could evaluate that I possess a double standard when I haven't expressed my support of the NIST report. In fact, the way in which you constantly attack the NIST report while buying the "unofficial story" so religiously says more about your double standard than mine.

       So your entire comment is based on nothing. I expect scientific standards. No truth advocates have presented it. Sorry we have different standards.

       Personally, I wouldn't feel quite qualified to make a claim. I know there are flaws with official explanations, so I have a hard time accepting that at face value. Currently, do to the aggressively anti-science attitude of the 9/11 truth movement, all I know is that I do not side with them either.

       CONTROLLED DEMOLITION IS THE SOLE KNOWN CAUSE OF RAPID TOTAL TALL BUILDING COLLAPSE. RAPID TOTAL TALL BUILDING COLLAPSE IS EVIDENCE OF CONTROLLED DEMOLITION. If you think there's anything else that has ever caused rapid total tall building collapse and have scientifically rigorous evidence to back it up, then present it.  Until then, controlled demolition is the only sensible explanation. Stop being a jackass and wasting people's time.

       Those elements are part of conclusively proving a controlled demolition. If you say controlled demo but can't provide evidence or have a working theory based on empirical evidence then all you really have is a hypothesis.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of understanding, but in lack of resolve and courage to use it without guidance from another. Sapere Aude! [dare to know] “Have courage to use your own understanding!”–that is the motto of enlightenment.

       I don't accept this until an adequate technical investigation/report is completed. Even if we discount the NIST report as utter bunk, and conclusively say that elements of the collapse resemble a controlled demolition, I still don't believe that is enough to conclude a controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before I come to a conclusion, I want to see the truth movement present their evidence to the standards of the communities they are trying to gain acceptance from. I want to see a technical report regarding the supposed definition that outlines the theories
       <em>
        in detail
       </em>
       . I know most here are pacified by "free-fall speed" and assertions that a progressive collapse "violates newtonian physics", but without a more detailed analysis, I don't put much stock in these assertions. I know my particular standards and the fact that I choose to express them here makes a lot of people angry, but that is how I feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the cost of an investigation, AE911 truth has taken in plenty in donations. I think they are currently working on a report actually. It should also be noted that just because NIST dedicated more resources, doesn't mean studies cannot be done for less. Perhaps they may be more limited in their scope, but the quality of the research is what matters IMO.

       If you need all of that to understand an utterly simple concept then you have issues with common sense. That said, no, you don't need an alternative report to prove that the NIST report is wrong. For instance, if NIST said that 2+2=5, so that caused the collapse, you just need to know that 2+2=4, therefore NIST is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are actually talking about is, "If you guys say it was a controlled demolition, then you need to produce an entirely scientific report of your own."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, saying NIST was wrong, and saying here's what actually happened, are two very different things. And yes, at some point, the next question is, "If the NIST explanation is obviously wrong, then what explains how they did fall down?", and ultimately that will require a scientific report, if that doesn't exist already.

       I don't share your opinion that it is simple. Easy as that. Especially when I see members of this movement try to tell me things like "the collapse is symetrical", when it very clearly isn't. I'll keep my standards for believing in line with the engineering community, rather than the armchair engineering community.

       <p>
        Well, saying NIST was wrong, and saying here's what actually happened, are two very different things. And yes, at some point, the next question is, "If the NIST explanation is obviously wrong, then what explains how they did fall down?", and ultimately that will require a scientific report, if that doesn't exist already.

      <p>
       Well, the majority of my conversations with people on this subreddit indicate that they do believe a controlled demolitions. Also, if you want to disprove something like the NIST report, I would argue that the best way to do so would be a scientific report.

       It's so annoying at this point when people like you say that all the time. Is it because you think saying that traps everyone who disagrees with you? Because it doesn't. It's just a cliched phrase at this point.

       You aren't asking questions if you're honest with yourself. You're just disrupting conversation with needlessly wordy demands for ridiculous levels of scientific facts that aren't really required for an understanding of what we're talking about.

       Possibly from your perspective. All I ask is for evidence that follows the standards of the Scientific Method. Considering this is an engineering concept, I would expect technical reports with detailed hypothesis, assumptions, calculations and conclusions followed by submission to a peer review journal. (although because many will claim a worldwide scientific conspiracy, I would say the peer reviewed journal part is less important).

       If you don't think demands for scientific facts and standards are appropriate for a scientific debate I suggest it is you who needs to re-evaluate. What you are talking about are scientific concepts, if you are willing to make claims like "NIST is wrong" or "WTC7 fell because of controlled demolition" then you should be prepared to address those scientifically.

       People have done that. That information is available. I'm not sure how you missed it. There's a user here who regularly posts an extremely long comment in response to people asking for what you are, but for the life of me, I don't know their name. But if you normally come here asking for all of thi, I would have to think they would have responded to you by now with that information. Does anyone know who that is?

       Indeed they did, not only did they use it, they constructed their model so that it would behave like it did on video. They did this

       </strong>
       of using their own scientifically acquired data. And they admit to this in their own report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only did they pull steel temperatures out their ass that directly contradicted their own findings, they also found it necessary to completely remove the thermal conductivity of the steel.

       Right, from which they then removed the critical parts that were in place to counter exactly the issues that we're now told led to the collapse of WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       So all of that to produce a model which we can't see and that by their own admission isn't based on the evidence they themselves found. So shouldn't you be asking
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       for a decent explanation? After all, they DID the research.

       NIST had a decade of a head start in creating their simulation, having only finally released WTC 7 blueprints
       <a href="http://www1.ae911truth.org/faqs/611-wtc-7-blueprints-exposed-via-foia-request.html">
        a few years ago
       </a>
       , and they haven't rightly shown that it corroborates their hypothesis as long as they refuse to release their inputs for independent review. Granted I too hope to see a demolition simulation for WTC 7 someday, but absent any publicly available model demonstrating fires being able to bring such a building down anywhere near so quickly and completely, the building having been rigged to come down remains the more reasonable explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for theorizing on placement of explosives, incendiaries, and otherwise,  there's countless possibilities which can't be ruled out by the available evidence since only one small piece of WTC 7's steel had its condition documented. The rest of the steel which would've facilitated a far better understand of how the building came down was promptly shipped off and destroyed, and the most reasonable explanation such widespread destruction of evidence for that is that those  in charge of investigating the matter were actually intent on covering it up. So of course any such simulation will be highly speculative, but it would be good to have at least one in the public record regardless.
