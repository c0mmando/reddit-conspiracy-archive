       If its so prevalent in the controlled demolition business, how come there are no other examples of thermite being used to take down modern buildings? Seems like they always use RDX or TNT.

       Who said it was prevalent in the controlled demolition business?
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumably nano-thermite was used because it had properties that made it more effective for the situation, and easier to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why go to the hassle of finding military grade nano-thermite, when 
RDX and TNT do the job of commercial building demolition perfectly (albeit in a very obvious manner, which obviously doesnt matter in a legitimate, commercial application).
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like me buying a screwdriver made of diamond. Its the best solution, but stupid when a steel screwdriver does the job just fine.

       Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now (hypothetically speaking) if the government went through the hassle of making the events of 9/11 look like an attack of terrorism by building two military aircraft...
      </p>
      <p>
       that were reinforced and souped-up in order to fly them faster than you can technically fly a 767...
      </p>
      <p>
       then painted them to look identical to an American Airlines and a United Airlines plane...
      </p>
      <p>
       then switched these two planes with the real planes mid-flight, diverting the real planes to a remote airfield somewhere, where the passengers were then "disappeared"...
      </p>
      <p>
       and rigged both buildings with super nano-thermate cutting charges...
      </p>
      <p>
       and flying these two souped-up disguised military planes into the buildings and triggering the explosives to go off at the EXACT point where the planes crashed into the buildings...
      </p>
      <p>
       All to make everything look to the average person watching that the planes caused the collapse of the buildings...
      </p>
      <p>
       THEN WHY DIDNT THEY DO THIS FOR BUILDING 7?

       According to the 9/11 commission report, United 93 was destined for either the White House or the capital building.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's just assume for the sake of argument that United 93 was intended for WTC7...if this was the case, then why would the government demolish the building without the plane crashing into it? That seems like an awful lot of planning only to tip your hand to the world that the whole thing was a controlled demo.

       Because they're not gonna leave a building sitting there rigged to the hilt with explosives, are they. One of the main objectives of the day was to destroy the buildings and what they contained. Clearly it wasn't a giveaway because 14 years on and most don't even know about building 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       As proven by you, most just believe the official report and the 'evidence' it contains. Where as a building filled with explosives is a bit harder to explain away by 'Fires did it'.

       9-11[edit: 9-11WTC] makes more sense as a two part event, then. 1) Actual plane crashes and collapses of the two main towers [edit: by foreign aggression] &amp; 2) Controlled, pre-rigged demolition of WTC7 to hide whatever the charges were installed to hide [edit: by government info. destruction policy].   --   The blatant weirdness around WTC7 reinforces the twin towers conspiracy aura [edit: now gov't can't admit to any hand].

       I'm not sure where you got the idea that anyone believed that thermite was commonly used in building demolitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thermite theory wasn't first presented for quite some time after the 9/11 events, and even then it was conceieved to have been some kind of "secret military formula" of thermite, as it would take massive amounts of the thermite that we know of to take down the buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah, here it is.  The thermite theory was first published by a Dr. Steven Jones in 2007, although that year could be wrong.

       Correct. Jones analyzed a sample of dust that was collected (and kept in someone's private possession for six years before turning it over, thus completely fracturing the concept of "chain of custody") and determined that the dust contained red/grey chips. After analyzing the chips, Jones concluded that they appeared to be "unreacted" material that was "thermetic in nature."
      </p>
      <p>
       If the amount of chips in the dust represented an amount of thermite that didnt react, then exactly how much material was needed to still successfully cut through the steel supports of the building?

      <p>
       I haven't the foggiest idea, but it would need to be placed in many different places in order to take the building down in such a uniform manner, which would take many man-hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I'm not the best person to speak to about this, being that I don't subscribe to the thermite concept, mostly because the damage done doesn't match the expected results from a thermite induced demolition.

       It wasnt Thermite, it was military grade nano-thermite.

       This is not available to Phil's Demo Company.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are here asking "If there was thermite where is other Thermite used? (insert whiny voice here)" then when Phil gets access to military grade nano-thermite, maybe you can answer that question.

       Nope it cannot --- So explain this...
      </p>
      <p>
       Jet fuel can't melt steel beams, so why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?
NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.
Physical Evidence
Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study
Their discoveries were also reported in a WPI article entitled “The ‘Deep Mystery’ of Melted Steel,” which said:
Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.
Stating that the New York Times called these findings “perhaps the deepest mystery uncovered in the investigation,” the article added:
A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.
In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled “WTC Dust Signature,” at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove (to its insurance company) that the building was “pervasively contaminated with WTC Dust The report listed five elements in this signature, one of which was: “Spherical iron and spherical or vesicular silicate particles that result from exposure to high temperature
In 2005, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) published a report entitled “Particle Atlas of World Trade Center Dust,” which was intended to aid the “identification of WTC dust components.” Among the components, it reported, were “metal or metal oxides” (which could not be distinguished by the USGS’s methods). “The primary metal and metal-oxide phases in WTC dust,” the report said, “are Fe-rich [iron-rich] and Zn-rich [zinc-rich] particles
Extremely high temperatures during the World Trade Center destruction
Journal of the American Society of Safety Engineers
The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot. Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures ranging from 400ºF to more than 2,800ºF
Sources related to exceptionally high temperatures, and/or to persistent heat at Ground Zero
FEMA documents in their Appendix C of its May 2002 WTC Building Performance Assessment Team study, for sample 1, “evidence of a severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including oxidation and sulfidation with subsequent intergranular melting.” A “sulfur-rich liquid” containing “primarily iron, oxygen, and sulfur” “penetrated” into the steel.
Testimonial Evidence
Testimony from Firefighters:
New York Fire Department Captain Philip Ruvolo said: “You’d get down below and you’d see molten steel, molten steel, running down the channel rails, like you’re in a foundry, like lava.
Joe O’Toole, a Bronx firefighter who worked on the rescue and cleanup efforts, reported that one beam lifted from deep below the surface months later, in February 2002, “was dripping from the molten steel.”
New York firefighters recalled in the documentary film Collateral Damages, “heat so intense they encountered rivers of molten steel.”
Testimony from Other Professionals:
Leslie Robertson, a member of the engineering firm that designed the World Trade Center, said 21 days after the attack: “When we were down at the B1 level, one of the firefighters said, ‘I think you’d be interested in this,’ and they pulled up a big block of concrete and there was a, like a little river of steel, flowing.”
Ron Burger, a public health advisor at the National Center for Environmental Health who arrived at Ground Zero September 12, 2001, said: “Feeling the heat, seeing the molten steel, the layers upon layers of ash, like lava, it reminded me of Mt. St. Helen’s and the thousands who fled that disaster.”
In late fall 2001, Dr. Alison Geyh of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health reported: “Fires are still actively burning and the smoke is very intense. In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel.”
Joe Allbaugh, the Director of FEMA, said in an October 2001 interview on CBS: “It’s just too hot for rescuers to get into [some] areas. So we do not know yet what’s in those areas, other than very hot, molten material.”
Dr. Keith Eaton reported in Structural Engineer: “They showed us many fascinating slides . . . ranging from molten metal which was still red hot weeks after the event, to 4-inch thick steel plates sheared and bent in the disaster.”
Don Carson, a hazardous materials expert from the National Operating Engineers Union, said six weeks after 9/11: “There are pieces of steel being pulled out from as far as six stories underground that are still cherry red.”
Testimony from Other Credible Witnesses:
Greg Fuchek, vice president of a company that supplied computer equipment used to identify human remains, reported that “sometimes when a worker would pull a steel beam from the wreckage, the end of the beam would be dripping molten steel.”
Sarah Atlas, of New Jersey’s Task Force One Urban Search and Rescue, arrived at Ground Zero on September 11 and reported that “fires burned and molten steel flowed in the pile of ruins still settling beneath her feet.”
Tom Arterburn, writing in Waste Age, reported that the New York Department of Sanitation removed “everything from molten steel beams to human remains

The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.
When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible

       The result of the catastrophic destruction of the buildings was a pile of ground fuels, metals and insulation that would have formed natural furnaces as fires drafted air in and vented hot gases out through the pile. The molten pools in the towers' footprint would have been slag from concrete dust and gypsum, as well as paper clips, furniture hardware, staples, wiring, etc. Focusing on the steel beams is willfully ignorant.

       Look around you. Sconces, doorknobs, furniture hardware, bathroom fixtures, carpet tacks, soda cans, picture frames. All cheap, low temperature melting metals like zinc, brass, copper, aluminum, cast magnesium, etc. These metals are not only melting materials, but fuels. Grind them up add jet fuel, tons of paper, plastics, carpet, furniture and air. = fire in the pile

       This is what I am talking about when I say "willfull ignorance". 
A cupola furnace = air + fire + fuel + insulated draft chimney + meltable metals.
If the fires were burning underground, for weeks, as reported, then they were getting air, fuel and venting (smoking pile). Any "chimney" formed by the chaotic events of collapse would be a mix of fuels, metals and insulation (ground concrete and drywall). As the insulation and ignited fuels accumulated heat, the metals would flow down and pool under the fires.
The collapse itself provided fuels and metals in the form of ground-up office towers (paper, wood, carpets, etc.), planes, cars, jet fuel, car gas tanks and rendered people.

       When I say "natural" furnace, I am speaking of a random series of events and conditions that occurred after a non-natural event. Asking for documentation of another occurrence of the largest building collapse in history, and the resulting "metal melting chimneys" is disengenuous. Perhaps you have a "gut-reaction" against the use of the term, "natural", like creationists use a strawman definition of "theory" to attack evolution. A "metal melting chimney" is the basic definition of a

       I'm not sure what position you're arguing. The fact that there were fires in the pile that could be seen smoking and felt through the debris means that there was air, fuel, ignition source and venting available in the pile.
       <strong>
        That's what fire requires and can be safely inferred
       </strong>
       . If fire is burning and venting, then whatever
       <strong>
        (many) channels
       </strong>
       that heat and smoke are escaping from are de-facto "chimneys". Descriptions of the debris indicate that it was filled with ground-up fuels, metals and insulation. It's not imagination, it's physics, chemistry and metallurgy. I think what you are worried about is that if ordinary fires in the pile created pools of molten metal and slag, then there is no need for a thermite explanation for those pools. I think that Occam's razor supports it over "sustained thermite reaction" over weeks.

       If you are using thermite as the "only plausible alternative" to regular burning, then the question you meant to ask is where is the oxidiser (air) in the water/pyrocool "bathtub". The fuel is the ground wooden, paper, car/plane liquid fuels, carpets, etc. mixed throughout the pile and whatever protected space that the fires found their way into before fire suppression had begun were probably the dry-areas for continued burning. Perhaps air was also introduced through underground tunnels and utility shafts.

       Focusing on thermite just takes you in circles.  Maybe thermite was used in wtc7, but the twin towers' collapse was much different.  They didn't just collapse, they burst into dust.  They were pulverized from the top down which is characteristic of a shockwave resulting from a controlled nuclear demolition and not a collapse from the structural damage that would be incurred by something like thermite.

       There are a fair number of 9/11 fire fighters suffering from radiation "like" sickness.  Of course it's not documented as such, and I am unable to find information on anyone standing at ground zero with a geiger counter.  Even if there were such measurements, they would be easiy censored.  If I had information like that, it wouldn't be much of a conspiracy anymore.  I am simply stating that it is the most accurate model for the manner in which the towers collapsed.  The whole thermite discussion is misdirection.

The jet from a shaped charge will penetrate it, but cutting requires multiple charges or linear-shaped charges. Nickel-molybdenum steel shafts can be cut with a diamond charge. However, the saddle charge will not cut nickel-molybdenum shafts. Therefore, use some method other than explosives to cut nickel-molybdenum steel, such as thermite or acetylene or electrical cutting tools.

       It appears that thermite has been standard operating procedure to bring down hardened vertical structures for the military since 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guys at Hight3ch burned through a car engine and say that thermite burns through just about anything at 2500 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       How hot is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone says that there are substances that burn much hotter than thermite, such as thermate, super-thermite or nano-thermite.

       “The cutting of the piling is performed by a series of tubes radially deployed in the cutter on a common plane. Each tube is filled with what is, in essence, a solid fuel similar to thermite or magnesium. Thus, the cut is performed through the use of a series of solid fuel torches. The preferred solid fuel is Pyronol.RTM. Pyronol.RTM. is manufactured by Goex, Inc. and the material itself is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 3,695,951. Pyronol.RTM., once ignited, will attain temperatures between six and twelve thousand degrees Fahrenheit. These temperatures are sufficient to burn through steel and concrete.”

       Okay thermite at 2500 degrees can burn through a car engine.

       What can you do with 12,000 degrees?

       Oh the 9/11 commission report, that bastion of truthiness!
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they're not gonna leave a building sitting there rigged to the hilt with explosives, are they. One of the main objectives of the day was to destroy the buildings and what they contained. Clearly it wasn't a giveaway because 14 years on and most don't even know about building 7.
      </p>
      <p>
       As proven by you, most just believe the official report and the 'evidence' it contains. Where as a building filled with explosives is a bit harder to explain away by 'Fires did it'.

       Depends how important whatever was in that building was. Do you know what was destroyed?
