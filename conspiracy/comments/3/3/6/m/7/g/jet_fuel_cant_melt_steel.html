<p>Fuel doesn&#39;t melt anything, heat does. Steel holding up a building wouldn&#39;t need to melt but just be heated enough to bend or snap.</p>

<p>Ive seen people throw out statistics of jet fuel fire but forget about how heat works in enclosed areas. You don&#39;t need powerful fuel to get a good heat going in confined spaces.</p>

<p>You can melt steel with BBQ charcoal as your fuel.</p>

<p>That being said, keep up the theories please, one day we will get to the bottom of it all.</p>

<p>Im not saying this is what happened, im saying it is possible in the right circumstances. The winds blowing in at that height combined with the flames in an enclosed area of those office buildings would result in an EXTREMELY hot area that would disintegrate anything on those floors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yes you can melt steel inside of a forge. No you cannot melt steel with a BBQ grill and no you cannot melt steel by flying a plane into a building. You need lots of air and pressure (sustained by a forge) to reach temperatures high enough to melt steel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe you are confusing (and misrepresenting) this particular argument.</p>

<p>I think it can best be clarified by viewing this 6 minute video:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YaFGSPErKU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YaFGSPErKU</a></p>

<p>To understand this argument, you have to be aware that there was physical evidence of molten steel and iron at the WTC site, as well as witnesses testimony.  Yes, fire can <em>weaken</em> steel, but can it create the effects we have witnessed (as shown in the video) such as completely fusing steel beams, or creating a &quot;meteorite&quot; of molten steel and concrete?  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know the answer to the question. I don&#39;t claim to understand the physics of the collapse, or exactly how hot the steel beams would have to be to weaken and collapse the towers.  Like most of you, I am open to research, discussion, discovery, and criticism.  Here are my questions for the community:</p>

<p>1) What forces caused the molten steel effects seen in the video, such as the &quot;meteorite&quot; or the previously-molten &quot;cross&quot;?  Would normal fire be capable of producing these effects?  Would the collapse of the building generate enough heat from friction that could produce these effects?  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>2) What exactly did those witnesses see who explained witnessing &quot;pools of molten steel&quot;,&quot; streams of liquid steel&quot;, &quot;like a foundry&quot;, &quot;like lava&quot;?  Apparently temperatures were exceeding 2,000 degrees in the rubble for weeks after the collapse.  What was the source of this heat?  Again, is this something that could be produced from fire or from friction?  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>3) If the molten steel, or previously-molten steel does/did exist, as the evidence and witnesses seem to suggest, then why does John Gross, lead NIST engineer of the WTC collapse investigation, deny the presence of this evidence?  NIST is not trying to explain this evidence, but rather deny the existence of it.  This strikes me as strange.</p>

<p>So I believe when people claim &quot;jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams&quot; they perhaps may be referring to actual melted steel beams, and wondering how they got that way.</p>

<p>Please feel free to criticize me and point out flaws in my thought process.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how,</p>

<p>As the south tower started moving from it&#39;s normal standing position, it&#39;s uppermost floors moved towards the tilting position. seen here</p>

<p>Normally that portion, once moving, would have been forced by physical law to conserve momentum and continue to tilt further falling over the side of the lower floors in the direction of least resistance, beside, the lower undamaged 78 floors as all objects do fall.</p>

<p>The end results, if physics prevailed, would be the upper 30 some floors would lie crushed in the street beside the still standing stub of the remaining lower floors. At the moment pictured above the entire building had to have been semi sequentially pulverized by an unseen force for the collapse to have proceeded as seen.</p>

<p>If the upper floors were pulverized in mid air by an unseen force then each small piece of that section would have conserved momentum or motion by appearing to change direction because each tiny piece would now follow a comparatively tiny new arc of descent. That is indeed what happened. If there was a demolition, that would be normal, If the building collapsed under the force of gravity on a &#39;weakened&#39; steel frame, then it was a violation of physics because motion was not conserved.</p>

<p>If the government&#39;s story, that the collapse used gravity as it&#39;s source of energy, is true, then the change of direction in mid air from tilting to falling straight down would be anomalous and defy the law of conservation of motion.</p>

<p>The next problem for the official story is that the top portion then fell in the direction of most resistance, through the undamaged lower portion.of the building.</p>

<p>Normal physics would demand that the upper portion of the building fall beside the lower portion following the direction of least resistance, not most.</p>

<p>That didn&#39;t happen, a second violation of physics.</p>

<p>No violation occurred if the truthers are right and the buildings were demolished in a controlled demolition because each pulverized piece did follow the path of least resistance, not through an integrated steel and concrete framework, but through open air.</p>

<p>The third problem for proponents of the official story is found within the debris piles.</p>

<p>If gravity was the cause of the collapse, then each 1 acre square floor would pile up on the ground in the same relative position they had occupied while standing because the official story provides no available source of horizontal energy to move any given floor out from under the one above it.</p>

<p>Each floor would be captured in place by the floor above it causing what are described as pancakes or layers of floors on the ground. You should see layers of floors caused by gravity but what you do see is a lot of shrapnel and no layers , which is what would happen if the collapse was caused by explosives. So under the official explanation we should see layers. but what we did see instead was shrapnel.</p>

<p>There were three violations of physics under the official story.</p>

<p>None were necessary if the buildings were the subject of controlled demolition</p>

<p>Shrapnel caused by explosives, not layers caused by gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yes you can melt steel inside of a forge. No you cannot melt steel with a BBQ grill and no you cannot melt steel by flying a plane into a building. You need lots of air and pressure (sustained by a forge) to reach temperatures high enough to melt steel.</p>

<p>A building that was designed to be a building and not a forge will not create the same amount of heat and pressure, ya dummy. </p>
