    <div class="md"><p>No, some SEALs from Team Six (a large team) died in a helicopter incident (I believe it was an RPG) but none of the Team Six members from the Bin Laden raid were on it. SEAL Team Six consists of four assault teams, one recon &amp; surveillance team, one transports/drivers squadron, and one selection/training squadron.</p>

<p>The assault team involved in the alleged Bin Laden raid were Red Squadron, while the SEALs that died in the helicopter incident were from Gold Squadron.</p>

<p>The hit on the SEAL team is what is strange and i don&#39;t mean conspiracy theory (they knew to much) angle.</p>

<p>I think the ISI was involved in killing the SEALs as payback for what went down in Pakistan. ISI are involved with the Taliban and its possible they knew where DEVGRU members were operating from and they were apart of the QRF.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s well known that I was &quot;out of theater&quot; prior to 2004.  There were rumors of Bush claiming a kill as part of the 2004 election campaign, but major democratic party members publicly balked; the result was a toned down fake video attacking Bush which is said to have thrown the election to Bush anyway.</p>

<p>Anywho.  What does out of theater mean?  You probably need a good grasp of who I am first.  CIA?  Duh.  No way I am first generation - the mission is too sensitive.  So we&#39;re talking parents, maybe grandparents in the CIA.</p>

<p>Afghan theater in the 80s?  I need the ability to speak Russian for sure.  </p>

<p>Obviously we need to pull off the whole Muslim thing too.  Childhood madrassa education?  Speak Arabic?  Of course.</p>

<p>If you include my tall stature, just the above might narrow you down to maybe 1 or 2 people in the whole world: a second or third generation CIA operative that speaks Russian and Arabic above 6&#39; tall with darkish skin.  </p>

<p>Maybe this isn&#39;t quite specific enough though.  Brzezinski ran the CIA program in Afghanistan, so we&#39;re probably looking for someone in his orbit.  In particular, he&#39;d be in the orbit of Brzezinski in the early 80s when the whole shebang kicks off.  Perhaps a student at Columbia where Brzezinski was a faculty member would be a good pool to search though.</p>

<p>Next we want someone whose whereabouts can&#39;t be confirmed in the late 80s / early 90s.  A dubious cover story, perhaps with few people remembering me there is a big red flag.  As a completely random example, imagine you know someone that claimed to go to Harvard during this time but whose alleged classmates/teachers don&#39;t remember him.</p>

<p>In the early 90s, we start flying in the eventual patsies for 9/11.  So I probably don&#39;t have a time consuming job at this point.  Perhaps &quot;writing an autobiography&quot; in my early 30s or something.</p>

<p>Later, we have a couple confirmed sitings in eastern Europe related to possible nuke smuggling / black market dealing, although only in the summer for a few consecutive years.  This would be consistent with, say, a job as a state legislative branch that is only in session during the winter in the late 90s.</p>

<p>Finally, since everyone knows elections are rigged to shit, we should probably not even really hide my real identity because LOL what are the slaves going to do about it anyway?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no facts, I have speculations. The facts have been withheld from us by the government and government agencies and the military.</p>

<p>I suspect that the raid on the compound in Pakistan was a staged event. By that I mean it was a real raid, but it was not spontaneous -- it was timed for political effect. US forces did go to this compound, but we have no idea what they did there. The video of the event has been withheld from us.</p>

<p>The fact that Bin Laden&#39;s body was never put on display, or photographed by independent photographers, and the assertion that it was dumped into the ocean, also without witnesses, <em>strongly</em> suggests that it was not Bin Laden&#39;s body. Or that there was no body at all. The whole &quot;burial at sea&quot; nonsense is so ridiculous, I&#39;ve never encountered anyone who believes it.</p>

<p>The facts exist. There are those who know what went on during the raid, and what was done with Bin Laden. There are undoubtedly videos of everything -- the raid, the shooting, the autopsy, the burial at sea (if it actually occurred).</p>

<p>Everything about the raid stinks. Remember when everyone was sitting around the White House, supposedly watching the raid live? And it turned out they weren&#39;t really watching anything? All staged, all faked.</p>

<p>It may be, as many assert, that Bin Laden died years ago, and for reasons of their own the government has been keeping his myth alive. It may be that Bin Laden was always a collaborator with the CIA, and had no real role in 9-11, and that the White House finally decided it was time to execute him (this is the speculation I am favoring in my own mind). But we don&#39;t have the facts, so we can&#39;t know for certain.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/21/osama-bin-laden-death_n_2172275.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/21/osama-bin-laden-death_n_2172275.html</a></p>

<p>Daily Mail &amp; Huffington Post (among others) both confirm emails between officials claiming <em>no</em> US soldiers saw the burial. Also, the first indicates he was wrapped in a white sheet, not a black body bag, and that the Defence Department claim they can find no images or videos of Bin Laden being aboard the USS Carl Vinson.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re lying about meeting the guy, but if you did he probably made up seeing any video feed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair it says,   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The deceased&#39;s body was washed (ablution) then placed in a white sheet. The body was placed in a weighted bag.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, it is possible that the weighted bag he was placed in was black.<br/>
He told me there was a rumor a couple heavy weights went missing from the workout facility.  Could be complete BS, but thought it was interesting...<br/>
At first I was like holy shit you were on the deck?  Hadn&#39;t seen the two articles you linked then.  But he said no, but he saw the bag going over the side via a television set.<br/>
It is kind of interesting the way it says there were no sailors who saw the ceremony/burial.  I could see this as equal to, &quot;there were no sailors on the deck during the ceremony/burial.&quot;<br/>
Ah it says,      </p>

<blockquote>
<p>indicate that no sailors watched Osama bin Laden&#39;s burial at sea     </p>
</blockquote>

<p>it would be easy to interpret that as watched from the sidelines, or with their own eyes.<br/>
He also said only a single person, or very few people, were in the room that shows the location they dropped the body.  Thought that was interesting because someone should know the long/lat in the sea.<br/>
The dude is in a class with me currently, and shit...  See him most days, but hardly speak.  </p>

<p>Honestly, 9/11 would have been the greatest achievement of his life. I&#39;m absolutely sure if he did it and was alive, he would have released countless, CLEAR videos of himself talking about it or celebrating it. I mean, what a great recruitment opportunity right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the email <strong>there were plans underway for a burial on the 29th April, 2011. However, the announcement about Osama Bin Laden’s killing was made on the 1st of May, 2011.</strong> This implies that the president knowingly lied to the whole world about the date that the terrorist was killed. According to Barnett, <strong>there are several emails that prove that the actual mission took place in 28th April and not 1st May</strong> as the president claims. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There were multiple news reports in the week before Obama&#39;s May 1st announcement, about &quot;a confirmed missile strike killing bin laden.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was following <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread700449/pg1">this thread</a> from the start, and tons of people went back on the girl&#39;s twitter page and confirmed that she did make that post on april 28th.
I don&#39;t know shit about twitter but everyone that does seems to agree that you can&#39;t go back and change the dates on stuff...</p>

<p>edit; thread filled up quick with idiots and trolls trying to make people think they&#39;re funny, so I&#39;ll add this here. Her twitter is private now, so you can&#39;t go on it unless you friend her or whatever, but before that happened, and you can see this in the thread I link to above, hundreds of people including me were able to go on, go back through her old posts, and see it/take screengrabs.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t about fox news or their credibility, and it&#39;s not about &quot;believing everything you see on twitter,&quot; it&#39;s about the fact that stories ran about osamas death 3 days before the president came on tv and told a hole-filled, soon-to-completely-change fairytale, and people are still citing it/talking about it like what he told us was the whole truth and nothing but. </p>

<p>Hi everyone. This is my first post.</p>

<p>I wanted to let everyone know that the Fox News channel&#39;s ticker <strong>reported Bin Laden&#39;s death on April 28th, 2011...a few days before Obama and all other media reported it</strong>!!</p>

<p>You can go to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MegNeverLands">www.twitter.com/MegNeverLands</a> and check for the post about it. That&#39;s my Twitter account &amp; I posted about it when I saw it on tv that day, because I thought it was super weird that it was being reported on Fox News, but it wasn&#39;t breaking news, nor was it on any network. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are the obvious general concerns about it. However my particular complaint is that - assuming everything else is true - </p>

<ol>
<li>Seal Six killed bin Laden. </li>
<li>We were then told it was a kill mission. </li>
</ol>

<p>That second agreement conflicts with my understanding of how special forces operate. </p>

<p>Why not send cruise missiles if it was a kill all mission? Seal Six are very expensive and bad pr to lose. </p>

<p>Special forces are not supposed to kill everyone. There are always hostages or high value targets to capture. That&#39;s the whole point of the mission. </p>

<p>If I am right, why in the Bin Laden raid was that basic principle violated. </p>

<p>Also </p>

<p>To this day there is still no coherent version of when the special forces helicopter was lost. It&#39;s either as they arrive or as they are leaving. 
Versions differ. </p>

<p>Ailing bin Laden ‘treated secretly for kidney disease&#39;</p>

<p>ADAM SAGE IN PARIS; OVERSEAS NEWS</p>

<p>KIDNEY stones rather than Stealth bombers could deal a mortal blow to Osama bin Laden it appeared yesterday after reports that the al-Qaeda leader recently smuggled himself into an expensive Gulf hospital. Needing urgent treatment for his ailing kidneys, bin Laden, 44, is said to have checked into the American Hospital in Dubai in July. Among those with him, it is thought, was Dr Ayman Zawahiri, who as well as being his personal physician is al-Qaeda&#39;s second-in-command.</p>

<p>The report in Le Figaro and on Radio France International said that bin Laden had stayed in hospital for ten days. There have been persistent rumours about the frailty of bin Laden&#39;s health. In recent videos he is generally not seen moving about. When he does take a few steps it is with the aid of a cane. Aides blame a back injury. Intelligence sources believe that bin Laden bought a dialysis machine earlier this year which he had shipped to Kandahar. His problem now will be operating such equipment and the risk of infection if, as seems likely, he is hiding out in Afghan mountains.</p>

<p>Last year the magazine Asiaweek said bin Laden was dying of a kidney disease. In desperation he is said to have turned to the United Arab Emirates, one of the three governments that recognised the Taleban regime. Bin Laden is known to have influential supporters in the Emirates and to have kept substantial funds in bank accounts there. He is believed to have flown out of Dubai on the morning of the September 11 hijackings.</p>

<p>According to Western diplomatic sources the UAE was the nearest safe destination for bin Laden to get the high quality, modern and urgent treatment he needed. Quoting an unnamed manager at the American Hospital, Le Figaro said that bin Laden arrived in Dubai on July 4 accompanied by four bodyguards, an Algerian male nurse and Dr Zawahiri, who stayed at his side at all times. They had flown to Dubai from Quetta in Pakistan. The newspaper said that bin Laden was treated in the urology department, run by Terry Callaway, a Canadian-trained doctor, and left on July 14. Dr Callaway is a specialist in kidney stones and male infertility.</p>

<p>During his stay, Le Figaro said, bin Laden was visited by a CIA agent. One source said that the US agent was &quot;recognised taking the main lift in the hospital to go to Osama bin Laden&#39;s room&quot;. The agent was recalled to the US on July 15, the day after bin Laden left hospital, the newspaper said. The CIA last night flatly denied the report. Its spokeswoman, Anya Guelsher, said that it was &quot;complete nonsense&quot;.</p>

<p>A diplomatic source said earlier: &quot;There are lots of rumours flying around Dubai. At first sight, it seems highly unlikely that a member of the CIA would go and knock on bin Laden&#39;s hospital bedroom door.&quot; Bernard Koval, the director of the 100-bed hospital that opened in 1995, also denied that bin Laden had been a patient there. Dr Callaway was unavailable for comment.</p>

<p>Intelligence sources in France also questioned yesterday what US agents did with information that Paris passed to America about bin Laden&#39;s terrorist ambitions just a few days before September 11. One of his lieutenants, Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian, who had been arrested in Dubai on his way back from Afghanistan to Europe, allegedly told police that he had been told by al-Qaeda to plan a terrorist attack on the US Embassy in Paris. Le Figaro said that on September 7 the French intelligence service met embassy officials in Paris to pass on the information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, now you get how conspiracy theories work, maybe you can contribute to a healthy theory sometime!  You see within the framework of a proper conspiracy, collusion must take place in utmost secrecy.  Unfortunately that leaves non-conspirators with little evidence and much speculation. Similar to court deliberation things like motive and suspicion are debated alongside any limited evidence.</p>

<p>Luckily, OP noticed that our federal government (which has a colorful history of deep conspiracy and flagrant opacity) has taken part in blatant evidence suppression and then OP asked for our opinion on the topic.  In no way is this proof of Osama bin Laden&#39;s cause of death, but its a step towards constructing a solid theory that supports collusion to suppress evidence and maybe more.</p>

<p>Have you noticed anything odd about the incident or are you just going to troll around here like a baby back bitch?</p>
