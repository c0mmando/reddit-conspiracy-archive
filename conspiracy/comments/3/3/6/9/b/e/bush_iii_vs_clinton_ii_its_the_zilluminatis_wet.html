<p>no, that would not be the objective.  obviously?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>no, that&#39;s the problem with the current system.  it wouldn&#39;t make any sense to spend more money on the CURRENT system.  a spring-cleaning/overhaul/upgrade/improvement is obviously &quot;LONG OVERDUE&quot;.</p>

<p>how about, who has a vagina (aka. the &quot;first women POTUS&quot;)??</p>

<p>sorry, if i had to pick the single biggest &quot;problem&quot; (capable of contributing the single largest value proposition), it would be &quot;the education system&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, parents should be paid - by the federal government - to homeschool.  (The details can be polished once we agree that the government should spend a lot more money on education -- via all the many and creative ways that it can.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, let&#39;s put it this way:</p>

<p>Which is more likely:  One of these individuals funds public education, or they fund home schools?  It should seem quite obvious which one they would pick.  The United States thrives off of misinformation, and if they let parents teach their kids, what would stop them from teaching their kids about the truth? If politicians have any sort of brain, they would know that making everyone home-schooled would be bad for their agenda.</p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to agree that children should be home-schooled, but getting help from corrupt politicians seems nearly impossible to me.</p>

<p>I can agree with that.  If by present company included you mean me, disagreeing doesn&#39;t make you right/more educated, don&#39;t get that twisted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>compared to kids in public school ?? you&#39;re joking, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was a reference to all children.  They are programmed from the beginning to mimic things they have heard in order to learn.  Public, private, or home school doesn&#39;t matter, that&#39;s just how children are taught.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>homeschooling would save States billions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you are telling me that funding <em>individual houses</em> would cost less that having all of the children in a particular area in one building? That&#39;s ridiculous.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M">In a &quot;Digital Aristotle&quot;</a> sense, maybe.  Paying a parent to teach their own children would in <strong>no way at all</strong> cost less than having a teacher in one paid-for building teach to 20+ children at a time.  I think you might need to go brush up on economics and accounting and consider how much one alternative would cost compared to another.</p>

Clinton has too many scandals that she&#39;ll be spending too much time trying to put out fires and another democrat will have a better platform to actually connect with people. Jeb will have a hard time shaking his brother&#39;s legacy, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of dirt on him as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theyre both crooks.  And liars.  None of the above on a ballot has been upheld in court challenges.  I doubt Ventura will run, but if not, vote none of the above till they get a candidate worth voting for.  Its a shame out of 300 million people, these are the two best we can come up with.</p>
