       Why? So more children can be poisoned by our education system? So the government can continue to paint themselves as the good guys in any time in history? Don't make that decide your vote, put it into a better cause than who can fund more propaganda.

       no, that's the problem with the current system.  it wouldn't make any sense to spend more money on the CURRENT system.  a spring-cleaning/overhaul/upgrade/improvement is obviously "LONG OVERDUE".

       sorry, if i had to pick the single biggest "problem" (capable of contributing the single largest value proposition), it would be "the education system".
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, parents should be paid - by the federal government - to homeschool.  (The details can be polished once we agree that the government should spend a lot more money on education -- via all the many and creative ways that it can.)

       Alright, let's put it this way:
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is more likely:  One of these individuals funds public education, or they fund home schools?  It should seem quite obvious which one they would pick.  The United States thrives off of misinformation, and if they let parents teach their kids, what would stop them from teaching their kids about the truth? If politicians have any sort of brain, they would know that making everyone home-schooled would be bad for their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to agree that children should be home-schooled, but getting help from corrupt politicians seems nearly impossible to me.

       You have to look at it from a business standpoint, it's black or white because the government wouldn't split it.  For them they can push the "truth" to children much easier through public schools and won't help home schools because of that.

       This leads to more misinformation.  Kids do and say anything to seem smart.  They don't always know facts and can only know as much as they have been given.  In an ideal situation, you would be right.  The truth, unfortunately, is not the ideal situation and increased funding would not help with this.

       There was a quote on Agents of Shield I like. It essentially was not one person has 100% of the solution to a problem, but a 100 people with 1% does. We need to have people awakened to combat these things. We need to be able to talk to one another and reach common ground. Human programming is difficult man

       Let's save all that discussion until after one of the candidates pledges to triple the education budget.  None of ya'll have given any good reason to NOT spend more money on education.  (I don't consider "it's hard" a good reason.)

       That was a reference to all children.  They are programmed from the beginning to mimic things they have heard in order to learn.  Public, private, or home school doesn't matter, that's just how children are taught.

      <p>
       So you are telling me that funding
       <em>
        individual houses
       </em>
       would cost less that having all of the children in a particular area in one building? That's ridiculous.

       sense, maybe.  Paying a parent to teach their own children would in
       <strong>
        no way at all
       </strong>
       cost less than having a teacher in one paid-for building teach to 20+ children at a time.  I think you might need to go brush up on economics and accounting and consider how much one alternative would cost compared to another.

       Personally, I don't think that it'll end up being Bush vs Clinton. Doubt they'll win their respective primaries. Clinton has too many scandals that she'll be spending too much time trying to put out fires and another democrat will have a better platform to actually connect with people. Jeb will have a hard time shaking his brother's legacy, and I'm sure there's plenty of dirt on him as well.

       Just my two cents.

       The problem with that Statement is that Obama already won.

       Where's Obama II ?

       Theyre both crooks.  And liars.  None of the above on a ballot has been upheld in court challenges.  I doubt Ventura will run, but if not, vote none of the above till they get a candidate worth voting for.  Its a shame out of 300 million people, these are the two best we can come up with.

       The clout to win and then use the same excuse as Obama about why we have to capitulate to the conservatives because we "can't". That was what I always heard. Even when they had a full majority, executive, house and senate, they said "oh, we can't, it's a weak majority".
