        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am curious if others feel like this. I walk around fully aware I am in a controlled tax farm. Kind of like being in the Middle Ages or something. Sure this farm (called the USA) is preferable to North Korea, Inc. or China, Inc., but most of my work and energy and money is still taken from me and funneled up the pyramid. This is frustrating. However, I do feel a lot more free now that I have a better understanding of what&#39;s going on. My health and focus are much improved and shit seems a lot more epic, like I&#39;m in Star Wars or something, walking around the empire. Finally, I have no urge to argue with people about conspiracies, since it all seems pretty obvious. </p>

<p>What about you guys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just the cold hard facts, Operation Ajax
hardly unique, killing innocent people to blame it on Mosadeiq.</p>

<p>The cia picked out sadam hussein, 
pschological profile: homocidal maniac.</p>

<p>Sold him plenty of weapons with a purpose, 
to go on attack.
Iran Iraq war, half million dead.
Sold him mustard gas, but not on the cheap,</p>

<p>Loans from the US to get the Iraqi people in debt, neck deep.</p>

<p>Gulf of Tonkin, WMD. That government lies to start wars not even a controversy.
He was right: Carrol Quigley
it&#39;s a sham Democracy</p>

<p>two parties pulled by the same puppet master
you can see the strings run through Kissinger: the cold hearted bastard</p>

<p>....want to get punched in the face with my left or my right?
there has been a coup in this country in broad day light</p>

<p>1963... LBJ needed a whitewash investigation to help calm the nation...guess who he hired?....same motherfucker that JFK had just fired!</p>

<p>Allen Dulles ex-head of the CIA...came back to work to coverup foul play. </p>

<p>People bought it because he was old and white and wore a tie.</p>

<p>Nevermind the crap about russians, castro and the mafia...those groups don&#39;t provide media cover.</p>

<p>They killed MLK and gave him a day. 
Trial occurred in 1999...read about it when you have the time..or continue to whine </p>

<p>when shits all fucked up and you figure we just have bad luck. Accidentally getting politicians who lie. Your paychecks or welfare keep coming on time...flouride tv and beer, NFL gives us something to cheer for.</p>

<p>Never want to risk your 401k, your mind and your skills are in decay</p>

<p>virtual prison right out of Huxley...domesticating humans like the sheeple we are. Have a wild night and go to the bar...get a DWI if you get in that car
show your state issued ID...isn&#39;t it exciting. 
take your shoes off to show your a slave...write checks to the IRS this is how you behave
TSA:&quot;papers please! for the homeland&quot; is our new national anthem.
My great-grandpa wouldn&#39;t understand...woulda slapped the fat fuck that told his kid to get oughta the stroller...</p>

<p>Time to get up and stand UP
Time to get bolder. 
They ain&#39;t turning back, til we turn it back for them.
Internet may cause great awakening...but ain&#39;t as easy as it seems...people livin in daydreams...don&#39;t wanna follow the logic of what this all means. 
Still wanna believe in farytales and cherry trees...Hope and change and campaign songs....no one wants to believe they kill innocents with drone bombs.</p>

<p>but they do.</p>

<p>It&#39;s still a conspiracy even if it&#39;s overt. They have so much control now they don&#39;t even feel the need to hide it. They&#39;re more like &#39;what&#39;re you gonna do about it?&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much. Shit&#39;s gonna go south soon enough, I just walk around seeing people bicker about tiny things, minor alights against eachother, barbecuing prowess, whatever.  I mean, enjoy your stuff and time and all, but when anything economy-related or poverty-related comes up, and you brush it off as... yeah, conspiracy, or something g so trivial and meaningless that it&#39;s not worth spending thought on. In my mind I&#39;m all &quot;alright man, hope you at least bought gold bullion or something&quot;, but I k ow well enough. They&#39;re miles in debt, driving a new truck, and don&#39;t have even the slightest idea how to cut back expenses.</p>

<p><em>sigh</em> Record debt, record separation of wealth, record population, full time jobs swapped for temp jobs, rampant corruption, worse economic conditions than immediately before the great depression of the 1930&#39;s, and a recession approximately every 7 years (we&#39;re at 8 since the last one)?  Does nobody pay attention to either the news OR history?</p>

The native populations aren&#39;t getting married, nor are they having children at replacement, every western countries natives are breeding below replacement level, and the immigrants are breeding above (not to even mention intermarriage).

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting how you conflate the genetics of intelligence with racial superiority, yet many of the articles you link to explain just that difference so I&#39;m not even sure you read them.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s pretty clear that your &quot;data&quot; that supports your worldview is actually just a cheap excuse to frame the world in your pre-existing notions. When challenged to bring forth your data <strong>you didn&#39;t have any existing scientific studies at hand, you went to Google and brought back blog links. Blog. Links.</strong></p>

<p>Seeing as it didn&#39;t even occur to you to try to link reputable scientific material, even if you had access to the data I&#39;d imagine it wouldn&#39;t make a hint of difference (what with you already having made up your mind, and your very probable lack of the statistical toolset required to draw meaningful conclusions.)</p>

X-american was a common term, but they were still AMERICANS</p>

<p>Last time Europe faced an immigration problem was when the arabs where invading, the crusades stopped that shit real quick, shame Europe is gonna suicide now. Ah well, worlds gonna burn yadda yadda, nothing anyone can do to stop it, just gonna enjoy the blaze while it lasts.</p>

<p>Yep.

<p>Try not to draw too much attention to yourself.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s best to keep your ideas to yourself, be smart and blend in.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am reminded of that line near the end of Michael Cimino&#39;s &quot;Heaven&#39;s Gate,&quot; after defeat has been snapped from the jaws of victory: &quot;You can&#39;t force salvation on people, Jim.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s what it is, exactly. You can only figure this stuff out for yourself and you can share information when the opportunity arises, but you can&#39;t force anyone to accept things they&#39;re not prepared to accept.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why the slow drip-drip-drip of media/societal/education brainwashing is so effective....it gradually makes people draw what they think are their own conclusions, but they&#39;ve been guided there.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also why the internet is so dangerous to the people who control media/society/education, because alternative and subversive views are blossoming and becoming harder and harder to keep down.</p>

<p>I am becoming increasingly, cautiously optimistic for at least a certain educated segment of our society. More people are seeing things don&#39;t add up. I really think the next time they try to pull a 911/Boston bombing/Paris shooting/London bombing, the people might not rally as quickly to believe. Unless it&#39;s a nuke or EMP, which is probably what I&#39;d do next, because shit&#39;s getting real. </p>

Most people i have the 911 conversation with think something is fishy about the whole ordeal but can&#39;t wrap their minds around the behind the scenes job our government had its hand in. Questioning everything involved with the aftermath is to much to wrap their minds around. People are comfortable, and fear what it would mean to question everything that the people you are supposed to trust do. </p>

<p>Its sad, frustrating and extremely irritating that most people wont be woken up until the system starts to collapse and join us in the streets because no one can find work because no business can stay open and our government supports a failing system by supporting big banks and businesses that are to big to fail...

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to claim that I&#39;m doing more than any other guy, but every time I see a post from this particular user it&#39;s always a rant about, literally, the same thing. Just reaffirmation of your own beliefs over and over again. When you post this shit on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> who is going to change their minds? This is the shit that most people on this sub already agree with.</p>

<p>Everyone needs to wake up, yadda yadda yadda. </p>

<p>Everyone needs to start realizing that our world is fucked up, yadda yadda yadda.</p>

<p>Take control of your life yadda yadda yadda</p>

<p>I started coming to this sub a few weeks ago, and I&#39;m trying&#39; man. I&#39;m trying to look at news more objectively, and whatnot. But when I come across these posts, I just get really confused. Will I become like <a href="/u/poptart_fiend">/u/poptart_fiend</a>? Will I start coming off as some elitist asshole who mentions how enlightened I am about how the world is being controlled by the &quot;elites&quot;? The moment you start believing you&#39;re better than other people just because you know more than someone else is the moment that you become just as evil as the &quot;elites&quot;. </p>

<p>And FYI, the conspiracies on this sub are not obvious. If it were obvious then we wouldn&#39;t be considered conspiracy theorists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, I appreciate your reply. I agree I can be repetitive sometimes, which is why I&#39;ve recently been submitting more links (check my post history.) Also, part of the reason I&#39;ve been writing a lot of self posts is that waking up has been one the most intense experiences of my life and sometimes I just need to get stuff off my chest. </p>

<p>Also, as for the conspiracies not being obvious - I don&#39;t disagree. It would probably take a lifetime to unravel everything. What I meant is more that the knowledge I&#39;ve gained has fundamentally changed my awareness of day-to-day life. The world literally looks different, which is really trippy. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you have to worry about becoming &quot;like me&quot; haha. Waking up has made me much happier, more social, etc. not the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I get it. But your self posts are a call to action. You&#39;re telling people to start believing in things they already believe and I just don&#39;t see the point. If you really wanted to help people see what you see, why not convince the people who are skeptical?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not even just you. It&#39;s all people who post stuff like this on this sub. Look at the replies. Everyone agrees! You&#39;re not convincing anyone of anything. It&#39;s just reaffirming your own beliefs. If you want change to happen, you have to get people who don&#39;t believe to start believing in the truth.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t really planning on writing this much, but here&#39;s my gripe. People come into this sub and ask for condensed and simple explanations on some of the more tin-foily and complex conspiracies. And often, the reply will be along the lines of: just look it up, go down the rabbit hole, or why don&#39;t you just read the article. And sometimes it gets as bad as linking a Google page with whatever term inside it. How do you expect people to start believing in the &quot;truth&quot; if that&#39;s how they&#39;re replied to? Some people are busy with their lives. Some people have families and they have jobs that occupy most of their free time. In this sub, they&#39;re referred to as law-abiding citizens, sheeple, and the like. But then you forget that they are also <strong>fellow human beings</strong>. They are not the enemy. This is a neutral party that needs swaying to come over to the good side. So rather than bash people for being stuck in the system, why not throw them a rope or flash a light at the end of the dark tunnel? </p>

<p>EDIT: I feel like I should clarify. a TL;DR version would basically be me saying you should focus on your efforts on convincing people stuck in the system, not people already outside of it.</p>

<p>I agree with you 100%. I&#39;m guilty of this myself. It&#39;s not easy figuring out people who genuinely want to learn or who come here to mock or derail the stories presented. But try to remember many of us are going through a process that isn&#39;t quite completed. </p>

<p>The main reason I come here is because I know there are a lot of good people who are going through the same process as I am. It gives me comfort in a way. And yes it often becomes a circle-jerk. Nobody is perfect.</p>

<p>Yes, the fact that some of us know that we are definitively on a prison planet when so many others still seem pretty thoroughly unaware of this fact <em>is</em> something that sets those of us who know <em>ahead</em> of those of us who don&#39;t.  However, the pig that can set himself apart from the others by knowing that he&#39;s in a slaughter house...IS STILL IN A SLAUGHTERHOUSE.</p>

<p>Apart from coming together as one species and working together to break out of the slaughterhouse <em>together</em> (a thing that&#39;s difficult enough to do since the farmers in control of the slaughterhouse make sure and keep the pigs fighting and at odds with each other so that the pigs never unify <em>against</em> the farmer), it certainly seems that working toward developing your own sense of individual understanding and awareness <em>on your own</em> and independent of anyone else is a big key.</p>

<p>You seem to be doing that, so cheers.  Awesome.  I guess I&#39;m just saying don&#39;t get <em>too</em> satisfied with that, as we have a LOOOONG way to go as a species - individually and collectively.</p>

<p>Very well-said, sir.  Agreed.  More important things than just &quot;comfort&quot; come to the fore once you start waking up.</p>

<p>Yeah - that&#39;s been a big part of the conspiracy for me. (Not that I am elite), but I always wondered how elites have historically had so much damn energy. You read about Teddy Roosevelt and it sounds like the guy is from a different freaking species compared to the average person. Now it&#39;s starting to make more sense...</p>

<p>It&#39;s because I think they&#39;re working toward a bigger, greater goal.  Even though that goal might be looked upon as misguided or even abominable by some (many), the fact that they themselves seem to believe in it to the extent that they do I imagine gives them a sense of purpose that helps them keep working hard and moving forward toward this goal.</p>

<p>All this can be very much likened to the ultimate point behind <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/14utv0/911_was_an_occult_megaritual_the_numbers_of_the_4/c7gwqaz">the information here</a>.</p>

<p>And what is a TL;DR on the wall of text found in the link?  Well, the ultimate point in all the info (independent of any specific dates or &quot;predictions&quot; that didn&#39;t or may not have come to pass, etc) is that there is a species of being here on this planet that are not <em>from</em> here, but that have a vested interest in helping the entire human race evolve into <em>better</em> beings...but the manner that they are helping the human species better itself by absolutely bombarding it with a some <em>extremely</em> difficult trials and tribulations - some <em>very</em> hard lessons - many of which can be looked upon as being excruciatingly difficult if not boarder line sadistic.  It&#39;s &quot;tough love&quot; so to speak that they&#39;re said to be giving us.  This race is said to look very much like us - outwardly indistinguishable from us, in fact...but they are not like us at all.</p>

<p>Shit gets very deep.</p>

People are more likely to listen to you if you agree with what they say for a while before you start inserting little cracks into their politics/philosophy.

And as they focus on it the fuzzyness fades into crystal clarity like the lense on a manual camera, eventually their awareness of this crack in the glass will become hyper awareness and every time they hit a bump in the road their eyes will instinctively dart back to that crack to see if it has grown and spread.   With enough cracks, and the unavoidable bumps in the road, the windscreen will in time become an obstruction to their vision and they will be forced to replace it with a new one (world view).</p>

Great post btw. If you dig deeper, the meat suits we inhabit are also programmed with its own operating system called ego, as well as, the animalistic urges of the body also manifest in forms of urges to sleep with every woman, the urge to procreate, limited energy, limited lifespan. Our existence here is the ultimate conspiracy.</p>

<p>Now if you study the world&#39;s/histories philosophy on why we are here, I tend to side with Buddhist cosmology as far as we are all stuck in a cycle of reincarnation and the only way to break free is enlightenment. Or perhaps reaching Union w God as the Christian esoterics teach</p>

The sooner I don&#39;t have to spend the best hours of the day of the best years of my life breaking my back and brain slaving away for the privilege of living paycheque to paycheque, barely scraping enough together to put food in my fridge, AND doing it with a forced smile on my face, the better.</p>

<p>Whelp, enough daydreaming, time to force that smile back onto my face and earn my Mr. Noodles like the faceless drone that I am.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My man we are of like mind. .. an analogy would be if your family works hard and builds a nice big house. . If you see a neighbors family in trouble you could invite them into your home providing they help out with the chores and clean up after themselves. . That would be the right thing to do. .. however if another family who would disrespect your rules demand that your respect there foreign customs showed up and demanded that they get the same treatment. .. ignoring the fact that it is your house... you would be in the right to say. . Sorry all full</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LEL, most of those &quot;previous immigrants&quot; were from Europe  (Higher IQ averages than africans or arabs for one, they also integrated into the US system) The culture of the US was still in tact as well, being an american actually fucking meant something. X-american was a common term, but they were still AMERICANS</p>

<p>Last time Europe faced an immigration problem was when the arabs where invading, the crusades stopped that shit real quick, shame Europe is gonna suicide now. Ah well, worlds gonna burn yadda yadda, nothing anyone can do to stop it, just gonna enjoy the blaze while it lasts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are the one who is unable to change your mind, I&#39;ve been convinced with both data and experience, but you have me pegged as a raysist so no point continuing. </p>

<p>Secondly, lot of those articles REFERENCE sources, and EXPLAIN THEM, I don&#39;t know what your level of intelligence is but considering you seem to be a liberal I can&#39;t take chances. </p>

<p>Nice job trying to move them goalposts though, no way in hell you actually read the material and watched that 45 min video. Good jerb, 10/10 would Postmodern again.</p>
