        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Issue #1: But we&#39;re running out of space! Oh no, it&#39;s because we build too many malls and schools and houses and we should focus on building more apartments to efficiently store many humans in area. We are overpopulated!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/249896/eib14_reportsummary_1_.pdf">http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/249896/eib14_reportsummary_1_.pdf</a></p>

<p>The US has 2.3 billion acres of land.
Land use for all agriculture is 52%.
35% of all land used for &quot;grazing,&quot; meaning animals.
19.5% for cropland (this is including plants that are grown to feed the animals).
These don&#39;t add to 52, so I&#39;m assuming either some grazing applies to wild animals or some of the crops are not used to feed people or animals. However, there is only a 2.5% difference, so it really doesn&#39;t matter. We&#39;ll assume this is lost.</p>

<p>805 million acres of land for the purpose of maintaining animals. Plus 46 million (estimated) for crops to feed animals.
Animals are not necessary at all. Homes and schools are.</p>

<p>Issue #2: We don&#39;t have enough food! We&#39;re running out and so we have to turn to GMOs (aside: I am not against these) and other practices to make sure we don&#39;t starve! It&#39;s our fault because we are overpopulated. Too many babies. This is also why we can&#39;t share food. We don&#39;t have anything.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/cropmajor.html">http://www.epa.gov/agriculture/ag101/cropmajor.html</a></p>

<p>According to this, the major crops grown are corn (84 million acres), soybeans (74), hay (56), and wheat (46). 
80% of corn is grown to feed livestock. 
50% of soybeans used to feed livestock.
Hay is mainly used for domestic production. This is good!
22% of wheat is used for animals. 70% is for domestic. This is not very good.</p>

<p>Most of the food that we do grow goes to feeding animals. If we were to take away that intermediate step, we would have MORE than enough for ourselves and lots to spare for others. </p>

<p>Issue #3: We&#39;re running out of water! It&#39;s because we take long showers and want pretty lawns and pools and fountains! It&#39;s all our fault for being so wasteful! But it&#39;s inevitable. We must use water, so we&#39;ll just have to accept there&#39;s not enough for the current number of inhabitants.</p>

<p><a href="http://www2.worldwater.org/data20082009/Table19.pdf">http://www2.worldwater.org/data20082009/Table19.pdf</a></p>

<p>Water use is 355 billion gallons per day.
1000-1800 liters per kg to grow corn. 
1100-2000 for soybeans.
1000 for hay.
900-2000 for wheat.</p>

<p>For animals (this includes water for feed):
Sheep 6,100
Goat 4,000
Beef 15,000 to 70,000
Chicken 3,500 to 5,700
Eggs 3,300</p>

<p>It is our fault, but not in the way we were raised to believe. The world is more than capable of sustaining our current population! Every problem we are encountering is directly because of the animal farming system. It does not benefit us AT ALL. The only thing it does is provide a luxury, and unfortunately (or fortunately), we cannot sustain our current dependency on it. There are a slew of other problems that are caused by these farms: cancer, diabetes, expanding waistlines, pollution (THIS is a biggie), the contamination of our water, the mistreatment of workers on these farms, deforestation, species extinction, and last but certainly not least, the torture and exploitation of creatures that do not deserve it. All to give us our double cheeseburgers (which are cheap because corn and soybeans are subsidized by the government and that&#39;s what they feed the animals!) so we can become fat and sick and addicted (casein is a component of cheese that, when broken down by the body, releases casomorphins, which have an opiate effect). Then we give our money to health insurance companies and hospitals only to come back to the animal products. Literally eating ourselves (and our planet) to death and paying the ones responsible.</p>

<p>So! What can you do? Get educated. Attempt to adopt a plant-based diet. You don&#39;t have to do it all at once. Start with meatless Mondays one week, add tofu Tuesdays the next, etc. Support local animal sanctuaries. r/vegan gives great advice and welcomes everyone with open arms, whether you want to change or just want to argue.
Some further documentaries: Vegucated (this is relatable), Cowspiracy (this is facts), Earthlings (this shows how the animal industries work and will make you hate yourself).
There are some places I did not include sources because I was too lazy to find them. If you really want them, just ask. I am more than happy to oblige.</p>

<p>But OP! I won&#39;t change anything! I will change if everyone else changes, but by myself I won&#39;t make a difference.
And to that I have to say that you will. &quot;Each day, a person who eats a vegan (plant-based) diet saves 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq ft of forested land, 20 lbs CO2 equivalent, and one animal’s life.&quot; - <a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/">http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/</a>
The fact of the matter is every person makes a difference. Knowing the facts and trying your best to help the planet will make a difference. You bring awareness just by existing and talking about it to those that are interested.
Slavery and the oppression of women were stopped because people spoke up. The holocaust was started by a relatively small group of people, but they fought for something. It was terrible and left a mark on the survivors and their offspring, but it goes to show that any group of people with enough conviction can make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is asking for a complete change in lifestyle choice from people. Quite a few vegans will not wear/use animal products such as leather. That&#39;s a drastic amount of overall change. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been a (lacto ovo) vegetarian for almost my entire life. I grow almost all of my own organic fruits, vegetables, coffee, and other oddities. </p>

<p>I love cheese, eggs from our free range chickens, honey and bee pollen way too much to go vegan. I do source locally produced organic cheeses etc. </p>

<p>As a vegetarian I also raise animals to butcher for my family whom all eat meat. We all hunt and trap, fish and gather sustainably from the sea. We also use as much from the animal as possible. The hide, fur, we carve bones and make traditional crafts from boar teeth, we use shells from edible sea creatures for squid lures and other crafts,  large fish bones from marlin are crafted into traditional weapons, and 
various other applications. </p>

<p>There is a huge difference in home raised meat vs. factory farmed animals. The same can be said of personal fishing vs. buying commercially harvested /raised fish. That same difference can also be applied to commercially grown transgenic (gmo) crops and homegrown organic heirloom edibles. I find it almost contradictory that you take a pro gmo stance along with a pro vegan one. </p>

<p>Encouraging people to make small lifestyle choices in a healthier direction rather than a complete lifestyle change seems more fitting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, I jumped straight to vegan and that&#39;s not the point of this post. I fixed it.</p>

<p>To clarify, a plant-based diet is when you choose to exclude animal products from your diet. Being vegan means excluding all forms of animal exploitation from your life, such as purchasing wool or leather products, consuming honey, and using products tested on animals or composed of animal-byproducts (soaps, shampoos, deodorant, detergents, creams, etc.). This can be quite the change from a normal omnivorous lifestyle.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s great that you actively grow your own food! Of course you love cheese. It has super concentrated amounts of casein when compared to milk, which makes it addictive. Literally. And it&#39;s wonderful you don&#39;t contribute to animal farming (as much)! But most people do not have the option of buying locally sourced food items or growing their own chickens and animals. You are a lucky minority. For them, it would be much simpler and cheaper to just substitute meat, milk, eggs, and cheese with lentils, beans, tofu, and vegetables. 
Your lifestyle still does support the usage of large amounts of land for growing animals (locally sourced still means people grow them to sell them), and although I personally do not find it ideal or sustainable for a majority of the population, it&#39;s working for you and that&#39;s good, and I would much rather support this way of living than the average way.</p>

<p>Everything is GMO. Most vegans that live by facts (which are a lot since the &quot;organic&quot; lifestyle is unrealistic for a majority of the population) support GMOs. The facts are:
All plants that we eat are GMOs. Artificial selection (which is what humans have been doing for thousands of years) makes GMOs, just at a much slower rate than the direct insertion of a gene. Genes that ward off bugs can make pesticides a thing of the past. Genes that increase the crop yield per square foot by warding off bacteria or increasing the size of the plants can make it easier for us to support a growing population without using as much land and generating as much waste. I do not see a down side besides possible adverse effects. 
The FDA tests them for 2-3 years before releasing them. Introducing new genes to a plant simply means different proteins will be consumed by us. These tests make sure there will be no adverse effects. I feel iffy about this because I do not like depending on the government, but if you wage a war on GMOs (especially now) you will lose.</p>

<p>Vegans are not anti-GMO. They are not all-organic, mother nature is the best, tree-huggers. They are people that do not wish to contribute to a system of animal suffering. There is absolutely no link between animal cruelty and GMOs.</p>

<p>In my post, I do encourage small changes, but the main point is that unless we stop paying the factory farms, they will fuck us over. The point of my post was to educate and provide resources for changing one&#39;s life (one of which is me). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and I both have extremely different views on many things. </p>

<p>It seems that you are parroting a narrative most often told by transgenic cheerleaders. Everything is not GMO as you put it. </p>

<p>Selective breeding is not in the same category as gene splicing and artificially inserting those genes. If Mother Nature had intended for that, she&#39;d have surely found a way herself for that to arise naturally. </p>

<p>&quot;Most vegans that live by facts&quot; would educate themselves to know the difference rather than repeating a fallacy told to them. </p>

<p>I am an heirloom seed saver. You&#39;d be suprised how quickly those plants change and adapt through selection in successive generations. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re so against cruelty to living beings, then perhaps you should consider a fruitarian or even breatharian lifestyle? </p>

<p>It is an oxymoron to declare that &quot;I do not see a downside besidess possible adverse effects&quot;. What are you saying in that statement? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure you know how to convey your points without coming off as confusing and contradictory on many levels. </p>

<p>Genes that ward of insects are not making pesticides a thing of the past in transgenic farming. </p>

<p>Some might say that a direct link to cruelty and transgenic crops is the link to humans suffering. As well as unborn children. But the most obvious link is environmental cruelty and how the technology affects the ecosystem in ways often overlooked and ignored by progmo advocates. </p>

<p>If your point is to educate, then perhaps you might consider educating yourself before writing in a public forum and confusing the subject you seem so passionate about. </p>

<p>Best of luck on your vegan revivalist pro gmo campaign. Aloha. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we do. But I didn&#39;t really post this to argue about views. I posted this to present facts and make people think twice about supporting a system that&#39;s all about bleeding their wallets and destroying their bodies and homes.</p>

<p>I am a microbiology major about to graduate. I have worked with GMOs in several labs. I am working with them now. I know many other scientists that work with GMOs. This is my life. Trust me, I know what they are and I don&#39;t want to be educated on this topic by an anonymous internet stranger. My stance on them is not the issue. It is a highly debated topic and there is a lot of misleading information on both sides. The less-than-ethical approaches that have been taken by Monsanto does not help. I was just talking about the potential benefits, but I did not write a whole post about animal farming facts to discuss a couple of words on my opinion about GMOs. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I don&#39;t believe in mother nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Skipping the cruelty comment. You nitpick. Focus on the bigger picture.</p></li>
<li><p>Adverse effects: The introduction of super weeds, bacteria have been known to evolve quickly under pressure so taking away a main breeding ground for them could make them develop some resistance, same with bugs and weeds. It can affect other organisms dependent on these plants. There are many possibilities. I&#39;m not getting into it.</p></li>

<p><strong>The main point you are ignoring is we are using our resources and taking it away from fellow humans to support the growth of animals unnecessary for our survival.</strong> This is what I want to discuss. Everyone is either unaware or avoiding the topic entirely, pretending like there is an easy solution, but there isn&#39;t. This is the biggest conspiracy. Almost all of our problems are caused by our mass consumption of animal products and this is being hidden by all the fucking corporations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While vegetarian is a step, the point is the industries most harmful are the egg and milk because we have to use our resources to raise the animal and keep it alive so it can provide.</p>

<p>The milk: You have to grow the cow using food, water, land. Artificially inseminate it and impregnate it then wait for the calf to pop out. Rinse and repeat 4 times. This is a process that takes years. The meat comes after the cow stops producing as much milk and starts costing the industry money to keep alive.</p>

<p>The eggs: Again, you have to raise the chickens and keep them alive. In a barn or cages. This takes land and food and water. And again, we only eat the meat once they&#39;re done.</p>

<p>Meat is leftovers. Stopping the consumption of meat still supports allocating our resources to these useless industries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not always, but a good majority (like 80%) yes. </p>

<p>Tell me, if you were a businessman, would you raise male cows or female ones? Considering the fact you can feed them on plants that are paid for by the government and they consume roughly the same amount of water. The answer is female. They can make milk and then you can sell their corpses. Males you just have to grow, but you&#39;re wasting valuable time, money, and space waiting for them to become big and they can&#39;t do much in return.</p>

<p>The reality is most grow females and the baby calves that are male are slaughtered and made into veal while the ones that are female are grown to then make more milk. The females that cannot make milk as efficiently become burgers.
As for chickens, there are those specifically raised for meat (6 to 7 weeks growing time), and cutting them from your diet is definitely helpful, but cutting eggs would be even better since they are grown for several years (2-4), which means they use up more resources.</p>

<p>Technically, the best things to cut out in order are: dairy, burgers, steak, pigs, eggs, chicken, veal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mmmm. Regardless of what kind you buy, they use resources. Free range (although it is a lie) arguably uses much more resources than just caged. And we still would have to feed them and water them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how much resources growing bugs for commercial consumption would take, but they do grow quickly and some are full of protein. So that is one option. Much better than animals.</p>

<p>And the best way to stop this is to stop supporting the use of animal food items.</p>

<p>The UK still grows animals the same way the rest of the world does and it does have factory farms, in case you were wondering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My whole post is about how we do not have the resources to support this global consumption of animal products. This is the point. The point you keep avoiding. Where will we find the land and the water and food? We&#39;re already running out. How will we maintain this?
It&#39;s not about the freedom to eat meat. It&#39;s not about ethics. It&#39;s not about responsible farming. It&#39;s about the <strong>fact</strong> that we do not have enough water and food to grow animals, and we should not use what we do have on things not necessary for our survival.</p>

<li>Almost nobody is aware of the impact animal farms have. Reason: advertisements, propaganda, cultural integration. It&#39;s the norm nobody questions.</li>
<li>Politicians are paid a lot and heavily influenced by the meat industry. It has a lot of power. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/meat/politics/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/meat/politics/</a></li>
<li>Politicians appeal to people. If people do not want something, why would politicians go out of their way to make a law that would require not only educating these people and <strong>forcing</strong> them to adopt a whole new way of life? <strong>AND</strong> it would put a lot of pressure on many major food chains. This will be met with a lot of backlash and cries about freedom being taken away.</li>
<li>Hence, we should focus on educating people. Start with the ones who make these choices. Inform them of what is going on. That is what I&#39;m doing with this post.</li>

<p>Several of my friends in University are science majors. Some have taken environmental classes and they tell me either the classes don&#39;t mention factory farms at all or talk about it for a few minutes. None of the classes I have taken have mentioned it, but my classes were mostly about genes, microorganisms, and lab techniques. I have taken one class about ecology, and while the teacher was very passionate about the environment, he never did bring up animal farming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not as good as I thought it would be. I have some points:</p>

<p>b) It mentions water can be polluted by sewage, but I think there should be an emphasis on animal feces.</p>

<p>c) There is not mention that most of the farming is to support animals.</p>

<p>d, h, i) The land used for rice fields does not even begin to compare to the land used for cattle. Also, there is no mention of nitrous oxide, almost 60% of which is released by animal agriculture. “It has a global warming potential of approximately 300, meaning it is 300 times more active than CO2 per unit mass. And it’s 10 to 15 times more potent than methane.” <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2012/12/04/nitrous-oxide-levels-in-california/">http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2012/12/04/nitrous-oxide-levels-in-california/</a></p>

<p>Overall, it does not do a good job of educating about the impact animal agriculture has and instead seems to be providing the minimum amount of information to point at when shit hits the fan. Governments like to do that whole &quot;but we totally told you guys about this problems and you chose not to listen so whoops.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, the dynamic of factory farming is definitely one that is powerful enough that those agencies in control of it will definitely have some significant say in global matters - matters that influence more than just factory farming specifically.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like to think that&#39;s not a majority of the world, but I do not know how many people depend on them.</p>

<p>Think about how dependent much of the United States is on such a thing…and think about how globally manipulative the United States in general is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just wish more people saw how integrated this system is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is the very reason why I brought up above that those powers controlling the factory farming dynamic also have their hands in matters more globally far reaching as well.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Absolutely.  And all this that you correctly point out deals only with one area of the issue overall.  The political influence that exists is very, very powerful as well.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the main point here is that, as per your OP question, the factory farming issue as a whole is one that deals with not just food, but with <em>power</em> - power over the masses.  These are <em>very</em> important issues, and I wouldn’t be in the least surprised if the forces in control of this area are are powerful enough to significantly influence the global allocation of resources as well.</p>
