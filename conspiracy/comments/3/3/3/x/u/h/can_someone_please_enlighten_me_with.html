       It's a veiled psychological work in order to familiarize US citizens with the tools of the upcoming crackdown.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was recently a video of an individual pulled over by an APC (Armoured personnel carrier) in Florida. They were virtually indistinguishable from soldiers serving in the military. This becoming an acceptable practice would be a result of familiarization.

       I guess I'm not 100% convinced americans would rise up if martial law were enacted, full force, even a decade ago. Though this sort of familiarization would certainly lead to less resistance in the future if it were to take place.

       I'll explain why it would concern me, if I was American. The military has two principal functions - to protect the country from invasion (guard dogs), and to enforce the nation's strategic objectives overseas (attack dogs). Historically, the military has no active function inside the Homeland, and has hitherto always been
       <strong>
        kept apart
       </strong>
       from its own country's civilians (apart from states of emergency).
      </p>
      <p>
       The military live and work on special military bases. If they train outside those bases, it will be on Federal Land set aside for that purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jade Helm 15 is very unusual because it is allowing the military to "bleed" into the community. They will be conducting an active military operation amongst US civilians, on private land. It raises some important questions, with no obvious answers. Why are they allowing the nation's "attack dogs" off the reservation? What are they hoping to gain from this "exercise"? What are they preparing for?

       does it bother you that the UN seems to be so involved? i could be wrong, but everything i am seeing is saying that this is all part of a lead up to a large, even global maybe, scaled war.

       It is clear that some influential elements in the US elite are desperate to start wars, and they are inventing pretexts all over the place (Ukraine, Syria, Iran, Yemen, North Korea etc etc). I am struggling to see who or what is going to be attacking the US, unless it is US elite v the people.

       yeah maybe, but with UN and BR paratroopers being involved in some of the "exercises" does that not raise some questions for you? 1)why have training like this at all if not preparing for some kind of violent opposition and 2)why bring in military from other places to have them train too?

       This is a massive psy-op. And according to
       <a href="/u/kit8642">
        /u/kit8642
       </a>
       by looking at the sources and information coming out of info wars, reporter Joe Biggs has received txt messages from SOF members telling him to "shut up" and "you don't know what you're talking about it, it's just a psy-op".
      </p>
      <p>
       So imo it is most definitely a psychological operation in order to condition the public to seeing a higher than normal military presence on the streets.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the current information that has been leaked, the 1200+ special forces members taking part in the exercise may be wearing civilian clothes or 'mixed uniforms' like fatigue bottoms and a t-shirt. They will also be driving around in civilian vehicles, or getting rides in the back of civilian driven vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest concern I believe is the unprecedented amount of military presence already occurring in the areas.

       thanks for the reply. i agree. it is all a bit scary. my biggest concern, though, is that i keep seeing people talking about how this is ultimately going to lead up to a large scale war. any thoughts about that? i also think that while there is a lot of corruption, there are a lot of people fighting for good in the world, if something this drastic starts happening, do you think we will start to see more open opposition?

       I follow the news, and geopolitics roughly 12 hours a day. From Yemen to Ukraine the potential for the U.S. to get involved in large scale warfare, I think, hasn't been this great in the last 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       However that being said if Jade Helm does bring about some sort of nazi style round-ups of citizens I believe yes. There will be major resistance groups.

       in my opinion, i don't think it is too big of a stretch to see Russia furthering its advance into Ukraine and possibly making other fronts as well. if that happens i think it is also not too big a stretch to imagine European powers taking a stand against it. am i off base here?
      </p>
      <p>
       also in my opinion, if the US does start engaging in nazi style round ups, i would not be surprised to extra-national opposition as we as inter-national opposition. but i also think that would be pretty obvious to the government, so i am curious to what kind of pay off that would have, if any?

       Ukraine is a situation the I believe is inevitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       However jumping ahead in priority is this recent drudge headline and subsequent AP article detailing the potential for naval warfare between the United states and Iran in the Gulf of Aden.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent footage shows 1000's of MRAPS and various other war fighting equipment being staged in Barstow California. It's seems unlikely it will be used for Jade Helm 15 and instead used for a possible upcoming invasion of Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this is all theoretical and of course potentially nothing at all will occur. I'm hoping for the later.

       Don't forget that the U.S. currently has an armored division and adviser units in Ukraine right now. Along with drills taking place in Poland.

       It's guaranteed. Nato will surely be involved, so essentially all of Europe, and the U.K. Just Like Russia and China will back Iran. Allies V.S. Axis WWIII basically. We're overdue for a good war.

       my concern is that these pressure points have been boiling for quite some time now, and you're right, it is overdue, but how does this tie into jade helm. with how planned out our nation seems to be, i can't help but think there is some underlying connection between the two things. on the one hand inevitable war in europe involving everyone, on the other hand the US and britain and UN training for either potential violent revolt or martial law...

       Perhaps the inevitable war will collapse the dollar or perhaps we become attacked and the electricity goes out. No electricity for more than 5 days = absolute chaos. Could be training for that.

       I would like to point this out to anyone taking u/Goldilocks_is_cool's suggestion. Alex Jones is a POS and has done more harm than good to the conspiracy community, but his team and him are really effective if you can look past their theory and just use their sources.  They do have a shit ton of good content to support their theory, but they use it all to push their own agenda.  That's my advise, ditch their theory but use their sources.  Good suggestion Goldie!

       You guys keep making these claims but you are jumping the shark (which is quite a feat for the conspiracy community). There's no evidence Alex Jones works for the bad guys. Just pure fantasy and speculation and bad dot connecting.

       I think Jones is on the payroll of someone to push certain agenda's.  Whether it be the FBI (Hal Turner style) or all of his advertisers, he is pushing an agenda.  The way he conducts himself is clearly discrediting the whole conspiracy community.  I use to listen to him back in 06-09 and he slowly got worst and worst.  He would have tons of topics he would cover and bring up great points and information, but as time when on, he would start foaming at the mouth and just start yelling and screaming about topics for hours.  It was very off putting from and I couldn't listen anymore.  He does more harm than good as a spokes person for the community.

       Thank you, it's been a while and I couldn't remember all the reason I had stopped listening.  This was one of them, he started to claim every headline in the news was because of the NWO, and never was there a shred of doubt it could be just coincidence.  When listeners would call in and try and calm him down and add a little reality into the news, he would rant about how they were shills and were harassing him and just loose it for an hour on just that.  Even with relatively small things that didn't really matter.  Another reason was because he kept hyping some huge news that he was going to break and it being some dumb shit or product he was selling.
