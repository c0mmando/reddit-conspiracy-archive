    <div class="md"><p>I am going to tell you what I believe to a good appoximation.  I&#39;ll start with a history of my beliefs, using the Masons as an example.</p>

<p>I used to think the Masons ran the world from a secret government.  I had been to court and seen the Masons display hand signals which the judge seemed to follow.  I had been granted special status in my hometown by my Mason father.  So I knew they had power in the government.</p>

<p>Then I found out the Masons are <em>part</em>  of a system of many world governments.  Primarily what they offer is something like a worker&#39;s union, for elite world government people.  The Masons have a certain amount of power and their members are a certain amount protected from the other secret world governments.  A small part of the reason the other governments allow the Masons some independence of action is that they enforce a system of rules and hierarchy on their members.  The Masonic oath swears to kill those who betray the secrets, and meetings have a system of rules in which penalties can be assessed against members for socials behavior that doesn&#39;t meet the standard.  (e.g., for interrupting a superior, the lesser member may experience that superior removing a &quot;jewel&quot; from the lapel of the offender.  Until the jewel is returned, the penalized member is not allowed to speak.)</p>

<p>Early on, I thought that the Masons had infiltrated/formed the various branches of government.  For example, I knew there were Masons in the police and had personally seem them arrive to &quot;handle&quot; the arrest (non-arrest) of one of their brothers.</p>

<p>But I also knew that the U.S. CIA is itself a form of secret world government.  A few presidents have pointed out that the National Security Council and the CIA take actions in secret without the authorization of the President, and advance their own agenda.  That makes them a secret world government.  In fact, there are two of them: the conservatives and the liberals.  As each of them loses the office of President, they sequester their people, materiel, money, and secrets from the next administration.  A large number of personnel are removed to private industry cover jobs and struck from the records.</p>

<p>For example, The Plumbers were from the conservative CIA.  These are the same people who were involved in Bay of Pigs, JFK assassination, RFK assassination, Iraq War, 9/11, the Patriot Act, stealing the Gore/Bush Jr. election and stealing the Gore/Kerry election, among other things.</p>

<p>As another example, Timothy Leary is famously quoted as attributing his May 1971 escape to Switzerland to the &quot;liberal CIA.&quot;</p>

<p>In recent history, we have the case of 1979 Operation Snow White in which Scientology infiltrated the U.S. government.  They were discovered to have 5,000 operatives involved in Snow White.  Infiltration of local government seems to be a practice they borrowed from the Masons and appear to practice in some form everywhere they establish bastions.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s 3 or 4 secret world shadow governments right there.  All of them have these qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Global government with numerous members in almost all nations of the globe, and many of those members involved in government.</p></li>
<li><p>Power acquired by infiltrating legitimate governments, except in the case of CIA, which only infiltrates foreign governments but could be argued to infiltrate the U.S. government due to unauthorized political and criminal activity.</p></li>
<li><p>Special privileges for members.  For example, CIA operative and Masons are routinely released from police investigations that would lead to the arrest of a normal person.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now if we turn to your question, about the Illuminati, the first thing I would say is that it&#39;s a less important question.  There are lots of world shadow governments.  I haven&#39;t even given all the examples I&#39;m aware of.</p>

<p>We know the Bavarian Illuminati existed by 1780 and were infiltrating the U.S. government, from George Washington&#39;s letter to Reverend G. W. Snyder.</p>

<p>The question is: do the Illuminati from 1780 still exist?  The answer is that they probably sort-of do.  Things have changed a lot, but the Masons still exist, and the Illuminati set up shop within the secret rooms of the Masonic house.  It is likely that Illuminati branches of Masonry continue to propagate the Illuminati meme, which is not that far off in content from the Masonic appreciation of the Lucifer the light-bearer, either.  The two organizations are synergistic, but maybe have blended into each other and lost a little of their unique identities.</p>

<p>There might also be a modern and newly-formed type of Illuminati, who style themselves after the originals. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve encountered both types of Illuminati, and while I can say they exist as I&#39;ve defined them, I cannot say whether they should be considered the same Illuminati that G. Washington wrote about.  But I am not sure what Illuminati, precisely, you are asking about.  Could you please define your definition of Illuminati?  ;)</p>

<p>Something the Masons, Illuminati, and some other modern secret world shadow governments share is that they derive beliefs from Orphism, which is the real origin of what some call Gnosticism, which was a Christian/Orphistic syncrete.</p>

<p>Personally, I wonder if there is a more powerful and more secret cabal mostly running everything, taking cover behind all the other secret world shadow governments.  That is, I wonder if there are puppetmasters running the puppetmasters who run the world.</p>

<p>I think there are, and some of the reason stems from what I&#39;ve picked up in this forum, but because I don&#39;t know it first-hand, won&#39;t go into it.</p>

<p>Not to change the subject, what are some of the commonalities or similarities of the world governments?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Scientology - research into neurofeedback, meditation, psychotherapy, and telepathy</p></li>
<li><p>Masonry - research into mathematics, ritual, magic, and telepathy</p></li>
<li><p>CIA - research into neurofeedback, remote neurostimulation, psychedelic drugs, and telepathy</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The most surprising thing I gathered out of my adventures with the secret world shadow governments is that there are <em>bloodlines.</em>  One example is the McLean clan of Scotland.  These bloodlines get extensive special privileges.  It is a priority for them to have male offspring trained in Special Forces or clandestine intelligence if possible.</p>

<p>There is so much to it, and a lot to write down that never will be written, but in answer to your original question, yeah, the Illuminati exist, but it&#39;s not that big a deal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My opinion is that they once existed, this can be proven. A simple google search and Wikipedia will reveal that there was an organisation by the name of the Bavarian Illuminati founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt. The same article on Wikipedia however says that their goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. The group then went into decline and died out. There is no proof of it surviving or a conspiracy to take over the world. I am curious where people today got this idea from and why there is a lot of paranoia in regards to the NWO theory and everything allegedly being secretly controlled by a group calling itself the Illuminati.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What makes you think they died out? John Robison wrote an entire book on the fact that the Illuminati survived the initial &quot;shut down&quot;. Its called &quot;Proofs of Conspiracy&quot; and is free online. He names the names of the men from the Illuminati that came over and then founded Skull and Bones. Skull and Bones still exists right? You didn&#39;t know that they were founded as the American sect of the Illuminati?</p>

<p>Also, there are many books that mention the Illuminati in passing throughout the 1800s. You should check out the work of Eliphas Levi, especially the &quot;Doctrine on Transcendental Magick&quot;. Written in the mid-1800s, he many times mentions the magick techniques of the illuminati in the context of giving examples and the book isn&#39;t even about them at all. The book &quot;Occult Theocracy&quot; was also written in the 1800s and takes for granted that the Rothschilds (literally the founders of the Illuminati and Israel) run a secret magick sect called the Illuminati.</p>

<p>What books are you going off of? Wikipedia? Dig deeper dude and read primary sources. Anthony Suttons books on Skull and Bones are important too. As well as Carrol Quigleys &quot;Tragedy and Hope&quot;. Read up before reposting the wiki entry on them.</p>

<p>Well of course a secretive organization meant to overthrow the governments of the world will stop when the governments tell them to.    </p>

<p>In my opinion secrecy is the basis of any sound strategy.  You can&#39;t enact any plan if your opponent knows what you are planning.  Any group unable to some level of secrecy will be defeated by a group that can.  This is true in war.  This is true in politics.  Its true in business.  Its true in <em>any</em> game.   </p>

<p>The Writings of George Washington from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745-1799. John C. Fitzpatrick, Editor.</p>

<p>Mount Vernon, October 24, 1798.</p>

<p>Revd Sir: I have your favor of the 17th. instant before me; and my only motive to trouble you with the receipt of this letter, is to explain, and correct a mistake which I perceive the hurry in which I am obliged, often, to write letters, have led you into.</p>

<p>It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.</p>

<p>The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a seperation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.</p>

<p>My occupations are such, that but little leisure is allowed me to read News Papers, or Books of any kind; the reading of letters, and preparing answers, absorb much of my time. With respect, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>is it hard to believe a group with money, power and influence who believe themselves to be of a better class than the rest of us, might conspire together to keep that money, power and influence by any means necessary? or that at some point a group like this would get to a place where what it thought was &quot;best&quot; for &quot;us&quot; should happen by any means necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there either is an illuminati or there are groups out there trying to make it appear that there is.   </p>

<p>By the way masonic symbolism showing up in art is not something new.  For instance Goethe, Shakespeare, and Mozart all put masonic symbolism into their works of art.  Actually, much of the architecture in DC has masonic symbolism in it.  Those are just a few examples.   </p>

<p>So what do we have here?  An esoteric group in the past would put their symbols into artwork.  These same symbols keep showing up in the artwork.  It seems to me that is pretty strong evidence that these groups are still functioning.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, though I like to refer to them as &quot;The Global Elitists&quot; I doubt they&#39;re actually called the Illuminati. Witnessing satanism around the world whether it be in media or federal government, it just seems real to me. I think this &quot;Illuminati&quot; is just a part of The Global Elitists. The Illuminati are the satanists in the group while the others such as the bankers are the Zionists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The illuminati without a doubt exist. Their are several well known illuminists in history, one being Pythagoras. </p>

<p>The Zionists came in and basically overran the illuminati by adopting all their symbols and pasting them anywhere they can. Which is where they get their bad name and the belief that the Illuminati runs the world</p>

<p>The real illuminati are still around, but they are definitley not in control of the world. While they do want a new world order its not what everyone thinks it is. The elite are already in control of the world, the new world order is meant to replace the old world order and take the power away from the elite.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about making a post that goes into this in detail, but its to late for that tonight. in the mean time, I would recoment looking up &quot;Pythagorean Illuminism&quot;</p>

<p>Basically the Illuminati is just a secret religon with roots in gnostism</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate your interest in Illuminati and we offer our best wishes of success as you pursue your world domination goals.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
