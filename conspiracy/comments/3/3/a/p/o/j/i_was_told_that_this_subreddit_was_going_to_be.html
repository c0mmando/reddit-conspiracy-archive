Googling conspiracies often yield sketchy results because theres not really any established place to talk about it. So you get individual biased ideas/views.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking Russia and China will keep us out of WW3. I think Europe will pivot to BRICS and mostly abandon the US; it&#39;ll be rough over there for a few years, but then rapidly improve.</p>

<p>I think the US will be globally isolated and will go through the worst depression it&#39;s ever seen -- with a populace that is the worst prepared to deal with it. I call it &quot;The Greatest Depression&quot;.</p>

<p>I doubt civil war will break out; there&#39;s just too much power in place and too much mind control. But it might. More likely there&#39;s some excuse to put away all dissidents. There will likely be pockets of &quot;domestic terrorists&quot; but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll make a dent.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be a good place to be unless something amazing happens. Still got my fingers crossed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rest of the world has gotten sick of our shit. Well, the cabal&#39;s shit via the US. I shouldn&#39;t include them in &quot;we&quot;.</p>

<p>The entire rest of the world<sup>**</sup> is forming the BRICS financial alliance and striking trade deals, taking their ball and going home. The US economy is in collapse, right now, and with it will go the non-gold-backed, worthless paper US dollar. It&#39;ll climb, climb, climb then poof. (Good time to buy some land if you have some USD saved up.) When that happens, the rest of the world won&#39;t want USD anymore -- I expect hyperinflation.</p>

<p>Then again, the big banks will likely fail after Europe&#39;s banks fail. That&#39;ll happen when Greece, Spain, and Italy leave the EU. Even some talk of France and Germany leaving. And as the banks fail, they&#39;ll likely do &quot;bail-ins&quot; -- swipe customers&#39; money from their accounts to keep from going bankrupt.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s possible you&#39;ll have your money swiped by the banks only to have hyperinflation hit you on the other side. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m just a computer guy trying to put things together. There are much smarter people than I making predictions. Just make sure they aren&#39;t the source of or passing through propaganda -- that&#39;s the tricky part! I won&#39;t intentionally mislead you, but I could be wrong... and I could be lying...</p>

<p>This. This is it exactly. The hive mind has come to reddit and its becomming a combo of status quo Digg, as well as r/hailcorporate front page ads disguised as &quot;look what my dog did? with a subtle ad placement in the background.

    <div class="md"><p>If I share, it will result in that again. Irony! What I will say is, at the time, I GENUINELY did not think the &quot;info I had&quot; was important or really new. </p>

<p>I was naive, and never heard the word truther or all this lingo. </p>

<p>So, I happened to live near a site of something I read about on this subreddit, and I felt like I could help a lot of people by going to the physical place and getting documents at the town hall things like that. .. that&#39;s legal. I even paid like, $0.12/page or something :) </p>

<p>Well that was just the first in a line of dominoes that extends from here and spiderwebs out and I literally was not only shadow banned here, that&#39;s the thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been removed, deleted, &quot;user does not exist&quot; type of responses..</p>

<p>It seems to be a combo of the topic at hand and the very strong evidence I had that things were at least deeply amiss. </p>

<p>I have been removed from sites I use for &#39;normal&#39; stuff and URL not found. </p>

<p>Btw I love polka dots :) </p>

<p>I&#39;m at the point I literally am so scared to communicate things online that I just completely don&#39;t. </p>

<p>I had NO CLUE how dark the waters were when I put in my big toe, and a shark came, bit it off and as I hobbled away, be kept after me, chewing the rest of my leg. </p>

<p>It has been every major social media site and many email hosting places, except Insta, still have that, but its just me and my family. Vert benign. Pics of kids playing, school sports.. etc.. </p>

<p>It is ironic how if &#39;they&#39;d&#39; ignored me, I might&#39;ve just kind of thought, &#39;Eh well, that was a weird blip of time.... The world sure is strange.&#39;</p>

<p>Instead, the massive pushback made their efforts really obvious. They wanted to scare me. I know this bc an individual who is a member in a forum they lost in shared screenshots of their discussion about me. </p>

<p>I saw the name and age of my child. </p>

<p>My employer. </p>

<p>Things about me, details, jokes cracked about how I look, my senior citizen parents, the grandma and grandpa of my kids, mocked publicly ONLINE.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never engaged in lying, harassing, or doing illegal things to get access to the truth. </p>

<p>It was right there, j just had to drive a couple hours, and do a little research like in college. </p>

<p>Any smithereens of doubt that remained in the recesses of my mind were lit on fire and blazed by this attack that has lasted.....10 months-ish so far.</p>

<p>I&#39;m frustrated, polka. </p>

<p>Im a good person with honest intentions....and a passionate drive to find what is real and TRUE. </p>

<p>Now I wish I could go back and somehow...undo it. </p>

<p>My lawyer has the info but I can&#39;t do anything about it. </p>

<p>The topic that was sensitive is one that is posted about OFTEN here, involves many children, and raised several issues in the public consciousness and political arena. </p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of shocked you can read this post. :) I lingered quietly for a while til I hit some magical date where I became allowed to post again.</p>

<p>I tread carefully now. </p>

<p>Think, the things that are true that we need to hear are <em>likely</em> blocked.                         :(</p>

<p>Thanks for listening... Feel a little less under water.                                                                                                                                                        </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I don&#39;t like this sub is instead of doing what they criticize by assuming conspiracy theories are not true, the assumption on this sub seems to be that most conspiracy theories are true, which is an equally bad opposite extreme. </p>

<p>I like the concept of looking into things I just don&#39;t like confirmation bias and blocking out evidence because you want to believe everything is a lie. </p>

<p>The issue is and always will be who controls the flow of information. On most of Reddit, and nearly all the internet, mainstream sources take precedence. Once you realize that an eyewitness CAN carry as much weight as a 9 year old CNN article, you stop dismissing things that do not fit with the narrative based solely on them not fitting.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official story or mainstream view is usually that there is no conspiracy, so in this sub, called r/conspiracy by the way, the event will be picked apart and different theories about why it could be a conspiracy will be discussed.

Saying that the sub &quot;wants&quot; something to be true just because everything is questioned here is a strange statement unless you think there are things that should not be questioned.  </p>

<p>unfortunately, the buttholes from <a href="/r/conspiratard">/r/conspiratard</a> and <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">/r/TopMindsOfReddit</a> have made &#39;new&#39; people that come here uncomfortable to discuss <em>theories</em>. apparently, just discussing alternatives to what official government &#39;stories&#39; say, are tantamount to treason. when i visit here, i want to <em>discuss</em> different points of view. those gossip subreddits want to make people here feel stupid and belittled. you kind of have to have a thick skin and it doesnt hurt to check peoples comment history every now and then, otherwise you might find yourself engaged in a useless conversation that just wastes your time, when you mightve been on a decent train of thought on a certain subject. be selective in who you respond to, and be mindful that there are trolls galore on here. like i said before, check peoples comment history, i cant stress that enough. </p>

<p>if you like JFK assassination history, come over to <a href="/r/JFKresearcher">/r/JFKresearcher</a>. its only a small subreddit, but you might find some useful information there.</p>
