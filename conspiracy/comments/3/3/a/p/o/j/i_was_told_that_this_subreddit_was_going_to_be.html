       I've always loved conspiracies, but it seems like going against the hivemind here in conspiracy will land you a lot of downvotes so I never comment. Like, I'm not an anti vaxxer and I beleive in climate change and there's some particular conspiracies I would disagree with but it feels unwelcoming a lot of times. I've been wanting to say this for a while.

       It does, though I don't think that's the case. I think it's more of a comfortable circle jerk happening. I don't mind except I don't think differing opinions should be downvoted. This is a place where, ideally, I think, we should be able to express all sorts of ideas and opinions and not made to feel bad about them.

       speak freely. I am against forced vaccinations...but I would not classify that as being part of the "hivemind". I also don't think taxes on CO2 will give us better weather...but I encourage open discussion and can understand that some people disagree...thanks for having an open mind! I find that talking about this stuff in r/politics is where you will tend to encounter closed minds.

       Don't let that stop you from speaking your mind.  Ask questions and be genuine in wanting to know and you'll always have good people backing you up or trying to correct you, even then be diligent in making the effort to confirm for yourself.  Don't let my text or someone else's text be the "proof".

       If you want to run with the big dogs here on r/conspiracy, it really helps if you have something to contribute.  Trying to learn by coming here to "ask questions" is just a waste of time, as the thing you want to know can be learned much more quickly and easily by simply googling it.
      </p>
      <p>
       99% of the time, people who say they are just "asking questions" are in fact arguing for the official story.  They are not sincerely looking to be informed.

       To win friends here, come with something to offer besides criticism.

       Well, I disagree with this. I don't think it should be a sub for experts on every conspiracy. Googling conspiracies often yield sketchy results because theres not really any established place to talk about it. So you get individual biased ideas/views. I like asking questions because it often creates the most informative comment chains where I can interact.
      </p>

       I also didn't say I came here to criticize, I come here with ideas and an open mind.

       I too believe in climate change, and am skeptical about vaccine conspiracies.  It's not so much the evidence that scares me w/ vaccines, rather the idea of us forced to inject shit into our bodies when manufacturers aren't held liable.

       We need people like you here.  Don't worry about people downvoting you, contradicting opinions are absolutely necessary.

       I don't believe in climate change, am skeptical about the Boston Bombing conspiracy, and refuse to use the phrase "TPTB" (I think it's a copout).  Keep posting my man.

       Eh, at the end of the day, nothing changes. I've had many comments get obliterated through replies or downvotes. You really shouldn't get upset over it. You're still the same person and a couple strangers on the internet thought poorly of you for a minute and then they forgot about you and once again you're a stranger, unjudged and fresh to a new conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it bothers you that much, delete the downvoted comments and/or keep a couple of alts that you can bounce between if things get too hot. In the end, nobody really cares. Nobody knows who you are and they aren't better than you for clicking an arrow button on a web page.

       Yes mam I completely agree. It is quite scary how much and how quickly the world as we know it is changing. We should be allowed a forum for an informed debate because it sure as hell isn't happening in parliaments and congresses anymore.... Merely the selling of political decisions and legislations to the highest bidder. Don't get discouraged on this sub because there are a lot of good ppl on it!

       I hope I am not wrong when I speak for most people on this sub, we unanimously believe that it was an inside job, false flag to start the war on terror. Its the only way, everything else post 9/11 makes sense. Its the only window through which we view post and pre 9/11 events. That's why our POV is different from the mainstreams. They don't know where we are coming from if they don't also believe or suspect that 9/11 was an inside job. It is the litmus test. It is clear as day to me.

       I don't like saying it was an "inside job", though it partially was.  There's clear evidence to incriminate a .0001%, elite group of madmen within the US Government, CIA, Israeli Mossad, and Saudi Royal Family.  There are other groups represented (seen arguments for NSA, Canadian Government, ISI, etc. but these are certainly the main players.

       I completely agree. I stuck my nose in almost exactly a year ago, expecting to find a world of derp... and what I found was simply fantastic. Once you work your way around the shills (and there are many, sad to say), there is some fantastic information here. Now you understand why they were trying to keep you away from here.

       I'm thinking Russia and China will keep us out of WW3. I think Europe will pivot to BRICS and mostly abandon the US; it'll be rough over there for a few years, but then rapidly improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the US will be globally isolated and will go through the worst depression it's ever seen -- with a populace that is the worst prepared to deal with it. I call it "The Greatest Depression".
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt civil war will break out; there's just too much power in place and too much mind control. But it might. More likely there's some excuse to put away all dissidents. There will likely be pockets of "domestic terrorists" but I don't think they'll make a dent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't think it'll be a good place to be unless something amazing happens. Still got my fingers crossed.

       The rest of the world has gotten sick of our shit. Well, the cabal's shit via the US. I shouldn't include them in "we".
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire rest of the world
       <sup>
        **
       </sup>
       is forming the BRICS financial alliance and striking trade deals, taking their ball and going home. The US economy is in collapse, right now, and with it will go the non-gold-backed, worthless paper US dollar. It'll climb, climb, climb then poof. (Good time to buy some land if you have some USD saved up.) When that happens, the rest of the world won't want USD anymore -- I expect hyperinflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, the big banks will likely fail after Europe's banks fail. That'll happen when Greece, Spain, and Italy leave the EU. Even some talk of France and Germany leaving. And as the banks fail, they'll likely do "bail-ins" -- swipe customers' money from their accounts to keep from going bankrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's possible you'll have your money swiped by the banks only to have hyperinflation hit you on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm just a computer guy trying to put things together. There are much smarter people than I making predictions. Just make sure they aren't the source of or passing through propaganda -- that's the tricky part! I won't intentionally mislead you, but I could be wrong... and I could be lying...

       This. This is it exactly. The hive mind has come to reddit and its becomming a combo of status quo Digg, as well as r/hailcorporate front page ads disguised as "look what my dog did? with a subtle ad placement in the background. Plus there are upvote bots out there now so there's always that.

       If I share, it will result in that again. Irony! What I will say is, at the time, I GENUINELY did not think the "info I had" was important or really new.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was naive, and never heard the word truther or all this lingo.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I happened to live near a site of something I read about on this subreddit, and I felt like I could help a lot of people by going to the physical place and getting documents at the town hall things like that. .. that's legal. I even paid like, $0.12/page or something :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Well that was just the first in a line of dominoes that extends from here and spiderwebs out and I literally was not only shadow banned here, that's the thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been removed, deleted, "user does not exist" type of responses..
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to be a combo of the topic at hand and the very strong evidence I had that things were at least deeply amiss.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been removed from sites I use for 'normal' stuff and URL not found.
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw I love polka dots :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm at the point I literally am so scared to communicate things online that I just completely don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had NO CLUE how dark the waters were when I put in my big toe, and a shark came, bit it off and as I hobbled away, be kept after me, chewing the rest of my leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has been every major social media site and many email hosting places, except Insta, still have that, but its just me and my family. Vert benign. Pics of kids playing, school sports.. etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       It is ironic how if 'they'd' ignored me, I might've just kind of thought, 'Eh well, that was a weird blip of time.... The world sure is strange.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, the massive pushback made their efforts really obvious. They wanted to scare me. I know this bc an individual who is a member in a forum they lost in shared screenshots of their discussion about me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the name and age of my child.
      </p>
      <p>
       My employer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things about me, details, jokes cracked about how I look, my senior citizen parents, the grandma and grandpa of my kids, mocked publicly ONLINE.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never engaged in lying, harassing, or doing illegal things to get access to the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was right there, j just had to drive a couple hours, and do a little research like in college.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any smithereens of doubt that remained in the recesses of my mind were lit on fire and blazed by this attack that has lasted.....10 months-ish so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm frustrated, polka.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im a good person with honest intentions....and a passionate drive to find what is real and TRUE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I wish I could go back and somehow...undo it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My lawyer has the info but I can't do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The topic that was sensitive is one that is posted about OFTEN here, involves many children, and raised several issues in the public consciousness and political arena.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm kind of shocked you can read this post. :) I lingered quietly for a while til I hit some magical date where I became allowed to post again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tread carefully now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think, the things that are true that we need to hear are
       <em>
        likely
       </em>
       blocked.                         :(

       Thanks for listening... Feel a little less under water.

       Welcome aboard. Try not to let the occasional shitposts and trolls bother you. If you can manage to get past that, which isn't very difficult quite frankly, there's actually some damn good content here or there, shit you're unlikely to find elsewhere. So there's that, also.

       The reason I don't like this sub is instead of doing what they criticize by assuming conspiracy theories are not true, the assumption on this sub seems to be that most conspiracy theories are true, which is an equally bad opposite extreme.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like the concept of looking into things I just don't like confirmation bias and blocking out evidence because you want to believe everything is a lie.

       The issue is and always will be who controls the flow of information. On most of Reddit, and nearly all the internet, mainstream sources take precedence. Once you realize that an eyewitness CAN carry as much weight as a 9 year old CNN article, you stop dismissing things that do not fit with the narrative based solely on them not fitting.

       The official story or mainstream view is usually that there is no conspiracy, so in this sub, called r/conspiracy by the way, the event will be picked apart and different theories about why it could be a conspiracy will be discussed.  Most here want to find the truth and that means questioning EVERYTHING in order to get to it.  Saying that the sub "wants" something to be true just because everything is questioned here is a strange statement unless you think there are things that should not be questioned.

       Yes Op it is not all that crazy as the world likes to label conspirators. You just have to be wise at discerning he facts presented whether some are rubbish theories or not.

       Reddit is compromised - it's as simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       A desolate wasteland of memes, corporate junk sucking, circlejerking, and cat posts. I mainly use it as a sort of 9gag for interesting content.
      </p>
      <p>
       The days of actual discussion and critical thinking are gone here - but there are fringe subreddits like this one where those who feel annoyed by the obvious subversion can hang out and give the mains a proper, rigid, middle finger.

       You should be aware that we have a few people here that are "skeptical" about everything
       <em>
        except
       </em>
       official narratives. 3Try8 is one of those people. Note how he generalized the entire sub as suckers.

       I suspect at some point, they can just overrun us with AI bots. Gonna get really hard to find out what's really going on when you have 1000 AI posts for every 1 user post.

       unfortunately, the buttholes from
       <a href="/r/conspiratard">
        /r/conspiratard

       and
       <a href="/r/TopMindsOfReddit">
        /r/TopMindsOfReddit
       </a>
       have made 'new' people that come here uncomfortable to discuss
       <em>
        theories
       </em>
       . apparently, just discussing alternatives to what official government 'stories' say, are tantamount to treason. when i visit here, i want to
       <em>
        discuss
       </em>
       different points of view. those gossip subreddits want to make people here feel stupid and belittled. you kind of have to have a thick skin and it doesnt hurt to check peoples comment history every now and then, otherwise you might find yourself engaged in a useless conversation that just wastes your time, when you mightve been on a decent train of thought on a certain subject. be selective in who you respond to, and be mindful that there are trolls galore on here. like i said before, check peoples comment history, i cant stress that enough.

       if you like JFK assassination history, come over to

       it can get you down, but at the end of the day, you realise that they arent anyone important. they are very good at bullying people, and theres no point carrying on a conversation with them. if you do not feed them, they have nothing but their little circlejerk to satisfy them. downvote, report them to the mods, and move on. this sub and others are great discussion threads, and you will have a fun time here.

       You can expect the powers that be to drive their agenda even harder in the US, Canada and Mexico during that period, get ready for the North American Union, this might not happen until after a lot of blood letting.
