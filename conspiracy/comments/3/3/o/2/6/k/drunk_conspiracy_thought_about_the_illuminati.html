       What if the Illuminati is putting shit out into the public, like in movies/songs/etc to see who will call them out. We are all vocal about calling them out and we speak it online and offline. Well, what if this is by design? To see who is smart enough to call them out and see shit for what it really is. This makes sense, they do not want a idiot populace, that would hinder progress. What if what they want is to find the intelligent, skeptical, free thinking people? You know, to better humanity. Kind of playing devils advocate here, but what if they are looking to find intelligent minds. Much like a hiring group, if you will, think Google hiring process.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the plan is to eliminate all the idiots (god knows there are many) and find the one's who catch on and can see the shit they are doing. By doing so, they can weed out the idiots for intelligent people. By intelligent, I do not mean IQ, but people who are spiritually aware and self aware intellectually. What if this is the grand plan for the Illuminati? Find/record/track those who "know" and dispose of the mindless idiots, so humanity can progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a drunk thought, but I read an article which led to this. Maybe we are not being watched/tracked/etc to be killed, but to be saved and harnessed. You cannot have progress without intellectuals. I'm not saying this is a good thing, because I think all authority is/can be evil. But, what if the point of blatantly throwing around their agenda is to get some people to call it out? You see it in movies and music. Most people say, meh, heh I like this song but never looks at the imagery, the symbolism, the lyrics behind it. Those that do are on
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       level.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if, and this is a strong what if, they are doing it for that purpose. Just watched Deep Impact which talks about comets hitting the earth and causing mass extinction. Now there are talks about the same event happening in September (could be why Jade Helm 15). What if this is a clue to people who know, to prepare and GTFO. Those that do GTFO are worthy, those who have their head in the sand aren't. It's like being a gentleman and subtly telling people of something. If they get it they are on your level. If they don't, they aren't worthy of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, drunk thought. Cheers mates/gals.

       Dude, I've had the vague same thought, along the lines of 'if you're smart enough and call out enough shit, you'll be "contacted", and... whatever awesome shit happens after that happens.'

       It's just a thought exercise and is different from our (conspiracy theorist) normal view. People ask, well if there is an agenda why do they make it obvious? Well, it's not obvious to those who aren't aware, it's obvious to those who are aware. What if that is the plan/agenda. See who are aware and save them. You can say, well they want to control us like cattle. But, what if the goal is to weed out the idiots from those intelligent/aware. Therefore humanity could progress into something "better". Not saying killing a bunch of "idiots" is right, just playing devil's advocate. Glad some one else out there has had this thought :).

       It's a nice thought, but it seems like they prefer to court the idiotic variety. Think politicians, govt. bureaucrats, etc. They actually for the most part either don't know or don't believe in "the illuminati". The kind of person they are "looking for" is the kind of duplicitous prick who can rise through the ranks of a religious organization knowingly deceiving their congregation for monetary or other nefarious gains.

       Think about it this way. Why do you need idiots when you have robots? Robots to do the mundane tasks of life. Robots can do just about any job that an "idiot" could do. So they don't need them. They get rid of them but keeps though who are aware we could progress. People who think for themselves, entrepreneurs, etc. That's who they want (imo). Drunk thought, but it kind of makes sense. I think outside of the box. I think, how could these people play. What is their agenda? Think like a tycoon. Thought exercise :)

       Thought that before.  Doesnt really matter though.  ...  For those of us who do believe and see whats coming...we already know.  We see it and well just accept Gods plan.  That simple. We are watching. We do see.  We are not afraid. Fear not.

       Which is the reason. I have, you said you have. Both are the same. So is the god of the "elites". Because, what is god and who is god? What is his/her/it's plan?

       My husband is barely starting to believe in God. But I personally am trying so hard to put my faith there.  I own land but its land without a house.  We are trying to save for that but its probably jobless when we get there.  So I have to keep up my career because it will always be there.  I just didnt want to go into management but they are making me.  I dont like that responsibility.  I dont know how to do that.  The last place I worked I ran from because the cnas threatened me just for asking them to do their job.  I lo ke my tires inflated.  Etc.

       Im not so smart like that.  And I like my God. But my husband he puts up with me and my conspiracies. He didnt believe any of them til he became jobless.  Now he is 300 miles away just trying to make ends meet.  He got mad back when I used to coupon and save food.  Store food.  Spa e was wasted.  Now we have nothing.  But land so fa r away.  No job for him and a scarey promotion for me but God says fear not.  I keep telling God im sorry.  I cant help but fear.  How will I feed my child.  Im already living in a friends house.

       the friends we are living with are awesome but they smoke weed and one is on parole.  No guns allowed on property.  (Never wanted a gun til the government told me I shouldnt have one).  And we work and we save and hopeless for the future.  We have no internet even.  I cant even catch the news except what tid bits I get on my phone.  Ugh.  I appologise for whining.   It is what it is and I know that.  Thank you friend.

       You're a fool if you think they don't. Let alone the ideology which has been passed down to many other societies. Their ideas were revolutionary. I suggest you look into them. That knowledge has been passed, much like a baton passed by Olympic runners. Illuminati is dead but not their ideology.

       I think there are 2 sides evil and the lesser evil and even though all sides are propaganda with bits of truth but there are ppl within the system backing some of the evil being exposed

       I've had a similar thought, stemming from my early youtubin' days after learning about the Georgia guide stones.

       Unfortunately I disagree with any enforced system, even if a select group have deemed it to be the best way.

       We all progress together or we all die out together as far I'm concerned.

       I agree. I'm not in with it. Just kinda struck me. What if, damn this cider is good. I think they wanna kill us all,  what what if?  We are here to think. It's a thought exercise...

       I know myself, truthfully. Some people don't, I do. I will admit all my flaws. People will not. I do not get it. Illuminati is a metaphor for TPTB. But still begs the question.......
