       I'm putting on my helmet for downvotes here, since we're on Reddit, but as a woman probably a bit older than y'all, the whole debacle sure makes younger people (especially young guys) look kind of dumb to outsiders and tertiary news followers. And confused/bemused about what liberalism has become (not one myself, but it's interesting to see how "liberals" just...aren't at all anymore).

       I think most of the media's positioning makes younger generations look dumb. However for those smart enough to think critically about it Gamergate, as foolish as it may appear to "outsiders", is really solidifying the mistrust with traditional media. Everytime and anti- uses their platform to push the same narrative it exposes a small part of the moneyed influence and causes said platform to lose credibility.

       The threats and abuse people have pushed don't bode well for them. And that Milo guy, ick. The whole thing centered around a butthurt boyfriend. It's ugly, all around. I haven't yet seen any legit criticism of actual corruption in games journalism (of which there is PLENTY - but GamerGate hasn't brought any of the real stuff to light; it's almost as if the entire embarrassing squabble was created by and for EA).

       Milo without without regressing to ad hominem was the one who leaked the game jorno pro email list which showed direct links to collusion, nepotism, and corruption. Which ironically is a legitimate criticism of actual corruption in games journalism.  It is much more accurate to say the whole thing started because of the reaction to the censorship of everyone discussing the situation between said boyfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sentiment, that gamergate is a fabrication by EA is definitely in the right sub. But that sadly is where its merit ends. You should do more research.

       How did that email list prove anything? Oh, my, journalists talk to each other! Game developers keep lists of journalists to email when their games come out! Oooh. Big whoop, talk to some actual game developers; would save you some time and effort. That guy is playing y'all so bad. Notice no one talks at all about the wholesale theft of IP of indie developers by big gaming companies. How much free shit the big gaming companies compensate journalists with. Happens on a daily, naught to do with it, and you guys so concerned with "corruption" spend all day up the ass of a girl that made a game that wasn't even a game, nor was it even popular (or even
       <em>
        covered
       </em>
       by the guy she was seeing). Someone got dumped, and it's this big thing to you guys, like it's General Hospital and you're 11 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of obsessing over soap opera bullshit, I wonder if some of you guys actually got involved in game development - if you'd actually stop being tools and start being architects and builders. If I can code, you can code. And code isn't all you need to do to make cool things - art, music, writing, testing - all vital for building. Shit, if you don't like the direction games are going in, make some fucking games. Support the games and developers you like by buying them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got hope that some of y'all will wake up to the manipulation. For the younger generation of women, anyway, I hope you boys can grow up a little. I weep for girls right now trying to find partners.  I have no idea how they go through life without stabbing someone...when I was younger, the odds were good but the goods were odd, which was pretty awesome. Now, everywhere I look, are these ragged out whiners obsessing about things of little consequence, spending all day plotting - for what? To end up as self-pitying victims. It's not a good look and I'm hoping some of these boys wake up before they've lost the best years of their lives to...I don't even know.

       The email list Proved that journalists and Judges were friends who, without disclosure Decided to collude e.g. voting up games in which they had Invested in. If no one talks about wholsale theft its because People  like you continue to drag people who don't even matter into the conversation. Considering the aforementioned is proof that your argument is not only Proven false,  it continues to fall flat in the face of actual truth.   .

       Notice how you say being and not learning to be.

      <p>
       News flash WE ARE architects, Builders, and programmers, . Shit I have three degrees myself and the only reason. Why I'm not in school for computer science  is because I'm too busy trying to make a living. So thanks for that Miss General Hospital maybe next time don't vote lockstep like you're used to.  What you could never Possibly understand Because you clearly Haven't looked  or played for yourself is that one, as a gamer I don't Care about your political bullshit and two if I don't like it I don't play it. if you insist on making shitty games and shitty tactics to get me to play your game I'll Just simply play something else and Ill warn others so they don't have to suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the  aforementioned point isn't clear enough, I could give a shit about the direction of games. The Game industry are changing and this "boys club" is just throwing a fit argument has been proven false as well. So thats two strawman fallacies. Next

       Actually make that three. Assuming Gamers don't code. (we must treat those developers like gods huh)

      <p>
       Tell me more about who's being manipulated and feel free to use as many Television references as possible. Again I don't give two shits coupling or marriage. Is this about Games or is it about your frustration of the direction of of today's youth. If you don't like their direction By all means Make your own children.

       From what I can tell, the entire movement has been taken over by MRA losers trying to use gamers as tools for their own ends by stealing a playbook from ye olde Westboro Baptist Church, so I guess I am right? Yer one of them, I guess? I was trying to engage with someone being used, but it looks like you're one of the users, so have a nice day and seek Jesus, man, seek Jesus.

       Wow so this guy explains away all of your gish gallop and all you can do is move the goalposts and continue with your strawman fallacies.  It's obvious you don't play any video games and got your information from a shill site. So let me get this straight you think the movement has regressed to being the wbc but the solution is to seek jesus. Right. Do us all a favor and kindly see your way back to tv land. You CLEARLY have no stake in an industry you know little about. So if you do decide to pick up a controller we'll be more than happy to play with you but until then, stick your old misguided baby boomer pontificating somewhere else. I hear there's already a hugbox for you.

       I'm still waiting to hear about how you have a stake in this considering that you continue to misrepresent your opponents arguments. You are projecting. I'm the one being manipulated in your opinion despite you demonstrably being less informed? OK  buddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh its changing. you want to see how it's changing? Go read about how preorder sales are down. Go to anyone of the shill sites where you get your information. See how many sponsors have pulled their ads. Look at all of the sites that were forced to update their ethics policies. Gamergate is responsible for that. 
Now who's the tool of big business? 
Define irony. The person who is woefully mislead hopes the person who is informed will come to their senses and "wake up". Maybe if you played I could care but we both know you don't so to me you're just a lost cause.

       Last time I checked F1 2015 was scheduled for release later this year along with Dirt 4, and that's just codemasters , I haven't even gotten to the mgs series, cod series, or even the games I'm developing for VR.

      <p>
       Actually this is a strawman fallacy. I didn't imply that I didn't care about gaming integrity in fact I argued quite to the contrary. What I do not care for is the politicization of gaming partly because that isn't why I play But mostly because the ones who preach more than they program are usually the most boring unimaginitive spoiled rotten trust fund kids making unplayable crap that gets passed as a game just because they're friends with the publisher or journalist.

       So now that you have failed to argue your point, you then revert to your Ad hominem and advise me to seek Jesus?

       Lastly I think you should pick up a game and play and think about why you play that particular game. then I want you to think about how great it is that the game you aren't playing ;or rather don't want to play isn't the only playable game for eveyone.

       Right wing sites like Breitbart are certainly trying to take advantage of the mess to try and 'red pill' as many young minds as possible, but that's just opportunism, not conspiracy. What's happening with Gamergate, and the wider political landscape, is that we're seeing left wing politics slowly being taken over by extremism, just like the right was during the 80's. There's a lot of frustration and anger at what is being seen as unfair pandering to the extreme elements of that political spectrum, with 'Social Justice Warriors' taking the place of the fundamentalist Christians of the late 20th century. And the same is happening as before. The moderates become more and more frustrated with the direction the political discourse is taking, and jump to the other side of the fence.

       Wow so this guy explains away all of your gish gallop and all you can do is move the goalposts and continue with your strawman fallacies.  It's obvious you don't play any video games and got your information from a shill site. So let me get this straight you think the movement has regressed to being the wbc but the solution is to seek jesus. Right. Do us all a favor and kindly see your way back to tv land. You CLEARLY have no stake in an industry you know little about. So if you do decide to pick up a controller we'll be more than happy to play with you but until then, stick your old misguided baby boomer pontificating somewhere else. I hear there's already a hugbox for you.

       Because then we could play together

       I don't care if you make because if you make. I can simply choose to play or not to play.

       Last time I checked F1 2015 was scheduled for release later this year along with Dirt 4, and that's just codemasters , I haven't even gotten to the mgs series, cod series, or even the games I'm developing for VR. 
So in addition to having your argument fall flat, You continue to embarrass yourself.  Now put that goalpost back where you found it.

       loosely Ad hominem. you've moved the goalpost pretty far out also.

        Also, if you don't care about games and the integrity of games, why are you involved with GamerGate at all?

      <p>
       Actually this is a strawman fallacy. I didn't imply that I didn't care about gaming integrity in fact I argued quite to the contrary. What I do not care for is the politicization of gaming partly because that isn't why I play But mostly because the ones who preach more than they program are usually the most boring unimaginitive spoiled rotten trust fund kids making unplayable crap that gets passed as a game just because they're friends with the publisher or journalist.

        From what I can tell, the entire movement has been taken over by MRA losers trying to use gamers as tools for their own ends by stealing a playbook from ye olde Westboro Baptist Church, so I guess I am right?

       First it was hijacked by trolls from 4 chan, then they accused wizard chan, hell they even blamed reddit at one point all to demonize thier accusers and one by one they fall flat because Lies are always Lies. You are free to delude yourself with any righteousness you deem fit. However the truth May cause you to look foolish.

      <p>
       So now that you have failed to argue your point, you then revert to your Ad hominem and advise me to seek Jesus? You do realize that some of us are not only engineers but some of us even have multiple degrees? one of mine just so happens to be in Theology.  I'm sorry to inform you that you demonstrate the behavior of someone who stands for a belief despite their actions in which they display the complete opposite. I'd advise you reflect on this.

       Lastly I think you should pick up a game and play and think about why you play that particular game. then I want you to think about how great it is that the game you aren't playing ;or rather don't want to play isn't the only playable game for eveyone.
