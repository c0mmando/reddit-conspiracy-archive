    <div class="md"><p>is there a list of sources or a collection of evidence somewhere against the validity of the Apollo missions? I&#39;ve only ever heard the conspiracy that the space program, while having done all the research necessary, did not actually go to the moon, and instead used launches to set up spy satellites in orbit. While doing this, it drove the S.U. to bankrupt itself upon building their own space program. I&#39;ve never seen any evidence of this other than it making more sense strategically than the U.S. just <em>deciding</em> to go there amidst a cold war. I&#39;m always interested in learning more! Any links? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why this was downvoted.  Nothing wrong with wanting more information.</p>

<p>There are many sources, not all good by any stretch.  <a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/">Here&#39;s</a> one good one, the series called Wagging the Moondoggie.  Maybe it will lead you to other stuff.</p>

<p>Personally I lean pretty strongly towards didn&#39;t go, but am not 100%.  I don&#39;t know why they would have used it as a cover for spy satellites though, since AFAIK both nations were launching them pretty openly before the Apollo missions.  The author I linked to does offer the theory that a couple more recent space mission failures (like the &quot;forgot to convert feet to meters&quot; one, which makes no sense since it&#39;s all in meters to start with) were actually used to launch weapons into orbit which is banned by treaty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the chief video is called &quot;flat earth conspiracy&quot; and is available on YouTube.  I would not really call it a documentary, more like an hour and half long YouTube clip, but it contains a lot of great information.  His website, atlanteanconspiracy.com is a more polished and distilled version of the same information</p>

<p>Oh yeah.  I remember that part.  I personally didn&#39;t take that moment so literally that I didn&#39;t think the CIA <em>didn&#39;t</em> had a massive hand in everything as well (or even more than the mafia itself, for that matter).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep.  I took that as totally metaphorical in the sense that the CIA&#39;s modus operandi is about EXACTLY the same as the mafia&#39;s if not worse, as the CIA tortures and kills more people than the mafia does.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that were the case.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I&#39;d say the information in the video shouldn&#39;t be looked upon as the &quot;final, definitive, last word&quot; on this issue.  It should be looked upon as a piece of a very complicated, very convoluted, very nefarious puzzle.  I think it&#39;s a very significant and important puzzle piece, but with these kinds of issues, various different sources tend to all have different valid pieces that can be used to put the greater picture together and not necessarily any <em>one</em> doc or source should be looked upon as having &quot;the&quot; answer.</p>
