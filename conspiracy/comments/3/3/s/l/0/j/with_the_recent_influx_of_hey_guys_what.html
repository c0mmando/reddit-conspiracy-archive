       Um, that article mentions that they had the technology to refine liquid mercury from cinnabar (as did most civilizations of that level of complexity, many much earlier).  They had cinnabar, they had fire, that's all you need.  But no, obviously aliens.

       is there a list of sources or a collection of evidence somewhere against the validity of the Apollo missions? I've only ever heard the conspiracy that the space program, while having done all the research necessary, did not actually go to the moon, and instead used launches to set up spy satellites in orbit. While doing this, it drove the S.U. to bankrupt itself upon building their own space program. I've never seen any evidence of this other than it making more sense strategically than the U.S. just
       <em>
        deciding
       </em>
       to go there amidst a cold war. I'm always interested in learning more! Any links?

       There are many sources, not all good by any stretch.

       Personally I lean pretty strongly towards didn't go, but am not 100%.  I don't know why they would have used it as a cover for spy satellites though, since AFAIK both nations were launching them pretty openly before the Apollo missions.  The author I linked to does offer the theory that a couple more recent space mission failures (like the "forgot to convert feet to meters" one, which makes no sense since it's all in meters to start with) were actually used to launch weapons into orbit which is banned by treaty.

       We know how ours got there, have video of them being emplaced, and can view the ancillary items left behind by the astronauts emplacing them today. Yes. I regard that as proof.   Furthermore, the Apollo program involved tens of thousands of people all of whom would be in a position to reveal "the truth" had we faked the moon landings.

       And my argument is that the reflectors along with the mountain of related evidence that shows exactly how why and when they were placed is positive proof that humans walked on the moon. I am sorry for you if you are either unable or unwilling to understand that.

       On the wide expanse of the ocean, tall ships can be seen at a great distance by their masts first as they approach, last as they depart, caused by the curvature of the earth. You can also see it if you go up high enough in an airplane. But i think you're trying to make a point that anyone can believe anything.

       If "many word hurt brain", then I would likely not be able to summarize everything I posted in an ELI5 manner that would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       ultimately prove very painful to you.  Additionally, if you are an idiot, then not only would you likely not be able to understand what I post, but you shouldn't, as a matter of fact, know enough to even postulate that the world is flat in the first place.

       So explain what apparently you think an idiot means then - especially in relation to the fact that you used the word immediately prior to stating "many word hurt brain".

       And I do not "believe" that the world is not flat.  I understand, acknowledge, and

       The Eric Dubay videos purpose a model where the sun and moon rotate clockwise around polar north in a fairly consistent but not perfectly circular orbit - this accounts for the temperatures getting cooler outside the tropics and getting warmest at the equator, and the imperfect nature of the orbit accounts for seasons, at least this is my understanding

       I believe the chief video is called "flat earth conspiracy" and is available on YouTube.  I would not really call it a documentary, more like an hour and half long YouTube clip, but it contains a lot of great information.  His website, atlanteanconspiracy.com is a more polished and distilled version of the same information

       I honestly already did check it out -  I think he was asking about how the temperature distribution on the flat earth works, but it's plainly covered in the videos from theNASAchannel and Eric Dubay on YouTube that the sun and moon rotate clockwise around polar north - a partially elliptical orbit which explains temperatures across the world as well as the seasons and phases of the moon etc

       Just watched the entire video. Lots of very good stuff there about the cabal, however it posits that the Sicilian mafia is at the top of the corruption pyramid, when it is quite clear it is a different mafia entirely.

       I get your point, and that's why I was surprised with the segment starting at 2:53.00, when it states that the "five mafia families...control all politicians in the United States".
      </p>
      <p>
       It also says that the mafia and CIA are indistinguishable from each other, which may be true, but I think there are a number of different "mafia" who collaborate with (and compete against) each other, and the Sicilian mafia is by no means the most important.

       Oh yeah.  I remember that part.  I personally didn't take that moment so literally that I didn't think the CIA
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       had a massive hand in everything as well (or even more than the mafia itself, for that matter).

      <p>
       Yep.  I took that as totally metaphorical in the sense that the CIA's modus operandi is about EXACTLY the same as the mafia's if not worse, as the CIA tortures and kills more people than the mafia does.

       Wouldn't be surprised if that were the case.

       At the end of the day, I'd say the information in the video shouldn't be looked upon as the "final, definitive, last word" on this issue.  It should be looked upon as a piece of a very complicated, very convoluted, very nefarious puzzle.  I think it's a very significant and important puzzle piece, but with these kinds of issues, various different sources tend to all have different valid pieces that can be used to put the greater picture together and not necessarily any
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       doc or source should be looked upon as having "the" answer.
