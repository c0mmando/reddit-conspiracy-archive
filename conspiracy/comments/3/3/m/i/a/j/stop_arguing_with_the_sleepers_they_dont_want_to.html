        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s impossible for most people to see the conspiracy. Obama could literally turn into a reptilian on live TV, and most people would just believe the government&#39;s excuse about a technical malfunction or something.</p>

<p>When you are at lower levels of awareness, you literally cannot see what&#39;s going on at the top. It&#39;s too far removed from your every day experience. When I was a nerd in high school, for instance, I really believed that most people were like me/weren&#39;t having much fun. It wasn&#39;t until years later I realized that there was a group of kids having a blast, living freely, hooking up with all the girls, etc. At the time this lifestyle was so out of my experience, that I didn&#39;t even entirely notice it was going on around me. </p>

<p>This works on a macro level as well. It doesn&#39;t matter that Operation Gladio, Operation Ajax, Bush collaboration with Nazi&#39;s is all 100% public. People can&#39;t comprehend why those things happen, or how they fit into the larger picture, and thus write them off as random or one-time instances of corruption.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying to be pessimistic, or to not try to wake people up. But if we really want to change the world, we need to be realistic about the best and strongest way to do so. Arguing with people who want to sleep is a waste of time and energy. </p>

<p>We need to take care of ourselves first and foremost. When you become strong and happy, it <em>rubs off on other people.</em> This is not hyperbole; it is true in a literal sense. People intuitively can feel what you&#39;re about and, if you&#39;re living strong and in the light, they will be positively influenced by you. This is how we will change the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. The other day I was reading about North Korea. I always assumed that people there more or less knew the system was BS, but couldn&#39;t do anything about it. I was shocked to learn, though, that most North Koreans actually love dear leader Kim Jong-un. Many defectors have said they literally considered him a God and still are afraid he can read their minds <em>years after escaping.</em> This shows how programmable human beings are.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have been taught that the apparent orbit of the Sun, planets, and stars (but not the Moon!) around the Earth are all optical illusions, that it is in fact the Earth beneath our feet which moves, and our eyes that deceive us. Special exception is made for the Moon, however, which is said to revolve around Earth just as it appears. Since we only ever see one side of the Moon, we have been taught this is because the Moon’s supposed 10.3 mph West to East rotation combined with its 2,288 mph orbit of Earth just happens to be the EXACT motion and speed necessary to perfectly cancel out the Earth’s supposed 1,000 mph East to West rotation and 67,000 mph orbit of the Sun, thereby creating the perpetual dark side of the Moon illusion! Oh really!?</p>

<p>Though the Sun and Moon appear to be relatively small equal-sized bodies revolving around a stationary Earth, we have been taught that this too is an optical illusion, and they are in fact thousands of miles divergent in diameter! They say the Sun is actually a whopping 865,374 miles across, 109 times wider than the Earth, and, contrary to all experience, experiments, and common sense, that we revolve around it! They say the Moon is 2,159 miles across, a quarter the size of the Earth, and why they appear the same size is because the Moon is “only” 238,000 miles away, while the Sun is an unfathomable 93,000,000 miles away from the Earth, and these just happen to be the EXACT diameters and distances necessary for a viewer from Earth to “falsely” perceive them as being the same size! You don’t say!?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no universe at least not in the current standard model. How come since 1970 there is not a better picture of earth? The image is the same one they have used for years the same as used on the original iphone. We are on a flat surface, I know this sounds fucking nuttier than a snickers bar but when you actually think about it it makes sense.</p>

<p>We have been taught that the height of stupidity and naivety was when our ignorant ancestors believed the Earth to be flat, and that if any man somehow still thinks the Earth to be the immovable center of the universe, that they must be the most primitive kind of ignoramus. Nowadays the label “Flat-Earther” has become literally synonymous with “moron” and is a common cliché derogatory term for insulting someone’s intelligence. Upon seeing  Flat Earth your ingrained instinct was likely to laugh, mock the messenger, and deny the very possibility.</p>

<p>Ancient civilizations the world over believed Earth to be the flat, immovable center of the universe around which the heavens revolved daily cycles in perfect circles. This stable geocentric universe, proven true by experience and experiments, which reigned undisputed for thousands of years adequately explaining all Earthly and celestial phenomena, was violently uprooted, spun around, and sent flying through infinite space by a cabal of Sun-worshipping
theoretical astronomers. Early Masonic magicians like Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, along with their modern Masonic astro-not counter-parts like Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins, hand-in-hand with NASA and world Freemasonry have pulled off the greatest hoax, propagated the most phenomenal lie, and perpetuated the most complete indoctrination in history.</p>

<p>Over the course of 500 years, using everything from books, magazines, and television to computer-generated imaging, a multi-generational conspiracy has succeeded, in the minds of the masses, to pick up the fixed Earth, shape it into a ball, spin it in circles, and throw it around the Sun! In schools where every professor’s desk is adorned with a spinning Earth-globe, we are lectured on the “heliocentric” theory of the universe, shown images of ball-planets and videos of men suspended in space. The illusion created, cunningly convincing, has entranced the world’s population into blindly believing a maleficent myth. The greatest cover-up of all time, NASA and Freemasonry’s biggest secret, is that we are living on a plane, not a planet, that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the universe.</p>

<p>This is the greatest conspiracy of all time yet it will be so inherently mocked so vehemently denied it may never come to light. The trillions funneled through NASA to mindfuck us must be repaid to every citizen on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That ain&#39;t a source. </p>

<p>Air flight times change. Why is it shorter to fly from Dallas to New York than it is from New York to Dallas by 23 minutes? If the earth was flat wouldn&#39;t it be the same no matter what? </p>

<p>The information you seek is easily found. Science disproves your fairy tale. Flat earthers are a group of people I flat out refuse to debate. You have no real evidence. It&#39;s all pictures that you look at and say &quot;WHY CANT I SEE A CURVE.?!?!&quot; Five year olds would ask questions that debunk it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Space travel is the fairy tale my friend. 
Why doesn&#39;t in your example above the 1,000 mph spin of the earth make the time shorter from NY to Dallas? Earth would be spinning to help this distance become shorter by your globe model.</p>
