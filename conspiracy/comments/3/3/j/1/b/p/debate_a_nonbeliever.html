<p>Straw man argument. I simply said I believe the government is not telling us the truth on everything and they are definetly hiding some stuff. Whether it be this stuff that &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; believe or something else, they are definitely hiding some stuff.</p>

<p>Just because something is held from us doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it jeopardizes our safety. There could be plenty of things that they are not telling us that have nothing to do with the preservation of our safety, for example they can be an anagram of non-nefarious sociopolitical/economic factors.</p>

<p>LOL. You are trying to justify the Tuskegee syphilis experiment on African-Americans. And by the way, it was 600 people who were forced to get syphilis and forced to undergo tests with all sorts of different unethical procedures with chemicals.</p>

<p>The Tuskegee syphilis experiment was an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 <strong>by the U.S. Public Health Service</strong> to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama. <strong>They were told that they were receiving <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm">free health care from the U.S. government</a>.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have lied to us before, what makes you think they wouldn&#39;t do it now? And If you think tracking our phones and spying on us is in our best interest, you are delusional. It violates the constitution - the ONE thing that Americans wave and brag about, freedom. </p>

<p>The US Public Health Service tricked people who were already down on their luck into becoming human lab rats.</p>

<p>It began when the US Public Health Service teamed up with the Tuskegee Institute to study the long term effects of syphilis on the human body. They contacted a group of 600 poor, African American men (399 of which had syphilis) and offered to give them free health care. However, this “health care” never involved treating the men for syphilis or even informing them they had the disease. Instead, the clinicians told the men they had “bad blood,” an ambiguous and unscientific term for a variety of illnesses. Making matters worse, by the 1940s, penicillin was a proven cure for syphilis—yet none of the men received it. Thanks to Peter Buxton, a 27-year-old employee of the US Public Health Service, the 40 year study was put to an end in 1972 when Buxton revealed information about the experiment to the Washington Star. He went public with the details after filing multiple complaints within his organization and didn’t receive a response. Unfortunately, dozens of men had died and many of their wives and children were infected by that time.In 1997, President Bill Clinton offered an official apology for the racist and inhumane study, but it seems the damage was already done.</p>

<p>The Tuskegee syphilis experiment was an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 <strong>by the U.S. Public Health Service</strong> to study the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama. <strong>They were told that they were receiving <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm">free health care from the U.S. government</a>.</strong></p>

<p>The government has illegally detained thousands of people, the most notorious example being the men at Guantánamo. The Center for Constitutional Rights has fought for the right to due process, filing countless cases on behalf of these men and others swept up in the so-called War on Terror.</p>

<p>Force feeding, water boarding, torturing in Guantanamo bay.
<strong>Psychological abuse, physical abuse, medical abuse, sexual provocation, rape, harassment, religious/cultural abuse, pre-Guantanamo torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.</strong>

    <div class="md"><p>The government is still the government. They haven&#39;t learned from their mistakes. They killed millions of innocent Iraqis and Afghans who had NOTHING to do with Saddam or Osama bin Laden. Innocent children. And what was the reason? We <em>believed</em> they had weapons of mass destruction. Then we found out there were no mass weapons of mass destruction. Next excuse they bring up to stay in Iraq &quot;We have to get rid of Saddam! He is hurting the people!&quot;. First of all, Iraq was far better off under Saddam then they were under American occupations and sanctions. Second, after they killed Saddam what was their third excuse for staying in Iraq? &quot;&#39;The Taliban/al-qaeda/terrorist groups&#39; are here!!!!&quot; Well no duh, the terrorist groups emerged as a resistance group. I&#39;m not going to defend their (the terrorist groups) actions because they&#39;re unjustifiable but it is important to realize that they arose out of over 30 years of war. Subject anyone to that much war and bloodshed and they&#39;ll go insane. The last Iraq war alone resulted in the deaths of 1.3 million innocent Iraqis. Look at the effects sanctions had on the Iraqi children:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Researcher Richard Garfield estimated that &quot;a minimum of 100,000 and a more likely estimate of 227,000 excess deaths among young children from August 1991 through March 1998&quot; from all causes including sanctions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Russia bombed your entire country and destroyed all of your towns and occupied your land and raped your mother and sister and held them as slaves and killed your father you would think that Russians are terrorists, and that you must join a resistance group to fight against them. </p>

<p>The American government is the direct cause of these terrorist groups in the east, whether you like it or not. This is not a conspiracy. Everyone knows it, heck, even professors in college classes openly say that the war was because we wanted oil, not to stop the atrocities happening in Iraq/Afghanistan. We invaded Iraq because they had something we wanted (oil). Answer this (my philosophy professor said this in class, I think it is well put):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are there a lot of evil and terrible atrocities happening in Africa? Yes. Why don&#39;t we help them? Because they are not in our best interest; they don&#39;t have anything we want.</p>

<p>If you really think the U.S. Government cares about people and is fighting terrorists, think again. They work for their own benefit, the U.S. Government is selfish and corrupt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The proposals called for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or other US government operatives to commit acts of terrorism against American civilians and military targets, blaming it on the Cuban government, and using it to justify a war against Cuba. The proposals were rejected by the Kennedy administration.</p>

<p>It does remind us that the Government would do ANYTHING. Even kill Americans, to get what they want.</p>

You come off as an ignorant person and you expect your insults to cover up for your lack of evidence. It was drafted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, signed by Chairman Lyman Lemnitzer and sent to the Secretary of Defense and approved, then rejected by Kennedy. If that many people were willing to do such a thing that speaks volumes of the character of the government. You are probably the one in high school considering you open your arguments with &quot;grow the fuck up&quot; and &quot;go to college&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re an imbecile&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had hundreds. One more would just waste my time. You  cannot support your own position  and have not to this point considered that you would ever need to.</p>

<p>Your kind   just make endless demands for proof of whatever comes to your mind and are typically unreasonably belligerent. </p>

<p>Nothing proves anything for you.  Looking up and seeing the sun doesn&#39;t prove it&#39;s daytime where you are.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll say that&#39;s just an assumption of mine.</p>

<p>You cannot be the least bit honest or rational and support your side. </p>

<p>There is no reasonable doubt that 9/11 was an inside job. </p>

<p>There can be no reasonable doubt that the government considers it&#39;s own people it&#39;s adversary, is run by sociopaths and psychopaths and CONSPIRES to gain more power over them. </p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the government completely ignores the will of the people and that they  typically feel scorn against the majority.</p>

<p>No I won&#39;t argue the possibility that you are  just a random inquisitive person because the chances are far too slim. Your tactics match a far too well worn pattern. Prove I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>If any  further communication is justified it will start with a complete description of what you believe and how you came to those conclusions without the inclusion of ad hominem statements  about me rather than the subject at hand.</p>

<p>Continuous demands that I prove things to your satisfaction while you don&#39;t feel the need to reciprocate  will not be tolerated because  they are strictly a tactic to waste my time and energy. </p>

<p>I would like just once in my life to hear how anyone at all could possibly support the governments positions on anything we here discuss. I say it isn&#39;t reasonably possible.</p>
