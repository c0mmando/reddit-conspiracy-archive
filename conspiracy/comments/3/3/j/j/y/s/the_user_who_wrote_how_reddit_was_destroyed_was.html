    <div class="md"><p>My 4 year old account (<a href="/u/diselphiend">/u/diselphiend</a>) was banned site wide, and my subreddit-- <a href="/r/CannabisCures">/r/CannabisCures</a> was also &quot;banned&quot;, for simply messaging the mods at <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> about the removal of a TPP post. This week. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really funny to watch the Reddit administration attempt to fight the rising tides. No matter how hard they try- people are concerned with the state of the world, and they always will be. It reminds me of the story of the little boy who attempted to stop the dam from breaking by plugging  a hole with his finger, only to have more holes created around him. It really is a full-time job attempting to snuff out awareness, but it will never work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on this site now only for disruptive and guerrilla warfare, which is quite fun. I&#39;m not even doing anything complicated or &#39;haxxor&#39; related, simply psychological abuse of power hunger moderators, admins and massive disruptive activities on the site itself, and punishment of the stupid users. It&#39;s quite hilarious how easily you can make these people furious and how all you need is something primitive as TOR browser. It&#39;s not even a kindergarden level of disrupting web services, yet they&#39;re too dumb to prevent it. </p>

<p>I highly recommend everyone to do these disruptive and guerrilla warfare things as well. This site is lost and punishment of the stupid with harvesting of their tears is the thing every decent human being should do now before this site is a <del>graveyard</del> digg for good in less than 2 years. </p>

<p>That is such an immature response. Of course it&#39;s possible to show me some kind of data. </p>

<p>Conduct an experiment. Your hypothesis will be that humiliation and belittlement of another human being leads said human being becoming smarter. That&#39;s the gist of what you&#39;re saying right? Now define your sample as a person who has been humiliated and belittled because of ignorance. Find as much of these people as you can because the more samples the better. Now, define what metric you&#39;re going to use measure someone&#39;s intelligence. Record the sample&#39;s score for before and after humiliation and belittlement. If the sample scores higher after humiliation and belittlement, then at least you&#39;ll have some kind of evidence to support your ridiculous claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that&#39;s significantly wrong.  If you want someone to listen to you, politely make valid counter arguments.  If you want to do so even better, make a point of mentioning what parts of their statement you agree with &quot;While it&#39;s true that... still...&quot;  If they weren&#39;t going to listen to anything anyway you&#39;ve lost nothing.  If there was a chance they would listen to reasoned points, you not only destroy it by trying to make them look/feel bad, but actually strengthen their wrong beliefs through a combination of causing them to be defensive and by being rude/emotional/not focused on the discussion in your comments.</p>

<p>That is very moronic and in direct violation of free speech</p>

<p>Where did I say you <em>had</em> to take that approach?  This was simply pointing out a better way to open people&#39;s mind than &quot;humiliating&quot; them and has nothing to do with free speech.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please contribute directly to the topic of this thread instead of trying to &#39;lecture&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yeah... not really sure how talk of &quot;convincing&quot; people by &quot;humiliating&quot; them is directly related to a post about an unjust ban itself.  I didn&#39;t make this as a stand alone comment, but as a response to yours.  This is how Reddit works; you get into discussions by responding to people&#39;s comments, which in the case of your comment <em>did not</em> &quot;contribute directly to the topic of this thread&quot; which is normal in running discussions.</p>

<p>But oh, I didn&#39;t realize I look like unintelligent moron because I disagreed with you and violated your freedom of speech.  I&#39;m so convinced now though.  I stand &quot;humiliated&quot;...</p>

<p>Please do not tell me how reddit works. This site is suppose to be an open platform and I can exercise my free speech in any way I please. I did not mean to insult you, however your previous comment almost sounded like a moronic contribution to this discussion. If you have any further arguments to offer <em>to the topic itself</em>, I&#39;m willing to listen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, you&#39;re not addressing the fact that as soon as you&#39;re in a discussion about how you deal with people who do/say stuff you find stupid <em>you yourself are not directly discussing the topic of the post</em>.  This happens in every comment thread and is normal, and nigh unavoidable.  Then you seem to imply that your objection is the fact that my &quot;contribution to this discussion&quot; sounded moronic.  First, which is it?  That it&#39;s not directly related to the topic of the post (just like yours before it)?  Or that it is moronic (your opinion)?</p>

<p>Censorship sucks, but conflating disagreement with censorship is itself de facto censorship.  You <em>can</em> exercise your free speech in any way you want on Reddit (with the exception of the bullshit bans/deletions like that mentioned in your post title), but telling other people they shouldn&#39;t do the same, in the same context and with the same level of relevance to the post is hypocritical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote 2 comments.  They were about your behavior too.  You need to grow up.  All you keep saying is &quot;moron&quot; and &quot;buttmad/assmad&quot;  You must be 12.  The user you&#39;re speaking about deletes his reddit accounts often.  Maybe he was banned, maybe he wasn&#39;t.  His only other post was asking if he was shadow banned, which was proved to be false.  So you keep using your script kiddie tactics if you want to, but I seriously doubt you&#39;ll change anything around here.  Everyone knows the mods have gone silly, it&#39;s been proven over and over again.  If you would like to have a discussion, I&#39;m game for that, but I don&#39;t think you can bring much to the table.  </p>

<p>Your rebuttal?</p>

For instance, I was banned for using the word &quot;Hypocrite&quot; when describing a certain radical Christian group and their activities.

<p>This site had its genesis in astroturf.</p>

<p>Should we have expected any different?</p>

<p>As one grows older, one learns that most things are corrupt to the core.</p>

<p>Some become disillusioned.</p>

<p>Others spend their time finding ways to exist despite the defects all around them.</p>

<p>In the end, happiness comes from within. If you are looking to a website (or a government) for freedom, you will find disappointment instead.</p>

<p>The removal the visible vote counter was one of the biggest signs to me. Then the &quot;Witch Hunter&quot; and &quot;Vote brigading&quot; talking points that kept showing up for deleted posts (both around the same time). </p>

<p>Probably the biggest reasons was the garbage moderators selectively enforcing vague rules; basically Fluff moderators acting as the gate keeper by removing unfit comments/posts. Don&#39;t need them.</p>

<p>Incorrect. Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>

<p>This applies to a website run by a private for profit orgaization as well.</p>

<p>Anything else is a direct and heavy violation of basic human rights. Of course many States, groups and people are not following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights properly, but that doesn&#39;t mean it is not universal and binding all and everyone to it. It is our duty that we must follow this Declaration everywhere and at all times as humanly as possible.</p>

<p>I have to disagree with this point entirely.  Those freedoms are in place to protect us from government censorship.  What <a href="/u/NSA_web_spider">/u/NSA_web_spider</a> was saying about the mall is no different than a restaurant having the ability to refuse service, ostensibly for being too drunk, but that is never explicitly stated.   Reddit has no obiigation to anyone except their own profit motives.  They&#39;re well withing their rights to ban anyone, or everyone, as they see fit.  Not saying it&#39;s nice or good, but it is unquestionably reality.   Private clubs may always choose who gets to be members and what the rules are in their club.    </p>

I don&#39;t believe the majority of reddit users expectation is censorship on this site.

    <div class="md"><p>As do I, but you seem to not understand that when someone creates a service, it is their property, and they have the liberty to do what they will with it. Especially so if it is an online website. If I make my own website forum, do I not reserve the right to ban anyone I deem might be disturbing my forum? The power is there, I was the one who created it, it&#39;s mine. Do not delude yourself to think that I can&#39;t censor something that&#39;s been put in a place I own, it is my right because it is my property. Same goes here on reddit. Not that it makes censorship right, but those who own the site do hold the power to silence anyone they please. You can&#39;t get any more common sense than that.</p>

<p>If you were right about </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do, your service will be removed, as according to the law of the Declaration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then wouldn&#39;t reddit disappear? It has not. Wouldn&#39;t many things disappear? They have not. Thus you are wrong and your logic is flawed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and everyone must follow them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by law of nature I am <em>forced</em> to do something? Again, no. That violates my right to liberty. Again, flawed logic. Not at all common sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this man-made thing simply recognizes natural rights and declares them? Interesting, though I never needed such a thing to understand my rights.</p>

<p>However, it turns out by the way things are these days, is that natural rights, even in the universal declaration of them, is void. This is the day and age of legal persons, where we are <em>legally</em> bound and liable. This universal declaration has no say in &#39;the system&#39; simply because that is how the system works.</p>

<p>&quot;Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration.&quot;</p>

<p>And yet the system can say they&#39;re not. Legally. And enforce it, because it has the power. </p>

<p>The way the system is, Article 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9... probably a lot of the others, are already infringed, in most people&#39;s daily lives. So it recognizes these rights. That doesn&#39;t mean we get to exercise them without consequence in this system.</p>

<p>The 14th Amendment recognizes anyone <strong>born</strong> or <strong>naturalized</strong> in the United States as a United States civilian. You are AUTOMATICALLY part of a system, automatically liable to the system, no matter what you do. That&#39;s how they recognize you, and they can stamp any amount of liabilities on your forehead for it to tell you what you can and cannot do. That is the legal system of rights, rather than the natural. And that is what&#39;s enforced. You can say whatever the buck you want about this universal declaration of human rights, that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re going to be respected and allowed to be exercised. It cannot force someone to do so any more than I can say I am God and can make anyone do whatever I wish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More importantly, it seems many of the things this declaration has said are not inalienable. As in things that cannot be taken away. Censorship is not really taking away one&#39;s right to freedom of speech. If you post a comment and it is deleted, it does not infringe upon your right to free speech. You are fully capable and have the right to act in saying something, as others have a right to either ignore or delete what has been said. The right to free speech gives you the right to use your person to communicate something. Doesn&#39;t mean someone literally cannot delete what you&#39;ve said or ignore it.</p>

<p>To <em>truly</em> infringe upon one&#39;s right to freedom of speech, one must have to physically render you incapable of saying or doing anything to communicate. And that requires a lot of effort and force. Deleting comments on internet forums is not an infringement of your person&#39;s capabilities to communicate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. My freedom is not limited because someone thinks I&#39;m disturbing the peace or trespassing. You know this logic is used in every country that is not free, right? It is abused heavily and that&#39;s why it is an utter and complete nonsense and wrong argument to use. I wouldn&#39;t even need to go to the court; the justice would be done long before that.</p>

<p>Protests can happen anywhere, you&#39;re entitled to make them anywhere. Government can say no, but it is in direct violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nobody is saying here that every state is perfect. Far from it. You&#39;re a very confused person if you don&#39;t understand the difference between the Declaration and how imperfectly so many states are trying to follow it. Our duty is to try to follow it as much as humanly possible.</p>
