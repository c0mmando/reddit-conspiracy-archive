       <a href="/u/diselphiend">

        /r/CannabisCures

       was also "banned", for simply messaging the mods at

        /r/news

       about the removal of a TPP post. This week.

       It's really funny to watch the Reddit administration attempt to fight the rising tides. No matter how hard they try- people are concerned with the state of the world, and they always will be. It reminds me of the story of the little boy who attempted to stop the dam from breaking by plugging  a hole with his finger, only to have more holes created around him. It really is a full-time job attempting to snuff out awareness, but it will never work.

       I'm on this site now only for disruptive and guerrilla warfare, which is quite fun. I'm not even doing anything complicated or 'haxxor' related, simply psychological abuse of power hunger moderators, admins and massive disruptive activities on the site itself, and punishment of the stupid users. It's quite hilarious how easily you can make these people furious and how all you need is something primitive as TOR browser. It's not even a kindergarden level of disrupting web services, yet they're too dumb to prevent it.
      </p>

       I highly recommend everyone to do these disruptive and guerrilla warfare things as well. This site is lost and punishment of the stupid with harvesting of their tears is the thing every decent human being should do now before this site is a

       The stupid must be punished, because there is nothing else to do with them. Killing them creates fear and despair, so humiliation and disruption of their ill minds will learn them how the world really works the hard way.

       To punish morons on reddit is my hobby and as a side effect I'm actually helping those people to learn how to be better in life. They suffer humiliation and unhuman punishment at first, but are worthy contribution to the society later.

       The previous reply from me to your comment was wrong, I thought you're someone else. I'm sorry.

      <p>
       I do not know what do you mean by 'show me some data'. How am I suppose to do that? I just know it works, because I see the reactions and the whole machine as a whole. I can't just link one account and say Look how this person changed after this or that. My work is bigger than this and has much more little things you can't possible see unless you're directly involved.

       That is such an immature response. Of course it's possible to show me some kind of data.

       Conduct an experiment. Your hypothesis will be that humiliation and belittlement of another human being leads said human being becoming smarter. That's the gist of what you're saying right? Now define your sample as a person who has been humiliated and belittled because of ignorance. Find as much of these people as you can because the more samples the better. Now, define what metric you're going to use measure someone's intelligence. Record the sample's score for before and after humiliation and belittlement. If the sample scores higher after humiliation and belittlement, then at least you'll have some kind of evidence to support your ridiculous claims.

       Wow, that's significantly wrong.  If you want someone to listen to you, politely make valid counter arguments.  If you want to do so even better, make a point of mentioning what parts of their statement you agree with "While it's true that... still..."  If they weren't going to listen to anything anyway you've lost nothing.  If there was a chance they would listen to reasoned points, you not only destroy it by trying to make them look/feel bad, but actually strengthen their wrong beliefs through a combination of causing them to be defensive and by being rude/emotional/not focused on the discussion in your comments.

       Yeah... not really sure how talk of "convincing" people by "humiliating" them is directly related to a post about an unjust ban itself.  I didn't make this as a stand alone comment, but as a response to yours.  This is how Reddit works; you get into discussions by responding to people's comments, which in the case of your comment
       <em>
        did not
       </em>
       "contribute directly to the topic of this thread" which is normal in running discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But oh, I didn't realize I look like unintelligent moron because I disagreed with you and violated your freedom of speech.  I'm so convinced now though.  I stand "humiliated"...

       OK, you're not addressing the fact that as soon as you're in a discussion about how you deal with people who do/say stuff you find stupid
       <em>
        you yourself are not directly discussing the topic of the post
       </em>
       .  This happens in every comment thread and is normal, and nigh unavoidable.  Then you seem to imply that your objection is the fact that my "contribution to this discussion" sounded moronic.  First, which is it?  That it's not directly related to the topic of the post (just like yours before it)?  Or that it is moronic (your opinion)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Censorship sucks, but conflating disagreement with censorship is itself de facto censorship.  You
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       exercise your free speech in any way you want on Reddit (with the exception of the bullshit bans/deletions like that mentioned in your post title), but telling other people they shouldn't do the same, in the same context and with the same level of relevance to the post is hypocritical.

       You're right. Unless your contribution is in a direct violation of basic human rights. I believe that was not your case however and thus I must admit that I was wrong and I apologize.

       That is not hacking. That is probably the most primitive and pathetic version of DDoS you can make by our own. I use it for random punishment of abusive admins and moderators, which is always nice and good thing to do.

       You should get a lawyer now, before you have no choice.

      <p>
       You should then describe what you are doing, and ask for advice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you have that advice, whether you choose to continue on this path is up to you, but you should have a good understanding of the potential ramifications of that choice.

       Nice well thought out response. You show your immaturity. Vigilante justice is not legal. There is a proper justice system in place. You can't just go out and hunt down and kill who you think is guilty. That is illegal

       How about you 503 only r/Pedosexual for example?

       There are only dirty disgusting peadophiles there. You know, the kind that think that fucking small children should be a UN declared universal human right.

       I'm a pedosexual, therefore I'll never do such thing.

      <p>
       There is nothing wrong about pedosexulity and it is legal and normal sexuality as any other. Fucking small children who gave their consent to do so is no different than fucking adults who gave theirs. This is not the topic of this thread, however. If you wish to discuss this further, you must do it somewhere else.

       You are absolutely being trolled. It's hilarious that you keep replying to him. He's even getting  on nerves enough for you to insult him. He's not even really trying and you keep biting at his bait. Every time you dignify him with an answer, he wins.

       I wrote 2 comments.  They were about your behavior too.  You need to grow up.  All you keep saying is "moron" and "buttmad/assmad"  You must be 12.  The user you're speaking about deletes his reddit accounts often.  Maybe he was banned, maybe he wasn't.  His only other post was asking if he was shadow banned, which was proved to be false.  So you keep using your script kiddie tactics if you want to, but I seriously doubt you'll change anything around here.  Everyone knows the mods have gone silly, it's been proven over and over again.  If you would like to have a discussion, I'm game for that, but I don't think you can bring much to the table.

       Believeable. Some mods are either shills or have personal agendas. For instance, I was banned for using the word "Hypocrite" when describing a certain radical Christian group and their activities. Apparently, "hypocrite" is a "bad word" or violates some rule of "reddiquette."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anymore, I am inclined to agree with those who think the entire "political correct speech" thing is a giant scam designed to censor free speech.

       This is just one more example.

       Well to be honest this is nothing new , reddit is actually pretty bad site for exchanging opinions because of downvote , even if your opinion is a bit different then "meta opinion" of some sub , you will get downvoted into oblivion.

      <p>
       I also actually had 2 accounts shadowbanned(really really lame way of banning someone by the way) and i dont even use reddit that much all i did was comment on world news sub,witch appreantly i know now, is pretty toxic.

       I normally call it the Monkey See, Monkey Do principle of Reddit.  People don't read the post and just vote based on what other people have done.

       Yup, just waiting for the next place at this point. At least this site has served a purpose for a couple years; learned a lot about corruption for example. It always a good idea to have multiple sources anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The removal the visible vote counter was one of the biggest signs to me. Then the "Witch Hunter" and "Vote brigading" talking points that kept showing up for deleted posts (both around the same time).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the biggest reasons was the garbage moderators selectively enforcing vague rules; basically Fluff moderators acting as the gate keeper by removing unfit comments/posts. Don't need them.

       This is kinda off topic but can someone tell me please if admins can increase your posting wait time?

       I defended myself against some of the more vocal bullies on the Doctor Who sub and now I have a long wait between posts, I messaged one of the admins who told me they can't affect posting wait times, is this correct please?

       Incorrect. Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.

       Anything else is a direct and heavy violation of basic human rights. Of course many States, groups and people are not following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights properly, but that doesn't mean it is not universal and binding all and everyone to it. It is our duty that we must follow this Declaration everywhere and at all times as humanly as possible.

       I have to disagree with this point entirely.  Those freedoms are in place to protect us from government censorship.  What

       was saying about the mall is no different than a restaurant having the ability to refuse service, ostensibly for being too drunk, but that is never explicitly stated.   Reddit has no obiigation to anyone except their own profit motives.  They're well withing their rights to ban anyone, or everyone, as they see fit.  Not saying it's nice or good, but it is unquestionably reality.   Private clubs may always choose who gets to be members and what the rules are in their club.

       Negative. Those freedoms apply to all human beings and do not serve only as protection from government censorship. That is because everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.

       Free speech is a basic human right. A privately owned website (or any website) cannot set any rule that is against Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Otherwise this site, or any other, could set rules against the Declaration, which would be illegal and the site would be taken down. Your argument is a nonsense.

       Just my opinion. I get where you're coming from. I believe he is saying free speech is a right granted universally, not by a piece of paper written by slave owners two hundred years ago. His point increases in validity if you consider the idea that your right to free speech should not be governed by legal authority. Also, let's not deter. I don't believe the majority of reddit users expectation is censorship on this site. Regardless of what their "rights" are, considering this is a website designed as a forum for discussion, one should always take censorship under heavy consideration whenever it occurs.

       It's hardly a misunderstanding of free speech, more a misunderstanding of how terms and services/rules work. Those things

        do

       have a purpose, after all. How hard is it to understand the idea of 'If you're using our service, we reserve the right to remove whatever you decide to post/comment on it for whatever reason we deem. We consider using our service as you accepting this rule.'?

       Wrong. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is not some

        service

       or some
       <em>

       you

       follow. Those are universal rights granted for everyone, and everyone
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       follow them. You cannot create a service which will be in violation of the basic human rights. If you do, your service will be removed, as according to the law of the Declaration, as nothing in the Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set in the Declaration.

       As do I, but you seem to not understand that when someone creates a service, it is their property, and they have the liberty to do what they will with it. Especially so if it is an online website. If I make my own website forum, do I not reserve the right to ban anyone I deem might be disturbing my forum? The power is there, I was the one who created it, it's mine. Do not delude yourself to think that I can't censor something that's been put in a place I own, it is my right because it is my property. Same goes here on reddit. Not that it makes censorship right, but those who own the site do hold the power to silence anyone they please. You can't get any more common sense than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were right about
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If you do, your service will be removed, as according to the law of the Declaration
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then wouldn't reddit disappear? It has not. Wouldn't many things disappear? They have not. Thus you are wrong and your logic is flawed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and everyone must follow them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So by law of nature I am
       <em>
        forced
       </em>
       to do something? Again, no. That violates my right to liberty. Again, flawed logic. Not at all common sense.

       Wrong. You cannot censor anyone just because it is 'your property'. You do realize this logic is used in China, North Korea and other non-free countries. You do realize that is a direct violation of human rights. If you create anything in this world, you must obey the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, because it is
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       basic humanity document used for
       <em>

      <p>
       What is your definition of 'human' rights?

       What is your definition of freedom?

       There is no 'my' definition of the fundamental and Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The definition itself is universal, for all, as all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

       Nonsense. I'm not hiding anything. I'm able to answer anything you want. I answered there is no 'my' definition of anything you mentioned in previous comment. Thus your whole question-aparatis failed as a proper tool and starting point to answer anything you wanted to know. Ask again and formulate your questions more carefully.

       Okay, then tell me what the definitions are. If there is no
       <em>
        your

       So this man-made thing simply recognizes natural rights and declares them? Interesting, though I never needed such a thing to understand my rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it turns out by the way things are these days, is that natural rights, even in the universal declaration of them, is void. This is the day and age of legal persons, where we are
       <em>
        legally
       </em>
       bound and liable. This universal declaration has no say in 'the system' simply because that is how the system works.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration."
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet the system can say they're not. Legally. And enforce it, because it has the power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the system is, Article 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9... probably a lot of the others, are already infringed, in most people's daily lives. So it recognizes these rights. That doesn't mean we get to exercise them without consequence in this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 14th Amendment recognizes anyone
       <strong>
        born
       </strong>
       or
       <strong>
        naturalized
       </strong>
       in the United States as a United States civilian. You are AUTOMATICALLY part of a system, automatically liable to the system, no matter what you do. That's how they recognize you, and they can stamp any amount of liabilities on your forehead for it to tell you what you can and cannot do. That is the legal system of rights, rather than the natural. And that is what's enforced. You can say whatever the buck you want about this universal declaration of human rights, that doesn't mean they're going to be respected and allowed to be exercised. It cannot force someone to do so any more than I can say I am God and can make anyone do whatever I wish.

       More importantly, it seems many of the things this declaration has said are not inalienable. As in things that cannot be taken away. Censorship is not really taking away one's right to freedom of speech. If you post a comment and it is deleted, it does not infringe upon your right to free speech. You are fully capable and have the right to act in saying something, as others have a right to either ignore or delete what has been said. The right to free speech gives you the right to use your person to communicate something. Doesn't mean someone literally cannot delete what you've said or ignore it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To
       <em>
        truly
       </em>
       infringe upon one's right to freedom of speech, one must have to physically render you incapable of saying or doing anything to communicate. And that requires a lot of effort and force. Deleting comments on internet forums is not an infringement of your person's capabilities to communicate.

       Wrong. The fact you can't loud in a library is not a violation of free speech. You can still express free speech in a library. You argument is weak and complete nonsense.

       The Universal Declaration of Human Rights does indeed legally bind all government in the world, including all private entities. Because nothing in the Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set in the Declaration.

       Whether you agree with it or not, any website has the right to censor any speech it wants to, for any reason it wants to. The United States Government is forbidden from making LAWS that limit speech, but that's a whole different thing.

       It is legally binding, because all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter what is your state or your laws, you're bound to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights because you simply just exist. These rules contain only freedom and basic human rights, therefore they must not be viewed as anything wrong. Unless there is something wrong with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.

       All countries are not bound to the Declaration, first of all. Only the ones who signed and ratified it. Secondly, it's only legally binding if the United Nations have the authority to use violence to compel individuals, corporations, nations and states to abide by the Declaration, which they do not.

       Quoting a thing does not make the thing more than it is. You're basically doing the same thing religious people do:

      <p>
       "The Bible is the word of God."
      </p>
      <p>
       "How do you know?"

      <p>
       "It says so in The Bible."

       What's different between those two statements? It's fine. You don't understand legal authority. But at the end of the day, reddit is not bound to the UDHR, and can do whatever it wants, whether you agree with me or not.

       You're missing my point here. The UNDHR claims to be universal and have the force of law but there is no enforcement mechanism. As such it is really more of a guideline or a way to condemn another country you already didn't like. If you think violating it (which hasn't happened here anyways because it's about state actions) has any real world consequences you are wrong.

       There never was an enforcement mechanism and there never will be. Any UN decision can be vetoed by any of the five permanent members of the Security Council. That's the U.S., Russia, China, England and France. None of them would ever want to face punishment for their action so no enforcement mechanism is possible.

       Wrong. Free speech absolutely is a basic right granted by just the fact you were born. The law is protected everywhere on Earth. Because everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, nothing in the Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set in the Declaration.

       It doesn't matter who "they" is. The owners of the site can censor you as they wish, and have given the same power to the moderators. Even other users can censor you by voting. None of this violates any of your rights.

       This is a well-brigaded point whenever it comes up.  They don't even seem to understand what they are saying, as the first amendment has never been suspended on private property nor is the framework of a country thought of as not applicable to private business.

       This is a well-honed contemporary talking point of Operation Earnest Voice.  Not to mention the fact that

       Good point. They probably have never even heard of natural rights. They think government allows them to speak. Freedom of expression is a natural right. We all have it. All the constitution does is make sure tyranny doesn't become tyranny.

       People who do not understand that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. That they are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

       Seriously, you're too funny. You're the one who's "assmad" but you try to put it off on me when I clearly don't give a shit. And you're calling me a moron while making the ridiculous assertion that the UDHR applies to websites! You complain that I'm not presenting any arguments, I have - that the UDHR is not applicable to websites or other private businesses. There's no disputing this. So you're just blowing up with butthurt comments because you have no way around the simple fact that the UHDR is not applicable to websites or businesses. This is too much. You're a riot. Got anymore hilariously butthurt things to yell at me?

       Your argument is wrong as I said in my previous comment. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights applies on
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        anywhere
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        anytime
       </em>
       . It doesn't matter that you're mumbling that it does not. All human beings are born free and nothing in the Declaration may be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set in the Declaration.

       You just can't get it through your tiny little pea brain that the UDHR has no real, theoretical, or philosophical ability to stop websites from publishing whatever the fuck they want.

       You have a freedom of speech against the government.  You don't have the freedom to say what you want on someone elses property.  That is why police will come and charge you with trespassing when you are making a ruckus in the parking lot next to the abortion clinic.  Sure you can say what you want to on the sidewalk, but the parking lot is private and they have now trespassed you for your freedom of speech.

       Wrong. You have the freedom to say what you want on someone elses property. Universal Declaration of Human Rights is universal and free speech must not be limited only to 'public areas', otherwise that would be censorship. Your argument is a complete nonsense.

       You have the freedom to say what you want until they don't want you around.  Then they call the police and you get trespassed and arrested for disturbing the peace and trespassing.  Good luck fighting that one in court as an infringement on your rights.  You have absolutely no freedom to just start spouting out bullshit or whatever your message is to someone in their place of business or in their yard.  Have you ever wondered why protests don't happen in malls or in a church parking lot?  They are always held in a street or similar area that is public property.  The ammendments are for your protection from the government, not for pissing off other citizens.  You are so confused it isn't even funny.

       Wrong. My freedom is not limited because someone thinks I'm disturbing the peace or trespassing. You know this logic is used in every country that is not free, right? It is abused heavily and that's why it is an utter and complete nonsense and wrong argument to use. I wouldn't even need to go to the court; the justice would be done long before that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protests can happen anywhere, you're entitled to make them anywhere. Government can say no, but it is in direct violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Nobody is saying here that every state is perfect. Far from it. You're a very confused person if you don't understand the difference between the Declaration and how imperfectly so many states are trying to follow it. Our duty is to try to follow it as much as humanly possible.

       I gave you a different perspective twice and you just reworded your response.  I'm not worried about your opinion because you won't see anything other than your own opinion and you are wrong.  I am not the only one that has this opinion.  Study some law to realize that the amendments protect you from the government, end of story.

       I hope you realize that what you just said can be used against your own comments as well. It is a moronic argument to use, and no matter how many agree with your opinion or how many laws realize whatever sick violation of human rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights cannot be interpreted as implying for any State, group or person any right to engage in any activity or to perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms set in the Declaration.

       Wrong. Any censorship anywhere in the world is against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. No state, private company or a person can exercise such act, because it is in direct violation of basic human rights.

       Create an autobot who will repeat the comment with ever-changing little content (dots, fonts, symbols), ever-changing usernames and ever-changing UIP and IP to avoid all possible shadowbans or hard-bans.
      </p>
      <p>
       This works extremely well and admins, moderators and other auto-bots are not even struggling with this - they're completely failing to protect the site against it and they're failing in protection of the censorship. Which is great. I'm using this whenever my comment or account gets deleted anywhere on the site.
