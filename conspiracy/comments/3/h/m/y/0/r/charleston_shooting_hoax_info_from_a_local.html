        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">20</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-08-19 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Xoxosharon.html">Xoxosharon</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For starters, I&#39;d like to say that this is just my theory. I&#39;m not 100% sure about anything, but after months of researching plenty of resources I definitely believe the Charleston shooting was a hoax. I actually live in Charleston, about 20 minutes away from downtown where the shooting supposedly took place. After seeing an early post on Facebook from a news station regarding a church being shot up, I immediately opened my police scanner to try and find some details out. When that failed, I called my dad to see if he had seen anything while he was out on his delivery job, and apparently he had just seen like 20 all black tinted window SUV&#39;s headed towards the downtown exit. That just weirds me out because I&#39;ve never been pulled over by a cop in an SUV and if it wasn&#39;t cops, who was it and how did they get there so quickly? </p>

<p>Besides that, I actually knew one of the victims son&#39;s. Chris Singleton, son of Sharonda Singleton. (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/j6H7YlA.png?1">http://i.imgur.com/j6H7YlA.png?1</a>) Whenever I tell people my thoughts about how it was all an hoax, they always ask me &quot;But why would he do that? What&#39;s the motive and why would they use some local dude that could blow their secret?&quot; Well, I imagine they used a local guy because otherwise, everyone in Charleston would be like &quot;who tf is that?&quot; and there would be way too many lose ends. If the victims are well known, there&#39;s more coverage. Sandy Hook had a lot of lose ends because they used crisis actors but this tragedy was much more put together because of the well known victims. My theory for Chris&#39; motive? Well, he&#39;s an athlete and has been playing baseball for years. With the publicity he&#39;s received, nationwide media coverage, and interview after interview, I&#39;m sure he could play on any team that he wanted. He&#39;s limitless as far as the things he can do now, especially now that he has money, fame, and people pity him. The dude even has a movie coming out about his strength. All of that at the age of 20 years old, that&#39;s enough to make anybody keep their mouth shut about anything. Especially if he experiences no actual loss. It&#39;s been a busy couple of months for him and his family, I can&#39;t imagine they&#39;ve had any time to grieve but they seem to be doing just fine, I&#39;ve put together a number of different screenshots that I&#39;ve gathered between his facebook and twitter because I just find his reaction to losing HIS MOTHER so damn weird. A few days after his birthday, he tweets that he wishes he could&#39;ve taken more selfies with his mom. Not spent more time with her or had her there during that time, but that he had more pictures with her. Lol. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Dz0waV0.png">http://i.imgur.com/Dz0waV0.png</a></p>

<p>Every since his mom&#39;s passing, he&#39;s been meeting athlete celebrities left and right. And this past weekend, Chris made national headlines again after throwing the first pitch for the New York Yankees.
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/oDitEkP.png">http://i.imgur.com/oDitEkP.png</a> </p>

<p>Two months prior to the shooting in March, Chris posted a picture of him and his mom posing in front of a Christmas tree. No caption or anything, along with two pictures of himself. not even a throw back Thursday, you&#39;re just gonna post a Christmas picture at the end of March? Weird timing dude. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Hllwzbi.png">http://i.imgur.com/Hllwzbi.png</a></p>

<p>Last but not least; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eu6qJCw.png">http://i.imgur.com/eu6qJCw.png</a>
Laid to rest by her family and only her family. I guess I just find it strange that friends weren&#39;t allowed to attend the funeral. Everything I find online says the funeral and viewing was open to the public, but this guy says otherwise. </p>

<p>Every since the night I heard about the shooting, something about it hasn&#39;t set right with me. Dylan Rooff, the shooter, was caught in Shelby, NC which is about 4 hours away from downtown Charleston, the next morning. Helicopters were spotlighting all over the city that night so I don&#39;t know how he got away and where he stayed. But it definitely didn&#39;t take him 13 hours to get there. After being arrested, the transport cops fed him burger king and flew him back to Charleston where he would be incarcerated at Leeds Avenue. I honestly was going to write a letter to him, but I found out that he isn&#39;t even allowed to receive mail. That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever heard of that, because plenty of people write murderers all the time. The whole thing is fishy and it screams hoax to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DOJ gave Charleston $29 million dollars &quot;to help families of victims of the mass murder of nine churchgoers at a historic black church in Charleston&quot; (this was later revised to say the funds were to be used state wide, so I hope the good citizens of Spartanburg get the help they need after this event). So $3.2 million per person killed from the federal govt. <a href="http://ojp.gov/ovc/grants/cvfa2015.html">A report of nationwide Office for Victims of Crime allocations for 2015</a> shows SC was allocated $3.9 mil in the Victim&#39;s Compensation fund at the beginning of the fiscal year, and those funds need to be spent over the next 4 years. That was actually the lowest initial allocation for SC in about 5 years (way to go, you&#39;re crime rates are going down!). But if you look at the assistance column, you&#39;ll see that it is up to $29.4 mil. These charts are mindboggling when you start going through them. Just compare what has already been given out/bookmarked in assistance for this fiscal year compared to last year. FY14 had only 4 states receiving more than $25 mil, this year there are 26 states. SD went from $235k to $5.6 mil. NM went from $663K to $12.9mil. Weird times and I don&#39;t think you&#39;re wrong. I don&#39;t know <em>what</em> happened at that church, but I know what they&#39;re saying does not hold water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She was in town the day before the shooting occurred and her speech was at Trident Tech College, which is in North Charleston about 40 minutes from where my dad spotted the SUV&#39;s. The shooting happened at 9:30 at night the following day and by that time, it&#39;s very doubtful that Hillary and her possee were still out driving around, especially in that area. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my dad, my brother, one best friend are the only ones who believe me. All three are logical thinkers, but I had to break it down completely for them before they started to even give what I was saying a chance. Other than those three, I&#39;ve only dared to bring it up to two people which both gave me this morbid look and I immediately shut up. Their reactions and responces were definitely not what you would expect out of someone who just lost a mother. I thought at the very least the girl would be emotional. To tell you the truth, I show more emotion when I&#39;m out of cigarettes than all three of them combined. I expect shock to a certain degree, but that wasn&#39;t shock. That was shitty acting.</p>

<p>none of this shit adds up. i just have page after page after page of information and articles that completely debunk this whole thing. I mean, the church opened up two days after the shooting. No bullet holes or blood, it&#39;s amazing how quickly they got the blood of 9 people cleaned up and the 9 bullets (assuming he didn&#39;t miss. cause he&#39;s a professional shooter, right? lol) out of the walls. They managed to get all of that done with crowds of people surrounding the church and the street it&#39;s on all without anybody seeing the clean up. Amazing</p>

<p>That just weirds me out because I&#39;ve never been pulled over by a cop in an SUV and if it wasn&#39;t cops, who was it and how did they get there so quickly?</p>

<p>This is 100% proof of conspiracy right here. Upvoted. It is ILLEGAL for police to drive SUVs.</p>

<p>Also there are reports that a yellow Volkswagen was parked illegally nearby the site of the shooting and may have had a flat tire. WHERE ARE THE MEDIA on this??? Paid propoganda BS</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had recent experience dealing with losses, more than one, unfortunately.  A lot about this is normal, wierdly enough.  The part about saying he wished he took more selfies with his mom?  Well, that is not as important a statement as it seems.  In my case, we all said a lot of things in person, but what we put on social media was disjointed and incomplete; mere snapshots in time that captured a particular emotion at a certain moment, not a carefully considered statement that was supposed to sum up the entirety of the situation.  If you took only what our family put online about our loss, you too may think that we didn&#39;t care all that much about it, but you would only be seeing part of the story, the part where we get a spare moment to ourselves, after grieving long hours with our family, and can finally slump, exhausted, behind a desk or in a corner and maybe type a half-assed sentence or two even though our minds are going a million miles an hour.</p>

<p>The christmas tree picture could be explained by him suddenly finding it, after going through an old box or something, and posting it for the family to see.  Maybe he makes his profile public, so everyone sees it.  It doesn&#39;t have to mean anything, and it is probably of no significance here.  The part about the increased attention and possible fame is also not necessarily evidence of a conspiracy, either, it is probably a direct result of the national coverage of the shooting, as well as the &#39;awwwww&#39; factor.  </p>

<p>The part about the viewing is strange, because we had the whole town here during my family members funeral.  I am not necessarily saying that this event is not a conspiracy, because it very well could be.  </p>
