    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Here is the faither MO. </p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When people question why WTC7 collapsed, pretend the reasoning should be obvious by stating that it was hit by debris. </p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> When those same people state that NIST admits that the debris did not initiate the collapse, pretend that you simply meant that debris caused damaged, which caused the fire.</p>

<p>This will happen every. single. time. </p>

<p>So keep in mind that NIST also admits that they have <strong>&quot;no evidence&quot;</strong> to confirm the possibility of the debris causing the fire. It is not a fact. It is yet another unproven theory. Literally supported by &quot;no evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>NIST also tries to get sneaky by stating that despite the 100%, complete lack of evidence....it is still &quot;highly likely.&quot; </p>

<p>Only in the NIST bible....</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>What caused the fires in WTC 7?<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Debris from the collapse of WTC 1, which was 370 feet to the south, ignited fires on at least 10 floors in the building at its south and west faces. However, only the fires on some of the lower floors—7 through 9 and 11 through 13—burned out of control. These lower-floor fires—which spread and grew because the water supply to the automatic sprinkler system for these floors had failed—were similar to building fires experienced in other tall buildings. The primary and backup water supply to the sprinkler systems for the lower floors relied on the city&#39;s water supply, whose lines were damaged by the collapse of WTC 1 and WTC 2. These uncontrolled lower-floor fires eventually spread to the northeast part of WTC 7, where the building&#39;s collapse began. <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/faqs_wtc7.cfm">Source</a></p>

<p>Does that surprise you?</p>

<p>Just like the FAQ give an &quot;explanation&quot; for the collapse of WTC 1&amp;2, but the report says (twice) they did not treat the collapse at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The focus of the investigation was on the sequence of events from the instant of aircraft impact to the initiation of collapse for each tower. For brevity in this report, this sequence is referred to as the ‘probable collapse sequence,’ although it includes little analysis of the structural behaviour of the tower after the conditions for collapse initiation were reached and collapse became inevitable.</p>

<p>the momentum (which equals mass times velocity) of the 12 to 28 stories (WTC 1 and WTC 2, respectively) falling on the supporting structure below (which was designed to support only the static weight of the floors above and not any dynamic effects due to the downward momentum) so greatly exceeded the strength capacity of the structure below that it (the structure below) was unable to stop or even to slow the falling mass. The downward momentum felt by each successive lower floor was even larger due to the increasing mass.</p>
