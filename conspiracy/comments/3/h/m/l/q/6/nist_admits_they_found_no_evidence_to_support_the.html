        Since fires were observed on the ground surrounding WTC 7, it is possible that potential ignition sources might have entered WTC 7 through openings created in the south and west face of the building during the collapses of the towers.
        <strong>
         NIST found no evidence to confirm this possibility,

       Indeed. Here is the faither MO.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Step 1:
       </strong>
       When people question why WTC7 collapsed, pretend the reasoning should be obvious by stating that it was hit by debris.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Step 2:
       </strong>
       When those same people state that NIST admits that the debris did not initiate the collapse, pretend that you simply meant that debris caused damaged, which caused the fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       This will happen every. single. time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So keep in mind that NIST also admits that they have
       <strong>
        "no evidence"
       </strong>
       to confirm the possibility of the debris causing the fire. It is not a fact. It is yet another unproven theory. Literally supported by "no evidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST also tries to get sneaky by stating that despite the 100%, complete lack of evidence....it is still "highly likely."
      </p>
      <p>
       Only in the NIST bible....

       So now the NIST FAQ isn't backed up by the report? wtf?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         What caused the fires in WTC 7?
         <br/>
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
        Debris from the collapse of WTC 1, which was 370 feet to the south, ignited fires on at least 10 floors in the building at its south and west faces. However, only the fires on some of the lower floors‚Äî7 through 9 and 11 through 13‚Äîburned out of control. These lower-floor fires‚Äîwhich spread and grew because the water supply to the automatic sprinkler system for these floors had failed‚Äîwere similar to building fires experienced in other tall buildings. The primary and backup water supply to the sprinkler systems for the lower floors relied on the city's water supply, whose lines were damaged by the collapse of WTC 1 and WTC 2. These uncontrolled lower-floor fires eventually spread to the northeast part of WTC 7, where the building's collapse began.
