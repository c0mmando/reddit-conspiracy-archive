Here&#39;s normal for you - finding a person you love and being in a relationship with that person.  &lt;-- See nothing about race(or gender for that matter).  The only thing that should be considered &quot;outside the norm&quot; is hating someone because of the color of their skin.  People should only be judged by the content of their character. Not their race, gender, orientation, or any other superficial factors. Get over the inter-racial relationships you see on TV or stop watching it. </p>

<p>There isn&#39;t &quot;propaganda&quot;. Television is beginning to reflect mainstream reality, and like the old white woman who told John McCain she wanted &quot;her&quot; country back, you&#39;re freaking out at the idea of white males losing their dominance as <a href="https://youtu.be/ysoOB9w0tF4">Bill O&#39;Reilly admitted to fearing</a>. </p>

<p>No, you&#39;re only against seeing it - ever. It&#39;s not &quot;normal&quot; to you and is shown on purpose for some sort of sinister purpose. Meanwhile, when only same-race relationships are shown on tv, despite not reflecting reality, that&#39;s not promoting anything and is completely normal.</p>

<p>We went through this same #@*#&amp; when the first gay characters who weren&#39;t being portrayed as villains or buffoons appeared on tv. Save it; no one&#39;s buying it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bahahaha!  Thanks for the lesson in reproduction, but I am well aware that babies of inter-racial couples come out mixed.  But now I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ve just tipped your racist hand my friend.  So your whole concern about this is &quot;keeping the white race pure&quot;.  Know who else was into eugenics like that?... Hitler.  But hey if it&#39;s all about breeding away the different races into one mixed race, I&#39;m all for it!  Maybe that will finally solve all the hatred and resentment. Maybe then we can stop all the infighting, and have a civilized society that focuses on the important things. Also did you know that more mixed people become the better evolution is able improve us. Inbreeding only leads to defects, variety is the name of the game when it comes to improving genes. If it is all about that I&#39;ll tell you one thing I&#39;m glad for, and that&#39;s that your bloodline will cease to be.  Unless of course you have a daughter who is into black guys, which I can only pray for that much poetic justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my God the retardation of people these days. inbreeding has to do with one&#39;s own direct family, not race. And I&#39;m not for racial purity as much as I am for racial communities. People of the same race usually get along better. That&#39;s why in multi-cultural countries races tend to keep together, ie chinatown, latino communities, blacks communities etc... people of the same race usually have similar cultural upbringing and interests so they get along better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re the racist, yet I&#39;m the one with retardation <em>yeah ok</em></p>

<p>I was not referring to incestual inbreeding, I&#39;m talking about racial inbreeding.  It&#39;s the same reason purebred dogs oftentimes develop health problems, even if the parents are in no way related but are still the same subset of their species. In mutts where you see mixes of two or more different breeds lifespan and general health are usually improved. But I don&#39;t want to get into an evolutionary genetics debate with you, because that would be getting off the main topic of your racism. </p>

<p>Now I understand what you&#39;re saying about the natural segregation of races. You&#39;re right that does happen, but it&#39;s not solely because individual races prefer to be grouped. There are several other factors at play.  Namely racially-based socioeconomic factors. You don&#39;t think people who live in Compton would rather live in Beverly Hills, of course they would but they can&#39;t afford it.  What if everyone had a level playing field though, what if race was not an issue?  </p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m not really for one <em>gray colored people of earth</em>, even though that&#39;s how it may sound in the last few paragraphs. That would be boring, and we&#39;re really just getting away from the main topic. All I&#39;m trying to convey to you is why is it a bad thing that they show some interracial couples on TV.  Not everything has a hidden agenda or an ulterior motive. Sometimes shit just is as shown. I watch TV, I don&#39;t see more interracial couples than same race couples. But if I did I wouldn&#39;t give a shit. Race is only a problem because we&#39;re not all colorblind.</p>

<p>Anyway been fun chatting with you dude. And for the record I don&#39;t think you&#39;re truly a racist, but you&#39;re kinda skirtin&#39; that line. Be careful not to fall over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>run out of arguments? No one dares discuss the issue and only think of attacking the messenger.</p>

<p>America was founded by white people and it&#39;s been predominantly white for most of its history. Yes yes I know about the native genocide and all but that&#39;s prior to the foundation of the US and that&#39;s another issue. </p>

<p>Now if lots of immigrants come in every year and white people are encouraged to breed with them, what do you think will happen to the white demographic in the long run? Whites will become a minority in their own country. This is not racist it&#39;s fucking fact and logical. So race mixing can lead to pretty negative consequences down the road for white people in America which is why it is being promoted I suspect.</p>

<p>I mean, goddamn.  Look at this puke: &quot;there won&#39;t be any white people left in <strong>their own country</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>But everyone here is giving you every last benefit of the doubt, trying to understand what sort of turd you have clogging up your brain.  An &quot;intellectual&quot; would already know that A) race is merely a social construct B) the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; is contrived bullshit.</p>

<p>You can go google those terms if you don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>In truth, we already know what it is we&#39;re trying to goad out of you; that you hold views rooted in racially prejudiced dumbfuckery.  But obviously that strategy is failing, because here you sit, still thinking you&#39;ve got some sort of fucking jump on the rest of us.  That you&#39;ve figured out the great secret the rest of us are blind to.  Well WAKE THE FUCK UP and realize that you. are. wrong.</p>

<p>As much as you&#39;d like to mitigate the damage by laying out platitudes like &quot;My views aren&#39;t racist; they would be if I was denigrating other races or attacking them which I am not&quot; the fact of the matter is that this: &quot;I&#39;m not for racial purity as much as I am for racial communities&quot; is pure, unadulterated, mainlined racism.</p>

<p>Since actively acquiring knowledge doesn&#39;t seem to be your thing, I&#39;ll just go ahead and copy-and-paste the very first definition that pops up when you google &quot;racism&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Golly fuckin gee.</p>

<p>Oh and nice touch that your initial &quot;Race-mixing will end white people in their own country&quot; sentiment is now tenderly reiterated as &quot;questioning whether multi-culturalism is good or bad.&quot;  You are advocating not only that inter-racial couples spell doom for the purity of the white race (which is the real fuckin problem here, by the way), you are questioning whether a media that is reflecting its demographically changing audience is part of some sort of nefarious plot.</p>

<p>The issue you are intellectually focusing on is a manifestation of your perception that race determines who a person is.  There&#39;s nothing &quot;politically correct&quot; about letting you know that that idea is a load of shit.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m mistaken and America wasn&#39;t a white country, however the point of my post here is that race mixing is being promoted on TV like never before and there has to be an agenda behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THERE WE FUCKING GO.</p>

<p>I was spot on when I rephrased your position as &quot;America is for whites and Africa is for blacks&quot; wasn&#39;t I?  But you didn&#39;t like it so you called it bullshit.</p>

<p>America isn&#39;t exclusively the white people&#39;s country.  Black Americans, Asian Americans, shit, even Native Americans are <em>minorities in their own country.</em>  As are homosexuals, trans people, disabled people, atheists, combat veterans, and more.  What the fuck would it even matter that white people stop being the majority?</p>

<p>Answer that.  Please.</p>

<p>Beyond that, imagine that dozens of generations from now, no human being left on the planet has 100% European DNA.  So what?  Tell me that too.  And be honest with me and with yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if they only show same-race couples, which doesn&#39;t reflect reality, that&#39;s not promoting an agenda... that&#39;s just &quot;normal&quot;, the &quot;default&quot;. But if 1% of TV shows have a mixed-race couple, that&#39;s intentionally done to &quot;promote&quot; something.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s &quot;fishy&quot;. &quot;Conspiracy&quot; involves collusion. Are you suggesting a group of producers across rival networks met in some secret enclave to portray mixed-race couples because... why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last few years it was about vaccine promotion now it appears to have shifted 
to inter racial couples</p>

<p>Maybe the intelligent, decent people who write television programs don&#39;t want your kids to die of whooping cough or to grow up racist?</p>

<p>As far as I know they are not white supremacist websites, they are sites against white genocide. They aren&#39;t advocating white supremacy at all, they document and expose what anti-white people are doing/saying which makes them decent resources and are on topic and they list their sources!</p>

<p>So in the context of the show, he should be with the white girl. Soooooo it&#39;s not promoting interracial relationships given the black girl is bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The show has a pretty interesting premise, some of Stephen Kings work has been brilliantly ported over to the screen. </p>

<p>First season was neat, second and third seasons are.... not, at this point i&#39;m watching it &#39;<em>just in case&#39;</em> something good happens. </p>

<p>The joys of two monitors, watching a show whilst doing everything else :D</p>

<p>Some would say it&#39;s a matter of flattening out the human race, making us all the same. Not sure if this is for better or for worse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Motherfucking bull<em>shit</em> you&#39;re an intellectual.  You wanna know why everyone is asking you simple questions itt?  Because you&#39;re a fucking piece of shit backwards-ass racist, and you&#39;re too fucking stupid to even realize it.</p>

<p>I mean, goddamn.  Look at this puke: &quot;there won&#39;t be any white people left in <strong>their own country</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>But everyone here is giving you every last benefit of the doubt, trying to understand what sort of turd you have clogging up your brain.  An &quot;intellectual&quot; would already know that A) race is merely a social construct B) the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; is contrived bullshit.</p>

<p>You can go google those terms if you don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>In truth, we already know what it is we&#39;re trying to goad out of you; that you hold views rooted in racially prejudiced dumbfuckery.  But obviously that strategy is failing, because here you sit, still thinking you&#39;ve got some sort of fucking jump on the rest of us.  That you&#39;ve figured out the great secret the rest of us are blind to.  Well WAKE THE FUCK UP and realize that you. are. wrong.</p>

<p>As much as you&#39;d like to mitigate the damage by laying out platitudes like &quot;My views aren&#39;t racist; they would be if I was denigrating other races or attacking them which I am not&quot; the fact of the matter is that this: &quot;I&#39;m not for racial purity as much as I am for racial communities&quot; is pure, unadulterated, mainlined racism.</p>

<p>Jesus fuck dude.  Open your goddamn eyes.</p>
