       What's with all the black/white couples in tv shows these days? I don't mind inter-racial couples but it's getting ridiculous when in every new tv show the main character has the hots for a black girl/boy and vice versa. It feels like there's an agenda and they are promoting it to younger folks. subliminal programming?

       Why does this matter?  Maybe they are trying to show people that being a racist is not the way to go.  Maybe they are trying to promote loving fellow humans, and not letting race or anything else divide us anymore.

       it's not being racist to date your own race, it's considered normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It matters because there's a reason behind it and they are promoting it subliminally.

       So are you implying it is not normal to date someone of another race?

      <p>
       Edit: Also the very fact that you notice it means it is not subliminal. Here is the definition for you.
       <em>
        Subliminal - below the threshold of sensation or consciousness; perceived by or affecting someone's mind without their being aware of it.

       Ha "outside the norm".  You are the problem with this country.  Here's normal for you - finding a person you love and being in a relationship with that person.  &lt;-- See nothing about race(or gender for that matter).  The only thing that should be considered "outside the norm" is hating someone because of the color of their skin.  People should only be judged by the content of their character. Not their race, gender, orientation, or any other superficial factors. Get over the inter-racial relationships you see on TV or stop watching it.

       The mere fact that use the term "promoting it" tells me everything I need to know about your stance on inter-racial relations. What could possibly be "fishy" about showing two
       <strong>
        human beings

       In 1968 the first inter-racial kiss was aired on TV between Captain Kirk &amp; Lt. Uhura on Star Trek.  47 years ago doesn't sound too "all of the sudden" to me.  Maybe you're right, and maybe there is a coordinated effort to have more inter-racial relationships on TV. But if that is case(which I highly doubt) it could only be an attempt to end or lessen the huge racial divide in the country, which I can only see as a positive thing.

       Ur the one that's being bigoted, I'm talking about a political issue and all you think about is playing the racism card. I added a few videos relevant to the issue. At least watch the first one.

       The "racism card" is all you are letting anyone use, because your view is racist. Political issue? Two consenting adults being in a relationship is none of your business let alone a governments or remotely a political issue. Ignorance and bigotry isn't a way to live your life, get over it.

       My views aren't racist; they would be if I was denigrating other races or attacking them which I am not. I am talking about the propaganda promoting inter-racial relationships this year in movies and tv shows. Stop trying to twist my argument to make it sound like I'm against consensual inter-racial relationships. I AM TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS BEING PROMOTED ON TV! They are actors! They are not in a real relationship.

       There isn't "propaganda". Television is beginning to reflect mainstream reality, and like the old white woman who told John McCain she wanted "her" country back, you're freaking out at the idea of white males losing their dominance as

       No, you're only against seeing it - ever. It's not "normal" to you and is shown on purpose for some sort of sinister purpose. Meanwhile, when only same-race relationships are shown on tv, despite not reflecting reality, that's not promoting anything and is completely normal.

       you honestly don't believe that there isn't an increase in interracial relationships because the younger generation doesn't give a fuck about the old rules about race and having to worry if marrying somebody from a different race will be too difficult?

       Not very smart are you. A white and black couple do not produce a white offspring and if more and more people do it and this goes on for several generations then there won't be any white people left in their own country.

       "In their own country"? Are you implying that the US is the white race's very own country? You claim to see interracial relationships being "promoted" as an agenda, but fail to see that using race as a means of classification is inherently more damaging and divisive to society than what you are proposing.

       Bahahaha!  Thanks for the lesson in reproduction, but I am well aware that babies of inter-racial couples come out mixed.  But now I'm afraid you've just tipped your racist hand my friend.  So your whole concern about this is "keeping the white race pure".  Know who else was into eugenics like that?... Hitler.  But hey if it's all about breeding away the different races into one mixed race, I'm all for it!  Maybe that will finally solve all the hatred and resentment. Maybe then we can stop all the infighting, and have a civilized society that focuses on the important things. Also did you know that more mixed people become the better evolution is able improve us. Inbreeding only leads to defects, variety is the name of the game when it comes to improving genes. If it is all about that I'll tell you one thing I'm glad for, and that's that your bloodline will cease to be.  Unless of course you have a daughter who is into black guys, which I can only pray for that much poetic justice.

       Oh my God the retardation of people these days. inbreeding has to do with one's own direct family, not race. And I'm not for racial purity as much as I am for racial communities. People of the same race usually get along better. That's why in multi-cultural countries races tend to keep together, ie chinatown, latino communities, blacks communities etc... people of the same race usually have similar cultural upbringing and interests so they get along better.

       I was not referring to incestual inbreeding, I'm talking about racial inbreeding.  It's the same reason purebred dogs oftentimes develop health problems, even if the parents are in no way related but are still the same subset of their species. In mutts where you see mixes of two or more different breeds lifespan and general health are usually improved. But I don't want to get into an evolutionary genetics debate with you, because that would be getting off the main topic of your racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I understand what you're saying about the natural segregation of races. You're right that does happen, but it's not solely because individual races prefer to be grouped. There are several other factors at play.  Namely racially-based socioeconomic factors. You don't think people who live in Compton would rather live in Beverly Hills, of course they would but they can't afford it.  What if everyone had a level playing field though, what if race was not an issue?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I'm not really for one
       <em>
        gray colored people of earth
       </em>
       , even though that's how it may sound in the last few paragraphs. That would be boring, and we're really just getting away from the main topic. All I'm trying to convey to you is why is it a bad thing that they show some interracial couples on TV.  Not everything has a hidden agenda or an ulterior motive. Sometimes shit just is as shown. I watch TV, I don't see more interracial couples than same race couples. But if I did I wouldn't give a shit. Race is only a problem because we're not all colorblind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway been fun chatting with you dude. And for the record I don't think you're truly a racist, but you're kinda skirtin' that line. Be careful not to fall over it.

       Hold up - if the child of one white parent and one black parent isn't white, then it isn't black either, right?  And white people outnumber black people in America, so... you should be more concerned over the elimination of the black race, shouldn't you?

       run out of arguments? No one dares discuss the issue and only think of attacking the messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       America was founded by white people and it's been predominantly white for most of its history. Yes yes I know about the native genocide and all but that's prior to the foundation of the US and that's another issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if lots of immigrants come in every year and white people are encouraged to breed with them, what do you think will happen to the white demographic in the long run? Whites will become a minority in their own country. This is not racist it's fucking fact and logical. So race mixing can lead to pretty negative consequences down the road for white people in America which is why it is being promoted I suspect.

      <p>
       Uhh, nothing will happen to white people, unless white people stop marrying other white people. There's nothing bad about race mixing anyway. Being white isn't some kind of thing you base your personality around, why do you feel that it's bad that white people apparently are going to die out? That's why I and others  suspect you're a white supremacist. If all people were one race, racism would be pretty much impossible, you mad about that? :^)

       I don't see a problem with it either, people do as they want, it's none of my business. My issue and it's been the only fucking thing I've been trying to say in this entire thread that you kept trying to derail towards racist bullshit is that race mixing is being PROMOTED ON TV. Now why is it PROMOTED and what are the likely consequences of that? Is multi-culturalism really good for the future of the country? I'm willing to debate this. Saying that anyone who dares question the merit of multi-culturalism is racist reminds me of the tactics used by jews with their antisemitic bullcrap.

       you're an intellectual.  You wanna know why everyone is asking you simple questions itt?  Because you're a fucking piece of shit backwards-ass racist, and you're too fucking stupid to even realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, goddamn.  Look at this puke: "there won't be any white people left in
       <strong>
        their own country
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       But everyone here is giving you every last benefit of the doubt, trying to understand what sort of turd you have clogging up your brain.  An "intellectual" would already know that A) race is merely a social construct B) the "one-drop rule" is contrived bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go google those terms if you don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, we already know what it is we're trying to goad out of you; that you hold views rooted in racially prejudiced dumbfuckery.  But obviously that strategy is failing, because here you sit, still thinking you've got some sort of fucking jump on the rest of us.  That you've figured out the great secret the rest of us are blind to.  Well WAKE THE FUCK UP and realize that you. are. wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as you'd like to mitigate the damage by laying out platitudes like "My views aren't racist; they would be if I was denigrating other races or attacking them which I am not" the fact of the matter is that this: "I'm not for racial purity as much as I am for racial communities" is pure, unadulterated, mainlined racism.

       A racist is someone who goes out of his way to attack people of other races and spew hatred towards them. I am talking about the effects and consequences of multi-culturalism. Questioning if it is good or bad is automatically racist now? There's always two sides to every coin dumbass. There is an agenda PROMOTING race mixing and I am questioning it's merit. When I say I am an intellectual I mean I focus on the issue and all this reactionary racist bullshit is nothing but knee jerk emotional politically correct garbage polluting intellectual discourse.

       Oh, you're not a racist because you don't go out of your way to attack people?  Fascinating, Dr. Sociology.  Next thing you're going to try to narrowly redefine the word "dumbass" so that you don't feel it applies to you either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since actively acquiring knowledge doesn't seem to be your thing, I'll just go ahead and copy-and-paste the very first definition that pops up when you google "racism":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Golly fuckin gee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and nice touch that your initial "Race-mixing will end white people in their own country" sentiment is now tenderly reiterated as "questioning whether multi-culturalism is good or bad."  You are advocating not only that inter-racial couples spell doom for the purity of the white race (which is the real fuckin problem here, by the way), you are questioning whether a media that is reflecting its demographically changing audience is part of some sort of nefarious plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue you are intellectually focusing on is a manifestation of your perception that race determines who a person is.  There's nothing "politically correct" about letting you know that that idea is a load of shit.

       Maybe I'm mistaken and America wasn't a white country, however the point of my post here is that race mixing is being promoted on TV like never before and there has to be an agenda behind it.

       I was spot on when I rephrased your position as "America is for whites and Africa is for blacks" wasn't I?  But you didn't like it so you called it bullshit.

       America isn't exclusively the white people's country.  Black Americans, Asian Americans, shit, even Native Americans are
       <em>
        minorities in their own country.
       </em>
       As are homosexuals, trans people, disabled people, atheists, combat veterans, and more.  What the fuck would it even matter that white people stop being the majority?
      </p>
      <p>
       Answer that.  Please.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, imagine that dozens of generations from now, no human being left on the planet has 100% European DNA.  So what?  Tell me that too.  And be honest with me and with yourself.

       The USA is a melting pot of cultures, not some white paradise. It's good for people to not stay within their own races, when people segregate themselves like that it causes racial tensions, regardless of the intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not like literally every single white person in the entire country will have kids with a  non-white person. That's not even possible, something like 70% of Americans are white

       So if they only show same-race couples, which doesn't reflect reality, that's not promoting an agenda... that's just "normal", the "default". But if 1% of TV shows have a mixed-race couple, that's intentionally done to "promote" something.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's "fishy". "Conspiracy" involves collusion. Are you suggesting a group of producers across rival networks met in some secret enclave to portray mixed-race couples because... why?

       I'm talking about movies and tv shows PROMOTING IT not about people actually doing it. Yes there are inter-racial couples and it's their choice and none of my business, I get that... I'm all about freedom and I see people as individuals, I'm not racist at all but my conspiracy theory is that tv shows are actively and subtly PROMOTING IT right now.

       Well all the new shows I've been seeing this year had this phenomenon in them which didn't use to be as present in previous years. A LOT of it is coming from Disney too I noticed.

       As far as I know they are not white supremacist websites, they are sites against white genocide. They aren't advocating white supremacy at all, they document and expose what anti-white people are doing/saying which makes them decent resources and are on topic and they list their sources!

       Of course it has an agenda, it exposes anti-white crap and that's why I linked to it cause it has a lot of links official source of all those statements which aren't on such sites. Forget the site's name, look at the info and the sources of that info.

       In under the dome, the white guy goes for the black girl after being brainwashed.

       So in the context of the show, he should be with the white girl. Soooooo it's not promoting interracial relationships given the black girl is bad.

       Yeah I know, I think it's probably a creative use of the directive which was passed down to them by the powers that be. Turns out the black chick was a deception leading to their destruction lol.

       Agreed. I don't care, but it's definitely more than coincidence.

       Some would say it's a matter of flattening out the human race, making us all the same. Not sure if this is for better or for worse.

       Motherfucking bull
       <em>
        shit
       </em>
       you're an intellectual.  You wanna know why everyone is asking you simple questions itt?  Because you're a fucking piece of shit backwards-ass racist, and you're too fucking stupid to even realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, goddamn.  Look at this puke: "there won't be any white people left in
       <strong>
        their own country
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       But everyone here is giving you every last benefit of the doubt, trying to understand what sort of turd you have clogging up your brain.  An "intellectual" would already know that A) race is merely a social construct B) the "one-drop rule" is contrived bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go google those terms if you don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       In truth, we already know what it is we're trying to goad out of you; that you hold views rooted in racially prejudiced dumbfuckery.  But obviously that strategy is failing, because here you sit, still thinking you've got some sort of fucking jump on the rest of us.  That you've figured out the great secret the rest of us are blind to.  Well WAKE THE FUCK UP and realize that you. are. wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as you'd like to mitigate the damage by laying out platitudes like "My views aren't racist; they would be if I was denigrating other races or attacking them which I am not" the fact of the matter is that this: "I'm not for racial purity as much as I am for racial communities" is pure, unadulterated, mainlined racism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus fuck dude.  Open your goddamn eyes.
