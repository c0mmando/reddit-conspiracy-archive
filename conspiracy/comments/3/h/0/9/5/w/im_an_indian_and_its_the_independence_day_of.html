    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say if Gandhi was British agent or a useful idiot.</p>

<p>But here are some interesting facts.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Young Gandhi served in British Army when he lived in SAfrica. And I guess his racism against the blacks could have been during this time of his life.</p></li>
<li><p>Gandhi&#39;s murderer was Jewish Indian. His organization never supported anti British movements. And they were all Zionists. </p></li>
<li><p>Gandhi was against the creation of Jewish  state of Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>Gandhi was against the opium trade.</p></li>
<li><p>Gandhi was against the British tax system. Britishers imposed tax on items made in India while they removed taxes imported from Britain. This led massive boycott British goods.</p></li>
<li><p>Wife of Viceroy Mountbatten, Edwina, was grand daughter of Jewish banker Joe Cassel. She most likely had affairs with Nehru, India&#39;s first Prime Minister.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Dumb question as I&#39;m not that familiar with regional relations. </p>

<p>Aside from the land dispute over Kashmir, is what this man says in his letter why Hindus and Muslims are enemies of one another? Because of Gandhi?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not exclusively, but he did agree to partition. Allowing the British to put the divide and conquer strategy to use yet again. Running up to the independence day, the british has always pitted Muslims against Hindus in the electorate (this is accepted knowledge). But more than that he holds that Gandi was merely a puppet. His ego was stoked by the British and he helped them push their agenda. Just everyday politics. Nothing new.</p>

<p>Also this enemnity between India and pakistan is kept alive purely by the media (and systemic brainwashing). None of us really otherwise would care. We all want peace. sigh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gandhi was a theosophist and an MI6 agent. 
He met Blavatsky and was his follower since then. He acknowlegded her in his autobiography in part my acquaintance with religion. Blavatsky worked for the Illuminati and was the founder of the new age movement. Gandhi also worked with theosophist Annie Besant.
Besant was one of the founder of the elite Fabian Society and she later became the head of theosophical society after the death of HP  Blavatsky.  Besant also served as the President of the Indian National Congress. She was one of the leading figures in the coming era of the New Age Movement. She recruited the new age messiah Jiddu Krishnamurti. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TIme nahi mila bhai. Aur kuch din lagega :P</p>

<p>I have a fleeting suspicion that Gandhi was either a useful idiot or a british agent, or has agendas of their own (nehru/gandi/powerful political families). Media is a weapon in the hands of the rulers. Anyone they tout as Gods require extra scrutiny. Look for leads in Arundati Roy&#39;s speeches on youtube. I haven&#39;t found many other people who speak on such topics.</p>

<p>I really want to connect with people who investigate ISRO. I really have yet to meet an ISRO employee in real life. I am myself an aerospace engineer by education. Where are all the space scientists! Or are they just a figment of our collective imagination?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Substance hai, cold war ke substance.</p>

<p>Space race is an extension of the cold war propaganda. America and Russia need to keep it alive. China and India just joined in. You have to partner up to stay in the game. The rich help the rich stay rich. Same thing with power. Without our approval their dollars are worthless. If the economic system fails, they lose the most!</p>
