       This factoid comes from a 2008 DOJ report (the link I have given) and the report has been referenced in many articles online.

       I couldn't agree with you more. I think it's ok to joke about ANYTHING, but many people who say that are dead serious and it's disgusting. sentencing any man to the current system is growing close to cruel and unusual punishment. And there's really no public support for the victims. I find myself to be on the moderate to progressive side of gender issues for men and women, and this is the one that bothers me the most

       100% agree.  You see people say things like 'Good.  They deserve nothing less.' and it makes me think, 'What the fuck?' then to see other people actually

       It's perfectly imaginable what type of inmates get raped too: the ones unable to defend themselves properly, the ones who ended up in there because of totally minor fuck-ups or victimless crimes that weren't even properly traceable or prosecuteable just 2 decades ago.

       When people joke about it I wonder how these prison rapists will fit back into society when they are released. You would think of all places crime would be nonexistent in prison, it's 2015 there should be cameras everywhere in prison.

       Odds are he will be the sex offender in prison as well. More innocent people, in there for crimes that are not violent, are the ones who suffer because they are the weaker ones in the hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your righteous rage, I really do. Very few prisoners are in there for life. Most get back out on the streets eventually. They will come back out more vicious and cold hearted then when they went in.

       Of course more rapes occur in mens prisons.  However, it doesn't fit with the media's narrative that the rape epidemic is on your every town college campus, and that regretting who you had sex with last night is now equivalent to rape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual rape is trivialized and often ignored at the expense of third wave feminism.

       Interestingly, given the underrepresentation of white people in prisons, this could be considered an act of genocide, this passive acceptance of mass prison rape.

       I don't mean to belittle sexual assault in the military, but this isn't that surprising. Their are relatively few women in combat zones, and there's not a huge number of US troops dying in them.

       Most don't report at all. That's sadly true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another place this happens is collage level and higher sports. Also the Greek Fraternity system is known to support environments that lead to rape. The sports and fraternities go together.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is nauseatingly sad how much this happens and goes on unseen and unavenged. It's heart breaking that so many men and boys have been brutalized in the most humiliating way and it's a nonissue in our culture.

       I am fairly sure one of the top posts on
       <a href="/r/Sex">
        /r/Sex
       </a>
       is about a man who was raped by a female superior in the military over and over for years. She was very clever about it as well, she gathered false evidence to make it look as if
       <em>
        she
       </em>
       was the victim of the rape, and then blackmailed him for ages into having sex with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course people said he was lying, or that he probably enjoyed it, because nobody cares if it happens to a man.

       Had this discussion. Lost friends. I argued that rape was just another form of physical and psychological torture, that death or maiming and dismemberment were as bad or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my female friends posted on my Facebook page that I had said "raped women shouldn't complain"
      </p>
      <p>
       Never said anything like that. I did say "given the choice between a dick up my ass or removal of limbs / death, I'd take the dick."

       In that year, there was one time where I could audibly hear someone being raped, and both my cell mate and I were not surprised. Being the scumbags we were we even joked about it while we could hear it going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may sound cold and harsh, but inside the system, the ones who get raped set themselves up. You can usually see it coming a month or two away. How they act daily. How they are socially with different cliques within the prison. There is often a very large grace period given to newbies to adjust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not justifying prison rape, but what I am saying is that the system is very darwinian, and I'm not entirely against systems that destroy the weak.

       Rapists are not exactly the most popular people in prison. You're better off killing yourself if you're going to prison over a sex crime than taking the beating they're going to give you. Most prison rape comes from inmates who are in there for unrelated crimes and want a sexual release while also establishing dominance and control over other inmates.
