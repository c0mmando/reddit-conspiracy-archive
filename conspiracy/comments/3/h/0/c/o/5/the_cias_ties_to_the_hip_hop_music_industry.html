        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My theory is that the CIA controls the international drug trade. They do this to mainly fund their black ops operations(ex. government overthrows, etc.). </p>

<p>The part where hip hop comes in started back in the 80s when they had to create a demand for drugs. They used various intermediaries (music executives) to push hip hop to be the fore front above rock and roll in order to glamorize the drug trade and drugs to insure the demand for drugs from the American inner youth. It was back in 1996 when journalist Gary Webb was writing for the San Jose Mercury News revealed that a former drug kingpin in the 80s &#39;Freeway Rick Ross&#39; had a cocaine connection that was tied to the CIA which created a huge scandal.</p>

<p>The following quote is from Rick Ross when he was featured on the Alex Jones show back in November:</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m letting you know right now, that the establishment, is using hip hop to prime these kids for a life that&#39;s going to send them to prison, just like they did with me! See when I was comin up there was Super Fly, Tequila Sunrise, Scarface; all these movies, to make you think that you could start with nothing, and then you could have the whole world in the palm of your hand. Only, there was no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, there was a set of handcuffs and shackles. And you wanna know why the CIA symbol is behind me? Because there was guys behind me when I was selling drugs. And now, they&#39;re behind hip hop and rock n roll. This prison/hip hop connection, they&#39;re behind that too.&quot;</p>

<p>Another quote from Rick Ross on an episode of Montel Williams:</p>

<p>&quot;If it was good for them to sell drugs then it should&#39;ve been good for me to sell drugs. The money from the drugs went to buy guns, for the contra.&quot;</p>

<p>Back to his interview on the Alex Jones show:</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you don&#39;t read my book, warn your kids, let them know. But I advise you that this book is worth reading... Know what the drug culture is all about&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>they definitely are tied in with it, Rick Ross is proof, along with Gary Webb. who committed suicide by shooting himself TWICE in the head, SMH. this is how dumbed down society is, to believe that a guy who was exposing widespread corruption would commit suicide and shoot himself TWICE in the head. i believe the government had Tupac Shakur killed. when he was playing ball with them, and promoting a gangster lifestyle, they were pleased with him. as soon as he had a change of heart and seen the government for what it is, they had him killed. Tupac figured out the same shit we have all found out, once he changed his tune from promoting violence and drug dealing to more positive messages, BOOM he gets killed. 2pac wanted to get involved in politics and try to make a real change in this country. not too long after that he ends up dead. then they used the media to promote the whole east coast west coast &quot;beef&quot; as a way to deflect blame off themselves, and killed notorious BIG to further the propaganda. Pac had a large following and really could have sparked change in this country as he had millions of loyal followers that would have risen up against this tyranny establishment called the US government.</p>

<p>a wise man once told me &quot;dont sell drugs, the government hates competition.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This an old &quot;conspiracy&quot; letter from a while back</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>After more than 20 years, I&#39;ve finally decided to tell the world what I witnessed in 1991, which I believe was one of the biggest turning point in popular music, and ultimately American society. I have struggled for a long time weighing the pros and cons of making this story public as I was reluctant to implicate the individuals who were present that day. So I&#39;ve simply decided to leave out names and all the details that may risk my personal well being and that of those who were, like me, dragged into something they weren&#39;t ready for.</p>

<p>Between the late 80&#39;s and early 90’s, I was what you may call a “decision maker” with one of the more established company in the music industry. I came from Europe in the early 80’s and quickly established myself in the business. The industry was different back then. Since technology and media weren’t accessible to people like they are today, the industry had more control over the public and had the means to influence them anyway it wanted. This may explain why in early 1991, I was invited to attend a closed door meeting with a small group of music business insiders to discuss rap music’s new direction. Little did I know that we would be asked to participate in one of the most unethical and destructive business practice I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>The meeting was held at a private residence on the outskirts of Los Angeles. I remember about 25 to 30 people being there, most of them familiar faces. Speaking to those I knew, we joked about the theme of the meeting as many of us did not care for rap music and failed to see the purpose of being invited to a private gathering to discuss its future. Among the attendees was a small group of unfamiliar faces who stayed to themselves and made no attempt to socialize beyond their circle. Based on their behavior and formal appearances, they didn&#39;t seem to be in our industry. Our casual chatter was interrupted when we were asked to sign a confidentiality agreement preventing us from publicly discussing the information presented during the meeting. Needless to say, this intrigued and in some cases disturbed many of us. The agreement was only a page long but very clear on the matter and consequences which stated that violating the terms would result in job termination. We asked several people what this meeting was about and the reason for such secrecy but couldn&#39;t find anyone who had answers for us. A few people refused to sign and walked out. No one stopped them. I was tempted to follow but curiosity got the best of me. A man who was part of the “unfamiliar” group collected the agreements from us.</p>

<p>Quickly after the meeting began, one of my industry colleagues (who shall remain nameless like everyone else) thanked us for attending. He then gave the floor to a man who only introduced himself by first name and gave no further details about his personal background. I think he was the owner of the residence but it was never confirmed. He briefly praised all of us for the success we had achieved in our industry and congratulated us for being selected as part of this small group of “decision makers”. At this point I begin to feel slightly uncomfortable at the strangeness of this gathering. The subject quickly changed as the speaker went on to tell us that the respective companies we represented had invested in a very profitable industry which could become even more rewarding with our active involvement. He explained that the companies we work for had invested millions into the building of privately owned prisons and that our positions of influence in the music industry would actually impact the profitability of these investments. I remember many of us in the group immediately looking at each other in confusion. At the time, I didn’t know what a private prison was but I wasn&#39;t the only one. Sure enough, someone asked what these prisons were and what any of this had to do with us. We were told that these prisons were built by privately owned companies who received funding from the government based on the number of inmates. The more inmates, the more money the government would pay these prisons. It was also made clear to us that since these prisons are privately owned, as they become publicly traded, we’d be able to buy shares. Most of us were taken back by this. Again, a couple of people asked what this had to do with us. At this point, my industry colleague who had first opened the meeting took the floor again and answered our questions. He told us that since our employers had become silent investors in this prison business, it was now in their interest to make sure that these prisons remained filled. Our job would be to help make this happen by marketing music which promotes criminal behavior, rap being the music of choice. He assured us that this would be a great situation for us because rap music was becoming an increasingly profitable market for our companies, and as employee, we’d also be able to buy personal stocks in these prisons. Immediately, silence came over the room. You could have heard a pin drop. I remember looking around to make sure I wasn&#39;t dreaming and saw half of the people with dropped jaws. My daze was interrupted when someone shouted, “Is this a f****** joke?” At this point things became chaotic. Two of the men who were part of the “unfamiliar” group grabbed the man who shouted out and attempted to remove him from the house. A few of us, myself included, tried to intervene. One of them pulled out a gun and we all backed off. They separated us from the crowd and all four of us were escorted outside. My industry colleague who had opened the meeting earlier hurried out to meet us and reminded us that we had signed agreement and would suffer the consequences of speaking about this publicly or even with those who attended the meeting. I asked him why he was involved with something this corrupt and he replied that it was bigger than the music business and nothing we’d want to challenge without risking consequences. We all protested and as he walked back into the house I remember word for word the last thing he said, “It’s out of my hands now. Remember you signed an agreement.” He then closed the door behind him. The men rushed us to our cars and actually watched until we drove off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>[continued]</p>

<p>A million things were going through my mind as I drove away and I eventually decided to pull over and park on a side street in order to collect my thoughts. I replayed everything in my mind repeatedly and it all seemed very surreal to me. I was angry with myself for not having taken a more active role in questioning what had been presented to us. I&#39;d like to believe the shock of it all is what suspended my better nature. After what seemed like an eternity, I was able to calm myself enough to make it home. I didn&#39;t talk or call anyone that night. The next day back at the office, I was visibly out of it but blamed it on being under the weather. No one else in my department had been invited to the meeting and I felt a sense of guilt for not being able to share what I had witnessed. I thought about contacting the 3 others who wear kicked out of the house but I didn&#39;t remember their names and thought that tracking them down would probably bring unwanted attention. I considered speaking out publicly at the risk of losing my job but I realized I’d probably be jeopardizing more than my job and I wasn&#39;t willing to risk anything happening to my family. I thought about those men with guns and wondered who they were? I had been told that this was bigger than the music business and all I could do was let my imagination run free. There were no answers and no one to talk to. I tried to do a little bit of research on private prisons but didn’t uncover anything about the music business’ involvement. However, the information I did find confirmed how dangerous this prison business really was. Days turned into weeks and weeks into months. Eventually, it was as if the meeting had never taken place. It all seemed surreal. I became more reclusive and stopped going to any industry events unless professionally obligated to do so. On two occasions, I found myself attending the same function as my former colleague. Both times, our eyes met but nothing more was exchanged.</p>

<p>As the months passed, rap music had definitely changed direction. I was never a fan of it but even I could tell the difference. Rap acts that talked about politics or harmless fun were quickly fading away as gangster rap started dominating the airwaves. Only a few months had passed since the meeting but I suspect that the ideas presented that day had been successfully implemented. It was as if the order has been given to all major label executives. The music was climbing the charts and most companies when more than happy to capitalize on it. Each one was churning out their very own gangster rap acts on an assembly line. Everyone bought into it, consumers included. Violence and drug use became a central theme in most rap music. I spoke to a few of my peers in the industry to get their opinions on the new trend but was told repeatedly that it was all about supply and demand. Sadly many of them even expressed that the music reinforced their prejudice of minorities.</p>

<p>I officially quit the music business in 1993 but my heart had already left months before. I broke ties with the majority of my peers and removed myself from this thing I had once loved. I took some time off, returned to Europe for a few years, settled out of state, and lived a “quiet” life away from the world of entertainment. As the years passed, I managed to keep my secret, fearful of sharing it with the wrong person but also a little ashamed of not having had the balls to blow the whistle. But as rap got worse, my guilt grew. Fortunately, in the late 90’s, having the internet as a resource which wasn&#39;t at my disposal in the early days made it easier for me to investigate what is now labeled the prison industrial complex. Now that I have a greater understanding of how private prisons operate, things make much more sense than they ever have. I see how the criminalization of rap music played a big part in promoting racial stereotypes and misguided so many impressionable young minds into adopting these glorified criminal behaviors which often lead to incarceration. Twenty years of guilt is a heavy load to carry but the least I can do now is to share my story, hoping that fans of rap music realize how they’ve been used for the past 2 decades. Although I plan on remaining anonymous for obvious reasons, my goal now is to get this information out to as many people as possible. Please help me spread the word. Hopefully, others who attended the meeting back in 1991 will be inspired by this and tell their own stories. Most importantly, if only one life has been touched by my story, I pray it makes the weight of my guilt a little more tolerable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, glad someone finally posting this type of stuff. 1960&#39;s all the way up until now have basically been the slaughter of black people.</p>

<p>A simple google search of
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=black+people+in+the+60s&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=945&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIibHi8t6pxwIVEH6SCh3DiQ0q">https://www.google.com/search?q=black+people+in+the+60s&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=945&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIibHi8t6pxwIVEH6SCh3DiQ0q</a></p>

<p>will show you the transformation that took place after the war on drugs started.</p>

<p>1960&#39;s Black power movement started, 1980&#39;s Gangsta rap music started along with gangs and the advertisement of the real &quot;nigga&quot;.</p>

<p>Segregation= blacks had to much power building their won systems in America.
Desegregation= blacks had to work for the white system while playing by his rules, this way blacks had no more power.</p>

<p>You will also notice &quot;Planned Parenthood&quot; started around this time.
You will also notice all black leader were assassinated during this time.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t the first time either, in 1921 the Tusla riots where whites ran through Black Wall street (before its time) and murdered all the black there and stole all the land,money,documents and books.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also Viacom manufactured demand for rap by launching Yo MTV Raps in 1988, three years after having bought MTV in 1985.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson sometimes spoke of a conspiracy against him by the record labels in their blacklisting his later records and possibly being behind the prosecutions and lawsuits against him. Some say he was supposed to be the one to introduce a black and criminal culture to white youth but when he refused to cooperate, they turned to other artists who started gangsta rap. His refusal to cooperate with Satanists and their evil plan is said to be his motivation in including his disavowal of &quot;the occult&quot; at the end of the Thriller video. Some say his continual plastic surgery and choice to use makeup to match the lighter color of his vitiligo rather than the color of his remaining dark skin was a way to make himself look different from his father who abused him.</p>

Snoop Dogg might as well have been Snitch Dogg when the neighbor tells their law enforcement buddy about the loud rap music next door or bumping in the car passing by. It&#39;s also strange the progression of the music culture from gentler forms of jazz, blues, rock, hip hop, and then to gangster rap.

    <div class="md"><p>No the war on drugs started and at the same time we were at war, poor ghettos had one choice, be a solider in the streets or be a solider in the army. All these Vietnam vets came back to the hood with nothing else but anger and addiction on their mind.</p>

<p>You know how the bush family has major ties to the Opium trade? How do you think poor blacks with no ships no helicopters or mode of transportation got the drugs here? The goverment brought it over for them. Gangsta rap was nothing but the pitch to sell the drug trade to the black race. Not only did they make money off the abused and poor blacks but they also enslaved them in prison. This type of system was so direct that one should assume that it was directly targeted at the black race.</p>

<p>I think the NWA movie will also portray a lot of this (finally some truth in media) as they were one of the first tricked into buying they were uplifting their people. As you can see from previous beefs of the 90&#39;s this is why Ice Cube got far far away from them.</p>

Governments also befriend or make alliances with druglords and cartels when it&#39;s in their best interest to do so (reportedly fighting the Tabliban is an example today, where the &quot;Northern Alliance&quot; is made up of warlords/drug cartels--and this makes sense as radical Islamists are generally anti-drug). All of this leads to the impression that the government controls far more of the drug trade than they really do. </p>

<p>The war on drugs was a reaction to the liberalization in drugs in popular culture that occurred in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s (radicalism born of conscription in an unpopular war). Drugs, crack especially, became a way to sell magazines and boost ratings as middle America was scared to think drugs were an epidemic. Politicians reacted, as they always do, and massively boosted spending on police. More police, harsher drugs laws led to many more people in prison. This hit the inner city harder than anywhere else.</p>

<p>The &quot;Highway&quot; Rick Ross allegations are specifically that the CIA intentionally introduced crack to the west coast. Basically, he alleges a massive, evil, social engineering project where the black people would get hooked on crack, and lead to more imprisonment. While Ross&#39; allegations on a small scale my be correct (he may have been allowed to sell crack), there has never been any credible substantiation I am aware of that there was any plot to harm the black community this way. </p>

<p>Gangster rap is the result of chronic poverty, in the African American community. It celebrates the thug lifestyle of guns, drugs and misogyny. It is far too complex and deep an artistic movement to plausibly be attributed to a single sinister plot. I don&#39;t think it is very controversial to argue hip hop culture has been exploitative of the black community, but I have never seen evidence of a connection to a CIA or governmental plot. </p>

<p>This conspiracy theory is sadly far too simplistic and gives the CIA credit as being far more powerful than it really is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe this. The outcome is so chaotic that I doubt it could be possible to predict; &quot;If we make rap songs or any other type of song say this, these certain populations will do this&quot;. </p>

<p>However, I do believe rap music, specially gangster rap music, has a bad influence on minorities that live in the lower income portion of medium to large cities. I grew up in one these &quot;ghettos&quot;. Growing up poor and in a lower income part of the city affected my whole life. From who were to be my friends in school to how teachers treated me and my colleagues. The more &quot;well fed and dressed&quot; kids tended to avoid me at school, with differences being that their parents were more involved in their life, had money to buy them name brand clothes and shoes, etc. If you were one of the kids that didn&#39;t have the new Nike&#39;s or wasn&#39;t taken to watch the new movie, it was really easy to be left out. So I ended up being a loner for the most part. Time for high school shows up and I run into a friend from elementary who lived a few blocks away. Our whole teenage years were fueled by rap music. From Eazy-E, Dr.Dre, Snoop, Tupac, Two Short, Bone Thugz, South Park Mexican, Psycho Realm, and a whole bunch of other minority rap stars. This is where I was introduced to alcohol. Tagging. The whole nine yards. My friends went on to be gang bangers, drug dealers, and later on prisoners. Every single one of them served a prison term for drugs. I remember seeing the undercover fed vehicles following them. Taking pictures. So why all this? Just to build street cred to be able to rap about it, in the hopes of becoming famous. I got lucky, since I was some what geeky and stuff the gangsters didn&#39;t see me as worthy  street material. So I was able to get out. </p>
