    <div class="md"><p>Have you read about the insane rate of cancer in the service employees that dug through the rubble at ground zero?  There are now more people with &quot;cancer linked to 9/11&quot; than there were actual 9/11 related deaths on that day.  WT1 and 2 were both helped.  I would go further to say that they were helped by something that produces radiation.</p>

<p>Edit:  You just need to do a little bit more digging and you&#39;ll see how infinitely profitable it is to have a perpetual enemy that is always a threat and can never be destroyed.  The fact that the death count was so low, (It is astonishingly low) means that really the crooks that did this weren&#39;t trying to kill as many as possible so it isn&#39;t so much evil as it is greedy.  If a plane crashed into the building that I work in right now and it collapsed, I suspect the death toll would be higher and my building is no where near the size of the World Trade Centers.  So many people were mysteriously not at work and the pentagon got hit in an area that was under renovation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perfectly plausible I suppose, except that there is a control.  Employees with the same job during the same time that didn&#39;t respond to 9/11 were still dealing with similar disaster type scenarios and digging through rubble and burning buildings and they didn&#39;t have the same rate of cancer.  </p>

<p>You still make a valid point though, there isn&#39;t a whole lot of data about what happens when buildings of that size fall down.</p>

<p>Therefore, the uploader of that video is as wrong as you are when describing the dust cloud from the towers as being a &quot;pyroclastic flow&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re 100% correct. The dust cloud from the collapsing towers shared <em>superficial similarities</em> with a pyroclastic flow (as it does with an avalanche), but that doesn&#39;t mean it <em>was</em> a pyroclastic flow. Why is this?</p>

<p>Because pyroclastic flows <em>only</em> come from volcanoes and other geothermal processes, for one thing. Second, they are extremely hot and incinerate everything in their path, which the cloud of debris from the towers didn&#39;t do (we know this because we have footage from inside the cloud). Case closed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A pyroclastic flow</strong> (also known scientifically as a pyroclastic density current[1]) <strong>is a fast-moving current of hot gas and rock (collectively known as tephra), which reaches speeds moving away</strong> from a volcano of up to 700 km/h (450 mph).[2] <strong>The gas can reach temperatures of about 1,000 °C</strong> (1,830 °F). <strong>Pyroclastic flows normally hug the ground and travel downhill, or spread laterally under gravity.</strong> Their speed depends upon the density of the current, the volcanic output rate, and the gradient of the slope. They are a common and devastating result of certain explosive volcanic eruptions.</p></li>

<p>Using the term is an exact definition of the pulverized concrete, and super heated air that behaved like a moving mass characteristic of flowing water in downtown NYC.  The only difference was the event that created it.</p>

<p>lol</p>

<p>I strongly encourage people here read that Wikipedia link. As it clearly states, a pyroclastic flow is a scientific term with a very specific meaning in the field of volcanology. Basically, if it didn&#39;t come from a volcano or volcanic process, it&#39;s not a pyroclastic flow. Describing the dust from the collapse of the towers as such is clearly incorrect, as the poster you replied to politely, and correctly, pointed out.</p>

<p>You saying the dust cloud from the towers is a pyroclastic flow is akin to me describing the stuff rising from a boiling kettle full of water as smoke instead of steam. Smoke and steam might look somewhat similar but they have different sources, composition and properties.</p>

<p>And next time, try reading your own fucking citations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, other people in the truth movement, like those who uploaded those videos to YouTube, have used the term incorrectly. I do not deny others have made the same error you have. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that pyroclastic flows <em>only</em> come from volcanoes and are full of extremely hot gas, as your own quote from the Wiki states.</p>

<p>If what resulted from the collapse of the towers was remotely comparable to a true pyroclastic flow, everyone caught in the dust would have been almost instantly burned to death. As we have footage taken by people caught in the dust cloud (very close to the towers), we know this didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>But again, this is all moot because pyroclastic flows only come from volcanoes. Still, it was cute of you to call other people &quot;misinformed&quot; only to quote a text that specifically disproved your contention.</p>

<li><strong>Long-lasting effect of initial configuration in gravitational
spreading of material fronts</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Introduction</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consider an accidental collapse or a skilled demolition of a building vertically on itself. The emerging debris cloud will quickly invade a wider region that greatly surpasses the bounds of the demolished building</strong>. During the infamous 9/11 attack, the tidal wave of dust and debris enveloped much of the lower Manhattan. The gravitational spreading of these destructive debris clouds, as seen in Fig. 1, sensitively depends on the building’s shape.</p>

<p>The non-axisymmetric nature of the resulting lobe-like structure is persistent over a significant time and cannot be predicted by current models. This counter-intuitive behavior of initial condition-dependent spreading of material fronts is not unique to debris clouds and is applicable to a variety of geophysical flows as demonstrated in this paper. <strong>Debris clouds belong to the family of gravity currents which are observed in various natural situations.</strong> The manner in which these flows spread has important implications for oil spills [1], accidental toxic gas releases [2,3], fire propagation [4], turbidity currents <strong>[5], pyroclastic flows</strong> [6], avalanches</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that quote says the dust cloud from a demolition can share various superficial similarities with a true pyroclastic flow (and avalanches and oil spills). This doesn&#39;t mean they <em>are</em> a pyroclastic flow (or avalanche or oil spill), in the same way the fact steam from my kettle has superficial similarities with smoke doesn&#39;t mean it <em>is</em> smoke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont know if I am fueling the fire now but I honestly just want you to get back on the right track.</p>

<p>The evidence that Pyroclastic flows only originates from volcanoes is abundant in that it is always mentioned connected to volcanoes and almost nowhere else. I understand your standpoint in that it is a effective analogy but does not change that fact that all the arguments made against you are because everyone loves to correct mistakes. Saying that pyroclastic flows originates from another source then a volcano is without doubt wrong.</p>

<p>Even if the effects was 100% the same it would not be a pyroclastic flow as it has nothing to to with geology or volcanology </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;Official Story&quot; requires that the falling debris from WTC 1 and 2, and the collapse all three Towers themselves defy not only gravity, but the laws of motion.</p>

<p>How about you take 15 minutes and watch the videos and actually listen to them INSTEAD of asking me to spoon fed you the information point by point?</p>

<p>The clear violation of even the most basic aspects of Thermodynamics is much more detailed but it is found in the formation of the pyroclastic flow which requires both a instant and MASSIVE amount of explosive energy.   </p>

<p>A HUGE amount of energy would be needed to pulverize millions of tons of concrete into dust <strong>in less that nine seconds</strong> .....and then also heat the air needed to propagate the flowing, wave-like mass down the streets of NYC which literally demolished cars, and baked them at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your question might be beside the point. We already know that Bush/Cheney/Netenyahu lied about Iraq and all deserve life in prison for their war crimes.</p>

<p>The fact that they used 9/11 for this and more - even though they knew (and we all know now) that it was all a lie, including knowing about terrorist movements before 9/11 yet they did nothing (also easily proven) already tells you they had involvement. We already know that these people <em>knew</em> that these terrorists were going to launch an attack, yet they did nothing.</p>

<p>Maybe people might take your topic seriously if all those corrupt politicians involved with this event were placed in jail.</p>

<p>I suppose if I woke up and realized it was actually September 10th 2001, and the last 14 years of my life were just a dream I might accept that it was <strong>NOT</strong> and inside job.  </p>

<p>I suppose also a new theory of physics could be discovered and proven that explains how those 2 planes could have taken down three steel buildings without damaging the buildings between them.</p>

<p>Perhaps they could recreate the event or point to any other time in history where a steel building has collapsed like that when it wasn&#39;t controlled.</p>

<p>Edit:  I thought of one that might do it:  If all of the 9 to 17 or so &quot;hijackers&quot; that are still alive came forward and said the US paid them to act like they were the hijackers to perpetuate the idea that the US is capable of this sort of inside job, then that might raise some questions.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, other people in the truth movement, like those who uploaded those videos to YouTube, have used the term incorrectly. I do not deny others have made the same error you have. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that pyroclastic flows <em>only</em> come from volcanoes and are full of extremely hot gas, as your own quote from the Wiki states.</p>

<p>If what resulted from the collapse of the towers was remotely comparable to a true pyroclastic flow, everyone caught in the dust would have been almost instantly burned to death. As we have footage taken by people caught in the dust cloud (very close to the towers), we know this didn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>But again, this is all moot because pyroclastic flows only come from volcanoes. Still, it was cute of you to call other people &quot;misinformed&quot; only to quote a text that specifically disproved your contention.</p>
