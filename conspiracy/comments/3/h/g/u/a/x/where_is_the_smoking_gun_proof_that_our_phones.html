       I have no doubt that triangulated coordinates, and GPS information picked up from satellites and reported over the phone, is uploaded and stored on telco/NSA servers in Utah..
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have no doubt that in a "national security emergency", the NSA / government can use the phone's operating system to secretively switch on your microphone and camera and front-facing camera, if they want to record what is going on inside your pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       But has anyone found evidence of the switch or the trigger, has anything been revealed of how this gets activated, and which earlier versions of Android operating system might be "safe" from this method of surveillance?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
       <strong>
        My bad, it happens at the HARDWARE level, not the operating system.

       While working on Replicant, a fully free/libre version of Android, we discovered that the proprietary program running on the applications processor in charge of handling the communication protocol with the modem actually implements a backdoor that lets the modem perform remote file I/O operations on the file system.

       Just want to share an experience here:
      </p>
      <p>
       I buy things online from time to time so my laptop that I had at the time knew that I had entered my credit/debit card number onto different websites. I moved to a bigger city for a year and would use my debit card at a grocery store. THE DAY AFTER I first went to that grocery store and used my debit card, I began seeing ads on different websites of that grocery store. I took some time to think about why suddenly how I was seeing these ads on a myriad of websites and came to the conclusion that it was connected by my debit card number. Unless there's still another explanation, I would love to hear.

       could just be that ads are fed based on region, so when you connected through an internet provider in the new location it "knew" you were there and you were getting a different pool of ads that would obviously consist of things in that area.  Still creepy though, don't get me wrong.

       What about corporate surveillance that goes to strategic partnership type of database (corp+govt). What about fusion centers that bring up your entire electronic life when you dial 9-1-1, everything from your utility bills history, bank information, medical history and social media/comments postings online- I thought this was common knowledge. If not, it's a given, the govt plus corporations give homeless/indigent persons cellphones -SMARTphones, for what- so they can "find jobs (ostensible reason)"? do you think the govt
       <em>

       The smoking gun is that all this anti-government fear mongering about spying and data collecting is a massive cover story for the very real data collecting, manipulating and spying being done by private for profit organizations as well as political organizations.  It is as dangerous and can and will be used against you in employment opportunities, credit ratings  and other business transactions.

       I put two traps on my network to detect any bulk transmission from my network which I don't expect. It cannot be a ubiquitous technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also open to the idea that it is not nearly as widespread as they want us to believe. If there is source on a machine that broadcasts unexpectedly... you can't do that around many of the hackers out there, because they will track the computer, the process and the bits... then it's three months of looking at decompiled code and it's solved.

       Why would it send at a suspicious moment? Just wrap, co-mingle or frontrun/tailgate legit traffic. But hey, I'm no expert.

       I monitor all traffic, and I know the ports and data rates and when I send. I do deep analysis on uploads, so there's gonna be no frontrunning or tailgating.

       This says what it says... no one is sneaking audio or video off of my network and I've got a lot of equipment. That doesn't mean that someone can't ocr and speech recognize content and slip them by in smaller packets... but audio and video are not going out.

       You don't think there may be a transmission avenue which would go unreported? Your network connection is not the only "exit node" from your device.

       I think there could be, if I was a targeted individual... but then I'd be screwed anyways :). I disable and monitor most of my wireless so they'd have to install something clandestinely. I don't have an audio air gap vulnerability. Checked that. You could hop out of the network FROM the wireless router, but I've got modified firmware that makes that very difficult.

       In order to test for yourself if your phone is being monitored, do this experiment: Leave your phone next to the television overnight. Turn the TV onto a Spanish language channel loud enough for the phone to be able to pick up the sound. In the morning, all the ads on your phone will be in spanish.

       Has there been a proof of this experiment, or is it a joke played on the tinfoil-hat set, like trying to trick someone into looking up the word "gullible" in the dictionary ?

       Companies like Samsung making Android phones have been earning about less than a dollar of profit per phone they sold in 2015. Cheap Android phones benefit Google's attempt to include everybody in their botnet with phones anyone can buy for $100.
