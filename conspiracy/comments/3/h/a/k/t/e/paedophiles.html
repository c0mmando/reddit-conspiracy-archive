       You say something in a serious tone, without intention to take part in silliness. You are greeted with: "take your meds", etc. This occurs on a regular basis. This thread is the beginning and end of something new.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys are paedophiles...
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain;
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of mental-critical insults whilst they are accepted by authorities, is equal to authorities holding your head down and them forcing their sexual energy upon you. They are linked to paedophilia, improperly.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example; a pejorative mental-critical insult, has been said many times in effort to win a debate; winning, then, at least, is on these people's minds. There is a timeline of this activity that keeps it in continuum; one refers to all the time's it's been said to people, all the times it has affected someone, in it's entirety; causing depression, causing isolation, etc. The evil types are energetic about their own, and comrades, past activity; this energy is, sexual energy; it's bore out of the raw emotional intercourse of conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the improper sense they are paedophiles. The improper side of sexual intercourse is manipulated. It wouldn't bother me if it was just them who were doing it and the authorities were not on their side, and that's exactly why they are "paedophiles" and not general rapists; they target future generations with their perversity.

       Nice element of sarcasm. You can't help but be a joker can you? That's okay, at the least you commit these evils unintentionally.

       You prey on the things which cannot be captured and analysed. You manipulate even children's minds, I hope for the world you are isolated.

       They're saying when someone tells you to "take your meds" in response to a serious post/comment, that you should retort, "stop touching kids", ie, pejorative claims of mental illness should be met with pejorative claims of pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also saying that that type of rudeness (insults of one's mental faculties) feels like sexual mistreatment by an overbearing authority figure to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       No idea how they're doing, though. The writing style is peculiar.

       Such an idiotic statement where you defend these pedos... So that they may continue calling people "crazy" or "crackpot" with authority, and the rest of the social circle on their side. Let me guess, your next response is: "yeaaah lol u R crazy, lol, right guys?!".

       In response to your obvious forthcoming idiocy; no it's not "just 'take your meds', but all mental-critical insults, or insults deemed okay by authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wouldn't get your feels from saying "you grass" "you police hater" or "you criminal", it must be effective in your eyes so you use an authority with powers similar to police; psychologists. If it was possible to say "you grass" and it have an effect, you would say it, regularly, like you say, "you mental case", "you crackpot" and "take your meds".
      </p>
      <p>
       You make use of authority or other power in your insults, to make them more hard-hitting, and you get off on it, like the vile paedophile you are.

       OP, I do not say this normally, but you an the digitalCartel need to take your meds. You speak like an insane, schizophrenic. I'm not sure if you are drunk (I am), but you remind me of a schizophrenic, who I know and love. Either you are trolling, or you seriously need help. Either learn how to control the booze, or serious think about getting back on meds for your mental illness.

       Your words mean nothing, it's nothing more than gibberish. I'm shit faced and cannot even understand you. You are speaking without any thought and you are only making yourself look like a fool. Go to your savior, in the DigitalCartel, tell the AmericanPharoh I said, piss off. You sick sadist fucks, who prey on a schizophrenics. You're no better than those who prey on helpless children.

       Yo, I'm a strict believer in the disbelief of humanities knowledge as it's always been retold or redrafted to fit the knowledge we've gained.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there are a lot of things that we do have knowledge of; and we do a very good job analyzing each other. I think this is because as humanity evolves, we have always tried to do what we thought was best for the people or for their prodigy and in other's view it could be the worst thing to happen in their generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution fixes everything because that's evolution, where you adapt or die off. Perhaps, mental disorders we see today are really just evolution taking its placeholder steps.
      </p>
      <h1>
       'Why the people who don't deal with mental disorders are so much better in  or off in life?'
      </h1>
      <p>
       The same could be said for the first fish to sprout legs. The struggle on land was hard but it kept predators away and gave way to new foods and new ways of life. Perhaps 'mental disorders', however prominent they may be, are just evolutions trial and error phase.
