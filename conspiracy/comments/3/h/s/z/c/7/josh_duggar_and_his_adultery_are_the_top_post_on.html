       Fuck yeah that's news. Josh Duggar was the head of the political lobbying arm of the Family Research Council, which fought against same sex marriage and opposes abortion, pornography, stem cell research, divorce and publicly denies climate change. In other words, he was a leader of a fundamentalist Christian group which claims to fight against "immorality" and seeks to influence national politics all the while he was cheating on his wife. Big name politicians supported him and some, like Mike Huckabee, continued to support him even after the news broke out that he had molested his own sisters and several other underage girls when he was younger.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is important news because it says a lot about Christian fundamentalist politicians and people who run these Christian fundamentalist organizations. Most of em are hypocrites!

       The TPP is just a small thing too... right? I mean its only a law that gives corporations a higher sovereignty than elected governments. Not really newsworthy.  No need for the public to be aware of little things like that when really important news needs to be reported like what Trump had for lunch.

       A lot of people I know who were raised in suffocating, large Christian families kept the most secrets. Their lack of privacy along with strict upbringing only makes them more careful in covering their tracks, being sneaky, and it turns them into sociopathic deviants.

       This part I get, to a degree I really didn't wish I had to but I did grow up in such an environment/family.

       This part is where it gets sinister though. It's the difference between:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        I grew up in a Christian family, realized I was gay, hid it for a while but eventually came to terms with it
       </li>
       <li>
        I grew up in a Christian family, realized I was gay, hid it indefinitely, went into politics and tried to enact legislation restricting or harming gays
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I wish I was making that scenario about repressed politicians up but it's happened far too many times now to be funny anymore. Josh Duggar basically did the same thing, except he did it by preaching core family values and traditional marriage.....all while screwing around both with/on his family and marriage. I can understand having secrets, but when you devote your life/career to things that are opposite in every way what you're actually doing secretly, that takes hypocrite to a new level.

       You're right, sinister describes Duggar perfectly. I wonder if Huckabee will still defend him, blaming porn addiction rather than the horrible person Duggar kept secret.

       So he molested his sister, has relationship issues, and is addicted to sexual activities... I think there is something sinister going on in the Duggar family and I bet it involved the dad touching him as a kid. I won't be shocked if the story comes out after people continue to dig.

       I agree. Either Josh has undiagnosed mental health issues that lead him to not care about the consequences of molesting his own siblings, or someone else taught him that behavior at a young age.

       Pretty much.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is preaching a position where cheating on their spouse is wrong, yet they can't live by that rule themselves, the answer is not just say "Oh well. I should just keep holding people accountable to a standard I myself can't achieve."
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is to take a real long look at that position and have an honest conversation with ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       To continue the example, the conversation should no longer be about whether cheating is right or wrong, but rather speaking honestly with ourselves about our ability to stay monogamous before making that level of commitment to another human.

       So, every leader must be in action the idealized version of their professed belief systems? That's a nice vision, but we're dealing with humans here. We get tired, angry, frustrated, whatever, and make poor choices. Also, if you look, those who sound off the loudest about what other people should stop doing are very often guilty of that action and simply not at peace with themselves about it. Telling everyone they should not do "x" is them trying to convince themselves to stop. Humans.  ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯

       Yes.  That's the whole fucking point of being a leader.  Live true to yourself and if you're going to hold every human to a certain standard, then you better fucking well be living to that standard too.

       I understand you completely. What you don't understand is that "should" and reality, often do not intersect. If you try and live in the world of "should", you are being completely disconnected from what is actually happening. Let's say that EVERYONE took your position, and would never put themselves in a position of leadership on any given subject in the first place unless they be the perfect ideal. Only, no one on Earth can actually be an ideal, because we're all human. So now what? We have no leaders? That's ridiculous. People look for leaders and are willing to accept less than ideal people as leaders everywhere, everyday. Taking that reality, and now declaring those normal people who are being looked to as leaders, must now magically transform themselves into perfect ideals is asinine. Get it out of your system. There is nothing wrong with holding people accountable for failures and deception, but seriously - get a grip yo'.

       Your position is bleak, depressing, and in my opinion completely out of touch.  It also sounds like you're a christian, as your default viewpoint is that humans are incapable of living by their own convictions.  Do you like that about yourself?  Assuming that every person you know is going to let you or themselves down?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my 20's I had an experience that lead me to believe that no human being should physically hit/harm another human being unless it is in defense.  Since then I have punched/kicked/hit/harmed exactly 0 people, unless it was in the name of defending myself or someone else.  So sign me up.  I'll be a leader in that regard.  You seem to already believe that I'm going to fail, just by being human.  I reject that, as you have no grounds for it.  You are judging me on a failure I haven't even committed yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand why that is so evil and despicable?  Do i need to spell that out even further?

       And if we judged people by only one domain of their life, you might be the example you want to be.  But we judge people by every aspect and ever facet we can dream up.  This isn't a defense of Dugger, I couldn't give two shits about him or his crappy (read boring) TV show (or reality TV in general...except that hot type-A chick that fixes up old houses...shes hot).  This is about this silly idealistic "perfect person" concept that you seem to think exists.

       I can be a leader on the issue of non-violence, yet also struggle with drug addiction.  As long as I'm not taking the public leadership position of "all drugs are bad" then I see no issue.  If the general public wants to judge me on my drug addiction (something I make no claim to be a leader or perfect in) then that is a mistake on their part, not mine.

       You can have desires and not act on them. That's what you are trying to argue is onerous for Duggar. He can not watch porn -- no one is making him. He can not cheat on his wife -- again, no one is forcing him. He could have not molested multiple children -- again no one made him do that.

       Hipocrite? Try child molesting piece of garbage that should be force fed his own cock.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have none of Jesus' s ability or urge to forgive those who rape children. I find him morally repugnant for teaching the world it was okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgiveness is christianity's greatest appeal and the curse they brought upon the world.  I don't believe in forgiveness, the world would be a better place if everybody paid for what they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Christians are hypocrites, that's no insult, it's their culture.  This motherfucker sexually assaulted his little sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the one who is underreacting. No amount of hate is too much hate for people like this. His death would make the world a better place.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I hope he reads this and kills himself, but he won't because he's already forgiven himself. He would just chuckle and talk about how he prays for my immortal soul.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd rather go to hell then to a heaven where he's welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a theory that if Christians are right, all the good people are in hell. Maybe the Gnostics were right.

       They are
       <em>
        everywhere
       </em>
       now.  Way worse than even a year ago.  All of the ELI5 posts in the top 100 have artificially promoted, usually highly inaccurate responses at the head of the comments.  See: the current bullshit about CC refunds taking longer for any logistical reason, when it does indeed happen due to interest on ledgers and lack of legal mandate for speedier transactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, regarding the Ashley Madison hack, it seems to be another expensive manufactured story designed to distract and sell.  Gawker has a post up about how some recent inorganic viral miscarriage couple is involved, and the Duggars are constantly promoted via their TLC reality show.  The whole thing is a dendritic structure designed to spawn as many vignettes as possible for a few hundred thousand pageviews here and there.

       Show me a fundamentalist Christian and I'll show you a person that is comfortable with child molesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a part of their sick culture, the devil makes them rape their own families, the church forgives them and their salvation is celebrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The victim's get the message, and when it happens to their children they condone it and the cycle begins again.  Souls are way more important than children.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible is a guidebook for victimizing your own and feeling good about it later, that's why chomos flock to the one place that forgives and protects them.

       I think their vehemence against their own perceived "sins" is telling. These people are fractured, self-hating. The self- hate can make 'em occasionally "release the demon," or so my psych teacher explained. Didn't Duggar basically say it was 'cause of porn?

       Excuse me, but I care deeply... DEEPLY about these issues which most of have no business being the business of modern politicians in a SECULAR democracy, and yet they are the same issues that people base their democratic votes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, I care when influential people that are working against the freedoms of Americans are god-damned hypocrites that somehow seemingly affect the policies and people that are making decisions on the behalf of innocent people that don't support a religious-based government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling us sheep for caring is like telling a person on fire that they shouldn't be concerned about hearing fire alarms. This affects us directly through the cultural chain of events, so yes, we are more than justified in caring.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not sure who "they" are. The media just taking advantage of the celebrity gossip of it can fuck off, but anyone else that understand the ramifications is legit in reporting this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit to say: All that being said, I am deeply upset that some criminals decided to invade the privacy of free adults to leak this information out. That is beyond reprehensible, and Josh Duggar's privacy should never have been invaded in this way, and it's absolutely disgusting. Unfortunately, he chose a life in the media which opened him up for this type of exposure. It's unfortunate that this important information was obtained this way rather than shared by himself or his wife, but it's out there and deserves to be known. Truly, the biggest evil of this story is the hackers, and I hope they are caught and justice is served.

       Christians replace their morality with Christianity, the Bible has no problem with rape or child abuse and it places no value on non Christians.

       I think more likely it's a Clinton plot. They saw how well 2012 went with that Todd Akin idiot saying one ridiculous thing and dragging his whole party down. So send out Trump to claim he's a Republican and draw the whole party down.
      </p>

       And if there is Trump as a nominee, holy hell, that would be the only thing in the world to make the thought of voting Hilary cross my mind. I'd probably just not vote though if that comes up.

       "college educated" will not mean squat to you once you are out and in the real world, if you leave academia. I know very intelligent/wise people who did not go to college, and I know some who did. Just because you are an expert on wonton burrito meals doesn't mean that you know more than other people on subjects outside of that. And if you are an expert in most lib arts, you are very articulate, but are missing the knowledge to back it up unless that knowledge is gained the same way a non-student would gain it.

       Yes, because no one can have an opinion without speaking to every single person in a represented population. That's why people are knocking on your day 15x a day to find out what you think about what X candidate said about whatever.

       Every season has a true news story and a "trumped up" one if you will. We're sheeple, and taught to play into the rumor and ignore the real news. Paris Hilton worked for a while. Then the Kardashians, who were famous for being famous. Then Miley Cyrus. Then Bruce Gender, the lion and the flag. You'd think reddit of all places would be exempt from this. But no.

       Not sure why the truth gets downvoted so quickly these days. Reddit wants to be a part of the MSM, the  'news' defaults have always strove for this status. If you listen to some of the mods bloviate on how important they see their role as gatekeeper of "The Front Page Of The Internet"  it will always make one puke in their mouth a little bit..

       It's not just the mods fault entirely. People actually care about that whole situation, but will never admit it. Having an opinion and side to fight for is much easier then trying to understand something like economics or politics. People want yellow journalism, not facts and real news.

       What is shocking to me is that this is even shocking information. Reddit is a privately owned site: utilized for profit, to further the aims of the capitalist hegemon, and to enforce a type of ideological status quo regarding a number of issues. It is not reflective of any sort of true democratic process in news-finding, and it is ridiculous to assume that it would, given the above.

       The Duggars were a
       <em>
        poster family
       </em>
       for religiously fundamentalist politicians &amp; politicos.  Various members of that family appeared many times with politicians as  examples of a godly lifestyle with alleged moral authority to sanctimoniously lecture the rest of us about the LGBT, contraception, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this family's latest hypocrisy is news for a lot of people who were tired of politicians pandering with this family.  However, it will pass.  Unfortunately, this family seems to be a walking train wreck who will probably be in the news again.

       It's as much news as CNN and Faux. Reddit belongs to a big media conglomerate, and is as censored as any big media product. I read
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       ,
       <a href="/r/occupywallstreet">

       , and
       <a href="/r/greed">
        /r/greed

       for more reliable news than the
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news

       subreddit which is a fucking joke.

       These people posting here are judging people of what they did over the Internet and because they have a certain religion. Seriously?

       This isa post about Ashley Madison and him cheating. If it was a post about his past child molestation it would be different. But having an affair is not a crime and people and Christians do it all the time. Why is this getting so much attention?

       Okay, we have a guy here who molested children, claimed to have repented and set his life straight, then a few months later, he's back in the news because his penis made him spend almost a $1000 on a site that exists to enable having an affair.  So, yeah,
       <em>
        once again
       </em>
       , here's a moral scold who was paid money from a Christian foundation, who turned around and spent that Jesus money trying to cheat on his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's getting well-deserved attention for being a hypocrite; in my opinion, if you push your religious ideology into the political sphere, and then you fall from grace while trying to legislate morality into everyone around you while blatantly doing the opposite in your personal life, you shouldn't just get that story blasted all over the news, you should get chained to a pillory so people can throw rotten fruit at you, like they did in Puritan New England.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, he's one of the people trying to drag us back to 1692, so let's embroider a goddamned scarlet "A" on his shirt so he can live the fantasy for real.

       A lot of people I know who were raised in suffocating, large Christian families kept the most secrets. Their lack of privacy along with strict upbringing only makes them more careful in covering their tracks, being sneaky, and it turns them into sociopathic deviants.

       So, every leader must be in action the idealized version of their professed belief systems? That's a nice vision, but we're dealing with humans here. We get tired, angry, frustrated, whatever, and make poor choices. Also, if you look, those who sound off the loudest about what other people should stop doing are very often guilty of that action and simply not at peace with themselves about it. Telling everyone they should not do "x" is them trying to convince themselves to stop. Humans.  ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯

       Your position is bleak, depressing, and in my opinion completely out of touch.  It also sounds like you're a christian, as your default viewpoint is that humans are incapable of living by their own convictions.  Do you like that about yourself?  Assuming that every person you know is going to let you or themselves down?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my 20's I had an experience that lead me to believe that no human being should physically hit/harm another human being unless it is in defense.  Since then I have punched/kicked/hit/harmed exactly 0 people, unless it was in the name of defending myself or someone else.  So sign me up.  I'll be a leader in that regard.  You seem to already believe that I'm going to fail, just by being human.  I reject that, as you have no grounds for it.  You are judging me on a failure I haven't even committed yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand why that is so evil and despicable?  Do i need to spell that out even further?

       , there is too much idealism on reddit (and the internet) and you'll never convince anyone.  Someone above said that hypocrites shouldn't try to change the world.  If that's the case, every public personality needs to go away - because they are all fakes.
