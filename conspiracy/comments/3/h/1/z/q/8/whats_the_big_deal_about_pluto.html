       As some of you know, I have a bot that searches through a user's history to find keywords. I would basically use it on someone who seemed suspicious, in order to see how much that user would participate in GMO-related threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that some of the suspicious users were also highly active in Clinton and Sanders threads (behaved as pro-Clinton/anti-Sanders). I also noticed something else, that some of them would participate in Pluto threads as well. It wasn't much, just a thread or so here and there, but it still seems kind of strange to me. I won't list the users this time, only the thread titles, but I'm wondering if anyone has any theories about the interest in Pluto or any additional information. It could be nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these users were either on the GMO/Monsanto list, close to it, and/or were just shilly enough for me to search them. (5 on the GMO/Monsanto list, 2 very close to it, 3 shilly)

       OP I gave this some thought and I have a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democratic candidates typically get scientifically-minded voters, at least as of late. The younger generation (18-30) has within it a fairly large subset which ascribes to a policy which could quickly be described as "scientific evidence or gtfo".
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore appeasing them would mean giving them shallow, scientifically-oriented hypotheses they can easily debate and defend with their arm-chair knowledge. I readily admit, I'm one of those youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other terms, it's associating the notion of science and science discussion with the candidate, thereby making them seem subliminally more appealing to that particular scientifically-oriented subset of the young voters. Democrats rely on the youth - they elected Obama. If Hilary or Sanders gets elected, it'll have been the youth vote that brings them in.

       Just a thought, but it plays right along with the traditional reddit user base: young, computer-oriented male. I'm a marketer: the first rule is "know and relate to your target audience". It applies to political campaign all the same. After all, both are trying to sell you something. Whereas I try to sell burritos, politicians try to sell ideas.

       All I'll say is that this emphasis on Pluto/Hades is just one of many warning signs that something bad is going to happen this year. The shmita, blood moons, the pope's visit to America are a few more warning signs.

       is a lot like me. He hovers around
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       because he's interested in conspiracy-type theories. I'd be willing to bet he ascribes to certain ones. He'd almost certainly admit that the JFK assassination, for instance, likely did not happen as the official story tells it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing I've noticed about him that's similar to myself is that he's an otherwise rational, well-thinking person. He's got a skeptical (yet open) mind, and he recognizes bunk for bunk. He just expects people to back up their assertions, and recognizes the signs of a person who isn't going to. Further (again, similar to myself), it's apparent to me that after it's been made clear that whomever he's talking to is not going to listen to reason (they're firmly planted in their line of thinking, regardless of evidence),
       <a href="/u/BillionaireBob">
        /u/BillionaireBob
       </a>
       will start tongue-in-cheek trolling. It's trolling in the sense that he's stopped giving a shit about what they're saying and he's just poking a few jabs at someone. "Teasing" would be a better definition, in my opinion.
       <sup>
        1
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, he's also usually a lot less verbal than I (being wordy is simultaneously a talent I'm proud of, and also, a burden and a curse), but he's basically got the same idea. Remember I just said this, right?

      <blockquote>

       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       That's why he posts on many flat-earth theories. Remember: I said shallow, scientifically oriented hypotheses. I've had and expressed a theory that the entire flat-earth nonsense is meant to distract that same scientifically-minded group (18-30) from discussing
       <em>
        legitimate
       </em>
       issues using those rational minds: issues such as world-banking, TPP, and the concept of 'terrorism'. These 'theories' – which is an affront to the word, being that they fly in the face of everything science knows – only serve as low-hanging fruit to take up the time of people who, while open to conspiracy theories, are also rational and educated folks.

There's about 50-100 on/off people who post/argue/retort/etc, and you can pretty clearly divide them along certain lines, scientific inquiry being one of them. The rest are mostly just lurking and/or passing users – ones who don't stick around very long.

       Yea, it's even more interesting because he participates in threads both on here and
       <a href="/r/theworldisflat">
        /r/theworldisflat

       . I think the theory is curious and interesting to think about, but I don't seek all the threads about them. I could understand if he did believe in the theory, even a little.

       I'm not claiming that he's anything. I was just wondering.

      <p>
       And usually when I see aggressive or mean comments that don't really add to the discussion, I get suspicious. It also doesn't help that the only two users I searched from this thread based off of that, both happened to be active in flat-earth theory threads, which to me isn't really a common theory to discuss, yet.

       I don't participate in the world is flat. I was banned. I didnt really say much, but once you go against the grain there you get the ban hammer. At the point the only time I participate in flat earth theory threads is when they are here, and it's usually for a laugh.

       I do agree with a lot of this. I'm here because this stuff is interesting and I can get behind a few things I see here. I like when people provide evidence for their discussion. I can say anything here and back it up with "the damn government" or "those zionest Jews" and it'll get supported most of the time, which isn't right. When I realize they can't back up what they say and the discussion is going to go nowhere I sometimes change up my mentality.

       25 seems like a lot. But I'm sure it's less recently, as I've been banned from the dedicated sub for it. For the most part I only ask for evidence for people to back up claims, no matter what thread I'm in. "But the gubment!" doesnt back up a theory. I've been called a shill for it, but whatever.

       Here's my hypothesis:
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of the people on your GMO Shill list (like me) have publicly declared that they have or are engaged in a formal education in the sciences. (One of the users on your list is an actual honest to god astronomer.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If these people are actually students of science as they claim, and they are
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       like my friends from college (who are all huge science nerds) then of course they'd be interested in Pluto- because of its unique place in our solar system and the fact that this mission is the closest look we've ever gotten at Pluto. It's kind of a big deal. All of my friends are following the current Pluto mission very closely.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the Clinton/Sanders thing- Clinton and Sanders are two of the most prominent contestants for the Democratic nomination. Sanders has a serious anti-GMO bent, which is not going to set well with the science crowd in general. So if you're pro-GMO (or at least anti-anti-GMO) the likelihood of you supporting Sanders will be diminished.
      </p>
      <p>
       If all of this is correct, it lends credence to the explanation that the people on your GMO Shill list are just a bunch of people who are really really interested in science and casts doubt on the assumption that they're getting paid by Monsanto to post about GMOs on reddit.

       Scientists are used to looking at and evaluating evidence and then coming to conclusions based off of that evidence. Why would the "science crowd" be anti-GMO when the evidence overwhelmingly is in favor of GMO safety?

       Really interested in science, but spreads misinformation, manipulates the public, and operate similarly to a gang. 3 out of that list may not completely fit the pattern (you being one; I haven't analyzed as much simply because you haven't been in the debate recently), as for the rest, I wonder if you've actually watched how they work.

       Well, for one thing, it isn't like they expected it to be, and for another, they are taking HD pics of it and showing us potato images, some of which are actually Jovian moons. It's round, and appears to have a mountain range, which, if they are right about how mountain ranges are made, should be impossible on Pluto.

       Mountain ranges are not always made with tectonic forces or an active core. Tectonics easily makes mountains, but so do sufficiently large impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, any mountain featured on a dwarf planet would appear larger (more like a 'range') due to the smaller globular sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like why the moon appears bigger near the horizon, it's all relative to perspective.

       My personal opinion is that this system was once occupied by a civilization the secret government is working to discover the secrets of, without disturbing their prison planet paradigm on Earth. How are they going to keep us down on the plantation if we discover our ancestors were a class one civilization; we'd start asking a lot of questions they really don't want to answer, and things could get ugly for them.

       a high-quality image of pluto — there are more at your fingertips if you look it up; no one has been shown an image of a Jovian moon and been told that it was Pluto; and mountains are not considered impossible on Pluto by

       Nobody is falling for anything. I was just interested in theories and observations relative to Pluto.

       Ironically, his last post also mentions Pluto and it seems like most of the times he wanders into /conspiracy is to discuss Nasa, space, or the flat earth theory.

       Not particularly interesting. As
       <a href="/u/kebutankie">
        /u/kebutankie

       pointed out, I gravitate towards flat earth posts on this sub. I'm an aerospace engineer, and seeing people say that my life's work is a hoax is pretty insulting, not to mention fucking stupid.

       If I were him, I'd be careful about posts that claim that there's a galactic conspiracy to hide the existence of Plutonion aliens. You know, the kind of post that sounds straight out of a science fiction comic from the '50s.
