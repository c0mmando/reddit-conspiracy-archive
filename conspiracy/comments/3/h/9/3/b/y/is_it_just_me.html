       Or is there a whole bunch of a-holes who hang around in this sub who don't really seem to be interested in any conspiracy theories? They just hang around and give off incredibly bad energy, while many of them try to shut down thought or discussion on many topics.

       People acting like we all aren't aware of the NIST report....ignoring significant things that are pointed out... Dragging in their friends who also only appear in 911 threads.... Stretching the official story and even their own beliefs to make something implausible totally possible...pretending they see different things in videos that clearly show whatever the topic is at hand.....and classic! Not showing up in posts that stand no chance of debunking or nitpicking.

       I have seen a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of people, on this sub and others, comment about how incredibly racist this place is. The funny thing is, the accusations seem to far outnumber the actual offences. Like the crazy label, it's perception management. It doesn't actually matter whether people are racist here or not, what matters is the
       <em>
        perception
       </em>
       that they are.

       There are people in other subs claiming that everyone in conspiracy is a white supremacist or a racist and that Stormfront "recruits" people here. I have seen these particular comments several times in several other subs, especially the political ones.

       The Stormfront claim is especially prominent, but it's also an interesting example of passive perception management, intentional or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had never heard of Stormfront until last year and the first I heard of it was in a comment about r/conspiracy being a recruitment ground for them. I thought that the word "recruitment" was a bit harsh, but I didn't see anything unusual about r/conspiracy discussing

       </a>
       I assumed that the racism allegations were based on videos that I hadn't seen and therefore avoided linking to their videos. By the time I realised that I was conflating two different names the damage had been done and I was watching their videos looking for traces of white supremacism while ignoring the actual content.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because this is r/conspiracy and some people tend to jump to conclusions, I am not proposing any "conspiracy" here (though it is possible). This is the psychology that makes conspiracy theory so successful.

       I've noticed a huge influx of stormfront type white supremacists. I assume because shit like coontown was shut down. I feel like one of the biggest problems, not just on reddit, is angry racists being aware of the oligarchy through the limited frame of "Dah gov is evil! not the precious free market tho" and hijacking legitimate issues. Probably a lot of them here are shills(mostly the ones that try to equate anti-semitism with anti-zionism) but obvious a lot of them are not.
      </p>

       There's a creeping facism amongst the disenfranchised especially in europe that's pretty distressing

       Yep.  These are our dedicated disruptors.  Losers who come here to shit on the discussions.  Nothing easier to spot that idiots who come here and claim conspiracies don't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The analogy of having certain people constantly sit on the One Direction sub telling users there how shitty One Direction is.  Watching all of their videos, listening to all of their releases, reading all media related to them, then telling the members how stupid they are for liking them.  It's so blatant, it's not even funny.

       I used to feel the same way about the flat-earth threads too, but after making this Pluto thread I had my doubts.
Two of the users came in aggressive and both happened to be active in flat-earth threads despite not believing it at all.

       Then after this in a span of 15 hours, 5 other flat-earth threads came up.

       Certain intellectually dishonest users find it easier to defame people with accusations of racism etc etc than to actually defend their own desire to censor everything that hurts their feelings.

       I'm also "a Holocaust denier" even though I have personally donated photographs my grandfather took during the liberation of a labor camp to the Holocaust museum, and publicly professed my belief in the Holocaust many times.

       Interesting because I've disagreed with things and I've never been called a shill. Usually, a civil and respectful debate follows, unless it's with these type of folks that I mentioned.

       Because you say that you've been called out as a shill before, may I ask a few questions?

       Can I answer that one too?

       It was when I started mentioning gmo, ( did that in small letters to not disturb any trolls. hopefully they won't hear this. ) and can't work out why, when some crops are 94% gm in the US that there would be a bunch of overly defensive people basically defending something that is already well established and probably never leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here's the thing, I still can't work out if they work for or against GM.
They are so defensive that it makes me think there really is something wrong and pushed me towards being anti gm, when it didn't really affect me before, and now I can't work out if that was their goal all along or they must be the worst employees ( shills ) in existence because all their efforts have had the opposite effect of their words.....

       Lol! I know exactly what you mean and it's really bizarre. There is a group of people trying to make us more aware and skeptical, which will push us towards the anti-GMO side. I've definitely thought of that and felt that way too. However, they have been doing it for quite a long time, so it makes me doubt that idea for some reason. I'm leaning towards the worst employees in existence haha. Never know though.

       Too many people here will call out anyone with an opposing view a shill. I think debate should be welcomed and not rejected, and if someone disagrees with a theory they have the right to voice that opinion.

       So from what I understand, you feel that there is never any truth presented here. I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people here are discussing conspiracy theories, do you feel that they are always claiming that as the absolute truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm really trying to understand though is why some people are very aggressive if others do not see the world in the same way as they do? That is if we assume that they are in here for the same reasons that the rest of us are in here for, and that's a tough assumption to make for most of these folks which I am trying to point out in this post. Why does the act of discussion make certain users become so hostile if they are simply normal users?

       If you can't prove which ones are shills how do you know they even exist? Aren't you starting with the

       It isn't an assumption.

       Your argument is the same thing as saying "You are just assuming that the government is spying on you!" which we know is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you are following it up with the argument that you should "just deal with it"... which is the same as telling people that if they have nothing to hide, then they should be fine with the government spying in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, when citizens want to have a discussion with one another without the government sticking their nose in and controlling the conversation, then that should be respected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you like it if you were having a conversation over dinner and some government asshole pulled up a chair and started trying to manipulate what you are talking about?  Because that is fundamentally what is going on here.

       Actually, I was talking specifically about shills on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . Your pointing to JTRIG - which as far as I can tell is about disrupting Islamic terrorist networks on the internet - as proof there are shills on
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       sub is like saying because it's raining where you are it must be raining everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see no evidence whatsoever that any government agency is interested in paying people to argue with conspiracy theorists here. You might have the beginnings of an argument if we were on a pro-Jihad board but
       <em>
        even then
       </em>
       you would have a high evidentiary burden to clear before credibly declaring any one poster a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It remains best to engage with ideas instead of resorting to the reductive and baseless ad hominem of declaring your opponents are government agents sent here to deceive you.

       Once again... you are falling back on the "if you have nothing to hide, then you have nothing to fear" argument.  These folks are not here to have an honest discussion and

        they should not be here in the first place

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental point is that people should not have to question whether their government is dishonestly manipulating their conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are also making the big assumption that everyone here just assumes those who are disagreeable are shills.  I have not seen that to be the case.  When I see most accusations, they come from a long pattern of behavior from that poster... not over single instances of disagreement.

       I've seen plenty of instances where people make a comment along the lines of "oh, the shills got to this thread quickly!" or "don't bother with this guy, I've got him tagged a pro-GMO shill." There are plenty of posters here incapable of recognising there are genuine people out there who have genuine disagreements with conspiracy theories and conspiracists.

       Absolutely.  But where there is smoke, is there fire?  Sometimes yes and sometimes no.  The fact remains that our government and many private corporations dishonestly manipulate what should be organic conversations between private citizens.  This is an issue that should be addressed and not ignored.  It has not served the citizenry well to ignore the spy-state where all of our communications are recorded because "they have nothing to hide".

       I haven't looked at it and won't right now.  Once again, this is the problem... it's the same as agent provocateurs who try to blend in and disrupt...
      </p>
      <p>
       1)  There are some people who are just trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)  There are some people who are true believers of what they are saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  There are some people who actually are shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe instead of ignoring them altogether, it would be a good idea to discuss them and allow the collective to see if they can figure out a way to determine which is which.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think I am saying I can single-handedly figure out which is which, then you haven't been paying attention.  The community, as a collective, should be able to discuss specific users and make that determination.  If shills did not exist and we lived in an honest world, then it would not be an issue.  We, unfortunately, do not live in that world and turning a blind eye to an issue like this whose goal is, mainly, to confuse the public and prevent them from having widespread cohesiveness among them plays right into their hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a microcosm of the "strategy of tension" that powerful people have used for hundreds, even thousands, of years to keep the populace divided and in conflict.

       Well, now that you're aware of it, it should be easy for you to see it. Just keep your eyes and heart open, if you're as innocent as you are trying to make yourself out to be right now.

       Oh, I see it all time! But I have a feeling you and I mean different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm skeptical of a lot of things here. In fact, I only post here when I feel the desire to question something. I get called a shill, insulted for not towing the r/conspiracy line, accused of derailing conversation for not agreeing with people  etc. Judging from this thread and the way you accused another user who I generally see expressing the same type of skepticism, I suspect my initial suspicion may have been accurate.

       Being skeptical and civil is one thing, but completely being an a-hole about it is another. These folks walk into discussions and basically pronounce that those people are idiots just by the act of discussing the topic. Their behavior is rude, arrogant, and egotistical. They change the state of these discussions into a very negative and uninviting one.

       I can see that being an issue. Still, I'd be careful not to confuse someone doubting you with an attack. It happens here alot.

       No this is specifically about people who do not even intend to consider anything opposing their opinion. People latching onto fallacies, personal attacks, and talking in circles....I've talked to people with different opinions in real life...there is a certain respect present and a yearning for knowledge and usually some type of concession/meeting of ideas....and occasionally convincing someone entirely. These people i,tend to disrupt and basically treat us as if we are ignorant of mainstream facts, or flat out stupid.

       Yeah I'm in the same boat, I still read UFO and like minded articles from time to time just in case something interesting comes up but it's pretty much useless overall.

       Lol! I know exactly what you mean and it's really bizarre. There is a group of people trying to make us more aware and skeptical, which will push us towards the anti-GMO side. I've definitely thought of that and felt that way too. However, they have been doing it for quite a long time, so it makes me doubt that idea for some reason. I'm leaning towards the worst employees in existence haha. Never know though.
