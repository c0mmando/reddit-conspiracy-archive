    <div class="md"><p>Completely removing it, is impossible (in 1st world countries). It&#39;s in everything, from the beverages you drink (soda,beer,juice,etc) to the meat you eat (chicken, beef, etc), to your city water. Those animals drink from fluoridated water. Crops are sprayed with fluoridated water. You can limit it (I have, thankfully I have well water), but you cannot completely remove it, unless they stop putting it in the water. That being said, after limiting it, I feel more clear in the head. Shit I see on TV (MSM) is laughable and blatant. I question more these days. But that could&#39;ve been a cumulative effect as I have canceled my TV service (I do not watch TV). This is kind of an impossible question OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not &quot;impossible&quot; , but perhaps more difficult for some than others. </p>

<p>My family and I are on rainwater catchment. Our state doesn&#39;t fluoridate water even if we had access to county water. </p>

<p>We grow almost all of our fruit, coffee, chocolate, veggies and culinary herbs. We&#39;re working on expanding grain production. The things we don&#39;t produce are often traded for the things we do. </p>

<p>We hunt, fish, raise chickens/rabbits and buy beef from friends that raise cattle when we&#39;re unable to hunt the wild cattle. </p>

<p>We live simply and work hard like our great grandparents did. We are healthy, our teeth are healthy and we&#39;ve never considered adding fluoride to our daily routine. </p>

<p>So for some it&#39;s not impossible, it&#39;s a matter of lifestyle choice. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was kinda my point, yes it&#39;s not &quot;impossible&quot; if you live rural, but for someone who doesn&#39;t, it is. Best you can do is limit it, then try to remove it (like you have). The lifestyle, is literally a 180, that we should all be doing, but for most, it&#39;s a monumental task. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This! Came here to say this.</p>

<p>Catchment systems are more practical than ever, and the small level of airborne pathogens contained in the water is readily neutralized with 03 and RO. Some people use neither and are no worse for wear, well, if not near Fukushima.</p>

<p>A pump run from a 20w portapanel is all you need today. It&#39;s clean and fresh and you can even naturally heat and chill it, without a drop of oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>impossible to an absolute extent perhaps; however, your experience is exactly the type of reply I am interested in. thanks! now would you attribute the change directly to limiting your fluoride intake or is it possible aging and continuing to learn about your surroundings could have contributed to the same results? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem! Like I said, I think it&#39;s probably a cumulative effect. We all need to start drinking/eating healthy. Once, you start to do this, everything else will fall into place. I&#39;d consider it a domino effect. Do I think limiting directly lead me on this path? No, but I think once you realize that it&#39;s not healthy/natural, then the seed is planted into living a more informed/healthy lifestyle. </p>

<p>I know a lot of high-level government officials drink Ozarka spring water, which has 0 fluoride. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/government-elections-politics/new-photos-show-bush-administration-reaction-to-911-attacks/">See the pictures here</a>.</p>

<p>You&#39;re an idiot if you drink soda.  Beer is an unnecessary alcoholic beverage.  If you want alcohol that badly buy something else.   And honestly juice won&#39;t have fluoridated water in it unless it&#39;s from concentrate or is otherwise diluted with water.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up on well water, and a lot of homegrown vegetables. Also took fluoride supplements. My teeth are healthy, I think I&#39;m reasonably mentally competent, and my ability to question authority seems fully intact.</p>

<p>I&#39;d be more worried about plastic and its associated chemicals in the food supply, especially as related to heating products with plastic containers or packaging. That one gets way less coverage because it has some actual science behind it, meaning someone might actually have to pay out on some big lawsuit, if people were informed enough to think to sue, anyway. A lot of companies have changed packaging or at the least amended their heating instructions to say to use something other than the package the food comes in.</p>

<p>But like so much nutritional science, who knows? The only parties in the world with the resources necessary to test a lot of this stuff are governments, who really have no interest in telling the rest of the world what they&#39;ve learned given the obvious military applications, every soldier has to eat after all. By the same logic however, if fluoride really was evil, would it make sense (exp in the 40s and 50s) to indiscriminately expose your whole force of future service people to it? What&#39;s the angle on poisoning your own water supply? If it makes people act a certain, perhaps more malleable way, I&#39;d say the day to day chaos of the world around us indicates it&#39;s doing an awful job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped using fluoride for a while because, of course, I found out about the damage it&#39;s reputed to do to the pineal gland.  After a while, however, it felt like I was getting a cavity, so I went to the dentist.  The dentist said that it wasn&#39;t a cavity (thank goodness), but that the non-fluoridated toothpaste that I was using was keeping my teeth from being &quot;remineralized&quot; and was, therefore, making them susceptible to bacteria...even with the regular brushing that I was doing.  I asked what that meant, and they explained that one main thing that keeps teeth from developing cavities is the enamel that teeth have over them.  The sugars in food immediately begin breaking down that enamel, and will quickly make the teeth vulnerable to bacteria - which, once they break through the enamel, will start eating away at your teeth themselves and cause cavities.  The dentist said that fluoride is the one element that&#39;s been found that effectively &quot;remineralizes&quot; the teeth with the protective coat needed to prevent bacteria build up and cavities.</p>

<p>I was pretty bummed when I was told this because, much as I don&#39;t want my pineal gland rotted out, I also don&#39;t want my <em>teeth</em> rotting out either...and cavities can be/are <em>painful</em>.  So I went back to a fluoridated toothpaste, and regret to say that my tooth pain went away.</p>

<p>I am <em>veeeery</em> ambivalent about fluoridated toothpastes.</p>

<p>Using fluoridated toothpaste seems reasonable to me because you don&#39;t have to swallow/ingest it. I&#39;m pretty sure we could all do without flouride in the water though, especially industrial waste fluoride (hexoflourosalisic acid)</p>

I do feel better knowing that stupidity is reversible, though.

So it&#39;s amazing to come out of it and regain your cognition. Also, tactile sensation improves. I&#39;m not totally sure if this improvement is due to less fluoride, fewer BPAs, or less contamination in general (I tend to fast when the dumb gets bad, too, and that likely has an effect).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way to incorporate fluoride into your teeth is to consume it while you are very young. This is actually a stupid thing to do, because fluoridated countries and non fluoridated countries have the same cavity rates. If you are a teenager or older, the fluoride will only leave a 6 nanometer-thick layer of fluorapatite on the surface of your teeth, which is easily scrubbed off by eating, chewing, etc. The fluoride also gets absorbed into your body and affects your thyroid at extremely low levels, so it&#39;s extremely stupid to consume it for a theoretical dental benefit that is controversial. Drinking it will do literally nothing to your teeth if you are old enough to post shit on forums. If anything, use it as a mouthwash if you are convinced it has benefits. </p>

<p>If you want to make your teeth stronger you do it through good nutrition and healthy lifestyle. You need to treat at root cause, applying to surface is just as effective as spraying on the leaves of a plant, thinking it&#39;s going to help. </p>
