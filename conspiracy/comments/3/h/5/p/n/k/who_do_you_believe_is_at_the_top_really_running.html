       Different people with slightly different agendas all agreeing about keeping themselves in control and everyone else working for their sole benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       They fan out the folks they have indoctrinated and trust into every institution on the planet that has influence on a large enough groups opinions and become "advisers".
      </p>
      <p>
       The advisers look for individuals they feel will play ball and sell their morals for personal gain and offer them terms without details.
      </p>
      <p>
       These useful idiots either have done or are willing to do some seriously fucked up shit in order to be protected from exposure and suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything else flows from this simple system of control over authority, experts, and prominent people in the minds of the MASSES.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not one thing. It's fucked up people exploiting the masses inability to do for themselves. Nobody controls anything, there are just very old systems of manipulation and distraction techniques.

       Many different pyramid power structures competing with one another, the common goal is control, money and power. It's a mess as a result. There are no long term end goals in my opinion, nothing realistic anyway, it's mainly about preserving personal wealth, power and as much control as possible. And god knows how many groups, areas, families, governments, MNC's and individuals are all trying to have a go. There probably is some common ground, some transient alliances that pop up when it suits more than one party.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my personal world view anyway, something along those lines.

       Yet there isn't actually a person, not even a group at the top of the pyramid.

       There are
       <em>
        groups
       </em>
       (possibly some on the above list) vying for power. It's this "struggle for power" that leads to wars, crisis, socio-religous revolutions. We, the masses are their pawns, some hoping to be "promoted", while most just trudging along.

       profit is basically to "gain advantage" not necessarily financial, but any sort of "advantage" so yes. We just need to remember that not everything is strictly "financial". More importantly is power, that is the ultimate goal

       Well, could you elaborate? You're just stating something with no explanation or evidence, maybe that's why you're getting downvoted. 
I'm interested in what you said, care to elaborate?

       The Jesuits are the intelligence/spy agency/secret service of the Holy Roman Empire (Vatican). They have been banned from countries throughout the centuries for espionage, treason, coup attempts, etc. They are known as the "Soldiers of Jesus", Jesus is the core of Catholicism and Catholicism says the Pope is the only human intermediary to Christ/God. They (The Jesuits) will do what ever (kill/steal/sabotage/etc) in order to protect the papacy and power of the Holy Roman Empire. Just like the KGB did for the Soviet Union and what the CIA does for the US. Make sense? You should look into the organization and the relationship they have (since the 1500's)  with the Pope/Vatican.

       Even if Lucifer WERE real, I doubt he'd be that dumb.  His end goal would be to simply make sure God never wins.  He knows he can't beat God, so he'll just make it impossible for God to ever get HIS end goal.

       I see your point but I don't think the koch's "run things" as much some others. Sure they can influence politics, but they can't reach an audience like the Vatican can, print money or rig LIBOR. That being said, I don't know for sure what their true influence is and you may be correct.

       At the spiritual level is Satan but he can only do what God allows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Operating below the spiritual level evidence points to Jewish - Masonic conspiracy.  Masonry was founded by the Jewish sorcerer John Dee, and it is related to Judiasm - eg. the goal of Masonry is to rebuilt Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, Masonry is Kabbalah (or Jewish Magic)

       </li>
       <li>
        Faked the holocaust with help of the Allies AND the Soviets
       </li>
       <li>
        Infiltrated the Vatican, replaced the Crucifixion with the Holocaust as the central sacrifice in history

        " The churches, moreover, realize the deadly irony implicit in a Christian plea for the conversion of the Jews; for after Auschwitz and the participation of the nations, it is the Christian world that is in need of conversion."  - Fr. Gregory Baum
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Fr. Gregory Baum was a Judaic (alleged) convert to Catholicism and Catholic priest, assistant to Cardinal Bea and peritus (theological advisor) at the Second Vatican Council, particularly on the three most heretical Vatican II documents, Dignitatis Humanæ, Unitatis Redintegratio and Nostra Aetate.

        Use the holocaust to extort billions of dollars from countries and companies operating in Europe

       Again…not me…but I get that this is what a

        lot
       </em>
       of humans do to
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       other life forms (unfortunately).

       Humans are doing it

       …on
       <em>
        this

       Not in the least.  The Earthly “rulers” - the multinational corporacrats, the .001% bankers, the money changers and creators, etc - are ultimately the gofers of those that truly rule from afar.  Just because the Earthly emissaries of these off-planet rulers are nothing but low level peons in comparison, however, it doesn’t mean that the Earthly ptb still don’t bear a
       <em>
        great
       </em>
       deal of responsibility in terms of the power balance that exists here.  It also doesn’t mean that we the 99% shouldn’t actively fight (peacefully or otherwise) those nefarious machinations used to keep us down and ignorant.

       What would
       <em>
        EEEVER
       </em>
       make you think that I am even implying any such thing?  The OP asked “Who runs things?” not “What should we do about it?”

      <p>
       It seems that the very TOP of the pyramid on this particular planet is not
       <em>
        from
       </em>
       this planet.  That doesn’t mean that humanity shouldn’t do everything it can to evolve, grow, and elevate itself past the servile state we’re generally in.

       I would say that some of you are correct, outwardly some of the groups you are referring to are in control of things by all appearances.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I would say there is a society above them who have technology far in excess of what we think 'state of the art' is, and these people have been around and have had this technology for a long time and that a lot of history as we know it is.. real, but definitely with some camouflage/censorship so as to lead us to believe in some kind of vague timeline of events (which is important, we need a backstory :P). And I would say some of them are acting within the overt groups, providing some guidance/assistance where needed, but mostly just letting things play out and just managing things within the boundaries they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they alien or a different species?  Unlikely.. I think they are genetically compatible with us because.. I think it's just logical that they are.. I'll explain this later, they are probably different in the sense of like.. in a simple way you could say like whites, blacks and asians appear different but are compatible. I don't know if I would just presume them to be genetically perfect and beautiful likes elves.. I think a highly intelligent and well-reasoned person would not really care about their own looks too much.. only caring about their health, longevity and intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they keep us around if their technology and life is perfect?  Well, obviously because they are exactly like us.. they want to enjoy life.. they enjoy stories, art, music and all manner of recreational activities just like we do.. and they watch us, and enjoy us, for all the things we do and create, we are an endless source of entertainment to them.  Maybe there is a bit of plucking of beautiful (they like beautiful people, just their own looks aren't of paramount importance) or intelligent people from the vast hoards of humans.. the more of us there are, more interesting are the things we come up with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ulrimately I think they are benevolent, but we are like barbarians to them, we have brains like theirs and the same ability to understand things if we put our minds to it, but ultimately we are not like them from a cultural standpoint, so they would never reveal themselves to us, because that would just burst the bubble of our reality.  It's likely I think that Atlantis or some such is some reference to them and their society that 'mysteriously vanished'.. but they are still there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol, basically I just made this up but it kinda makes sense to me all the same.  I could ramble on with more ideas and logic about this but yeah, it's already tl;dr.

       Im pretty sure they are the same bloodline as the fallen ones that came down long ago and started breeding with humans. That would make them human yes, but also descendants of those who were kicked out of heaven. I think they were worshipped as gods in ancient times and they are now some of the kings and queens and rulers of present day. And they consult their master on the spirtual level on how to carry out evil in the world. That's just what I think.

       Evil doesn't really exist except as an abstract concept.. sure we like to put a heading of "Evil" and then list all the things we don't like people doing under this heading, and if someone does a whole bunch of these things then they are labeled as being evil.  If people are carrying out evil in the world as you say, then what is the purpose in this evil?  Do they just like being evil?  I think what they do is a form of control, and also to take what they want while ignoring the negative impact it has on people or to intentionally cause the negative impact (evil? or some purpose?).. one might describe that as evil, but I would just say it is selfishness and delusional.  Evil is just a low-level way of describing the things we deem as evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is evil supposed to be anyway.. someone who takes joy in causing as much misery as they can?  I find this difficult to comprehend unless you consider this someone to be delusional or perhaps attempting to act out evil for the sake of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that someone can be taught to carry out evil, but only if they are being rewarded in some way.. and that doesn't really make them evil.. just corrupt, selfish and delusional.

       No, I said they weren't aliens, and the people you are referring to are just part of the overt groups we are aware of.. the people I'm referring to are completely hidden from us and have no names or culture that we can determine without simply guessing.

       lol. i have no control over monetary suppy or any other economic valves per se, im not even a zionist but i can say that many zionists are hardcore racists and view every who isnt a jew as subhuman, only worth of performing labor for them. i like white people (im prob about 80% white to be honest) but view many other races as worthless, subhuman, etc ..but i do not wish to kill them off..id rather just not even acknowledge their existance.

       The top of the pyramid is where the blood of the pyramid, money, is made. They have leaders. Their goal is upward concentration of power to rule over all minds and things of the planet as ultimate global slave masters. The end goal has for the most part been achieved, nobody bats an eye at feeding these fucks their sweat and blood for slavery is always presented in the form of an opportunity, so it's consolidation now. Internet was a requirement of the plan, to reach all minds and things, but is proving to be a problem as minds are understanding their condition with it, it might ruin the plan ultimately, but it's a requirement, so they can't really ditch the network.

       The whole idea is to convince the public we need government. In particular, the governments we have. Any notion that we should reset, flip the board, start over, etc, will be decried as irresponsible/anarchy/chaos/and so on.

       The reality is voting is not going to save us at this pointy. We need a global awakening to the reality of these facts. The wealthy oligarchs set the stage over a century ago (via the Federal Reserve Act). Once everone understands the game is rigged in the rich's favor and we'll never truly be free, we can progress.

       There is no one person or even group at the top. The world we live in is a twisting winding network of of companies and business. They all manipulate the the system in different ways to get what they want. When they do this they each effect the world in ways not even they could see in the long run. In the end it would be nice if there was a big bad guy to point at but, the world is way more complicated then that and some groups and people make decisions that they might even thing are good ones that can effect a lot of people in different ways. The end goal for all these people is more power and money that part is simple.

       Evil spirits. As for their end goal, who knows? Probably to hurt as many people as possible, and by proxy, to hurt God. I've heard the goal is to kill off about 90% of the population and corral the rest into super-cities, where they'll be coerced into worship of said spirits. I suppose we'll find out soon enough.

       I think that it is quite clear that the UK is and has been running things for quite some time. But there are various groups in various places with various amounts of power. There is not just one powerful group in the world or the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best evidence of the power of the UK is that they got the US to fight the Cold War against the USSR after WW2. USSR poised no threat to the US but loss of Western Europe to Communism would have put stress on the Rich of the UK.

       Noone. The world we live is just an end result of the average man's greed and hunger for power. The reason why we think that there is a priviledged group in power is that the group we see rarely changes, but again - they are a result of the way that wealth circulates around the world, not the ones who set up the system or planned for being where they are.
