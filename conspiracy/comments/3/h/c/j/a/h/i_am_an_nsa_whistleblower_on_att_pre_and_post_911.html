       My name is xxxx and I was employed by ATT Broadband from 01/2001 to 09/2003 before leaving for another position. I believe I have info that may provide userful to defenders of our electronic freedoms. Prior to 9/11, I was tasked with receiving subpoenas, court orders and title 3 and title 50 wiretapping. During and post 9/11, I was no longer allowed to see subpoenas but process over 1,000 FISA orders (which I was not cleared to view) that involved providing Name, Address and Location. No info was given other than a name on a spreadsheet and I was instructed by our legal council to get as much CNA (customer, name, address) on every one. I have other members of my team that were instructed to do the same.
I write to you this now as a supporter of EFF and finally realizing how dangerous what I did was to our freedom.
I was employed at the headquarters in Englewood, CO in their Legal Demands Center (now Comcast in Cherry Hill, NJ after merger). I cannot say with certainty that any ECPA laws were broken, but I can say with some certainty that scruity was not placed on proper legal process. I am wondering if this information can help in anyway. I have names of SA out of Quanitico, VP and Directors I worked for under the Legal Demands Department and several witnesses who are willing to speak up. Please let me know if this help in our fight for protecting our rights from govt intrusion

       Thanks. TBH, Im not too afraid of pushback.  I wasn't high enough up the corp chain to know what was going on back then, and as dumb as it sounds, If the NSA knows who I am, I'm not too worried.  I reached out to Glenn, ACLU Colorado, EFF and a few other bloggers.  Thanks for the help.

       Yeah, since Im no Snowden and didn't think enough to actually capture data, my credibility is low.  Several of us have been watching the ATT involvement and I finally said fuck it, I'll say what I know to the people still fighting privacy.  Many are willing to share what they know.  I have nothing to lose and only hope something will change.  But, I have plenty of proof.  Including an award I got signed by the FBI director for launching the first cable modem intercept on ATT Broadband

       Notice the hero worship.  Notice the randos leading to Greenwald and Watson.  Notice the idiocy involved in posting something like this in the digital age to a public forum.

      <p>
       Notice the ad campaign for mainstream controlled oppo news outlets, notice the honeypot trap laid out before you, notice the waste of your time.  Now ask yourself, are these people serious?  Notice a similar incident on 4chan today.

       Well, I guess the recent news from this weekend regarding the relationship with the NSA and ATT made me feel complied to speak up.  I've often wondered how I'd even go about reporting something this so...thats why I'm tell my side of events now.  As far as the link...I have no interest in clickbait, etc.  Sorry if its a bad source but google NSA ATT

       make sure you create 3-5 SD-Card copies that you spread out on different hidden locations so if you go down, you physical stuff gets seized, you can still send message from prison/abroad where you hid them or hope someone finds them at least some of it in electronic form. This is what most whistleblowers always fail to do, they don't keep secret copies so when they raid the house it's all over.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't have anything, just record yourself for 1 hour or 30 mins and list key info and references and get a few  smallest of SD cards you can find, for example 4 GBs, if the video or all data is like 350 Megabytes large then make 12 copies to fill out all the free space on each SD card which would help for redundancy incase of damage, but NAND flash is a bit weaker in this, a DVD would beneift a lot from this trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would stay away from mainstreams of any kind and other fake alternatives but this takes way more familiarity on this subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Greenwald is shaky around the experts, he's releasing trinkles and still has gigabytes of unreleased stuff that will take, what 50 years on this pace to release it all out, give me a break, and he was dealing with the bosses of paypal and it's all weird so.

       You have a lot of suspicious organizations like this, and it's just going to increase as the new world order increases their warmachine.

      <p>
       not all are to be trusted on Cryptome's PDF, for example ProPublica is an operative and funded by Soros/Ford, so even big stuff
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of disconnect and knowledge/awareness to varying degrees, so some orgs/groups know this or that better but nothing on there, or vice versa and combinations and a lot of them also get to a level point then they sluggish out and are stuck on that level for many many years and never expand their awareness/understanding, they aren't taking the issues seriously enough to be their main thing to do in life.

       Nobody is saying kidnapping.  I'm personally suggesting you might well be fired from your current job and blacklisted from similar jobs.  It's relatively simple given at will employment.  It's not kidnapping, but if you have no savings and no other job skills and especially if you have a family, that's serious business.

       I hate to be the bearer of bad news,  but it's probably too little,  too late.  We are now way passed the point of illegally collecting 1,000 names,  way far beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
       I admire your apparent epiphany on the damage being done to our liberties,  I do. But Especially if the data is that old,  I'm not really sure that anyone will truly care if you dumped it right here and right now to be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm interested in seeing is if there are any names on that list who went on to commit acts of terror.  If there are,  it proves that the NSA knew of terrorists and did nothing to stop them.

       i would assume the list was specific to ATT as all the names that we searched hit customer records. my speculation is that someone, possibly part of the Legal Demands department was asked to gather a list of common arabic names, then have the grunts compile it into one massive spreadsheet. Once all the data was pulled, we burned it to a CD and handed it off to the Director. I have no clue where it went after.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer why I never said anything sooner? Think back to the days following 9/11. everyone was in a panic. I never really questioned the legality of it since the prior 9 months we were extremely vigilant in what and how,we released data, chain of custody, etc.  I had one FISA order pre-9/11 but was never given govt clearance to review the order, so in these situations I'd usually get a tap on the shoulder to capture the info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, hindsight is 20/20. After leaving the field and watching all the backscratching articles getting released, I figured id ask this groups thoughts. I appreciate the input. i find odd people would question this is some hoax. It really isnt that fantastical story nor one that is seeking hero worship. i came to this group wondering if it's even worth providing at point.

       I can't recall exact dates but within a few days of 9/11 I was tasked with basically pulling every name, account number, IP (and email I believe).  My list included about 1k names, and I know at least a few more were handed out.  I did question the legal backing (newb at the time and curious in general) and was told by my Director this data could be collected under the "Request to Maintain" records provision in the ECPA.  This was all new and scary at the time so we just followed orders.

       Out of curiosity ... did these names seem overtly Arab to you? Like were there a lot of "Muhammads"?

       all arabic. i realized there were several names that appeared in various parts of the US (more common names) I questioned the validity / legality of the order as most single subpoenas get push back from the courts if wrote something generic.  Were not going to release any every Bob Smith unless we had some unique to ID (address, account number, IP).

       right now called privacy is dead.  I strongly suggest you watch it and take some good notes.  Depends on what you actually have, but a sufficiently motivated person can find you no matter what you do.  I think you should mentally and physically prepare for that.  I don't think they'll do anything physical to you, but I do think you'll be found out and probably fired and potentially blacklisted from similar jobs.  If you don't have enough savings to weather long term unemployment, and you have a family, make sure that you've got that shit handled before you contact anyone.  If you don't have skills that you can use in a completely different line of work, get that.

       Nope.  I left IT after the bust and probably after my 20,000 DMCA complaint :) =  The thing is, I was never "legal", I was ATT Broadbands main man for helping set up T1s (2001) to Quantico and ran a script that watched for IP changes and would inform the SA working the case they needed to stop collecting data.  I later went and changed their DHCP settings to remain static.....Gotta make life easier when ya can :)

       Sorry making light of a dark situation, if someone doesn't know that the government is not for us, they should research the Rothschild family, commonly spoke of as the illuminati. The puppeteer of our entire government. Now it's not just them there is 13 other family's in partner with them but they are the head of the snake.

       Is there something about what happened concerning you? I could care less if you believe me or not.  My story is far from glamorous.  I came to a source that could help me get in touch w people who might be interested in a small piece.  Does my situation seemed far fetched?  Do you want to quiz me on Title 3 / 50, pen registers?  HR number to confirm my position? I want to make sure this random dude on conspiracies concerns of me making this up are covered /s

       Carlos, you sound like a child telling everybody you're a secret agent. If you were in the position you claim, you would have absolutely no reason for posting on Reddit. You have no evidence to support your claims.
You have the spelling of a five year old and the demeanour of a four year old, and frankly; I take your statements just about as seriously as I do the homeless guy's on my train who thinks the NSA are warlocks from the 5th dimension who want to harvest our semen. How's the blanket for coming along?

       sorry my phone types like hell, Manuel.  im not overly concerned with my grammatical errors. I do admit, its funny to think this guy believes I'm try to make up some story for glory or hero worship.  all in all, its pretty mundane in my opinion.  thanks to the rest of the group for help.
