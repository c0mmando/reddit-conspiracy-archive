    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve flown around the world over the course of a few months. From the east coast of the US, to the west coast, to Hawaii, to Australia, to India, to London, and then back home. If the Earth is flat, how did I manage to go in a circle, all the way around?  How is it that satellites (that you can track from home) disappear on one side of the sky and then reappear on the other side of the sky in about 90 minutes? If you think the Earth is flat then you are a fucking retard. You can disprove it with your own two eyes. If you&#39;re in an airplane you can see the curvature of the Earth beneath you. Come on, people. </p>

I would be willing to bet that neither you nor anyone on those forums has a degree in science from an accredited school.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, i know, im super late to the game here however, i just had to reply to slightly remedy one part of this convo.</p>

<p>Yes, its the &#39;dark side&#39; which faces away from us. That side is very illuminated whenever the moon is in its new moon phases (cuz the suns light is not on the face facing us but rather the &#39;back&#39;.)</p>

<p>This camera/satelight, is way out from earth in the direction of the sun, looking back at us with the sun on its back. Thats how the dark site is &#39;lit&#39; when its looking at it. However, im SO with you, this looks super super photo shopped and not a very good job of it at all haha</p>

<p>However, this is because this is in NO WAY a true photo. in the true photo, we wouldnt be able to see the earth/moon combo, far too much light would be reflecting off the moon back at the camera, in the same way that you cant get a good photo when there is a bright light near the object your photographing, this camera has to parse out the light being reflected by the moon. Thus, yes they &#39;edited&#39; this photo so that we could see it as a cool new angle of the moon transiting the earth. it looks weird just so the colors are similar to what they actually are.</p>

<p>I also questioned this the day that article cameout, it does look odd, but thats because its ligt and color corrected for us.</p>

<p>Also, the reason it looks like the moon is going out to the right rather than orbiting, is simply because of scale. The distance between earth and moon is quite vast, so from this angle with the moon looking that large, it would have to go quite a bit out of the shot before it circled back around!</p>

<p>Also, as a side note, if the elites were REALLY trying to hide flat earth theory, done you think they would do a far better job of photoshopping the photo? My brother whos a designer def could, so that just speaks to me as further evidence that they were simply editing for necessity.</p>

<p>If youve read this far, i am very happy :) just trying to spread some info i got when i questioned this as well. Cheers</p>

<p>Look at the fourth image.  Compare the ratio of the size of North America to the sphere in that image to the other photos, especially the 5th and 6th(which is the one they gave us most recently).  If you want to actually look you can find many other problems like this.  If you don&#39;t want to look, you will not see them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The image with the seemingly huge North America is an explainable optical illusion. We&#39;re used to seeing images of the earth from a straight &quot;side-on&quot; view. This image, however, is taken &quot;from above,&quot; as it were. From that view, America appears to be at the center of the projected disk, and other continents appear stretched. In addition, the cloud cover makes it hard to find spacial context. If you don&#39;t believe me, open Google Earth. I guarantee that you can recreate that image by zooming in just right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things.</p>

<p>First off, the image you&#39;re referring to <em>is</em> a composite. Your whitehouse.gov link actually gets it wrong (which is honestly pretty surprising — I would&#39;ve expected their fact-checkers to be better than that), but <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2159.html">NASA clarifies that it is, indeed, a composite</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, the reason the photo looks so weird is because the satellite that took it is in low-earth orbit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomi_NPP">around 517 miles in altitude</a>. The satellites that take full-earth images, like the clip of the moon orbiting the earth, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory">are almost a million miles away</a>, or even further — <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Earth_and_Moon_from_Mars_PIA04531.jpg">here&#39;s a photo of earth from <em>Mars</em></a>. And when you&#39;re in low earth orbit, whatever you&#39;re currently flying over looks huge. Seriously, take a look at the <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload">ISS high definition livestream</a>: low earth orbit is . . . pretty damn low, so you really only see what&#39;s right below you. And when you digitally compile that into a composite, <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-blue-marble-photos-show-a-changing-earth.t6616/">you get what amounts to a fish-eye distortion</a>. </p>

<p>The shape of the global universe can be broken into three categories:[1]</p>

<li>Finite or infinite

<li>Connectivity, how the universe is put together, i.e., simply connected space or multiply connected.</li>

<p>Well, if from Earth you hypothetically travelled forever in one set direction, nobody knows what would happen, really. It could be that the universe is like the Earth, so that you can only escape it through certain dimensions and not others. It could also be nothing like the Earth and you might be able to simply travel forever into the void. In fact, since the expansion of space is accelerating, if you want to get back to your starting position without turning even in theory, you would need to be accelerating faster than space at the time you finally reached the edge of space, otherwise you literally would travel forever in the same direction without ever reaching your starting point again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;By removing Earth from the motionless center of the Universe, these Masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the Earth is the center of the Universe, then the ideas of God, creation, and a purpose for human existence are resplendent. But if the Earth is just one of billions of planets revolving around billions of stars in billions of galaxies, then the ideas of God, creation, and a specific purpose for Earth and human existence become highly implausible.</p>

<p>By surreptitiously indoctrinating us into their scientific materialist Sun-worship, not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism. If there is no God, and everyone is just an accident, then all that really matters is me, me, me. They have turned Madonna, the Mother of God, into a material girl living in a material world. Their rich, powerful corporations with slick Sun-cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly believe their “science,” vote for their politicians, buy their products, listen to their music, and watch their movies, sacrificing our souls at the altar of materialism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now, we haven&#39;t had any posts claiming the earth is flat over the past couple weeks but we&#39;ve certainly been getting a lot of these posts wanting the flat earthers to come and make their claims, even after being rejected by the vast majority of users here.</p>

<p>Anybody else think this is just a part of the pattern to keep flat earth discussions in this sub to make it look bad?</p>

<p>You want to find the biggest elephant in the room that this community could shine light on?  Look in corporate/rich person campaign finance.  But no, we get 9/11 truths and people convince Sandy hook was an inside job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I&#39;ve written about flat earth a lot recently. It is absolutely a distraction. You will not find supporters of the theory in the wild: Only when you challenge it will they come out in numbers to downvote. They&#39;ll ban anyone from their sub who doesn&#39;t agree. They&#39;re professional trolls.</p>
