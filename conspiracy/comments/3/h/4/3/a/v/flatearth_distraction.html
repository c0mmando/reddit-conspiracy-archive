       I can't bring myself to dig into the flat-earth theories.  I don't see a purpose in it.  Either way, I just don't see how it would effect any of our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I strongly believe in learning and understanding all that I can.  I just can't wrap my head around why anyone would go to the lengths that they have to hide something like this, or why it would matter.

       I've flown around the world over the course of a few months. From the east coast of the US, to the west coast, to Hawaii, to Australia, to India, to London, and then back home. If the Earth is flat, how did I manage to go in a circle, all the way around?  How is it that satellites (that you can track from home) disappear on one side of the sky and then reappear on the other side of the sky in about 90 minutes? If you think the Earth is flat then you are a fucking retard. You can disprove it with your own two eyes. If you're in an airplane you can see the curvature of the Earth beneath you. Come on, people.

       Spheroid Earth was posited centuries before nations like the U.S., Russia, India, France, et al. developed space programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for Flat Earth to be true, implicit collusion from governments, scientists, mathematicians,  geologists, map makers, ship crews, etc. over centuries would have happened despite world wars, border changes, government collapses, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the very nature of Flat Earth theories defy Occam's Razor and reality.

       Many people who understand the history of the occult and various secret societies already know that all of those things happen regularly, because scientists and presidents and dictators are all people who are all capable of lying.  Claiming the Earth is a nearly perfect sphere is a big claim that imo requires big evidence, which has certainly not been met, at least in my eyes, by fake NASA pictures or fisheye lenses.  Is saying that everything is completely random really the simplest and best explanation?

       In the ocean anyway, things disappear from the bottom because the surface of the water is always licking upwards (waves) to distort the light we see, and as things reach the terminus of our field of vision, the bottom parts fade first because these are the parts that the little waves are reaching up and interrupting.  Sorry if that language is a little weird - there is a thread dedicated to this on the ifers forums as well -

       After ships "disappear" in this way "over" the horizon, you can also zoom in with a telescope or binoculars and see them again until they pass far enough away into obscurity.

       Sorry if you think I'm using my own magical version of science, I'm not sure how you got that impression.  Here is a link to the ifers model explanation where the difference in stars in northern / southern "hemisphere" star / skies can be found, though the link was available from my last post as well.

       . . . or anything on any of your links is based in real physics — physics that can be mathematically described. I would be willing to bet that neither you nor anyone on those forums has a degree in science from an accredited school. I honestly don't mean that as an insult, and I'm sorry that it sounds assholish. I mean it as an explanation, à la Dunning-Kruger.

       i would think it wouldn't look so fake and photoshopped?  for one, the shadowing seems very wrong to me, shouldn't the earth be dark or something?  and why does the moon look like it's hurling into outer space at the end of the video instead of orbiting the earth?

       The Sun isn't directly behind the camera, it's off to the side so the moon isn't casting a shadow on the earth. It's a very small field of view and the moon orbits very far from the earth, you wouldn't be able to see it circle in this shot.

       The photo is real and can be easily explained. If you don't like it, go ahead and tell yourself that it's fake. It's certainly a lot easier than educating yourself.

       The dark side is the far side of the moon. It's the side of the moon we don't  see because the moon is tidally  locked with the earth. The dark side of the moon recives sunlight it is "dark" because we can't see it from earth.

       Ok, i know, im super late to the game here however, i just had to reply to slightly remedy one part of this convo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, its the 'dark side' which faces away from us. That side is very illuminated whenever the moon is in its new moon phases (cuz the suns light is not on the face facing us but rather the 'back'.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This camera/satelight, is way out from earth in the direction of the sun, looking back at us with the sun on its back. Thats how the dark site is 'lit' when its looking at it. However, im SO with you, this looks super super photo shopped and not a very good job of it at all haha
      </p>
      <p>
       However, this is because this is in NO WAY a true photo. in the true photo, we wouldnt be able to see the earth/moon combo, far too much light would be reflecting off the moon back at the camera, in the same way that you cant get a good photo when there is a bright light near the object your photographing, this camera has to parse out the light being reflected by the moon. Thus, yes they 'edited' this photo so that we could see it as a cool new angle of the moon transiting the earth. it looks weird just so the colors are similar to what they actually are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also questioned this the day that article cameout, it does look odd, but thats because its ligt and color corrected for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the reason it looks like the moon is going out to the right rather than orbiting, is simply because of scale. The distance between earth and moon is quite vast, so from this angle with the moon looking that large, it would have to go quite a bit out of the shot before it circled back around!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as a side note, if the elites were REALLY trying to hide flat earth theory, done you think they would do a far better job of photoshopping the photo? My brother whos a designer def could, so that just speaks to me as further evidence that they were simply editing for necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If youve read this far, i am very happy :) just trying to spread some info i got when i questioned this as well. Cheers

       You are right, we don't know what it should look like because we are unable to take photos from that position ourselves.  We can however point out contradictions in what they give us.

       Look at the fourth image.  Compare the ratio of the size of North America to the sphere in that image to the other photos, especially the 5th and 6th(which is the one they gave us most recently).  If you want to actually look you can find many other problems like this.  If you don't want to look, you will not see them.

       The image with the seemingly huge North America is an explainable optical illusion. We're used to seeing images of the earth from a straight "side-on" view. This image, however, is taken "from above," as it were. From that view, America appears to be at the center of the projected disk, and other continents appear stretched. In addition, the cloud cover makes it hard to find spacial context. If you don't believe me, open Google Earth. I guarantee that you can recreate that image by zooming in just right.

       That is some incredible mental gymnastics you are performing there.  Take a look again.  See how in the 4th and 5th image Cental America is close to the middle of the image.  Your explanation is not even close to working no matter how much you would like it to.

       Two things.

       First off, the image you're referring to
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a composite. Your whitehouse.gov link actually gets it wrong (which is honestly pretty surprising — I would've expected their fact-checkers to be better than that), but
       <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2159.html">

       Secondly, the reason the photo looks so weird is because the satellite that took it is in low-earth orbit,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomi_NPP">
        around 517 miles in altitude
       </a>
       . The satellites that take full-earth images, like the clip of the moon orbiting the earth,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory">
        are almost a million miles away
       </a>
       , or even further —
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Earth_and_Moon_from_Mars_PIA04531.jpg">
        here's a photo of earth from
        <em>
         Mars
        </em>
       </a>
       . And when you're in low earth orbit, whatever you're currently flying over looks huge. Seriously, take a look at the
       <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/iss-hdev-payload">
        ISS high definition livestream
       </a>
       : low earth orbit is . . . pretty damn low, so you really only see what's right below you. And when you digitally compile that into a composite,
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/debunked-blue-marble-photos-show-a-changing-earth.t6616/">
        you get what amounts to a fish-eye distortion

       If you measure the pixel distance in mspaint or Photoshop of the official NASA photos of earth from space, like the famous one from Apollo 17, it will confirm what your eyes tell you, which is that it's a nearly perfect sphere - the alleged bulge is like 10 miles or so iirc which is not very detectable on a ball with a radius of just under 4000

        Thus the universe was known to be flat to within about 15% accuracy prior to the WMAP results. WMAP has confirmed this result with very high accuracy and precision. We now know (as of 2013) that the universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error.

      <p>
       The shape of the global universe can be broken into three categories:[1]
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Finite or infinite
        <strong>
         - Flat (no curvature)
        </strong>
        , open (negative curvature) or closed (positive curvature)
       </li>
       <li>
        Connectivity, how the universe is put together, i.e., simply connected space or multiply connected.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Do you see where they explain that Flat equates to no curvature?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there is:
       <strong>
        In a universe with zero curvature, the local geometry is flat. The most obvious global structure is that of Euclidean space, which is infinite in extent.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, where did make an appeal to authority? Because asking you to educate yourself on basic cosmology when you are trying to argue it isn't close to being a logical fallacy.

       Well, if from Earth you hypothetically travelled forever in one set direction, nobody knows what would happen, really. It could be that the universe is like the Earth, so that you can only escape it through certain dimensions and not others. It could also be nothing like the Earth and you might be able to simply travel forever into the void. In fact, since the expansion of space is accelerating, if you want to get back to your starting position without turning even in theory, you would need to be accelerating faster than space at the time you finally reached the edge of space, otherwise you literally would travel forever in the same direction without ever reaching your starting point again.

       Well, this is where it gets interesting, because reality becomes a matter of perspective. As far as you are concerned your head isn't flat, but if you were outside the universe looking back into it then it would be flat.

       Why would it matter? Just think of all the resources we spend on space exploration/research. All that money could go towards actually making this world a better place to live. If the flat earth conspiracy is true then what are they doing with all those resources we spend on space?

       I completely agree. It's amazing to see those stuck in their ideology defend the Flat Earth because of a book written by man over a thousand years ago. Open your mind!

       By the way, I'd be careful call the religious believers "shills", as they could target you for harassment and down vote brigades as I've seen in the past.

       This is an interesting video which looks at facts about positions of celestial bodies (the moon), instead of the religious theme. I am still not convinced our planet is flat; however, this does force me to reconsider what "I know".

       Me too. I don't necessarily believe the earth is flat, but I have looked into why those who believe it think that way and there is some interesting info out there. Then again, there is Hollow Earth theory too- who the hell knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it disinfo? Maybe, but a lot of stuff could be disinfo- doesn't mean I'm not going to look into it for myself. I find it fun to think about these things. I feel like some people feel super threatened by it.

       "By removing Earth from the motionless center of the Universe, these Masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the Earth is the center of the Universe, then the ideas of God, creation, and a purpose for human existence are resplendent. But if the Earth is just one of billions of planets revolving around billions of stars in billions of galaxies, then the ideas of God, creation, and a specific purpose for Earth and human existence become highly implausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       By surreptitiously indoctrinating us into their scientific materialist Sun-worship, not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism. If there is no God, and everyone is just an accident, then all that really matters is me, me, me. They have turned Madonna, the Mother of God, into a material girl living in a material world. Their rich, powerful corporations with slick Sun-cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly believe their “science,” vote for their politicians, buy their products, listen to their music, and watch their movies, sacrificing our souls at the altar of materialism."

       I get what you are saying, but don't you think it odd that "flat earth" has become synonymous with retarded, when it isn't something you can see for yourself??

       You have to rely on "experts" to believe in the ball earth, who may or may not be correct.

       I described it with some artistic license and then linked a back up that describes it better.  I dunno why you're attempting to discredit me or paint my sources as unreliable, but you will have better luck convincing other people if you refute my points instead of insulting me.

       This is a place of discussion, not an activist platform.

       If I want to talk about little green men and flat earth then this is the place.  r/activism is for activism.
