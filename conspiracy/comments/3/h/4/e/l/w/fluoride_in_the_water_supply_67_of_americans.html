       can someone please calm me down? if this has been going on for decades, that means that an entire country has not only had their third eye suppressed through media and government drug laws, but LITERALLY BY CHEMICAL MEANS. i am extremely agitated. how is the government not pure evil? this is evil. because of this, im vastly more inclined to believe David Icke's reptilian theory.

       This is true, the gov't openly admit to having fluoride in the water supply and claim it makes our teeth "healthy".
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people don't understand the power of the Pineal Gland, which is why no one talks about this. A lot of people say it's only pseudoscience and will say that it is insignificant. My suggestion would be to find water that doesn't have fluoride and stick with it, as well as opening your Pineal Gland.

       There is no credible evidence that fluoridated water has ever prevented a single dental cavity. Here's some quotes from the 2015 Cochrane review of artificial water fluoridation. 
p 2 "A total of 155 studies met the inclusion criteria; 107 studies provided sufficient data for quantitative synthesis."
p 2 "There is insufficient information to determine whether initiation of a water fluoridation programme results in a change in disparities in caries across socioeconomic status (SES) levels.
There is insufficient information to determine the effect of stopping water fluoridation programmes on caries levels.
No studies that aimed to determine the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults met the review's inclusion criteria."
p 3 "Researchers from the Cochrane Oral Health Group reviewed the evidence - up to 19 February 2015 - for the effect of water fluoridation. They identified 155 studies in which children receiving fluoridated water (either natural or artificial) were compared with those receiving water with very low or no fluoride. Twenty studies examined tooth decay, most of which (71%) were conducted prior to 1975. A further 135 studies examined dental fluorosis."
p 14 "Five studies were funded by research grants from research organisations, health authorities and government organisations, one study was funded in collaboration with members of the committee pro-fluoridation, while the other studies [on caries] did not state their funding sources."
p 17 "We judged that all the 20 studies included for the caries outcome (including disparities in caries) were at high risk of bias overall."
p 17 "We found all studies to be at high risk of bias for confounding. We considered confounding factors for this outcome to be sugar consumption/dietary habits, SES, ethnicity and the use of other fluoride sources."
p 28 "Whilst these [fluoridated] areas tend to have low to very low DMFT, there are many other parts of the world where fluoridated water is not widespread that also have low caries levels. Equally, there are areas with relatively high distribution of water fluoridation and moderate caries levels (e.g. Brazil)."
p 30 "The quality of the evidence, when GRADE criteria are applied, is judged to be low."

       Fluoride is not an element required for the body to function. It is not a required component of any process or tissue. It does accumulate in the bones and cause deformation of the teeth and bones. Type skeletal fluorosis and dental fluorosis into Google images and see for yourself. In smaller amounts it can cause arthritis and other problems. Why would one think that something that causes problems in small and large doses, that bioaccumulates, that is completely unnecessary for biology, is something beneficial for one's health?
      </p>
      <p>
       The studies that support water fluoridation are dubious and very old. Yet, there are many studies new and old that suggest harmful effects. The history of fluoride in industry has even demonstrated those effects. Before they scrubbed the waste with water, they vented it and the local area was affected by it. Cattle and people were exposed and visible bone deformations resulted.

       Authority empowered with some of the best propagandists in history has brought us to this place. It's amazing the contortions of cognition we will do in order to align our perceptions with the claims of authority. We don't want to believe our protectors would hurt us for self serving advantages, but they do regularly.

       Skeletal fluorosis is something that only happens with excessive exposure to fluoride (mainly people that work in the mining industry) or people drinking from water wells in India/China which have insane levels of fluoride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Burning coal indoor is also a cause. You're not getting Skeletal fluorosis from drinking water in the US, ever.

      <p>
       I can find no credible information on fluoride causing arthritis, if you can provide citation on that I'd like to see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you also please provide these new studies that say fluoride is harmful, and before you do so please be aware if you link a single Chinese IQ fluoride study I'm going to pick it apart so don't waste your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride is also naturally occurring in most water supplies which means humans have evolved ingesting fluoride, it's found in most water supplies in fairly high levels.

       Close.  But I have heard a sensible explanation as to why drinking it
       <em>
        does have an effect

       on our dental health, which ends up being topical anyway...

       Heres a section of my answer which should appear somewhere else in this thread.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The evidence is slowly coming out that researchers and dentists falsely read into the esteemed benefits of fluoride, especially that of digestion, where their thesis is that swallowed fluoride enters the bloodstream from the stomach (like most things we drink and eat) and is found mixed with the saliva produced by your salivary glands. The saliva acts as a continual dosage to the teeth in your mouth. Reasonable. But what else is getting a continual dosage?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you read my entire answer though, it'll be clear I am certainly not in support of forcefully medicating our tap water with fluoridation (which as you outline, surfaces in many unexpected places with an abnormally high dose)

       Please read my entire answer first since you are not making sense from my point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it needed clarification, it's easy to verify the researcher's claim that saliva will have an increased concentration of fluoride due to us being forcefully medicated with it,
       <strong>
        which is topically and constantly applied to our teeth.
       </strong>
       But I really would appreciate you commenting on my full answer in this thread btw.

       Where's my disinfo?  Or did you really just read me wrong?  (You might have missed "

       Moreover, who gives an absolute god damn about keeping healthy teeth through the water supply? People should be brushing anyway. It's absolutely stupid to believe that the government gives two shits about your teeth. Why would they? They don't care about poverty or wage inequality.

       Many necessary long term studies about the effects of chemicals on the human body are difficult to achieve for many reasons. One danger is that greedy corporations must sell their product now, or must implement their poorly designed, poorly and short-term tested drugs, products, snake oil. After all, we only live 80 years. If the human race really cared about each and everyone's genetic future (which is sadly not the case) then we'd perform long term (lifetime+) studies before dosing over 70% of an entire country, in the case of fluoride. The evidence is slowly coming out that researchers and dentists falsely read into the esteemed benefits of fluoride, especially that of digestion, where their thesis is that swallowed fluoride enters the bloodstream from the stomach (like most things we drink and eat) and is found mixed with the saliva produced by your salivary glands. The saliva acts as a continual dosage to the teeth in your mouth. Reasonable. But what else is getting a continual dosage?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is one wrong to say that digestion of fluoride is unnecessary and potentially dangerous to control a population's dosage? At the minimum, long term studies must be taken seriously. In the meantime, I'll confess that optional topical application through toothpaste both coats the the tooth with fluoride and partially absorbs through the gums (I pray no child swallows the toothpaste,) which has shown to have minor (believe it or not, some researchers even suggest no effect) benefits to enamel health and tooth cavity reduction. My main concern is certainly with unmonitored, negligent amounts of fluoride accumulating within our bones, organs, brains (and brain glands, which is where some will mention the pineal gland) and cells. Some of it is just not excreted when digested/drank. I'll prove it with some papers which requires a slight connecting of a few dots to get across the point that long term fluoride absorption is something to truly think and worry about.

       <p>
        Abstract: The dietary intake of fluoride and the fluoride excretions in urine and stool were determined under controlled conditions in man. Fluoride balance studies have shown that the urinary fluoride corresponds to 50–60% of the intake, the fecal fluoride was very low, corresponding to 6% of the intake, and approximately 1 mg fluoride was retained per day during an average fluoride intake of 4.3 mg/day. The fluoride intake depended on the amount of fluoridated water consumed. The dietary fluoride content ranged from 1.2 to 1.5 mg/day. During the intake of supplemental fluoride the fluroide excretions increased but the ratio of the urinary/fecal fluoride was similar. Added fluoride is well retained. Following its discontinuation, very small amounts of the retained fluoride are excreted for several days. Inorganic elements, such as calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, which have been shown to decrease the intestinal absorption of fluoride in animals were ineffective in man, while aluminum, given as aluminum-containing antacids, markedly decreased the intestinal absorption of fluoride and thereby decreased the retention of fluoride.

       <p>
        The results may have been different if the experiment had been conducted with adults, as fluoride retention (percentage of absorbed fluoride), extrarenal clearance, skeletal uptake [20] and fluoride removal from the plasma is generally greater in children than adults [21,22].

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fluoride retention was also estimated assuming a constant average F fraction of 10% excreted through faeces. It was found that the average proportion of liquids, solid foods, and toothpaste to the daily fluoride intake (1.02-mg F/day on average) were 40.8, 34.6, and 24.5%, respectively. The average FUEF value was 35.5% (95% C.I.=31.7-39.3%), and the estimated fractional F retention was 54.5%.

       So these are just some papers I've collected over the last couple of months. Note that America's federal, state, and local government (and dentists!) sponsored and began fluoridating most it's water more than 60 years ago. Why are these studies just beginning to accumulate (year 2000+,) all of which are pointing toward a hard truth? That maybe we shouldn't be forcefully (and usually unknowingly to the many) medicating most of the country? So now I ask the reader to look him or herself for the established effect that fluoride has in super-optimal doses. To get you started, it's a fact that in some Asian countries, where fluoridation is over 4ppm, real, ugly effects occur in children and adults (mostly the latter) when monitored. Its claimed the optimal amount of fluoride in water is anywhere from 0.7ppm - 1ppm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important thing to remember is poison is all about dose. The only valid defense pro-flouridation has is that there is not enough fluoride to cause any harm. Fine. I believe that too. But connect the dots, people. Look at the research. What happens in the summer when you are drinking twice as much fluoridated water as the winter? Has your loving water supplier worked this into the algorithm ( i pray) that decides how much of the vat of fluoride to add to a certain amount of water? I just looked at the most recent extensive blood of both my parents and they definitely do not test for fluoride. Why not? Regardless, this wouldn't be a complete study if one didnt examine the tissue and glands. See, some research does in fact do this and shows deposits in the pineal gland. (See the post in this thread by u/munkomanko)

       Great work.  Added to my collection of resources.  For those who aren't convinced they should visit that link, he delves into a much more mathematical study into fluoride accumulation in bone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as a bonus here's some more info about fluoride deposition
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First, about half of the fluoride you consume is excreted through your kidneys into your urine, while the other half becomes bound in your skeleton. The fluoride that enters your bones is eliminated very slowly. The NRC estimates the biological half-life of fluoride in bone (the time for half of it to be removed) is as long as 20 years.

       Also every time we shower or take a bath the fluoride is entering our body through our pores. It's also in beverages like soda and orange juice. I would suggest taking quick showers and getting a zero water filter pitcher. I think zerowater is the only filter that can remove fluoride out of all the ones on the market. It's not in water for teeth health. We have tooth paste for that. Fluoride is extremely evil. It's secretly in many things. The reptilian order will not allow us to be aware.

       The damage is not irreparable, Fluoride causes Calcification of the pineal gland. So we simply need to remove the calcium. There are many supplements that can remove calcification of the pineal gland.

       Sure the damage is done but still a good idea to try and avoid it as much as possible. I use the zerowater filter and its with out a doubt the best. I've researched them all and zerowater themselves say it removes fluoride and I'm not 100% sure if it does but it is the only filter that I've seen that has a five level filtering system. Also get some iodine pills from a health store. They will help the body detox fluoride

       I'm not so sure. If I can locate the study, I'll link it, but basically, reverse osmosis removes about 70 percent of the fluoride, distilled removes about 50, and regular carbon filters vary, but remove very little on average. Zero Water removes ions, and fluoride is an ion, so I would assume they work as well, although the company still needs to pay for a test to be done to certify their filter for fluoride removal. If you use rain water in the zero water filter, there should be guaranteed no fluoride whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check the boiling point of fluoride, both calcium fluoride and hexafluorosilicic acid. That should tell you why fluoride follows the distilled water into the container. (Not a chemist, so somebody correct me if I fucked something up here)

       There is zero evidence that filters remove fluoride.  Britta, Zero, etc.  I'd be willing to bet they remove little if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rain water, with the heavy chemtrailing of oxides.  Barium, aluminum, etc, is probably not a terribly wise idea.

       Fluoride ions would raise the conductivity of the water. If the water reads 000, there is likely little or no fluoride present.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, rain water has extremely low levels of anything, so starting with that and filtering it using any of the above mentioned methods would be better than using tap water, which can vary between 50 and 250 ppm dissolved solids, some of which cannot be removed even through distillation. My tap reads about 200 ppm dissolved solids. Rain water reads 4 or 5 ppm.

       Sodium fluoride vs.Hexafluorosilicic acid.  What is in your water?

       I'm afraid you likely don't understand the mechanism of detection provided by a low rate device used by the manufacturer primarily to sell their own Zero water filters.

      <p>
       Thanks to heavy chemtrailing, your rainwater is rife with many harmful chemicals. In fact, most people are toxically filled with aluminum primarily because of it.  This is fairly common knowledge.

       Again, you're buying into marketing hype.  Dissolved solids is only part of the equation.  Using zero waters own 10$ marketing tool to determine the purity of water is pretty reckless.  From the creators own mouth:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         You claim that your pitcher is just as effective as reverse osmosis?
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        We don’t actually state that much in our packaging. These things are all subjective. But in terms of removing TDS, yes, it’s just as effective as RO. But generally, ion exchange against a large body of contaminants will do just as well as RO. There’s so many things that could be in your water. The point is that it’s far closer to RO than typical gravity filters.

       So, if I use a zero water filter to remove contaminants in rain water (as you stated, there will be "chemtrail" aluminum and barium in the water), what would you theorize would be left in the water? Also, what type of water do you start with in your distiller?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you trust Forensic Food Lab for simple information (basic water testing), they actually tested a bunch of filters and concluded that only zero water removed all of the aluminum, and 99 percent of everything else.

         Distillation also will not effectively remove fluoride, another dangerous element added to most water supplies. Distillation can remove an estimated 55-60 percent of fluoride, but the rest will get transferred. A reverse osmosis system is slightly more effective, capable of removing about 80 percent of fluoride

       Mercola spouts nonsense about mineral deficiencies caused by distillation, and is absolute distinfo not to be trusted.  You ALWAYS receive the lions share of your vitamins and minerals from your food.  Not your water.

      <p>
       The size and weight of fluoride makes it extremely difficult to remove.  Filters are effectively useless for this purpose.  You thinking that your 00 reading on a $10 marketing device included with your zero filter is marketing alone.  Do you honestly believe that ultra pure water used industrially is made by running it through a consumer grade zero filter then checking it with an inaccurate marketing device?  There is only one way to create pure h2o - steam distillation.  Running it through once probably isn't going to do it, but it's still magnitudes purer than filtered water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your water filtration may remove some of the fluoride.  Its one step closer, but it's by no means pure h2o.  I'm glad you feel you're seeing results.  You're not however reaching the purity of distillation.  It's not even in the same ballpark, regardless of what your marketing device tells you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a fun article about the company (it's actually a sponsored commercial advertisement), though it clearly tells you the company's focus.  It isn't pure water, I'm afraid.

       Ok, Mercola is a businessman, sure. However, to prove (or at least make it more likely) that the study I am still currently looking for actually exists  (I know it does), I cited that specific line in his article. Mercola cites scientific studies in most of this articles and has his own personal bent on a lot of topics, so I am not citing any other line or any other piece of information from that article other than the line I gave you.

       No, I never said entirely.  Steam distillation is the
       <strong>
        most

       My experience is merely anecdotal.  (Although there is plenty to read about it on many different websites.)  About 9 months ago, I had the same realization that OP had and I just began being more mindful of it and I began to meditate.  Since that time I feel more clear and intuitive and my friends and family have even mentioned it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still a beginner and my mindfulness techniques certainly didn't turn me into a neurologist; however, it did make me happier and more clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I imagine it though is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Your pineal gland has cones and rods just like the retina does.  I imagine if you kept one eye shut for an extended period it would begin to atrophy just like anything else.  If after an extended period of time you could open it and begin to use it again and it would rehabilitate (just like anything else.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We as a culture currently don't know how to use our pineal glands at all, and most believe the intentional
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       of it to be pseudoscience.  I believe that during meditation it is possible to activate your pineal gland and therefore use it and rehabilitate it, which
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have the effect of "de-calcifying" it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, merely anecdotal. But to answer your question:  Yes I have put some thought into it.

       Why does this sensation have to do anything with the pineal gland?  With decalcification of the pineal gland?  Why not a dozen other mechanisms that have more neurological proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it's simply that you are more relaxed, focused, less anxious, less depressed since mindfulness tends to dissolve negativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you are suggesting the pineal gland
       <strong>
        does
       </strong>
       those things.  But from my perspective, I have not come across anything asserting that.  I'd be open to reading whatever you read, but if we leave this at anecdotes, the average intelligent individual will (and should) have a short chance of changing his/her mind.

       There is a lot of fluoride free toothpaste you can find out there. Better chance in any kind of bio market.

       activated charcoal (great for whitening, seriously, it's amazing)

       You are absolutely correct. Diet is the most important thing for any health reasons, period. Plus keeping down inflammation will reduce the risk of pretty much all chronic disease. That should be priority number one if you are worried about your health.

       I bought a water distiller a few months ago. Cost me about 120 bucks on ebay.  I bought it after seeing so many studies on fluoride and how it just makes you a better sheep.  I know its unprovable but in just a short 3 months my ability to concentrate is much more focused and ability of saying fuck it seems to be improving as well.  Maybe its just the placebo effect but each time I distill a gallon of water I cannot believe the amount of shit left behind from the boiling process. It smells like burnt plastic and hydrochloric acid  fumes. Each gallon of water I make leaves behind about half a teaspoon of this foul crap.  I'm sure most of it is calcium but there's definitely some industrial waste in there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone is interested in getting clean water and live in a apt or otherwise cant install a reverse osmosis water filter check it out.  I like mine makes about 1 gallon every 4 hrs and you will see your electric bill increase since its about 550 watts to run.  But its cheaper than buying from the grocery store and easier than lugging around gallons of water each week.

       As I read this, I am drinking beer that was brewed with fluoridated water. The fluoride is STILL THERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier I had a tuna sandwich that was canned with fluoridated water, along with a soft drink that was made with fluoridated water.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fluoride is in virtually every foodstuff that uses municipal fluoridated water in its processing. It doesn't evaporate out during the cooking process - rather, it CONCENTRATES, so canned soups, vegetables, salsas, condiments and even products like breads will contain fluoride.
      </p>
      <p>
       This toxic waste is ubiquitous in our diets. It is everywhere, from the fruit juices we drink to the water we use to flush our heavily fluoridated poop down the fucking toilet.

       But you just telling me that on Reddit is just as unlikely to be true. Do you have a source? Why would the dentist give us fluoride treatments when we were younger if it leeches the calcium out of our teeth since calcium is important to teeth and bones?

       You're right. The fluoride given to you by dentists and in the water is not concentrated enough to do that. But, it is in China.

       See the difference between natural fluoride and sodium fluoride.

      <p>
       Also, please look into concentration of fluoride in processed foods.

        This was proven in a study called, "Comparative Toxicity of Fluorine Compounds." After this study was completed, this statement was made: " ... this meant a daily intake of approximately 40 mg/kg of fluorine from sodium fluoride as compared with 3400 mg/kg from calcium fluoride. Therefore, from the standpoint of lethal concentrations and amount of fluorine necessary to cause growth inhibition, wide differences in toxicity of some of the compounds of fluoride were noted." (See 3-1: Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. July 1934, page 797). In other words, industrial waste (sodium fluoride) is 85 times more toxic than natural calcium fluoride. Both of them contain fluoride, but they are totally different compounds. (Also see 3-2).

       Understand that processed foods and drinks lead to extremely high levels of fluoridation.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a pint of beer uses 24 gallons of water. Fluoride is not removed from water via evaporation. Thus your pint of beer contains about 24 gallons worth of fluoride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then perhaps consider that factory farms use tap water to water livestock. Fluoride then collects in the muscle tissue over the life of the animal. Whom you later consume.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also used in pesticides for your fruits and veggies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who thinks they can buy a water filter to escape fluoride hasn't thought this out yet.

      <p>
       This is incorrect. The stated statistic of 'it takes x litres of water to make y litres of beer' takes into account ALL of the water used in the brewing process. That includes the brewing water, as well as water used for cleaning/sanitizing, rinsing bottles/kegs and cooling the wort after boiling and prior to fermentation, and any losses that occur due to retention in pipes, hoses, spillage etc. During the boil, about 10% of the volume is lost due to evaporation, but this hardly equates to what you stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for what it's worth, many breweries use reverse osmosis water to maintain consistency of the mineral content of the water - ie the brewing salts are added to the water to give the mineral profile the brewer is after (and no, fluoride is not one of them...)

       Don't lose your brain over this type of thing. All you can do is protect yourself and family. Buy a really nice water filter for yourself and loved ones. There are also vitamins and supplements that will help.

       The Chinese water study does not mean what you think it does, they looked at areas with well over 10 times the amount of fluoride found in normal drinking water and didn't account for anything else that might also be in that water.

       You also linked the follow up study and called it a "government report" because it's on fucking pubmed, which means you don't actually know what pubmed is.

We care about oral health more than anything else about your health.  We do realize fluoride has only ever been studied for its effectiveness when applied topically.

       I'd also love for you to point out a single thing I said that was in any way incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call what I said disinformation because I corrected disinformation in the OP?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah dude, more like you know you can't win because just like the OP you've never read a single one of these studies and just saw the headlines and went with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's see here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've claimed fluoride reduces IQ and linked a study that doesn't actually say that, I've corrected that and some how what I did was disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've claimed people are getting dumber, yet IQ has been increasing since the 1900s and is still increasing today. Why is that? all just lies right? our IQs are really going down?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain to you how the real world works. You can't claim what someone says is disinformation without refuting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you people did was disinformation, what I did was information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Test scores have nothing to do with intelligence by the way. Even if test scores were going down that wouldn't be relevant to IQ.

       Stomped, huh?  We'll see.  It seems like your understanding of your own poorly sited sources is lacking.  From your first link, you've demonstrated that the baselines change based on averages of the masses:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Meaning, as the very definition of intelligence is tweaked to fit the average of the masses, they reevaluate and change the basis for calculating such intelligence.  And:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Hardly any of them would have scored 'very superior', but nearly one-quarter would have appeared to be 'deficient.'" He also wrote that "Test scores are certainly going up all over the world, but whether intelligence itself has risen remains controversial."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You've attempted to claim that the doses of fluoride were extremely high, therefore the cognitive declines shown in the studies are not valid because "we aren't exposed similarly." You're also solely basing fluoride exposure on tap water fluoridation amounts, and not calculating total exposure to fluoride from all sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument:
       <strong>
        IQ scores are going up, so fluoride has zero effect on intelligence, idiots.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look around you.  You think your neighbors, colleagues, and even family are more intelligent today than people were 50 years ago?  Yeah, seems like I've been totally stomped here.  Take your false equivalency bullshit disinfo, and kindly fuck clean off.  We've seen your friends attempt to use the same bullshit justifications here to the same disasterous results.

       Did you even read what you just fucking said rofl? this is easily the worst mental gymnastics attempts I have ever seen in my life.

      <p>
       You claimed fluoride was REDUCING THE IQ SCORES OF PEOPLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average IQ score has been increasing every year since 1900, IQ is not actually related to intelligence which is why he said that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Test scores are not related to IQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this, you're once again showing you didn't read the study.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care if you're rolling around in a fluoride bath every day for 20 years, you're not coming ANYWHERE NEAR the level of fluoride in those Chinese studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that wrote the study you're trying to cite have already come out and say the anti-fluoride quacks are not understanding what it says.
      </p>
      <p>
       They did not account for ANYTHING ELSE. That includes Arsenic/lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Harvard researchers wrote in their article that the average standardized mean difference (0.45) in IQ scores “may be within the measurement error of IQ testing.” Despite web pages claiming that the article ”confirms” that fluoride reduces IQ scores, the Harvard co-authors did not reach a firm conclusion, writing instead that “our results support the possibility of adverse effects …” Indeed, their article called for more and better-quality research, including more “precise” data on the children involved and assurances that other factors have been ruled out as reasons for the IQ differences"
      </p>
      <p>
       The two Harvard researchers who reviewed these studies have distanced themselves from the way in which anti-fluoride activists have misrepresented their article. After contacting these researchers, the Wichita Eagle newspaper reported, “While the studies the Harvard team reviewed did indicate that very high levels of fluoride could be linked to lower IQs among schoolchildren, the data is not particularly applicable here because it came from foreign sources where fluoride levels are multiple times higher than they are in American tap water.”

       Aren't you an absolute saint.  Trying to set the world straight by advocating further poisoning.
       <strong>
        You're latching on to one micro aspect of the HARVARD study.  No one cares about IQ.  We're not talking about IQ, yet you can't seem to give it up.
       </strong>
       From the study in question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A recent report from the U.S. National Research Council (NRC 2006) concluded that adverse effects of high fluoride concentrations in drinking water may be of concern and that additional research is warranted. Fluoride may cause neurotoxicity in laboratory animals, including effects on learning and memory ...
To summarize the available literature, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on increased fluoride exposure in drinking water and neurodevelopmental delays. We specifically targeted studies carried out in rural China that have not been widely disseminated, thus complementing the studies that have been included in previous reviews and risk assessment reports ... 
Findings from our meta-analyses of 27 studies published over 22 years suggest an inverse association between high fluoride exposure and children's intelligence ... The results suggest that fluoride may be a developmental neurotoxicant that affects brain development at exposures much below those that can cause toxicity in adults ... 
Serum-fluoride concentrations associated with high intakes from drinking-water may exceed 1 mg/L, or 50 Smol/L, thus more than 1000-times the levels of some other neurotoxicants that cause neurodevelopmental damage. Supporting the plausibility of our findings, rats exposed to 1 ppm (50 Smol/L) of water-fluoride for one year showed morphological alterations in the brain and increased levels of aluminum in brain tissue compared with controls ... 
In conclusion, our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on children's neurodevelopment. Future research should formally evaluate dose-response relations based on individual-level measures of exposure over time, including more precise prenatal exposure assessment and more extensive standardized measures of neurobehavioral performance, in addition to improving assessment and control of potential confounders.

       Did you think copy pasting this was going to say something new? it was a meta-analysis, not a "Harvard study" (I'd suggest you learn the difference before you try to bold the name) and a meta-analysis is only as good as the studies it's looking at.

       Here's what Philippe Grandjean, Adjunct Professor of Environmental Health at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote about the misrepresentation of research he co-authored on the link between fluoride and lowered IQ in children.
"neither [Kansas] newspaper checked their information with the authors, even though statements were attributed to them"
"On average, the children with higher fluoride exposure showed poorer intelligence test performance. The high exposures generally exceeded the concentrations normally occurring in fluoridated drinking water, but only 4 of 27 studies reached an excess of 10-fold, and clear differences were found also at much lower exposures.
Addition of fluoride to drinking water has been controversial since the very beginning in the 1940s. As noted in a National Research Council report, neither benefits nor risks have been thoroughly documented."
"Chemical brain drain should not be disregarded. The average IQ deficit in children exposed to increased levels of fluoride in drinking water was found to correspond to about 7 points - a sizable difference. To which extent this risk applies to fluoridation in Wichita or Portland or elsewhere is uncertain, but definitely deserves concern."

       "-- When considering the risks and benefits of fluoride exposure, the level of intake needs to be
considered.
--Possible risks to brain development in children have been studied in China, but this possible hazard has
not received much, if any, consideration in the U.S.
--Our study summarized the findings of 27 studies on intelligence tests in fluoride-exposed children; 25
of the studies were carried out in China. On average, children with higher fluoride exposure showed
poorer performance on IQ tests. Fluoride released into the ground water in China in some cases greatly
exceeded levels that are typical in the U.S.
--In general, complete information was not available on these 27 studies, and some limitations were
identified.
--All but one of the 27 studies documented an IQ deficit associated with increased fluoride exposure.
--These results do not allow us to make any judgment regarding possible levels of risk at levels of
exposure typical for water fluoridation in the U.S. On the other hand, neither can it be concluded that no
risk is present. We therefore recommend further research to clarify what role fluoride exposure levels
may play in possible adverse effects on brain development, so that future risk assessments can properly
take into regard this possible hazard"

       Point out where he says fluoride is directly linked to lower IO.

       Find a single one of those Chinese studies with fluoride levels anywhere near as low as they are here.

       Point out where he says fluoride is directly related to reduced IQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly because you can't understand why dosage is important, nobody is saying fluoride isn't TOXIC they're saying it isn't toxic at the levels we're currently getting.
      </p>
      <p>
       That may change with fluoride being more common in toothpaste, but it 100% isn't from the water supply.

       I'd be fully for more studies on the matter, but people like you making bullshit claims that fluoride reduces IQ are not acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a number of reasons why that clearly isn't the case, mainly because IQ has been on the rise in the US over the last 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       If fluoride reduced IQ then that clearly wouldn't be the case considering we've expanded the use of fluoride in that time.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This study has added new knowledge on the fate and distribution of fluoride in the body. It has shown for the first time that fluoride readily accumulates in the human pineal gland although there was considerable inter-individual variation (14-875 mg F/kg). By old age, the average pineal gland contains about the same amount of fluoride as teeth (300 mg F/kg) since dentine and whole enamel contain 300 and 100 mg F/kg, respectively [Newbrun, 1986]. Unlike brain capillaries, pineal capillaries allow the free passage of fluoride through the endothelium. If there had been a bloodbrain barrier in the pineal, it would have prevented the passage of fluoride into the pinealocytes and the pineal fluoride content would have been similar to or lower than muscle. This was obviously not the case: the fluoride concentration of the pineal was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) than muscle. The high fluoride levels in the pineal are presumably due to the large surface area of the HA crystallites both intra- and extracellularly. In addition, the pineal has a profuse blood flow and high capillary density; pineal blood flow (4 ml/min/g) is second only to the kidney [Arendt, 1995]

       You are misinterpreting your own sources.    High IQ's were associated with fluoride levels around the recommended .7 mg/L.  Danger and concern are totally warranted when you're talking about high concentrations (From your articles regarding China), but everyday water flouridation in the U.S. is a poor debunked conspiracy unfortunately...

       Really? Wow. Mind posting some information that we can check out for ourselves. Maybe some study that looks at long term build up of fluoride in the human body. How about what happens to the fluoride when it enters the body, does it get flushed out of the system or build up in a specific organ? Cause if it builds up then no matter how minute the dose, over time it has a potential risk. Again, can we get some info?

       Sure, start at PubMed.gov, but to understand many studies you may want to start by accumulating a college-level understanding of chemistry lest you be tempted misunderstand further.  If you have scientific evidence for this 'accumulation' theory of yours, you are welcome to share it.

        This study has added new knowledge on the fate and distribution of fluoride in the body. It has shown for the first time that fluoride readily accumulates in the human pineal gland although there was considerable inter-individual variation (14-875 mg F/kg). By old age, the average pineal gland contains about the same amount of fluoride as teeth (300 mg F/kg) since dentine and whole enamel contain 300 and 100 mg F/kg, respectively [Newbrun, 1986]. Unlike brain capillaries, pineal capillaries allow the free passage of fluoride through the endothelium. If there had been a bloodbrain barrier in the pineal, it would have prevented the passage of fluoride into the pinealocytes and the pineal fluoride content would have been similar to or lower than muscle. This was obviously not the case: the fluoride concentration of the pineal was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) than muscle. The high fluoride levels in the pineal are presumably due to the large surface area of the HA crystallites both intra- and extracellularly. In addition, the pineal has a profuse blood flow and high capillary density; pineal blood flow (4 ml/min/g) is second only to the kidney [Arendt, 1995]

       I'm to assume you cannot readily discuss these results or provide any further insight?  You seem apt to copy and paste over and over with little or nothing to add.  What is your point?

       It's your body, do what you want. I'm not going to argue with someone who doesn't want to help themselves. You removing the build up of calcium in one of the most important organs in your body has no ramifications upon me.

       The same ubiquitous copy and paste from mind/spirit/esoteric naturopathic websites, great.  No wonder you're an agitated mess; you're convinced a single brief study conducted by a single person on 11 cadavers drawing very limited conclusions is worth more weight than the dozens of more sophisticated studies on the subject that reject the idea of fluoride as unsafe.  Make your own decisions on the matter, but your worry stems from your ignorance.

       My experience is merely anecdotal.  (Although there is plenty to read about it on many different websites.)  About 9 months ago, I had the same realization that OP had and I just began being more mindful of it and I began to meditate.  Since that time I feel more clear and intuitive and my friends and family have even mentioned it to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still a beginner and my mindfulness techniques certainly didn't turn me into a neurologist; however, it did make me happier and more clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I imagine it though is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Your pineal gland has cones and rods just like the retina does.  I imagine if you kept one eye shut for an extended period it would begin to atrophy just like anything else.  If after an extended period of time you could open it and begin to use it again and it would rehabilitate (just like anything else.)
      </p>
      <p>
       We as a culture currently don't know how to use our pineal glands at all, and most believe the intentional
       <em>
        use
       </em>
       of it to be pseudoscience.  I believe that during meditation it is possible to activate your pineal gland and therefore use it and rehabilitate it, which
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have the effect of "de-calcifying" it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, merely anecdotal. But to answer your question:  Yes I have put some thought into it.

       Meditation definitely has physical ramifications. Meditation "collapses quantum systems at a distance".

       I don't see why you are making this a debate. A zero water filter does not have to remove fluoride if there is none to begin with. I use rain water, as I've stated 3 times already.
