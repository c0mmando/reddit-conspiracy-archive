    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, Corbyn&#39;s record on this issue is not good. He turned a blind eye to child abuse accusations in Islington over a period of many years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11758612/Jeremy-Corbyn-accused-of-inaction-over-paedophile-scandal.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/11758612/Jeremy-Corbyn-accused-of-inaction-over-paedophile-scandal.html</a></p>

<p>Of course, neither the Telegraph nor John Mann MP are sympathetic to Corbyn, but I think he has questions to answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At this point, I don&#39;t care about Corbyn&#39;s policies, I just want to see someone who isn&#39;t an android kick out the dissembler Cameron and shake things up. But this inaction over child abuse makes me wonder if Corbyn is quite the free agent he is made out to be.</p>

<p>Also, all this stuff is in the news but no one&#39;s doing shit about it except redirecting guilt to dead or scapegoat past their prime entertainers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Going back to earlier in the summer, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2aqcx3/the_breaking_uk_vip_pedophile_scandal_what_we/">where you posted this same thing</a>, you&#39;ve been using the word &quot;breaking&quot; but the reality is that this story happened in the 1970s and 80s and came to light in the 1990s. There are adults who were not yet born when this story was first reported.</p>

<p>I think the only thing &quot;breaking&quot; here, is your stretched use of that word.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important and it will continue to be important as people are finally prosecuted for their crimes (not that many of them are still alive and/or whole) but it&#39;s not breaking news and calling it that is somewhat disingenuous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might notice that this post is a whole bunch of new links to brand new stories (even if the new stories involve events from the past). </p>

<p>You do bring up an interesting point though. Do you notice how the term &quot;historical abuse&quot; is used in almost all mainstream articles concerning any stories related to this issue? It is almost as though the media is attempting to frame this issue as being in the past, and by implication are saying that it is not happening any more. I find this disingenuous - as I have heard of no catalyzing event that would have stopped the child abuse from happening... and I have seen no arrests of any of the people who were responsible for any of this... which makes me think the cover up is just continuing. </p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for your comment. </p>
