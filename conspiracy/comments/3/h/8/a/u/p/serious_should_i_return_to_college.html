      <p>
       I am going in to my Sophomore year of college in two weeks, and I am so torn over what to do...
      </p>
      <p>
       My college (in Alabama) is over 600 miles from my home (In North Eastern Ohio), and I do not have any family near my school. I am concerned that if shit hits the fan, I will be stranded and on my own in a state far from my family...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am primarily concerned over the "doomsday" events that are proposed for September 2015 such as the Shemitah, the US' financial collapse, or other earth-changing events, and I would like to hear your opinions: is it worth me going back to school, or should I take a semester off and see what happens?
      </p>
      <p>
       I frequent this sub a lot, and I have seen posts regarding "something" happening next month, and I would like some help or advice in deciding my next step...
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks in advance!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: It's articles like this that worry me the most...

       I couldn't agree more...
But I'll also feel helpless, afraid and alone if I go and "something" happens which inhibits me from seeing my family again...
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose I want to rather be safe than sorry, but I don't want to make a decision based on unfounded theories like you said.

       There is no sorry. Do not worry about what -could- happen, only what -IS- happening is important. You can not let such fear control you, you give it too much power.

       Probably not. Like was said in previous post; "People always see 'evidence' when they are really looking for something to find, no matter how watered down or unrealistic it is."
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if something happens, you would probably not be who is affected by it. Even if you were, what will you do? You know? All you can do is wait until something happens and THEN react to it. Worrying about the future and what MIGHT happen would not serve you.

       The only real concern you should have is if WW3 breaks out.  Otherwise, everything will be fine in this country.  Trust me, I've been following this stuff for a long time.

       I was in a pretty decent earthquake a few years back, buildings destroyed, people killed etc. I can tell you this, it times of disaster you will see the best of humanity. Sci-fi gets it wrong. People will go to stupid levels to help each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Days afterwards (when we still didn't have water and power in most areas) you would see people with signs out offering to help each other with washing or offering a place to stay.

       There have been so many doomsday predictions made that have come and gone without so much of a single tremor, you can not let the predictions of a group dictate your life. If the World ends or the shit hits the fan, you will have to deal with it when it happens (or not if you die), so why worry so much that you let it control your course?
      </p>
      <p>
       The more fear you bleed into it, the more power something like this has over you. The more power YOU give it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most likely outcome is that -nothing- will happen in September and people will just move onto the NEXT thing/year/month that everybody is supposed to die or something.

       IF there is a financial collapse in the United States, chances are the only people affected will be the rich and the big corporations; the bigger you are, the harder you fall sort of thing. You will probably not be all that affected by it, most likely. Especially if you have no money in the stocks or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But look at 2012? All conspiracy forums all over the internet were ablaze with 'Doomsday December 21st 2012' and that day passed, nothing happened unless.. PLOT TWIST! WE ARE ALL GHOSTS ALREADY DEAD BECAUSE IT WAS DOOMSDAY THEN! Dundundunnnnn!
      </p>
      <p>
       But seriously, just chill and do not let the fear control you.

       Not only that, but if it really bothers you that a collapse could happen and would separate you from your family you could learn survival skills and map reading. Learn to locate yourself and your family on a map and then learn the land navigation skills to get to them. Then you'll only need to either have enough non-perishables to got you home or a field guide that tells you what plants you can forage and eat. Become a survivalist. Make friends with the rednecks around your area and have them teach you. Learn to hunt if you don't know how. Learn primitive survival and make regular trips into the woods to practice and hone your skills.

       Lots of people insisted there would be a financial collapse or something worse in 2012.  Nothing happened.   So go to college and take some philosophy courses so you can learn to better identify the  false prophets on the internet.

       I dont think anyone should tell you what to do. But I will offer you some advise to help you make a decision.
Consider the possibility that we are all playing a role in this game of life, and maybe whatever happens is where we are suppose to be. What ever decision you make, make sure that its on the path of love. I will quote Don Juan from Carlos Castaneda work:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "Anything is one of a million paths. Therefore you must always keep in mind that a path is only a path; if you feel you should not follow it, you must not stay with it under any conditions. To have such clarity you must lead a disciplined life. Only then will you know that any path is only a path and there is no affront, to oneself or to others, in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you to do."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "But your decision to keep on the path or to leave it must be free of fear or ambition. I warn you. Look at every path closely and deliberately. Try it as many times as you think necessary.  All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. ... Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't, it is of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn't. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you."
       </em>

       live your life without fear and do what you choose. i vote that you look into alternitive free sources of knowledge. college helped me just get way deep into debt with a very volitile and not certain future.

       That is college in the United States, because the United States has a VERY broken system and your taxes are used on wars abroad rather than in your own Country where they could go to fund, you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       ...Free education like for in Finland for example where we are taxed higher but the taxes go to free education because that is an investment in the future which will bring more prosperity for the Country and people all around

       Stock market crash (if the patterns aren't coincidental) is not going to cause mass chaos right now, it hasn't in the past. There's a segment of preachers ginning this up, taking advantage of older folks and selling them doomsday kits (have a family member who has been taken in by this).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good to be prepared (I did move some money into cash so I can buy on the cheap if a crash does occur), but don't derail your life due to shysters peddling fear!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, 600 miles isn't that far--instead of dropping out of school, keep your car gassed up and keep some water bottles in the back.

       Crisis makes great friends, some have cars and are up for adventure! Some great stories I've heard from friends trying to escape places when flights were grounded and they had to get home somehow.

       The last thing you want is to derail your life for something that's so uncertain. If you prepare a little, if something does happen, you'll feel better and be in better shape. Derail your whole life, and if it doesn't happen, you've derailed your life. :(

       Example from my youth: the year 2000 bug fears. I saved whisky and cigs and kept water in my car. Nothing happened, but at that point, the provisions were still usable and I only felt slightly foolish. If I'd quit my job and fled to the mountains, I'd never have heard the end of it from my family...not to mention talking around why I left my job in future job interviews, egad.

       I am living in similar circumstances and I feel as though it is better to play it safe and to take this semester off and continue working my current job to stock up on canned goods and other survival items. It cannot hurt to be prepared. While you cannot believe all predicted events...this one seems pretty intimidating.

       Yea I recently left teaching and am getting ready too. I don't believe in doomsday dates but we are overdue for a stock market correction and I don't think there's much leverage left in the system. I'd rather be ready and wrong then unprepared.

       I'm leaning towards financial collapse due to the 7 year cycle. But it could be a total load of shit...although all the current stuff going on. All the war games in the different countries around the world. Especially jade helm. I don't fear the exercise itself but instead what they are training for. The empty Walmarts creep me out. Plus there is all this BS out there about CERN that I'm questioning what the truth behind it is. I feel as though many on here are in a state of denial. Pretending that the elite are not against us and do not want us dead. Something fishy is going on but nobody knows the truth about what will or won't happen

       While it was an interesting video, I do not see the correlation as to what it means for September 2015 and/or the future...? It seemed awfully focused on past tense, especially John Paul II

       What if the Catholic Church found that book with Malachi's vision, and hand-tailored the papacy to fulfill the prophecy?

       While it's true that economic collapse is inevitable, its definitely not possible to predict. The oligarchy will do everything within it's power to prevent any turmoil in the system it has created.

       Well I'm almost certain you would be able to find a ride, a train, bus, friend or family member. It's not like a complete collapse can happen overnight, not unless an asteroid or some crazy shit like that happens. If it does, being with your family wouldn't help anyways.
      </p>

       You should buy a car though. It would at least help with your anxiety. Just get something cheap.

       What makes you think September is the month? The only thing I've heard that points to September is the Shemitah, which shouldn't be a credible theory for complete collapse because it's a seven year cycle (among other reasons).

       Same here. I have pretty much discredited the "asteroid" theory, and the pope/UN theory seems a little far-fetched, since the pope visits and speaks all the time.

      <p>
       Out of curiosity, why don't you believe the Shemitah theory? I personally am hesitant, but I'd like to hear someone else's opinion as well :)

       The Shemittah is a seven year cycle of debt forgiveness, which doesn't really sound apocalyptic.

       I would agree. Given the theory, it seems like a pretty good and forgiving idea!
      </p>

       But these theorists attach it to bad patches like the recessions and stock crashes, and that turns it to not-such-a-good thing...

       Don't let fear control you. Even nuclear bombs could very well be a hoax. I can tell you that America won't undertake any such doomsday event. Things are going well for them. They are focusing on other projects atm. But still, don't give into fear. A lot of the times, our fears are completely unfounded. Be happy. Do good. Thats all that matters.

       Probably not. Like was said in previous post; "People always see 'evidence' when they are really looking for something to find, no matter how watered down or unrealistic it is."

       Even if something happens, you would probably not be who is affected by it. Even if you were, what will you do? You know? All you can do is wait until something happens and THEN react to it. Worrying about the future and what MIGHT happen would not serve you.
