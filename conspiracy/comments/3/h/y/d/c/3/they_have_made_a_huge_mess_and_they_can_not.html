       I believe this is why we are seeing this surge in the truth movement. This is why we are seeing so many more shills, and racists trying to infiltrate this sub. Race baiting, cop hating, down votingâ€¦ the truth will win. Let us not hate or disrespect the sleepers or the haters, or the shills for that matter. They will learn. They will be afraid of what they see. We need to be here for each other when the shit hits the fan.

       Don't ever think that the elite don't know exactly the state of disillusionment of the lower classes--this is one of the reasons for the surveillance state. If there is some sort of collapse, it will be engineered by the elite to allow them to further consolidate their stranglehold on the country.

       I believe if the elite were able to engineer a controlled collapse that allowed them to consolidate their power THEY ALREADY WOULD HAVE DONE IT. That has been their plan the whole time from the Cuban Missile Crisis to the WWIII Iran apocalypse scaremongering.  You see how desperate they are when all their goons in the media can come up with is trying to push a bullshit race war on America.  Its not gonna work.

       They did. Remember 2008? There is no possible way that all the investment banking industry didn't know the ramifications of providing unlimited retail credit. The credit bubble was blown and deflated to justify the unprecedented direct looting of the US Treasury, otherwise known as QE. God only knows what sort of criminally corrupt fuckery they will impose upon us when the current bubble blows.

       Not sure what bubble you mean, but in my eyes the biggest bubble is that (almost) every country lives with debt and not with real resources. That is a huge bubble and nobody is going to pay back the debt, obviously because it's impossible. But still they talk about paying it back and how it's a problem. I'm not very well informed on the situation, but I could guess the loaners that give countries / governments money will stop at some point when the elite wants. The interests need to be paid with more debt so (in my mind at least) at some point it will inevitably become a runaway situation where you need to take more debt exponentially and really fast. Then it will automatically collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I feel if this is the case how I'm thinking it, it should not be that hard for them to calculate when this extreme runaway situation will happen, and it might have been set a long long time ago.

       This is my concern. If you take the average idiot and give them enough information to panic but not enough context, they are now an empowered idiot. I overheard some customers at work talking about the september shit and I sorta butted into the conversation to ask one guy to clarify what he was saying. What does he talk about? How much ammo he has...

       I see. I wasn't referring to guns or violence necessarilyâ€¦ at all, actually. There are those people I guess. Maybe the shit is hitting the fan and this is a perfect example of being there for each other. Calm that dude down. Who does he think he is going to shoot? What information is he going on? Talk to him. Stimulate his mind beyond violence. Allow him to ask himself if he is taking that stance a little too far. I don't know.. I understand your concern. I am just a man. I don't have all the answers. Thank you for engaging in the conversation.

       The big problem that I see is that now that the prison/circus/distraction machine is starting to burst at the seams and people are slipping through the cracks, there is no map for what happens once they're outside of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've seen logan's run, it's like what happens after you sneak through the utility hallways and avoid the death robot at the exit. Now you're in the wilderness, and where do you go? Even the rumors about what exist outside of it don't guide you, there's no refuge like they said there'd be, so what do you do? It seems for many people the answer is ammo and MREs for their immediate family instead of, I dunno, building community, seed-saving, having a local tool library etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy's entire plan(that he spoke about anyway) was to put his 20k rounds in his SUV and drive to some place in "the hills" that he knows about. He didn't mention seeds, or neighbors or really anything other than bugging out with a 24hr plan. There's too much survival bullshit like that and not enough real solution seeking when I look at the various doom websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       He sounded pretty convinced of his position and because he was fat, armed and had the benefit of being a younger boomer(thus got paid real money for the same bullshit sort of job), had a baseless self confidence that I didn't care to challenge. He was not open, he was already an informed expert in his own mind even though it was clear he was new to collapse. I suspect the moment people like that listen is when they've run out of ammo and gas and find an intentional community that has already solved these problems.

       Many people are simply afraid. Afraid of what could happen. Afraid for themselves and their family. They take the "every man for themselves" approach. I agree with you. You are absolutely correct. You've got the right idea. Then again, there will be people who want to take what you and your community built because they didn't take the time to do anything but buy ammo. Ya can't eat ammo.. I am no "prepper". I kind of wish I were. If something bad happened I am not prepared. I do however have seeds. A sound mind. A good heart. A good family. Great friends, and I am prepared to be a part of a decent community to rebuild if something terrible happens on a mass scale. That's what people should be discussing more. Humans, at our core, when afraid, can be quite animalistic.

      <p>
       I haven't heard anyone connecting any dots with the recent news about Isis and so on. When conspiracies (truths) become older people start seeing it, like JFK and 911 to some extent, but when they are relevant nobody notices shit.

       Let's just stick with 9/11. It seems to me the height of the movement - at least in the West - was somewhere back in 2006, when it was on the verge of becoming mainstream. Since then it's become a fringe concern at best.

       I'm just going to suggest that is by far the most likely explanation. You probably associate with people who share a mindset and outlook somewhat similar to your own - we all do. That some of your friends have gotten into a subject you're into isn't all that shocking, and certainly not indicative of a wider trend.

       I find conspiracy theories, and the people who believe in them, interesting. It's that simple. Don't know what kind of other answer you were expecting
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd add that
       <em>
        at no point
       </em>
       did I say that "most people" in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are schizophrenic. I don't believe that to be the case, in fact I'd be surprised if the incidence of schizophrenia here was much greater than in the population at large. I
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       say that people who claim to be gang stalked are suffering from delusions
       <em>
        similar
       </em>
       to those found in paranoid schizophrenics. I later added this doesn't mean even this small group are actually schizophrenic. So that's a lie.

       The big problem that I see is that now that the prison/circus/distraction machine is starting to burst at the seams and people are slipping through the cracks, there is no map for what happens once they're outside of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've seen logan's run, it's like what happens after you sneak through the utility hallways and avoid the death robot at the exit. Now you're in the wilderness, and where do you go? Even the rumors about what exist outside of it don't guide you, there's no refuge like they said there'd be, so what do you do? It seems for many people the answer is ammo and MREs for their immediate family instead of, I dunno, building community, seed-saving, having a local tool library etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy's entire plan(that he spoke about anyway) was to put his 20k rounds in his SUV and drive to some place in "the hills" that he knows about. He didn't mention seeds, or neighbors or really anything other than bugging out with a 24hr plan. There's too much survival bullshit like that and not enough real solution seeking when I look at the various doom websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       He sounded pretty convinced of his position and because he was fat, armed and had the benefit of being a younger boomer(thus got paid real money for the same bullshit sort of job), had a baseless self confidence that I didn't care to challenge. He was not open, he was already an informed expert in his own mind even though it was clear he was new to collapse. I suspect the moment people like that listen is when they've run out of ammo and gas and find an intentional community that has already solved these problems.

       Oh yeah Gog El is in on it, but you could still be right. It might just be my own circle of friends.
