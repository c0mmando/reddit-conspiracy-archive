<p>&quot;Gang Stalking&quot; is a form of community mobbing and organized stalking combined. Just like you have workplace mobbing, and online mobbing, which are both fully recognized as legitimate, this is the community form. it&#39;s a psychological attack that can completely destroy a persons life, while leaving little or no evidence to incriminate the perpetrators.&quot;</p>

<p>Gang Stalking is stalking by more than one person to a victim, usually involving community harassment, or the &quot;mob&quot;, using people from all backgrounds and vocations to harass, tracking 24/7, sometimes organizing lethal vehicle accidents, poisonings, electronic harassment, home invasions/property destruction, corrupt or ignorant doctor diagnosis given to stamp the victim as bogus mentally ill with delusions, paranoia, or schizophrenia, etc. Everything is done covertly, and with a sophisticated real time dispatching system to organize the criminals&#39; harassment and attacks, often in the hundreds to thousands of criminals participating as a coordinated mob at any given time while the criminals due their normal routines of work, shopping, commuting to and from work, leisure, etc., using the method of moving foot and vehicular surveillance techniques, and computers, cell phones, verbal and visual cues, and every other conceivable type of communication.</p>

<p>Often, the local network of this mob is connected to a national and international network - funding is done by illicit drug industry/crime syndicates, CRIMINALS working in:corporate environment, and government sponsored terrorism for military weapons research using non-consenting human beings. It&#39;s similar to Cointelpro or red squads, and it&#39;s being used on a lot of innocent people to ruin them and make them look crazy. Gang Stalking is all about government disinformation, and using civilian spies/snitches to help with stalking and monitoring innocent people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never read anything posted by someone who uses the words &quot;gang stalking&quot; that wasn&#39;t completely crazy --- but I&#39;ve never mentioned that or posted in reply to one of their threads because I didn&#39;t want to participate in or validate their own delusions by &#39;invalidating them or trying to make them feel crazy&#39; (which is how they would probably perceive it)... because people suffering from delusions constantly re-affirm their own delusions to themselves -- and anyone pointing out the ridiculousness of it &#39;must just be a part of the plot against them&#39;. The idea that large groups of individuals are against you personally is self-aggrandizing as hell and extraordinarily symptomatic of mental illness.</p>

<p>In all the years I&#39;ve watched <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> chats and posts - those &quot;gang stalking&quot; posters are the most irrational, the most paranoid, and the most crazy seeming. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re &#39;talking about crazy experiences they have had&#39; - it&#39;s that they&#39;re taking normal, every day life and applying delusional paranoia to it and then posting it here to validate and affirm their own delusions by using the scope of &quot;conspiracies&quot; to confirm it to themselves.</p>

<p>gang stalking is not an actual thing. If &#39;the power that be&#39; cared about you, you would just be accused of rape (like Julian Assange), or arrested, or put into a navy brig in solitary confinement and go years without speaking to anyone, let alone your lawyer, which is an actual power that &quot;powers&quot; have now under the NDAA. The only place that the term &quot;gang stalking&quot; has any relevance in a sane person&#39;s mind is online -- where activists might be targeted by groups like JTRIG from NSA/GCHQ/etc. to discredit them or their work or put them in contact with trolls any time they try to post anything meaningful (which happens here quite often, try posting about GMOs or Israel in one of the mainstream subs and you can get 25 downvotes within the 2 minutes following your post as well as a couple people stalking thru your posting history looking for a way to personally attack you to discredit your post).</p>

<p>But IN REAL LIFE? To the sole end of bothering you on a personal level? no. That doesn&#39;t actually happen. If it isn&#39;t happening to people like Glenn Greenwald, then it <em>probably</em> isn&#39;t happening to you.</p>

<p>If by &quot;gangs&quot; you mean organizations who intrude on you like TSA, then that&#39;s different, but it&#39;s not &quot;gang stalking&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To an extent I agree, with you. There are a lot of lonely crazies out there making shit up. </p>

<p>However, to say gang stalking doesn&#39;t and never existed and can&#39;t happen is naive. Some verifiable forms of organized stalking did and may even still exist in the deep south, to say it never targeted everyday citizens is ignorant and downplays the ability of people to conspire against &#39;undesirables&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s real, here&#39;s video. This video constitutes proof that you would have to be willfully ignorant to dismiss. I think your comeback argument will be that this is a one-off video, or a personal dispute; I&#39;m not quarreling, believe me I fully understand the suspicion. It does seem insane, <em>because it is.</em> And yet it actually happens, this is a tiny tip of the iceberg, and what&#39;s portrayed in this video has federal support. Furthermore, these tactics are not relegated to static locations. Federal and local law-enforcement can and does use identical tactics on mobile people, both in vehicle and by foot.</p>

<p>This incident was actually covered by local news, and that video is also posted on Youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that&#39;s not even a little bit what people who describe &quot;gang stalking&quot; are referring to. I don&#39;t see anyone being stalked there, I see some cars going by and beeping (<em>omg terrifying</em>). This guy got in a fight with his town, and the other people there are annoyed by him, so they annoy him also. That isn&#39;t threatening or &#39;gang stalking&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s another response I would have expected.</p>

<p>First off, this is one aspect of gang stalking, and does not represent the entire protocol. </p>

<p>Secondly, they don&#39;t just honk a few times, they do it over months, and then years. This drives sane people mad. It&#39;s fairly understandable that you wouldn&#39;t be able to intuit this, since it&#39;s an experience the average person never has. But the human psyche over times begins to interpret the barrage of attacks as a persistent and unending threat. Imagine so-called water torture.</p>

<p>Thirdly, most of the accounts you have read are written by shills. I would expect this to look different than you expected. That&#39;s why a pervasive counterintelligence program directed at innocent Americans has been able to thrive, because of shills muddying and confusing the issue. These shills are thus directly responsible for a lot of deaths, including those at the hands of the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fsu-shooter-myron-may-left-message-i-do-not-want-n253436">people they drive mad</a>.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the incident I linked may be related to a direct dispute, or there may be more &quot;under the hood,&quot; so to speak. But one thing seems clear to those who have studied the subject, which is that these corrupt small town criminals did not come up with this methodology on their own. </p>

<p>As I said, this is just a part of gang stalking, which takes several other prominent forms. If you are truly interested, try reading: <a href="http://fightgangstalking.com/">http://fightgangstalking.com/</a> It&#39;s a fascinating read, written by an uncommonly rational and intelligent... somebody. It&#39;s a lot of material, so I don&#39;t expect you to read it, but it&#39;s worth it to know what&#39;s really going on. Particularly for those who are complicit in some way, because almost none of them have a real idea what they&#39;re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zersetzung">actually involved with</a>, due to its scope, and the nature of counterintelligence as being compartmentalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you where you gang stalking aficionados go off the rails.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know how to draw the line between plausible and ridiculous.</p>

<p>Yes, gang stalking exists. It is done by groups of people who target an individual, and commit small intrusive acts against that individual all day long, seven days a week -- acts not significant enough to warrant calling the police, but annoying enough so that the individual knows he or she is a target. It makes the life of that person unpleasant, and has no consequences for the group of people doing it. That&#39;s gang  stalking.</p>

<p>Where you whacky loony-tunes fly off into outer space is when you say that it is done by hundreds or thousands of people, working together, for money, or for the CIA or other government services. That&#39;s just nuts. Gang stalking is done for amusement, or to get back at an individual for some imagined slight. It isn&#39;t a massive network of thousands of employed professional gang-stalkers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is probably real in some sense, but id venture to say that 99.9% of the people who claim gang stalking have paranoid delusions.  No entity would waste this type of resources on someone below a very high level of importance.  Like maybe Gary webb (or someone like that breaking open a huge story), or someone as important as princess Diana.  </p>

<p>If you believe you&#39;re being gang stalked, and you&#39;re NOT a VIP or working on something very important, you&#39;re most likely delusional. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just read up on COINTELPRO. That&#39;s a blatant, recent historical example of organized, multi-agency gangstalking. Don&#39;t bother with skeptics here for the most part. They&#39;re uninformed and always give known liars the benefit of the doubt, and then proceed to call other people crazy. It&#39;s hilarious. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a need for test subjects for illegal projects, especially whatever MKULTRA turned in to. They probably shifted towards the use of various things, like audio spotlights and so on. It&#39;s a known fact that you can cause somebody to hear voices in their head. </p>

She was a journalist in Ontario, Canada that reported something that she shouldn&#39;t have and this was the retaliation. There used to be a video of this where she narrated, but I guess she went with text this time around.</p>

<p>For the record, I believe most people who think they&#39;re being gangstalked are &quot;crazy,&quot; but the phenomenon definitely exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen that video before (although when I watched it there was voice narration). Honestly, it&#39;s <strong>completely indistinguishable</strong> from what it would look like if I sat in my car on my street for a few minutes with a video camera pointing outside. </p>

<p>Absolutely nothing interesting would be captured (like it wasn&#39;t in the video you linked), just people going about their daily lives. But I could make it look vaguely sinister by slowing it down, zooming in on random shit and telling my audience they&#39;re watching a subtle yet hugely elaborate plot to drive me insane unfold. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 100% certain if I recorded such a video and uploaded it, people who believe in this gangstalking nonsense would believe I&#39;m being &#39;targeted&#39; too. There&#39;s simply nothing in it.</p>

<p>The guy was like 50 metres away. The lady needed to zoom in on him to even see him somewhat clearly. He could have been looking at absolutely anything between him and her, and he would need almost superhuman eyesight to even spot the lady with the camera - who was hiding in her car.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not &quot;shitposting&quot;, I just don&#39;t see the video you linked to as being convincing by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re discrediting the fact that somebody was obviously (according to the victim) behind her. Either that, or they were expecting her to leave her house (totally plausible, a car is obvious at that distance) but she didn&#39;t. Both are likely true, and neither require superhuman eyesight. They were looking &quot;at her&quot;, but only to the extent of waiting for her to leave. </p>

<p>There is another video on her channel, a recent one, where an ~18 year old girl follows her around for 4 minutes at 1 in the morning... she must just be paranoid though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I can say is I&#39;m not seeing what you&#39;re seeing. In the video the &quot;victim&quot; <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Z1QD8S5.jpg">helpfully supplies a picture of the view from the corner in question</a> and points out where her car was (indicated by blue circle in link). It&#39;s basically a dot at mid-distance, so yes, your eyesight would have to be exceptionally good to be looking at her, particularly as she&#39;s <em>in</em> the car.</p>

<p>So if the video is supposed to be &quot;irrefutable proof&quot; I think it failed in that regard. Like I said, anything can be made to look vaguely sinister if you slow it down and annotate it enough.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have looked at this gang stalking stuff on YouTube and the actions the &quot;victims&quot; describe are completely impossible to differentiate from the paranoid delusions of some schizophrenics.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the evidence these people present is them, sitting in a public place (or in their car), filming the people around them going about their daily lives and then analysing the video later for nebulous &quot;signs&quot; that the people being filmed were actually &quot;stalking&quot; them.</p>

<p>Other videos I&#39;ve seen consist of some poor, deluded soul sitting in front of a webcam claiming that stalkers have broken into their house to move their shoes/laptop/cups etc a few centimetres away from where they claimed they&#39;d been left.</p>

<p>It would almost be funny if these people weren&#39;t clearly ill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s paranoid schizophrenia. These folks never present any reason  their stalkers would have to commit to such an intensive and.expensive campaign.</p>

<p>But paranoia is a vicious cycle, and if you start making youtube videos about voice to skull technology, yah there&#39;s a good chance the fbi is going to investigate you and people are going to be looking at you sideways. Paranoia begets paranoia.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;m sure there are people on the receiving end of coordinated harassment. Susan Lindauer has clearly been painted as mentally ill, but her story is pretty legit. Alex jones tells stories about electronic harassment and phonetaps and that guy has every reason to be paranoid.</p>

<p>The core question may have more to do with whether or not Power would regard as desirable a capability to extrajudicially punish with complete impunity, anyone it views as a threat, in such a way as to push his or her existence into a persistent and unrelenting state of utter peacelessness - in a way the completely thwarts detection.</p>

<p>The intensely enemy/punisher oriented mentality of power might suggest that such a capability would be something they’d totally cream their pants over.</p>

<p>There are a billion ways for the state to fuck with someone or shut them up if they want to, it seems to me gang stalking is the least effective and most expensive option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with that argument is, of course, that it means a lack of evidence they are being stalked becomes evidence they are being stalked.</p>

<p>No. They are otherwise unremarkable people who are deluded. If they were people who presented an <strong>actual threat</strong> to the establishment it would be easier to take a little more seriously. Nothing against them personally, but if they weren&#39;t uploading their paranoia to YouTube and making blogs about their supposed victimhood no one would know they exist, and that includes TPTB.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said in my other comment, gang stalking does occur. A group of friends and extended family members gets together to torment an individual. To the person being stalked, almost all of these stalkers are complete strangers. They contact each other when the target individual goes out of the house and they do small things to attract the attention of the target, such as giving him the finger, or blowing the horn on their car as he passes, or cursing under their breath as he walks by ... little things that can&#39;t be proven to be coherent hostile acts, and therefore the target has nothing to take to the police. It does happen, but of course it is not the organized stalking of thousands of paid professional stalkers that some of the people talk about. That&#39;s ridiculous. But never be surprised at the lengths a group of red-necked  trailer trash will go to just to amuse themselves as someone else&#39;s expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gang stalking is a lie. A huge lie.  Most of the websites online are part of a massive disinformation campaign.  These are actually psychological operations.  The gang stalking hallucination, the result of carefully crafted hypnotic suggestions, is used as a diversion, so that the target does not notice the subtle changes in their own behavior.  These groups also use this &quot;hypnotizing&quot; technique to seek out revenge, not just exclusively for treatment.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what actually happens:
1) The target is observed by the attackers
2) They are lured to a particular venue
3) They are then hit with &quot;it&quot;.. could be &quot;just hypnosis&quot; or combined with something else
