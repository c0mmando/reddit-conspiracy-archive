       The DEA, and 99% of official sources tries to play it off as a Mexican drug problem, blatentlt trying to keep the last few investigative journalists left from looking too deep into the CIAs drug trafficking.  All of the info is on Google. It's sickening what happened to this country.. Opiate wise, since the "war on terror". I feel this is the biggest issue of our time, and no 'presidential candidate' ever utters the words.
      </p>
      <p>
       The enemy is "Islamic extremism"?? Yeah fucking right. It's massive clandestine heroin and opium transactions being made by the CIA. The NYTIMES pretty much cracked the case, with a couple of unconnected articles that no one hardly puts together. I've been saying this for years now.. But it's too obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       MAXIMIZE OPIUM PRODUCTION IN AFGAHNISTAN.

      <p>
       Analyze markerplace.. Realize that heroin has a bad name...
OVERPRODUCE OXYCODONE
flood market.
Crackdown on oxycodone
Flood market with cheap pure heroin.
Never ever ever talk about it.
10+ yrs later, whole entire generations are utterly decimated.
War in Middle East rages on, war for our souls and health becomes overkill.
      </p>
      <p>
       ONCE it's too obvious to ignore, hold a congressional hearing with DEA and blame mexico while allocating 1%... YES ONE PERCENT, OF FUNDS TO COMBAT DRUGS on fixing the problem..
      </p>
      <p>
       Completely allow the 7 or 8 pharma Giants who helped, and most likely conspired, to expand the opiate marketplace to all youth.. Now REGUARDLESS of race.. Which is new.. To GET OFF SCOT FREE WITH MULTI BILLIONS.
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERYONE KEEPS DYING
BILLIONS MAYBE TRILLIONS MADE
MIDDLE EAST CONTROLLED

BLAME EVERYONE AMD EVERYWHERE EXCEPT WHERE 90 FUCKING PERCENT OF OPIUM COMES FROM SINCE 2002... And ONLY AT THESE RATES STARTING AFTER 2002.. With well documented rise and usa aided opium production
CIA USING MONEY FOR (???????)..

       This shit is what makes me thing some form of electronic gangstalking type shit is real. They have the funds, and the sickening will to LITERALLY TORTURE a human beings soul.

       Opiates are the ideal drug to introduce to maintain a docile populace. You don't really have to give them healthcare - just numb 'em up on painkillers and send them back to work. Eventually they OD or die from an untreated condition the drugs were masking. Once people are addicted to opiates they're chained to the system that exploits them - can't really have a revolution if everyone's first priority is their next fix.

       Yeah it's al of that, AND the fact that if you stop, if your even mentally capable of WANTING to stoo, like most of my friends ARENT... It's two weeks straight of SEVERE health issues, followed by about two weeks of other serious issues. If they take away the oxycodone and heroin.. We grovel at their feet. Or we die..unable to keep our families safe.. Kicking dope mid event (weather event, financial crisis, etc etc)

       I think I just read that opiates are often the start for future heroine addicts...read it somewhere here on Reddit just recently.  I had always suspected the Afghan link since heroine use skyrocketed when we entered that country and by all reasonable conclusions use should have decreased.

       Opiates like oxycodone and morphine are chemically extremely similar to heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heroin is really just diacetylmorphine, which makes it more lipophillic and easier to get into your nervous system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Endorphins in your system were named after morphone (endogenous morphine).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Allies also got the patent for heroin (and aspirin) from Bayer in 1919 as war reparations.
      </p>
      <p>
       TYL a bunch of shit about morphine.

       The heroin is coming in from the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even have an old friend who used to be a high-level dealer but NEVER used whom I don't keep in contact with anymore really. He tells me that, in Chicago at least, its 99.999% CIA dope laundered through Nigerians.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy really. The Mexicans have limited access to acetic anhydride. This is why Mexican dope is almost all "tar."
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA has an unlimited supply of AA...this is why the vast majority of the US no longer has access to tar (you only really see it in border states) and PLENTY of access to extremely high quality "china"--it's dope made with acetic anhydride.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, the goal in Afghanistan is to KEEP THE POPPIES BLOOMING AT ALL COSTS. This was the reason for the overthrow of the Taliban; it, of course, had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with "terror" and everything whatsoever to get as many Americans as possible addicted to heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tl;Dr: It's an open secret. The war in Afghanistan has EVERYTHING to do with massive drug funds from that country.

       I have noticed this trend as well.. Sooo many fucking people and their friends are getting hooked on heroin. I hear about a new over dose almost every other day of people I knew. A lot of the addictions start from opiate  pain killers etc then they switch to heroin. I highly believe it is being brought in from an outside force (dea or cia) it sucks because its a revolving door. Flood streets with heroin -&gt; drug laws throw those people in jail, or they resort to theft, etc -&gt; families destroyed, people kept down and out because of this addiction -&gt; ??? Profit for the sick fucks. It's extremely fucked up, and it all benefits those fuckers in the end. Profiting off the suffering while also putting them in jail. Sad state of affairs.

       I took 10mg hydrocodone for almost 2 years due to multiple surgeries, and while I never seriously entertained it, I realized it was probably $10 and a couple blocks away when I finally ran out and my prescription was stopped. Kratom and weed seemed like a better option to get me off completely than to "manage it myself" with heroin. I'm sure others are weaker and not as well educated.

       This is a very dangerous point of view because it implies that if your income is better than that, you'll have some resistance to opiate addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       No social class is resistant to this stuff.  In fact, the middle and upper income classes are riddled with it, perhaps due to this very attitude.  They tend to trust their doctor and don't take addiction very seriously.  After all, their doctor prescribed it so it must be safe, right?

       You missed my point all together in lieu of attempting to dismantle a misinterpretation. The idea was to suggest to OP that a shifting of perspective may be required to fully grasp the heroin epidemic sweeping through our culture.

       Oh no, I didn't miss your point at all.  It's just wrong, and very misleading to suggest it.  Being from Maine, you should know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Addiction is usually something that afflicts poorer classes. This one, however, hits middle and upper classes as well.  Part of the reason it is proving so hard to stamp out is the widespread denial among these classes that they are even susceptible to problems like heroin addiction.

       This isn't the danger period for you.  Wait a few weeks.  Maybe months.  Wait until work is draining you and you feel tired and your boss just pissed you off.  And that fucking surgery still hurts after all this time.  And the car needs to be fixed.  And your partner has some sudden health issues.  You're tired, irritable, overworked, underpaid, and there's no end in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember what it felt like to be happy after the surgery?  One pill, a few hours of peace.  Hmm.  Maybe just a couple off the darknet?

       That's how it happens.

       There are certain factors that can predispose an individual to substance abuse and addiction. Just be thankful you haven't gone down that road. It does't usually
       <em>
        start
       </em>
       with someone getting prescribed painkillers. That's just one possible step of a long journey that involves things going wrong long before and long after the first use of a particular substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were someone predisposed to substance abuse in the first place, you might be feeling like this is something you'd like to do again. You wouldn't be thinking "I'm gonna go score some heroin now". That stuff is scary. But if you started hanging out with some new people who could get you more painkillers and then some of them started using heroin and telling you about how great it feels, it might feel a little bit more normal to you to make that upgrade. Heck, someone might even be nice enough to shoot it for you your first time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a speculative fiction. This is real life. I've seen friends go down this road several times and I've been lucky to hold on to reality well enough to not walk it with them. Doctor's prescriptions are not usually the entryway, but they are occasionally. But they are very often a step along the road for someone who's already on it. There's got to be something going wrong first, though. If everything's alright, most people don't just become drug addicts, even to drugs with withdrawal effects.

       This is the story of why there's such a big heroin problem in the U.S., especially among the middle class populations. People start doing oxy, thinking they won't get addicted, it's not a big deal, it's not "heroin." Then said people become addicted to oxy and eventually turn to dope and turn to the needle because it's cheaper and more accessible and far too many of these people end up dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have multiple friends who have died because of this cycle and others who are hopelessly addicted and it's devastating to see friends of mine because dumb, happy addicted consumers. Most of these people spend their time working shitty jobs, spend most of their money on drugs and spend their free time getting high, eating junk food, playing video games and watching sports and other things on TV, slowly becoming more mindless and soft. They're not only unaware of many of the important things going on in the world, but when these things are brought to their attention, they don't give a shit because they have this comfortable lazy lifestyle that they've become accustomed to... Until their friends start dropping like flies.

       Going back about 7 years ago, I watch an interview on TV of all places about the possibility of Marijuana becoming legal in the US and what it would mean for the Mexican drug cartels.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just so happened they were remotely interviewing one of the big Mexican drug lords...and I can't remember who it was unfortunately. This drug lord said that if the US ever made Marijuana legal, they would flood the market with cheap heroine to balance the loss of profits from their Marijuana business....I guess they kept their promise??

       IF the government was really concerned about the addiction problem, and not about abusing the made up war on drugs in order to gather information on people and justify their expense, they would be putting treatment and rehab out there,not harassing manufacturers and pharmacies and preventing pain patients from receiving medication.

       I sold oxycontin since I was 16 years old. The government was going to phase out the old ones and replace them with new "tamper resistant pills". Being the young entrepreneur I was, I decided to purchase and hoard all the oxy I could so that once the price skyrocketed I could triple my money. As soon as the pipe ran dry BOOM! heroin conveniently flooded the streets and it was like pharm grade pure shit. Im telling you that they waited for the right time before unleashing a huge tsunami of heroin onto the public. Before the oxy was phased out heroin was a rarity in my area.

       Getting heroin from across the globe, and masking it under black markets and drug cartels is the cheapest way for big pharmas to import it for pharmaceutical production ingredients (

      </p>
      <p>
       Introducing bits of it to the public in pure form is either a distraction, or just a coincidental benefit to the para-military police forces across the Western world. If the US wanted to solve the drug problem they could, they just choose not to, so that the pharmaceutical industry can keep importing tariff-free drugs, and the military industrial complex can supply mil-grade weapons to police while in the doldrums of war.

       I disagree that ALL heroin comes from Afghanistan. If you're on the east coast United States you'll find powdered heroin. Southern and western U.S.  you will find black tar heroin. Black tar is coming from Mexico and east coast powder comes from many sources.1 def being the Middle East.

       It is being grown in Afghanistan,  but most of it is coming into the US

       If you read any non biased news source, they say that the heroin comes from afghan and is shipped THROUGH Mexico. I'm surrounded by the stuff.. It's not Mexican grown. I'm sorry but there is an obvious attempt to make it look like the invasion of afghan and the opium production has zero to do with the rise in heroin in the USA along the same time period. It's nonsense.

       Lol that's absolutely retarded to say that. Poppy production has never been higher in Mexico or South America. Afghanistan heroin is not the same type that's in the USA !!! What don't you understand. It's #3 or freebase . If you find that in the United States then I will believe you. USA has tar which is from Mexico. And ecp or east coast powder . Which is from Colombia. Both are #4 not #3. Think whatever you want but your just wrong .

       If your right, I want to stop saying I'm right. I don't want to argue. And I don't want to be wrong.. I apologize if I came off like a jerk, but can you help sway my opinion, and turn my view into fact? I obviously need help if I am that wrong. This issue is really really big to me and so many of my friends are dying. I really need to know where it's coming from. Can you explain to me and show me objective reports that show that it is in fact Mexican grown poppy and not Afghanistan. Please. I will really be better off

       Sure I'll try to explain it for you. You just have to look at the type of heroin which is coming into the United States. I'm not sure what part of the country your in but if it's west coast or some areas north of Texas . You'll see black tar heroin. This is made in Mexico by the cartels.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       If your on the east coast you'll see a powder type heroin known as ecp. Or east coast powder. Now both of these are called #4 heroin . The Ecp is the salt which dissolves in water . So does tar so it is also considered #4. Ecp comes from Colombia through Mexico and the Dominican Republic . Here's some articles about the growing poppy cultivation in Latin America .

      <p>
       Now Afghanistan heroin is what is refered to as #3 heroin. This is the freebase form. This type of heroin is not seen in the United States . But if you go to Europe , that is what they have over there. No tar no powder . Just freebase or #3. The difference is with the freebase you need Citric acid to dissolve it to prepare for iv. As opposed to just water as with tar and ecp. I hope this helps.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bottom line is just by seeing what type of heroin is in the USA and Europe. You'll know where it's coming from and where it's going.

       "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the narcotic painkiller OxyContin for pediatric use. The regulatory agency reported the drug is safe for children as young as 11, [after pressure from Purdue Pharma]."
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The approval is for children 11 and older who are already tolerating a minimum daily dose of at least 20 milligrams per day." 
In other words, the kids who are popping opiates on a daily basis, and who have built up a tolerance (guaranteed addiction).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         "The agency says that with extended-release OxyContin, a child may require two doses a day, versus four to six of the immediate-release version of the drug." Holy fuck, they want these kids to re-up a lot of times on a daily basis! According to wikipedia, "The risk of experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms is high if a patient has become physically dependent or addicted and discontinues oxycodone abruptly.

       "In May 2007 [Purdue Pharma] pleaded guilty to misleading the public about Oxycontin's risk of addiction, and agreed to pay $600 million in one of the largest pharmaceutical settlements in U.S. history."

       I'm not rocket scientist, but it seems as if an Opium War is coming to Americans. Last time it was the Brits against the Chinese. Now it is the Globalists against Americans. BTW, Time magazine had a recent article about increasing Heroin ODs in the US. Let's not forget Afghanistan's role in the supply chain.

       You know what's better than oxycodone? Or morphine? Or heroin for that matter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Staying sober. Enjoying life like a child. Discovering new ideas and concepts. Travelling to new countries. Making new friends you can trust and repy on. Seriously.
      </p>

       It makes me regret I tried a bit of poppy seed tea out of curiosity I found myself getting addicted to. Never looked back since and quitted cold turkey when I found out accodentally it had magical synergy with cacao beans. The effects were exactly like what they said a heroin rush would be but much more blissfully euphoric because serotonin and anandamide. I actually said to my friend that day I'm so fucking happy I could fall asleep. And I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I dont regret quitting - not one bit. Life is better and not worth ODing over. If i ever touch it again it'll only be in the hospital room after a major op. The painkilling effects are that effective that's what they're intended for.

       Sure it isn't. Since 2002 heroin addiction and related deaths skyrocketed, exactly as the opium production in AFGHANISTAN ..NOT MEXICO.. Completely revamped fields and gained 95% market share. Mexico has marijuana, and POSSIBLY is used as a HUB to bring the AFGHAN dope into the states, but the U.S. gov doesn't say its a hub, they say it's EL CHAPO.. And that my friend, is bullshit

       You really do not know what your talking about. Black tar is made from opium(possibly from the opium from Afghanistan) but is much lower quality and completely different than afghan heroin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghan heroin is very good pure dope. Black tar is not. Mexico exports black tar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm done arguing with people who are connecting the dots on their own with no fucking real clue about what they are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe what you want. But it's just simply not true. The U.S. Does not have any afghan heroin In it. At all. We have 2 completely different types of heroin in the U.S.  And brown freebase afghan heroin is not one of them.

       They're actually correct that the majority of Heroin in the US comes from Latin America by way of Mexico. Afghanistan may produce 85% of the world's heroin, but the US and Canada combined only consume about 6% of the world's heroin, and most of their 6% comes from the 5-10% of global heroin production that comes out of Latin America. Another significant portion comes into West Cost ports from Central and East Asia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of Afghanistan's Heroin production is thought to go to feeding the massive demand in Russia, China, and the rest of Europe, which together account for 3/5 of global demand.

       I do apologize if this is a stupid question, but I've taken oxy multiple times and have never felt a high &amp; never felt addicted or like I needed my fix. I don't understand the drug. It does absolutely nothing. If you can't handle the pain of life when you're healthy, well then... that's a problem. But I just don't understand how this drug is addicting.

       About 10% of the population doesn't have the enzymes to process opiates. It is just passing through your system and not being converted. You would probably have to take much higher doses to feel an effect if this is the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the extended release drugs have so many compounds in them now to keep people from abusing them, that they almost don't even work. It has made them much weaker.

       guys approach this with common sense. Shipping opium from the mideast doesn't make much profit, if you're trying to get it to the US. It's cheaper to get it from mexico. Most of the mideast staff goes to europe/russia/india/china.

       because processing is cheaper in china. and half of the chicken actually stays in china. america eats more white meat. the dark meat was sent over to china anyway. so the cost to send back the white meat was offset by how cheap it is to process in china. The math works out.

       It cant be cheaper to ship it from the other side of the planet, than to ship from next door. it's. just. common. sense.

       Secret illuminati lizard people do not pack up all the heroin in Afghanistan, and fly it away from 3.5 billion possible customers in Asia &amp; Europe, so it can be used by the US. The tin foil conspiracy can't hold up on paper. Businessmen run numbers. I wish this sub did.

       Okay, ship supplies to forces overseas; ship drugs back instead of empty cargo ships. The math seems easy enough. Selling to other foreign nations could expose the operation, but they might be doing it anyways. Who knows? All we know is that the CIA has a history of profiting on illegal drugs here in the states.

       south america is the only place that you can find coca leaves. Afghanistan is not the only place you can find heroin. It's cheaper to get it from Mexico.

       The point is that there is a huge demand to ship supplies to Afghanistan -- more demand going that direction than to come back. Obviously, we need the ships to return in order to continue supplying, but are the ships returning as full as they left? Probably not, and that's where shipping gets cheap again.

       To be fair we get all the powdered heroin from Columbia. It's not about the cost of shipping or the distance one bit. It's just what groups of people are working together and have a partnership set up to distribute.

       Some of these people are so fucking stupid. Look at the replies I'm getting. Assumptions after assumptions of people connecting the dots on their own and acting like they are drug experts. One guy says Mexico has weed only. And only is a hub to bring in afghan heroin....  Wow. Just wow. Dude probably has never even seen heroin in his life

       I never said it is the only place. I said its where I am, and when I was told that 95% of all opium production comes from one place but doesn't reach america, I made the point that it does, and it's over saturated.. Ultra flooded..I am sure the UK is also.. And many other countries.  My post is specifically about the connection between he war on terror-Afghanistan-big pharmas 2002ish overproduction of oxycodone 30mg tablets, a orchestrated police crackdown with a instant herion flood into all areas of America, to places that have never seen heroin, to people who historically and normally would never consider or have a real chance to consider heroin.. All in a split second, at the EXACT moment that opium production in one country, THAT WE CONTROL, expanded at insane speeds to insane volume, under direction of an agency with former ties to clandestine CRACK COCAINE RUNNING.. Just do some reading man.. Don't take my word for it.. I'm not laying out the greatest evidence ever.. And I may sound like a jerk.. But I've been watching my city, and multiple oh her cities, simultaneously, instantly, becomes overtaken by one particular poison... And after hundreds of deaths and arrests and prison sentences, I researched, and found out about afghans opium situation.. And how we helped grow the fields, while claiming we were going to destroy them..because "afghans have no other jobs"... The heroin in all major U.S. cities and suburbs right now may be partly from South America and elsewhere .. But I can almost guarentee it's mostly afghanistan

       Yeah when the US starts going to war with Afghanistan, warehouse of opium needed to be liquidated because it was no longer safe to store there. The afgan people needed guns and explosives. That's what happens when people amp up for war. They sell what they won't need so that they can buy what they do need. it's just simple logic.

       People get prescribed painkillers, then they get hooked until they can't afford the street pills, then they switch to heroine because the massive supply keeps it cheap. They don't usually choose to inject heroine right away, or choose to get surgery that requires prescription painkillers.

       Not sure which part of the comment you think is weak.  He said they switch to heroin because it is cheap, which is true.  They can't afford the street pills like oxy because they are expense, which is also true.

       Actually, thats not entirely accurate.  Few people graduate from painkillers to heroine. Most painkiller addicts are normal needle fearing folks who developed a gnarly habit... with no shortage of doctors, "usual suppliers", peeps get "pharmacy quality" pills for years...on-time &amp; unabated.
      </p>

       Needles requires a trip down to the shitty side of town, where cops play drug cowboy Vs asphalt urchins: heads, holes, spikers, tweakers, clucks, Vatos, G monies and dumbfucks.  In the hood un licensed pharmacists of 'drug dealer' repute act as "unusual suppliers" who dispense adulterated opiate products of varying / questionable quality on an irregular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       All opiate addicts fear withdrawals more than needles tho.  A 'normal' pill popping physically addicted soccer mom will not hesitate to pluck a needle out of a dead guys arm, kick another bitches ass, and slam a "FPW" (Fresh Puncture Wound) into her virgin veins... to avoid withdrawals.

       This is actually usually how people start using heroin. This and snorting it. Then will go to the needle after a while of using and want a bigger rush or just any rush as the rush starts to go away from those route of administration. And you use a lot less but it's usually about the rush of it and wanting to get high rather than just well

       The market will never 'go away', prohibition is a time tested historically vetted unmitigated failure, used for fake drug wars, leverage over the masses...blah blah. Everyone is an opiate addict, our brains like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the proper dose of Narcan.. Even you will experience opiate withdrawals, sweating bullets &amp; hallucinating necrotic babies crawling on the ceiling.. like a hard core Heroin addict. Narcan  blocks your brain from receiving your brains locally produced shit.

       Ah, one of the lucky few not susceptible to addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize that something like 2% of our population gets addicted to anything, right?  When a doctor proscribes them synthetic heroin, known as OxyContin, they get addicted.
      </p>

       Your "solution" is naive.

       You didn't even add anything. Just saying false? Back up your claim. I know what I'm talking about. People in the states don't add citric acid to their dope to shoot up. That is something you need to do with the base form of heroin that is being exported from
The Middle East.

       It (heroin) comes off the Air America airplanes, goes right in the door of labs either in or on the periphery of air bases, then by truck to CIA-controlled distribution points.

       And no shit it's coming in on airplanes...  The heroin comes from certain places. And the places I said it comes from is where it originates. The CIA being in on it has nothing to do with that. If you think the CIA is making black Mexican tar heroin your wrong. The CIA allows them to do it and is in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your point doesn't invalidate anything I said about where it's coming from. You don't find afghan heroin H-3 in the states at all unless it's from a smaller time dealer who imported some himself. The main distribution is from the Mexicans and Colombians. Plain and simple. The CIA works with them. Same with the afghan heroin but that stuff goes to Europe.

       and even if it is coming from Afghanistan the drug cartels probably sell it through Mexico, it likely doesn't go directly into America from Afghanistan hence why the DEA would focus efforts on Mexico

       Please do share where u think heroin is coming from then that's in the states? I would love to hear what you think. The dope that's being made in the Middle East is going to Europe. The type of heroin in the states in tar coming from Mexico. Or h-4 coming from Columbia. Sure maybe a bit can come from other places but rarely and the main importers are bringing it in from those sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me why you think otherwise? It's pretty well known to addicts in the know.

       Its composition was the reason I still think conspiracy theorists are a little weird even though I love conspiracy theories myself. I look at it as things that are possible, but unprovable. I regard all the different theories for the millions of different things and the people espousing them as a sort of folk art, like Americana but without a real national identity. The people really interest me the most. They're always kook, god I love a good kook lol. The best are old lady kooks

       Sure it isn't. Since 2002 heroin addiction and related deaths skyrocketed, exactly as the opium production in AFGHANISTAN ..NOT MEXICO.. Completely revamped fields and gained 95% market share. Mexico has marijuana, and POSSIBLY is used as a HUB to bring the AFGHAN dope into the states, but the U.S. gov doesn't say its a hub, they say it's EL CHAPO.. And that my friend, is bullshit

       Lol that's absolutely retarded to say that. Poppy production has never been higher in Mexico or South America. Afghanistan heroin is not the same type that's in the USA !!! What don't you understand. It's #3 or freebase . If you find that in the United States then I will believe you. USA has tar which is from Mexico. And ecp or east coast powder . Which is from Colombia. Both are #4 not #3. Think whatever you want but your just wrong .
