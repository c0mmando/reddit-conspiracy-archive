<p>Before the financial crisis of 2008, Citigroup talked up two hedge funds with investors, saying the investments carried about the same risk as municipal bonds.</p>

<p>The pitch worked wonderfully for Citigroup, which wound up pulling in almost $3 billion for the ASTA/MAT fund and the Falcon fund from 2002 to 2007. Then Wall Street crashed the following year, and the 4,000 people who invested in the hedge funds watched them collapse along with their investments. Even as the funds were tanking, they took in another $110 million from investors, according to Courthouse News Service.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went after Citigroup for making false and misleading claims about the funds and fined the corporation $180 million, or about 6% of the amount Citigroup flushed down the financial toilet via those funds.</p>

<p>“Advisers at these Citigroup affiliates were supposed to be looking out for investors’ best interests, but falsely assured them they were making safe investments even when the funds were on the brink of disaster,” Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement.</p>

<p>An internal Citibank rating showed the investment posed a significant risk to principal, Bloomberg reported. In addition, one of the funds was seeking a loan to stay afloat.</p>

<p>“We are pleased to have resolved this matter,” Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg.</p>

<p>They should be pleased. Not only did they get to settle the fine for pennies on the dollar but Citigroup did not have to admit or deny the SEC’s claims in agreeing to settle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was taken down from r/News because it is a very misleading title.  Citigroup did not steal the $3BB, that money basically disappeared when those funds imploded.  They did make money off of commissions and management fees for the shares they sold, and the fine reflects that amount, ensuring that Citigroup did not profit from its fraudulent marketing of the funds.</p>

<p>I hate to be the one defending a corrupt financial institution, but I won&#39;t allow lies  to be paraded around as the truth, because that does not promote progress or justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but clawing back ill-gotten gains should be a no-brainer start to the punishment. If I steal, at a minimum, you should have to give that back. The commissions are the stealing part. The issue that disturbs me and countless others is that there is NO jail time for these crimes.  A petty thief robs a bank and goes to jail. A banker manipulates the system and causes billions in losses and they just pay fines and avoid jail. This is clearly not fair and is the prime example of how there are two systems of &quot;justice&quot; in America, one for the rich and connected and one for the rest of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the jail time sentiment and believe that those who knew of this fraud should be held criminally responsible for their fiduciary imprudence.  I just didn&#39;t want people to get the idea that Citigroup executives fraudulently made off with billions of dollars and were only forced to pay back a small percentage of that.  The fine ensures that they did not profit from this, but does nothing as far as punishing them beyond that.</p>
