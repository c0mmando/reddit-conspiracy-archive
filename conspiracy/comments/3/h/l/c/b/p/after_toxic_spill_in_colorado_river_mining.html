       The Animus River mine waste spill has drawn attention to a loophole in federal law that dates to the 1800s and has allowed mining companies to avoid paying to clean up the mess they leave behind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Gold King mine, which was the source of the 3 million gallons of orange toxic waste that spilled into the Animus River in Colorado, is just one of half a million abandoned and inactive hardrock mines in the U.S., according to the environmental group Earthworks. But the government can’t force the companies that operated these mines to pay because of the
       <a href="https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Act%20Of%20May%2010,%201872-%28Mining%20Law%20Of%201872%29.pdf">
        1872 Mining Law
       </a>
       (pdf), which allows corporations to mine for minerals on public lands but does not require them to pay to restore the land once they’re done with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Under this outdated law, mining companies are able to extract billions of dollars of minerals on America’s public lands essentially for free, often with no liability for environmental cleanup,” Claire Moser, research and advocacy associate with the public lands team at the Center for American Progress, told ClimateProgress. “The Animas spill disaster highlights the broader need for reform of this 143-year-old law to ensure that taxpayers receive a fair share of publicly-owned resources and that mining companies are responsible for cleanup.”
      </p>
      <p>
       One congressman is trying to change this. Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Arizona) has introduced HR 963, the
       <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/963">
        Hardrock Mining Reform and Reclamation Act of 2015
       </a>
       , which would charge the mining industry a reclamation fee that would generate $200 million annually for abandoned mine restoration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t hold out too much hope that Grijalva’s bill will advance, though. A similar effort in 2007 passed the House but couldn’t get through the Senate, according to the Christian Science Monitor. The 2015 version has no Republican co-sponsors, making it an unlikely candidate to advance through the GOP-controlled Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earthworks estimates it will take $32 billion to $72 billion to clean up all such abandoned hardrock mines in the United States. Congress, using figures from the Environmental Protection Agency, puts the range at a still-enormous $20 billion to $54 billion.

       Since the EPA screwed caused the leak, why should the company pay for it? Normally I'd be all for punching the corp in the dick over this kind of thing, but this time, regulators fucked up.

       Oh, I think that company should face some consequences for what I imagine to be a lengthy list of infractions, but if they didn't cause this spill, directly, and someone else did...that party should be held liable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tax payers pay for regulations and enforcement, and if they won't see to it that their employees do it right, then they should pay.

       What I got out of this is that if the laws were different the company would have been on the hook for restoration. The entire disaster might not have happened, but if it did the taxpayers wouldn't be footing the bill.

       These mines have been leaking the same stuff into the Animas river system for decades. The EPA was in the midst of cleaning up an environmental disaster zone when they triggered a site hazard left behind by a delinquent corporate owner.

       It's very akin to how companies didn't have to pay for the carbon, methane, mercury, etc gasses they used to emit in the production of their goods and services. Some of the pollution (cleanup and/or damages) is now covered by regulations and other laws, but they're not fully comprehensive yet.

       The 1872 mining law may be outdated in parts, but it's purpose is to protect small miners from overregulation and abuse at the hands of government officials and large mining companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately large companies abuse the law as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake though, the epa has a hardon to put a stop to all mining if possible. As though operating a one-man dredge is an environmental catastrophe. And nobody's using mercury or cyanide in the streams anymore so inb4 that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, usfs doesn't grant new claims without a Plan of Operation which includes a projected reclamation schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion: these guys might be jerks, but 1872 mining law should be left alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, but if the federal gov was serious about fixing the economy, they'd create CCC and TVA like groups to ethically mine, log, harvest and quarry the national forests and divert the resources toward massive civil projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       That'll never happen though because "muh scenic views".

       the epa is owned and operated bye the companys. to safeguard against anyone finding out they have been ignoring the laws for so long.  look who runs the fda ,for instance. former Monsanto employees. or the cdc.wich has tons of big pharma execs running the show. the epa doing what they did relieved the company of responsibility and transfered the responsibility to the taxpayer. and in the process created a whole new industry for itself in cleaning this thing up.   super fund any one?

       Yeah, about that. The toxins that collected in the closed mines leach at a constant low rate. This normally causes no problems, but is partially why the mines were abandoned. What the EPA did was break the dam they knew the 3M gallons of natural seepage contained...deliberately. The whole thing was another attempt to cause/claim a problem where none exists. This one just blew up in their faces.

       And then somehow this is proclaimed as a failure of the "free market."  No, this happens because of statutory exemption from damages.  The problem -- as always -- is government.

       Exemption from damages is the natural state of the market. It takes some form of authority outside the market to impose that kind of restitution. You can't say that government itself is inherently the problem when it exempts companies from damages it might otherwise impose. The problem is the type of government and the motives of the people  in it, specifically those who are there to make sure things run smoothly for moneyed business interests.

       False.  The natural state of the market is to hold people accountable for injuries they cause to others.  This is the case anywhere we have a system of community-derived law.  There are countless examples of this in indigenous cultures across the globe.

      <p>
       Insert Western-style government, and suddenly we have restrictions and limitations of liability.  This is an idea exclusive to the West, and it only applies to Western governments who claim the right to be above the law, to mold the law to suite their purposes, and to grant exemptions from the law to other entities (such as corporations).

      <p>
       This is an artificial distortion.

       And just how does the market hold people accountable in a case like this? People hold people accountable and they do it mostly through non-market mechanisms.

       I'm not saying that accountability is only possible through western governance. Not sure where you got that impression. I'm just saying that there is no method but boycott for the market to resolve such issues. For indigenous people to have community-derived laws that hold people accountable for the harm they cause others is
       <em>

       an example of the free market at work. It's an example of people working together to develop and promote a communitarian ethic.
