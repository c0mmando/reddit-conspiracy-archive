<p>He should just stick to his boring low brow shtick, at least that worked for him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While your post was harsh, I can&#39;t totally disagree, I have noticed that he is trying to get more &#39;controversial&#39; lately and &#39;political&#39;.  I don&#39;t hate his stuff, but his approach is still very much based on the rhythm of more low-brow jokes and it feels a little bit forced.  Carlin had the ability to distil things down and almost trick you into agreeing with him before realizing he just made you question everything you believed in.  Hicks was a bit more &#39;in your face&#39; but he had so much passion and conviction and a great delivery so it also worked.  Burr sometimes just feels like he is trying too hard - like it isn&#39;t natural for him.  Carlin and Hicks just felt like they were talking to you completely free-form even when it was a bit that they did over and over again.  </p>

<p>edit: and yes, he probably isn&#39;t quite as smart as they are either.  But he is funny sometimes so I will listen when he comes on the George Carlin pandora station instead of wasting a skip.</p>
