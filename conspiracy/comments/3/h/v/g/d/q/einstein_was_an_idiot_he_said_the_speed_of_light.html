<p>Since Einstein said the speed of light is the maximum speed and nothing can travel faster than this how the fuck the galaxies and galaxy clusters can form and exist?</p>

<p>But even on fucking earth</p>

<p>Earth is at approximately 8minutes light speed from the sun, yet earth &quot;knows&quot; where the sun is &quot;right fucking now!&quot; so he can orbit correctly and not remain behind.</p>

<p>if earth is tied to the sun due to the gravity, the gravity is instantaneous? Because it appear so.</p>

<p>If gravity is instantaneous or at leas close to it then the speed of light limit is fucking bullocks!</p>

<p>So how the fuck all those scientist, learning about this in their fancy universities missed this fucking obvious logical fact?</p>

<p><strong>Late Note: Apparently is how it is. Just because someone is perceived as famous, then one need to stop their thinking and accept whatever that dude said.

<p>The actual physical evidence that seems to show that &quot;something&quot; travels faster than light is a phenomenon that &quot;idiot&quot; Einstein predicted in 1935 and called &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;. We now know it as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">Quantum Entanglement</a>.</p>

<p>Oh.. I forgot to mention that we also know that space expands at a pace faster than the speed of light, so that&#39;s interesting, too.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s set the science discussion aside for a moment and evaluate just that statement, especially since we&#39;re having this discussion within the context of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... and all that entails.</p>

<p>Were you aware that, as a general rule, the more educated a person is, the more likely they are to be politically progressive? And that the more educated an area is, the more likely it is to elect progressive candidates?</p>

<p>Conversely, the less educated a person or area is, the more conservative they tend to be.</p>

<p>There are exceptions, obviously, but those are the general rules.</p>

<p>Now if we&#39;re arguing for LESS education, we&#39;re actually arguing for MORE conservativism. More conservatism translates roughly into more onerous government activity including more NSA and more military activity and conflict. It also translates roughly into less beneficial government activity - less concern for the underpriveleged and unlucky and less infrastructure development and maintenance. Finally, it translates into more onerous social constructs, like more prevalence of religion.</p>

<p>I would think that the things that &quot;less education&quot; would bring to bear would be exactly the opposite of what a community like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, which seems to be primarily concerned with the problem of the oppression of the &quot;masses&quot; for the benefit or entertainment of the &quot;elite&quot; few, would want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conservatism and liberalism <em>both</em> push for more onerous government, just in different ways. Two sides of a bullshit coin.</p>

<p>We need to recognize that much of the purpose of &quot;education&quot; is to indoctrinate the student with lies, with a false picture of history, with a false view of science, with a false view of politics. If you&#39;ve been filled up with that, you&#39;re gonna need to purge yourself of it before making any meaningful progress outside of the &quot;acceptable&quot; scientific norms.</p>

<p>Ideally, one would go through the whole &quot;education&quot; process wide-awake, with the ability to pick through the propaganda and keep the nuggets of truth. It&#39;s just a hard thing to raise a kid who&#39;s wide awake by, say, age 5 or 6.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not all false.</p>

<p>Much of the purpose of the (American public) education system today does seem to be to enforce conformity and obedience. I have called the American public schools &quot;Meat Puppet Factories&quot; for a good, long while.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s not a good reason for LESS education. It&#39;s a good reason to FIX education.</p>

<p>Even as they&#39;re teaching that conformity and obedience, they&#39;re also teaching real stuff, too. The geography is real. The science is real (unless you live in Texas). The math is real.</p>

<p>What they&#39;re not teaching is <strong>how</strong> to think. Logic. Rational thought. Skepticism in the absence of evidence. How to research an issue, including how and why to research information that you are predisposed to agree with.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yeah, I think we&#39;re probably on the same page. We home-schooled our daughter until her Freshman year in high school. By that point, she understood how to think, how to be skeptical, how to research, how to see through the bullshit. This enabled her to learn a lot in high school and to excel there and in college and now grad school, and how to be a good, upstanding, compassionate, THINKING human being in the process.</p>

<p>I know only ONE kid who&#39;s gone through the whole public school system who I have similar hope for. She&#39;s smart and cynical, but still too quiet and unprepared to stand up for herself. My daughter and I are working on those last two with her. =)</p>

<p>But still... the answer isn&#39;t LESS education. It&#39;s fixing education so it&#39;s less indoctrination and more knowledge and logic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% agree that the real answer is to <em>fix</em> (public) education. And of course public education teaches some real knowledge. But they also teach a very slanted worldview. </p>

<p>In all my 19 years of education, we never once talked about private central banking and its role in warfare. Or the dangers of fractional reserve banking of debt-laden fiat currency. We never discussed Holofractal Theory (<a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>) or sacred geometry. Not. One. Time. I got a good dose of math, but Common Core is essentially teaching kids that math is impossible for them to learn.</p>

<p>Fixing education would be grand. But if that&#39;s not an option -- and it&#39;s not -- then would you recommend MORE or LESS indoctrinating  education?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly what he was and what he did. He re-applied Brownian motion to another phenomenon that had been explored by scientists going back to the 1840s. He plagiarized work he gleaned while working in a patent office and wholly misrepresented Lagrangian transforms while failing to comprehend his own special relativity. He then goes on to formulate a description of gravity using systems of spacial geometry. In his entire career, he was constantly stressed by the failure of his theory. Yet, it is the true doofuses who continue to exalt a theory that even its author admitted was wrong for good reasons. It&#39;s like you can&#39;t progress, you&#39;re blinded to nature by hero worship and I can only imagine Einstein face palming at the sight of his fool apprentices.</p>

<p>However, these are merely shell games. They only work when you couple the electromagnetic forces into the so-called gravitational fields. However, it is now well known that gravity is merely an effect caused by electromagnetic phenomenon and there is no folding of spacial topology at work.</p>

<p>Big Bang Creationism is a manufactured creationist theory with no relation to real science whatsoever. The effect of Photons or Many-Electron Systems is a well researched field of physics. Einstein is praised today only due to his tongue-in-cheek support of Lemaitre&#39;s buckshot creationist claims. Einstein, Hubble, Bohr, Fermi, have all refuted the Doppler Theory of Spectral Redshift. It&#39;s work is found to be fully disproved in the laboratory research of the late Dr. Ari Brynjolfsson.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, there are tons of them, because these principles are well known in chemistry, biology, and a number of fields that cosmologists like to ignore when they conflict with their creationist religion.

<p>Gravity is a simple effect created by vibrating neutral electromagnetic dipoles.</p>

<p>There&#39;s another paper that seems to say just what you said above, importantly as a clarification of how gravity works rather than a re-working of it. That&#39;s sort of the way of science - we keep building upon the work that others have done before us.</p>

<p>I am assessing his contributions to the field of science in relation to the other scientists of his age. For example, Newton was probably smarter and more capable, but he had the work of far fewer scientists upon which to build, so his contributions seem somehow lesser.</p>

<p>I might be able to gain more knowledge, because more knowledge is available and it&#39;s easier to access, but for all the IQ I&#39;ve been lucky enough to have been born with, my brain will still never be able to think like his could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t regard Einstein&#39;s remarks on the consequences of Entanglement as a description of it. If Entanglement is true, then Einstein&#39;s theory fails. We know Entanglement is true, therefore Einstein&#39;s theory is a failure. Yet, people such as yourself think you can hold it up as a ToE. Fucking stupid man. It&#39;s no where near a ToE and many scientists have gotten far closer to ToE and GUT than Einstein ever did. The fact that you are not familiar with the wider and more diverse scientific community only goes to prove how destructive Einstein&#39;s propaganda has been.</p>

<p>Our society faces real problems requiring real solutions that are not going to be answered by entertaining Einstein&#39;s bullshit. Future science will built on the foundations of electrical engineering and plasma physics. Einstein isn&#39;t even worthy of a mention in the history books. Fritz London, Tesla, von Braun, are easily far more prominent to scientific progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Should you actually be interested, there are umpteen publications that address the sort of confusion you are expressing here.  The shortest, and most accessible might be <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/grav_speed.html">this one</a> from UC Riverside.  I&#39;ll quote a couple of paragraphs here, but there are only about 10 paragraphs in total, so it&#39;s not too much of a commitment to read the whole thing.  If you want even more detail, there is plenty more to be had, much of it online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While current observations do not yet provide a direct model-independent measurement of the speed of gravity, a test within the framework of general relativity can be made by observing the binary pulsar PSR 1913+16.  The orbit of this binary system is gradually decaying, and this behavior is attributed to the loss of energy due to escaping gravitational radiation.  But in any field theory, radiation is intimately related to the finite velocity of field propagation, and the orbital changes due to gravitational radiation can equivalently be viewed as damping caused by the finite propagation speed.  (In the discussion above, this damping represents a failure of the &quot;retardation&quot; and &quot;noncentral, velocity-dependent&quot; effects to completely cancel.)</p>

<p>The rate of this damping can be computed, and one finds that it depends sensitively on the speed of gravity.  The fact that gravitational damping is measured at all is a strong indication that the propagation speed of gravity is not infinite.  If the calculational framework of general relativity is accepted, the damping can be used to calculate the speed, and the actual measurement confirms that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light to within 1%.  (Measurements of at least one other binary pulsar system, PSR B1534+12, confirm this result, although so far with less precision.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if it uses a form of primitive consciousness, something faster then light like a telephone call you know? Like do we even ask how our voice travels from our end to half way across the world instantly via wireless cellphones? It&#39;s some kind of connection formed there, I know it&#39;s based on a science but what if the stars and planets have their own &quot;telephone&quot; type communication system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, that other post was directed toward another thought I had when I remember reading something that said something along the lines of another theory on a article and the term started with an L.</p>

<p>I think it was something about negative energy or dark matter and explaining how the big bang traveled faster than light but also proved nothing could travel faster then light. So &quot;nothing&quot; seems to be the basis here. I just can&#39;t remember where I read it from or the question to ask google as I&#39;m not really good with quantum physics but like talking about it in a logical manner.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Very odd coincidence:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3hwvdj/magnetic_wormhole_created_in_lab_this_device_can/">https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3hwvdj/magnetic_wormhole_created_in_lab_this_device_can/</a></p>

<p><a href="/u/Socsa">/u/Socsa</a> writes: If you can transport a magnetic field then you can transport a modulated magnetic field which could be used to send information. So it could have implications to secure communications systems.</p>

<p>That seems to be what I was on about, FTL communications then?</p>

<p>The speed of anything moving through space is limited to the speed at which light travels.</p>

<p>The speed with which space itself can move and expand is not limited to the speed of light.</p>

<p>The theoretical &quot;warp drive&quot; leverages this notion - create a bubble of space/time and &quot;warp&quot; space around it to make the bubble travel faster than light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I 100% agree that the real answer is to <em>fix</em> (public) education. And of course public education teaches some real knowledge. But they also teach a very slanted worldview. </p>

<p>In all my 19 years of education, we never once talked about private central banking and its role in warfare. Or the dangers of fractional reserve banking of debt-laden fiat currency. We never discussed Holofractal Theory (<a href="/r/holofractal">/r/holofractal</a>) or sacred geometry. Not. One. Time. I got a good dose of math, but Common Core is essentially teaching kids that math is impossible for them to learn.</p>

<p>Fixing education would be grand. But if that&#39;s not an option -- and it&#39;s not -- then would you recommend MORE or LESS indoctrinating  education?</p>
