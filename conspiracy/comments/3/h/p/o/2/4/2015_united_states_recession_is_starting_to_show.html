    <div class="md"><p>Maybe because people over 60 have seen market booms and busts come and go, more times than you can count? Maybe because people over 60 have come to realize the money game is rigged and that monthly/quarterly &#39;reports&#39; aren&#39;t worth the paper they&#39;re printed on?</p>

<p>And that Martin Armstrong is an utter crackpot (if an interesting one).</p>

<p>It&#39;s the long haul that counts, not just the last 3 months. And the long haul says that 7 billion people have worn out their welcome on planet earth and that shit is going to hit the fan - when that happens their market calculations aren&#39;t going to be worth the paper they&#39;re printed on either.</p>

<p>You might like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Huge energy throughput, in line with the Maximum Power Principle, has led to tremendous complexity, far greater extractive capacity (with huge ‘environmental externalities’ as a result), far greater potential to concentrate enormous power in the hands of the few with destructive political consequences), a far higher population, far greater burden on global carrying capacity, and the ability to borrow from the future to satisfy the insatiable greed of the present. The fact that we are now approaching so many limits has very significant implications for our ability to continue with any of these aspects of modern life. Therefore, any expectation that a future in the era of limits is likely to resemble the present (with a green gloss) are ill-founded and highly implausible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, like  said, i&#39;ve been hearing this doom and gloom in one form or anther since i was a child. Nearly every dime that comes into our household is from some form of government...state or federal (pensions and S.S.) Im to busy living to spend a second of my time putting any stock in predictions of economic, political, global doomsday crap. I have a life to live, either it&#39;ll be easy or hard. Been poor, been wealthy (relative to my own standards) After 65 yrs of living, i&#39;ve quit worrying..i suggest you do the same. Good luck to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does my post seem indicative of someone who is worried?</p>

<p>I was unaware the post said anything about Doom &amp; Gloom or a Global Doomsday...</p>

<p>You have been hearing Doom and Gloom since you were a child? </p>

<p>So you live on a fixed income provided by the USG, that will not be there for millenials. Not to mention the payouts for these programs are completely out of line with actual living costs/expenses in much of the United States.  </p>

<p>I appreciate your situation ,but it is completely different for someone who is still in the workforce and makes less than $75,000 / year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well sir..being a member of the middle class is something i&#39;ve never obtained (as i understand the definition). What i have embraced is being HAPPY with what i have ! Certainly on a socio/economic level I&#39;ve never qualified as middle class  Oh i had aspirations at one time, but came to understand that happiness (at work and home) is the only goal worth pursuing.

    <div class="md"><p>I saw something that said Metals are bobbing around because the Chinese are buying them as a hedge against the lower Yuan.  I agree with you though that things seem strange.  I personally monitor ebay to see how the economy is doing - when the upper middle class were doing poorly, a bunch of middle luxury items went on sale, and since the super rich were doing fine, the high end luxury items were still being bought.  Then came a period of time when NOTHING sold, no matter how nice it was, or how cheap it was.  I think the current economy is not as rosy as the news says, because really nice things are still being sold cheap, but noone is buying.  It may be that everyone is sitting on their money because we&#39;re still spooked.  I think the official term for that is lousy &quot;consumer confidence&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collectible things that are useless but pretty - vases, jewelry, paperweights.  Oddly enough - high end paperweights were extremely robust in the recession, keeping selling for good amounts of money while everything crashed.  Rich people must collect paperweights.  I imagine there are other things to monitor, but I like vases, jewelry, and paperweights, so that&#39;s where I lurk.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its about time. QE has been pumping money into everything in order to push this thing as far as it can go! Its amazing how reliant people are on CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, FX, BLOOMBERG etc... They think this will just be a little hiccup! Puhlease, this is going to be huge! Not just for the finance sector but for especially for the &quot;spiritual&quot; sector...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you take into account that they&#39;ve held interest rates at 0% for close to 8 years it only compounds the situation. Never in the history of the Fed have the held interest rates this low for that long. Inflation is a big concern in my eyes but what do I know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many emerging markets got hit hard twice this week. First, when the Yuan got devalued, that hurt all the little guys that send China raw materials.  And now that the raw materials / commodities are dropping.  It was a double whammy for these guys. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder things are going sideways.  I like how many experts are saying that the Fed should just increase the interest rate now so people aren&#39;t worried about it going up later.  As if that will magically correct the volatility of our economy that has been pumped up like never before yet still struggles to move along. </p>
