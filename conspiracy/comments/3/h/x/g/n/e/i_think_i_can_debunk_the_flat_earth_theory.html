        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay - so I tried out the Flat Earth theory. I went down the rabbit hole with this one, and I am still not 100% sure about this issue to be honest, but I&#39;m becoming increasingly convinced that although it is a very well thought out theory, it doesn&#39;t actually hold any water. </p>

<p>I <em>think</em> I can debunk pretty much every flat earth argument out there. The difference between me and every other debunker out there, is that I&#39;m not mad at flat earth people and part of me still wants the theory to be true. So when I debunk this stuff, I will do it politely and will be prepared to listen to the other side and converse with you. So fire away - give me your best flat earth argument and I&#39;ll tell you why either 1. it is wrong or 2. it doesn&#39;t actually prove anything. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have time to watch long videos (I&#39;ve done enough of that already) - so please keep your flat earth arguments succinct. Please feel free to respond to my responses if you think I&#39;m wrong. </p>

<p>And let&#39;s stay away from name-calling etc. </p>

<p>Good luck... hopefully we can start to get to the truth of this issue. </p>

The flat earthers have given up posting here because most everyone here realizes it&#39;s an effort to distract and discredit this sub. Since they started this stuff I&#39;ve been seeing trolls equating &#39;flat earth&#39; and &#39;9/11Truth&#39;, for instance. </p>

<p>I think most of us here would appreciate it if you would take your questions about then to their own subreddit, which I won&#39;t link to here. You&#39;ll have to do a subreddit search to find it, if you don&#39;t already know what it is.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can a ship going over the horizon still be seen with a telescope, when it should be well below the curve and out of sight?</li>
<li>Why are there no GPS recordings on tracker sites for planes flying over the ocean?</li>
<li>Why do planes not fly near Antarctica?</li>
<li>Why are planes not in a continuous downward path to compensate the curvature?</li>
<li>What is the curvature of the earth and at what altitude do planes fly ;)?</li>
<li>Why do planes go out of there way and fly routes, when quicker one way trips could be achieved?</li>
<li>Why is NASA giving us CGI of the Earth when it&#39;s fully possible for a livestream/live images?</li>
<li>Why is the Earth a perfect sphere, when NASA and Scientist tell us it&#39;s a pear shape?</li>
<li>If the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids and believed the Earth was flat, how did they achieve the astrological alignments they did?</li>
<li>How can satellites exist when LEO temperatures would turn metal into molten steel?</li>
<li>Why does NASA say that they are still working on how to safely get out of the Van Allen Belt radiation zone, when they supposedly did it already many years ago?</li>
<li>(fun) Why do we not have a reality TV show/colony on the moon by now?</li>

<p>NASA / Scientists do not tell us it&#39;s pear shaped (Unless it&#39;s a kids program where they use silly examples :/ ). </p>

<p>They tell us that&#39;s a <em>teeny-tiny-itty-little</em> bit wider at the equator than at the poles - 0.6% wider to be precise. </p>

<p>Not a pear. Not even a noticeable difference when looking at a photo. So your question is nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>/sigh</p>

<p>What NDT is saying is in reality, less than 1% of shape variation. </p>

<p>So if you look at a pear, with it&#39;s wild variations in shape, and a perfect sphere - Earth is closer to a perfect sphere than a pear.</p>

<p>It&#39;s slightly pear shaped, but the slight is extremely slight. </p>

<p>Of course NDT is Jesus and our lord and saviour and the brother from another mother of Carl Sagan, brought down to us by the FSM <em>&#39;Praise His Noodlyness&#39;</em>, but you&#39;re taking it as an exaggeration. </p>

<hr/>

<p>The Earth is not perfectly round, but saying it&#39;s like a pear without appreciating the subtleties is going to give you the wrong impression. </p>

<p>Absolutely false.  Stand-along GPS receivers do not have any phone receivers in them.  I know a lot about GPS, and, I assure you, nothing could be further from the truth than your statement here.</p>

<p>Enhanced cellular 911 does use the phone network to locate you (&#39;pinging&#39; you from the towers), to augment GPS.  The GPS receivers in phones are pretty weak, and the phone does benefit from the added information coming from the phone network.  But that&#39;s about phones, not GPS.</p>

If you can&#39;t support the round earth, then what the hell are you doing claiming you&#39;re good at debunking the flat earthers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hey, you seem to be good at this so I&#39;m asking you a serious question...</p>

<p>What does flat mean to you? Does that mean that the world cannot be round and flat like a plate we eat on? Or does it mean it&#39;s simply flat?</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve read nobody has ever said the earth was flat and some other shape but rather the earth itself was flat, if so then wouldn&#39;t this theory prove nothing because the earth is still but it&#39;s also flat like a plate?</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know what to believe, at one time the world did in fact believe the world was flat and then for some reason that changed. I don&#39;t really know anything about it since most people will never travel into outer space to see it. The only real information and proof comes from pictures that NASA tells me are true there is no second opinion. </p>

<p>I&#39;m more curious as to why the movement became so big again after all this time. That&#39;s what interest me the most. Honestly this seems like an issue that should be discussed by officials as it it&#39;s very important to know why (if) someone decided to lie.</p>

<p>Typically flat means it&#39;s a disc. I&#39;ve seen some claim it&#39;s curved up at the edges like a shallow bowl. </p>

<p>That&#39;s a myth. </p>

<p>Here are 15, written in the late 1800&#39;s.   </p>

<p>I know by experience debate and critical thinking is not possible with science-minded folks.  Their &quot;education&quot; (indoctrination) does not allow for them to entertain a thought that contradicts mainstream scientific &quot;knowledge&quot;.</p>

<p>150 years ago, we did not even have electricity, but since then science came along and has explained everything in an irrefutable manner.  We know many things, &quot;cuz science&quot;.  Since Copernic and Galileo 500 years ago science has replaced the church in explaining the world to us.  Science is the new religion and 13 years of mandatory education founds your entire belief system around &quot;science&quot; .  Debate is not tolerated, people are ridiculed if they even consider other possibilities.  Let me tell you,  many smart folks have come up with very interesting findings on the subject, just allow yourself to investigate on why the navigation routes of boats and planes do 3000 km. detours, for example.  All these  questions ... I have no answer to, but I do entertain the notion that on many topics, I am clueless and &quot;science&quot;, no matter how convincing it sounds coming from some folks is no better than religion when it rests on blind faith.</p>

<p>I am not a &quot;flat-earther&quot; nor a &quot;round-earther&quot;, I just feel the best proof we have right now are those (obviously fake) shots of our &quot;globe&quot; taken by NASA in the late 60&#39;s.</p>

<p>I believe we are kept in the dark on many subjects, and science is a major contributor to this darkness.</p>
