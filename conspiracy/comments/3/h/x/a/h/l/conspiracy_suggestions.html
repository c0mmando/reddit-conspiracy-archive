I&#39;ve been obsessed with satanic and abuse theories ever since light was shed on a ring of politicians and doctors in my small town, I love reading about the classics like Franklin ring, the mc martins,marc dutroux. They fascinate me because I wonder what motivates people in such high positions to engage in these acts and the elitism of their crimes. Can anybody recommend documentaries/books/movies etc?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the biggest conspiracy of all is that the Illuminati took over the Catholic Church at Vatican II.</p>

<ul>
<li>The name John XXIII had been avoided for 500 years because it was associated with Antipope John XXIII</li>
<li>Paul VI wore the breastplate of a Jewish High Priest (ephod) and was buried in a simple wooden box (according to the Jewish Tradition)</li>
<li>John Paul II defrauded the world of the true secret of Fatima</li>
<li>Sr. Lucia was assassinated and replaced with an imposter</li>
<li>The Devil succeeded in taking away the Mass </li>
<li>John Paul II was the Antichrist and the world is about to end</li>
</ul>

    <div class="md"><p>I did post the videos :) it is all explained.  Its not that simple as &quot;just attending the latin mass&quot; since most priests ordained in the new rite of ordination including antipope Francis are not validly ordained, and do not have sacramental power.  </p>

<p>It is true that the Novus Ordo Mass is the abomination of desolation - that&#39;s why it is an exact parallel to Maccabees.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was like that too, until I started looking into things a little more. It first started with Satanic Illuminati shit on youtube, then I dug deeper and dropped religion, then learned about the Flavian&#39;s of Rome, &quot;Christ&quot;, and occult ancient mystery schools. I&#39;m spiritual these days, not religious. If you do go this route, be warned your whole world view will change (imo, for better). But, it&#39;s at the heart of what you are asking here. Which is why I chimed in. Cheers mate!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jordan Maxwell is a Theosophist.  Theosophy&#39;s claims about history and even recorded mythology are not accurate.</p>

<p>Eg. Mithra was not born of a virgin, he had no parents and was born of a rock.  </p>

<p>Krishna was not born in a cave he was born in a prison, his mother was not a virgin, she had 7 prior children, there were no shepherds, etc.</p>

<p>Its all false.  Everything Jordan Maxwell says about ancient history is basically false.  Also he does not credit his sources, which are theosophical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is now an epidemic of thyroid cancer in the San Fransisco Bay area, which the MSM refuses to report on. This will spread across the U.S. since every part of the U.S. has been contaminated (and continues to be contaminated) by the radioactive nano-particles in the jet stream. I would recommend taking Potassium Iodine to protect your thyroid. Thyroid cancer will be epidemic all throughout the U.S. and parts of Canada in the next five years. I believe that all the fishermen of the Northern Pacific will be dead from cancer within 10 years, if not sooner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you should start seeing a big uptick in miscarriages along the West Coast even currently.  </p>

<p>As far as Japan is concerned, as I understand it death is happening 4x its usual rate, I read this ages ago on fukushima-diary.com .  </p>

<p>Probably people along the West Coast will start getting cancers soon or already have it, but from then it takes five years or so for it to kill you.</p>

<p>So I guess Tokyo freakout in about 3 years and West Coast freakout in about 6.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. I love Dana Durnford. He is a hero. I know he is making a documentary, and I hope it raises a lot of funds for his research to continue, because in his latest video he said that he won&#39;t ask for anymore donations. One thing we all can do is try to contribute whatever we can financially to those who are out there fighting the fine fight. I watched Kevin Blanch&#39;s newest video today and I got choked up watching him cry over Robin&#39;s death. The man is dying of leukemia, and yet he is out there, alone, and broke, trying to wake everybody up to get off their asses and fight the evil that is behind this whole Fukushima conspiracy. </p>
