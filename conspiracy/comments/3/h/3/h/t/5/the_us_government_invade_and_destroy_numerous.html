    <div class="md"><p>Heroin actually is very safe if you don&#39;t take into account addiction. There is a reason that other drugs related to heroin like Morphine are used on patients for months or years at a time in extreme cases, it really doesn&#39;t do any damage to your organs. Granted, its impossible to find heroin that hasn&#39;t been cut with something possibly harmful, and IVing it has a lot of risks unrelated to the drug. Cocaine is still pretty bad for you, and is also cut a lot of the time (the more North you go the shittier the coke gets). Most of the risks of drug use come from the drug being illegal, not the drug itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that much of a difference.  When I was a teenager it was easier for me to get drugs than to get cigarettes or alcohol.  I really don&#39;t need a lecture on the dangers of heroin. The town I grew up in had an epidemic of heroin. I personally knew 4 people who are dead from overdose or heart failure from extensive use of hard drugs. But lets not pretend that ending this disaster of a war on drugs will mean &quot;free heroin&quot; booths on every street corner. It is time to approach this problem in a different way. A way that doesn&#39;t destroy families because someone is locked up and the police take everything the family owns.</p>

Just imagine, how do you make sure you maintain power throughout the world?.......... and it&#39;s a fucked up world.... if it&#39;s not them it&#39;s you. So... I get it. I get all the CIA, NSA, NWO, Deep state, etc etc... They are at the top, they control everything... what are YOU gonna do about it? nothing.. you can&#39;t do anything. Even if Bernie Sanders get elected, he will only slow them down a few years, they&#39;ll still be in charge. Just live your life the best you can. Stop worrying, stop getting consumed by your thoughts. Every government has done terrible things, especially if they have power, things so horrible you&#39;ll never hear the whole story but that&#39;s the way it is. get over it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about this the other day. I remember a documentary about Fair Trade coffee. I thought it was called Bluebird but the search yielded no results. It was about how coffee growers in South America were proud to be apart of Starbucks and others growth and popularity. However, when they came to the US and saw people paying for a cup of coffee what Starbucks was paying for pounds and pounds of of their beans they were infuriated because most of their income was just barely providing their children an education.</p>

<p>However, the US and a lot of Western Nations are built on ideas. We are a culture of dreamers and making those dreams manifest in products. Think of the automobile. Wow! However, in order for us to have cheap bananas or iPhones that are affordable or Samsung or TVs or whatever the producers look for places that raising the standard of living is not necessary, but look at China.<br/>
Anyways, there are sharks out there ready to make this happen to live their lives. Western culture has a lot of sharks and go getters. But the getting part is ugly and sometimes I think we all have blood on our hands to have and get things. And now our leaders are drunk with power and greed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>pff you&#39;re an idiot if you think Americans care about middle eastern families or their culture. Everyone knows we have killed and we will kill millions of innocent people, that&#39;s the way it has always being... as long as the public doesn&#39;t have to deal with it nobody <em>really</em> cares. That&#39;s humanity right there, you don&#39;t like reality? GREAT. Keep dwelling in what&#39;s going on but it is our nature, great civilizations rise and fall, everyone fighting each other for survival, that&#39;s how it is. You can try to change that.. but you are a fool if you think you&#39;ll succeed. And there&#39;s a big difference now. We are at a point were technology has surpassed us. Before, if we really wanted a revolution we had a chance, lots of people getting together with guns worked. That&#39;s how America was created. Now it&#39;s far more complicated, you can&#39;t fight them anymore, they have millions of ways to deal with people who are in their way. You think Bill Gates is the richest guy alive? <em>Please</em>... as if who ever publishes the list of wealthiest people has access to all the hidden bank accounts and all the illegal shit the elite do. These people wealth are in the trillions by now. They literally have unlimited resources and access to the best most brilliant minds in the world. We&#39;ve truly lost. We are at their mercy right now and it&#39;s easy to tell, they do WHAT EVER they want. </p>

<p>Go watch your episode of law and order, you are so dumb you don&#39;t even realize why that show is popular... you live in your  own cultural bubble. You don&#39;t even realize how American culture has being shaped so it would end up like it is nowadays. &quot;Go to work. Get married. Have some kids. Pay your taxes. Pay your bills. Watch your TV. Follow fashion. Act normal. Obey the Law. And repeat after me: I AM FREE&quot;</p>

<p>Lol.</p>

<p><strong>How the US gave guns to Mexican cartels</strong></p>

<p><strong>In September 2009, John Dodson, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was assigned to the ATF’s Phoenix office. What he found there shocked him. The bureau was encouraging gun dealers to sell weapons in bulk to known straw buyers, who would funnel those guns to Mexican drug cartels.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Might as well put one every 50 yards surrounding the entire US, even the water, since anybody trying to sneak in would just use a boat if the whole southern border was guarded.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the actual problem here: it&#39;s a lot easier to convince the population there&#39;s an enemy abroad then try to pitch the idea that for some inexplicable reason we need 70k soldiers on the Mexican border. There are actually very few people who want all the drugs to go away <em>that</em> badly. The drugs wouldn&#39;t be coming in if there weren&#39;t people who liked them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a ton of reasons why. Border state representative want an issue they can flog their base with, plus they have prisons with contracted quotas they need to keep, oh and don&#39;t forget the law enforcement agencies and unions that suck funds from the state and federal teats while simultaneously seizing the assets of anybody unlucky enough to get caught up in their nets. Then there&#39;s the ongoing saga of the &quot;are they or aren&#39;t they&quot; alphabet agencies and their involvement with smuggling the drugs into the country in the first place so they can fund their black budget activities in other countries. </p>

<p>Why would they clean up the border when so many of them depend on what&#39;s happening for revenue and political influence? </p>

But I think the people who run the country are so backwards and are content with wasting billions of the war on drugs, despite doing little more than stopping a few smugglers and putting millions of non-violent drug users in prison.

Just look at Portugal, they decriminalized all drugs and have the 2nd lowest rate in drug deaths in Europe.</p>

<p>I disagree. As powerful as the government is, it isn&#39;t powerful enough to stop the drug trade. No force on earth is powerful enough to stop millions upon millions of people from doing what they want.</p>

<p>Narcotics still is not a justification for an invasion or military strike.</p>

<p>A wall cannot be built on the U.S. side of the border until property owners&#39; issues are resolved.  As you should already know, there is a document called the Constitution which acknowledges rights of property owners in our nation.</p>

<p>World opinion didn&#39;t stop us as we implemented chaos in numerous Arab states with fictitious justification. Narcotics has killed more Americans than terrorism, for certain. </p>
