       No disrespect but can you flat earthers please stop bombarding this subreddit over and over with demands that we have an open mind or at least be willing to discuss the possibility of the earth being flat. I'll be the first to admit, a flat earth fascinates me, just like a Nazi base in the Antarctic etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just not a sound theory, I'm a premium member of Art Bells new show and last week he had a debate between an Astrophysicist and a Flat-Earther. The Astrophysicist has multiple PHD's and studys Stars and Black Holes and i have to say he really did keep an open mind, he didn't belittle the Flat-Earther at all but at the same time couldn't Bring the conversation forward because every time the other guy said something about perspective or the horizon/ curvature Of the earth and the like, all he got back was that Nasa is fake etc and he should just read this site or watch this video he would understand. In fact closing down the debate and effectively imposing his beliefs on the Astrophysicist and thats exactly what you all do here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see to believe in a flat earth is to say all mathematics Is wrong, it has to be because if the earth is flat then all the mathematical calculations are wrong and well they are not. If the earth is flat then the science/math for this website to work or the keyboard I'm typing on should not work, or the monitor I'm looking at.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of you people keep posting over and over again demanding we read/debate every single post you all make. Then every single time you say 'just read this website' or 'watch this youtube video'. In effect you all are demanding that we accept this and you all are trying to impose your beliefs on us. That completely goes agains everything this subreddit stands for.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have open minds. People post content to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       Every day but what the don't do is demand that the entire subreddit conform to there way of thinking and to there belief systems. By doing this all of you are being disrespectful to this community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do all of you feel that you need validation from us at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       Because it's obvious thats what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please post all of the flat earth content you want. But don't Harass this community and it's users anymore.
      </p>

       Not a 'flat Earther' myself but...
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the conspiracy theories I choose to believe in are like the speed I choose to drive. Some people drive faster than me, others drive slower. Not everyone drives exactly the same speed I do.
      </p>
      <p>
       In much the same way, there are other people who, for reasons of their own, are either more or less willing to believe in various unproven theories. So who am I to tell them what they can or cannot post?
      </p>
      <p>
       If we choose to do that, we are imposing a form of censorship on someone else because their beliefs don't match up exactly with ours. I think we can all agree that it would suck if someone else did that to us... so let's not do this to the Flat Earthers.

       I'm fairly convinced that the flat earth theory is only being propagated to make all conspiracy theorists seen crazy/crazier than most people already think they are. It would explain why they just tell you to read our watch things instead of making legitimate arguments or keeping an open mind. They really don't know or care about the belief, but if WE believe it then it's much easier to make this sub seem less legitimate. They do seem to have an agenda, and I think it's just to sabotage this sub, but in a way that's fairly consistent with this sub's rules instead of brigading, which is not.

       They interviewed "The Morgile", not a great representative.  No person is representative of everyone's ideas on a subject.  It would have been interesting if they had interviewed Eric Dubay as planned.  Various reasons for why that didn't happen have been presented.

       This flat earth bullshit is here as disinformation so that later on when some more truth is revealed to the public that has been known here for quite some time comes out, the people who wish to discredit this sub and the real conspiracies that are discussed here, can point to posts like this and say, those conspiracy people think the earth is flat! It's a big set up. That's all

       I guarantee that guy doesn't study black holes because there has never been a black hole that's been witnessed or recorded in history - it's a theoretical concept to make sure the calculations for the supposed masses of the planets make sense within the accepted equation for the theory of universal gravitation which is itself is a reverse engineered explanation.

       If you think the Earth we live on is a round ball, then you should be able to construct some proofs to demonstrate it, right?  Why are you trying to limit the speech of other people?  Why do we need special rules for this?

       Pretty much. I wouldn't have a problem if he was merely being skeptical, but to launch ad hominem at someone because he doesn't understand the topic is as low as you can sink to. It's shows no thought or intelligence.

       None of that is true.

       <p>
        Astronomers have found convincing evidence for a supermassive black hole in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, the galaxy NGC 4258, the giant elliptical galaxy M87, and several others. Scientists verified the existence of the black holes by studying the speed of the clouds of gas orbiting those regions. In 1994, Hubble Space Telescope data measured the mass of an unseen object at the center of M87. Based on the motion of the material whirling about the center, the object is estimated to be about 3 billion times the mass of our Sun and appears to be concentrated into a space smaller than our solar system.

       I'm just saying if you really want to beat "the flat earthers" whoever they might be, the best way to do it isn't going to be trying to debunk that model but to prove the globe - always try to spend your time being constructive instead of destructive

       Flat earthers aren't completely looney, they're shills that are trying to control common people's idea of scientific reason so that it lines up with old religious mind sets.   They're trying to reset the clock and pull the world back into the 1600's which was easier for them to have complete control.  This world we live in now.... completely uncontrollable.
