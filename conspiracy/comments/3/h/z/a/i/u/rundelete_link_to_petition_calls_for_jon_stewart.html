    <div class="md"><p>You could disagree with me that the sky is blue, and you&#39;d still be flat wrong. You&#39;re a racist. An extremely ignorant one at that, based off your verbiage.</p>

<p>Jon Leibowitz Stewart is an American liberal. Not a fascist neocon, and not an Israeli. You&#39;re just throwing around buzzwords: You&#39;ve got no fucking clue what a neocon is if you think Stewart is one of them. You&#39;ve got not fucking clue what fascism means.</p>

<p>Further, not all Israelis are Jewish. </p>

<p>Further, not all Zionists are Jewish. </p>

<p>Stop equating Zionism and Israel with &quot;all teh jews&quot;. When you do that, you <em>are</em> making extremely racist claims, I don&#39;t care if you think so or not. The vast majority of Jews worldwide are not Zionists. As Stewart himself has said, </p>

<p><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/jon-stewart-not-many-people-get-called-both-zionist-and-anti-zionist/">&quot;Not Many People Get Called Both ‘Zionist’ and ‘Anti-Zionist’&quot;</a></p>

<p>Wonder why he&#39;d face those opposite allegations time and time again, eh? <a href="http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/7wnfel/we-need-to-talk-about-israel">Maybe it&#39;s because he&#39;s been extremely critical of Israel in the past?</a> Might be a bit disconcerting to your racist mind to find out that a Jew agrees with you on a few points about Israel, eh? That a famous Jew himself is willing to completely admit that even mentioning Israel is taboo. </p>

<p>You can have all the problems in the world with Israel that you want to: I&#39;ve got a fair share myself, some of them might be similar or even identical. Doesn&#39;t mean that I equate all the actions of Israel with every Jewish dude I ever encounter. </p>

<p>Israel is a nation, with more than just Jews living in it and more than just Jews benefiting from their being a nation. The problems of Israel are as much Jewish-caused as the problems of America are Christian-caused: They&#39;re not. Period. </p>

<p>There are men and women on both sides of the planet, of every single race, creed, religion, and nationality, who are trying to manipulate power to their own ends.</p>

<p>Again: Bringing up Stewarts given name of Leibowitz is wholly irrelevant, and further, just shows the knee-jerk reaction of the racists in this subreddit to equate anything a Jewish person does as evil and wrong. </p>

<p>I know there&#39;s a lot of people like you and I who feel this way, but as you say, it takes a certain amount of patience. It also takes being able to put cogent thoughts to words in an easy to digest manner. </p>

<p>Thankfully, typing is something I&#39;ve always taken a great pleasure in, and correcting ignorance is something I never view as a chore.</p>

<p>Finally, and on a sad note, there are some people out there who aren&#39;t racist, they&#39;re just ignorant - and that leads to racist behavior. To those people I feel for the most, because ignorance is something they can overcome, yet ignorance is the very thing that other people prey on and manipulate. This is the backbone of the Stormfront recruitment strategy. This is why they&#39;re on this subreddit: If you already believe there&#39;s an over-arching global conspiracy to dominate every aspect of our lives, it&#39;s not a very hard sell to get you to make the addendum &quot;... and it&#39;s the Jews&quot;. <em>Especially</em> if you equate all of Judaism to Israel, which admittedly, is a forgivable mistake for an ignorant person to make. Look at the Israeli flag, after all. But that is an ignorant mistake: There&#39;s plenty of flags with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Flag+with+a+Cross+on+it&amp;amp;oq=Flag+with+a+Cross+on+it&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2061j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;es_sm=93&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">crosses on them</a>. Are the mistakes of those countries all thus attributable to Christianity? Hardly. </p>

<p>Sorry, like I said, I enjoy typing. I&#39;m gonna stop. Thanks again for your support. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you im totally on your side with these arguments. In fact event I&#39;ve seen about the people of Israel leads me to believe that they are a progressive people. They just have awful neocons as leaders. It happens in America too, neocon leaders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the biggest mistakes people seem to make here is assuming that &quot;the government&quot; (of any country) is just one entity. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a huge number of people moving towards their own ends and in sometimes, completely opposite or conflicting directions. Yeah, there&#39;s neocons in American government. They&#39;ve been pretty strong the past few decades. Doesn&#39;t mean all American politicians are as corrupt as they are. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not just black and white, it&#39;s all of a spectrum.</p>

<p>And again: the topic was Jon Stewart, and you associated him with fascist neocons. That&#39;s an ignorant association.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This same new mod deleted one of my posts yesterday to a complete jackass. Since my posting was not significantly different from others that get posted I wondered what specifically it was. I did call the other person a fuck wad. </p>

<p>Looking at this new mods posts it is clear he is a right winger and is on reddit to filter out things HE does not agree with. </p>

<p>Here is one of his posts: I&#39;m working just fine, thankyouvermuch. &gt;Your comment is directed at others on this subreddit <strong>as there are certainly conservatives here</strong>.
If you feel the need to lash out and name call things you don&#39;t agree with, on a public forum, I&#39;d suggest stepping away from the keyboard and not commenting at all.</p>

<p>A mod should just moderate and leave their personal opinions out. </p>
