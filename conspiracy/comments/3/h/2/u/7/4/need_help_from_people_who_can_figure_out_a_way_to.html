    <div class="md"><p>Put it on youtube, and ask for donations (be genuine as I&#39;m sure you are). If the content is good, people will donate. I&#39;ve given a few dollars to many, if 1/2 the people gave 1$ to a video that was seen by 1,000,000, that would = 500,000. This is the future. Build it and they will come. Maybe release some, and do a marketing campaign, while you release the rest based on donations. Shits not hard, tis all marketing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good ideas there thanks! The devil is in the details though. And if I don&#39;t get it just right then they shut the videos down so it&#39;s tricky.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome! You have laws on your side! There are plenty of youtube videos that have copyright material, but they are for education purposes only. You can do this, while setting up a donation, completely legal under the current US laws (If you are a US citizen). I&#39;m not an attorney, but I suggest you look into it, if this is what you want to do, and spent a significant amount of time doing. Like I&#39;ve said, people will donate, if the content resonates. If you do not do this, you will have to go through publishers/etc. Your best bet is youtube. You may even qualify to monetize it via, their system. Good luck yo, post the link, and I may donate :).</p>

<p>If it&#39;s really that important, don&#39;t worry about copyright, just present the information in the best way you can and distribute it in a way that can&#39;t be traced back to you.

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to explain this because I can&#39;t give too much info and there is a lot of stuff involved. It&#39;s very complex.. but the biggest key is that this info isn&#39;t easy to understand.. and if I don&#39;t do it the right way the info could get buried before it even gets any steam.</p>

<p>I have no money.. I&#39;m just an average Joe. Anyone could discover what I did and put these pieces together if they have the time and if they take it seriously. That&#39;s more rare than you might think, though.</p>

<p>I think that they would just find a way to prevent people from taking me seriously or find a way to bury the info I am trying to get out because I would be breaking copyright rules.</p>

<p>A TL;DR version probably wouldn&#39;t convince anyone. They would just think it&#39;s a theory like anyone else&#39;s. Even when I write it all out people still may not understand it for a long time. But I am hoping to get lucky.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems is that I don&#39;t even know who to trust to help me get this info out.. and even if I did the world doesn&#39;t either.. so even if I tried to have some public person try to help me people wouldn&#39;t know to trust them either. These are the kinds of problems i face getting this info out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Books have a back cover. People look at them to decide, &quot;Is this a story I&#39;d be interested in reading?&quot; It&#39;s useful for whetting people&#39;s appetites or so they can decide if it&#39;s a subject they&#39;re interested in. A Tl;Dr: is also useful to show to friends as a prelude to discussing a subject so they have a baseline of what something&#39;s about before starting an hour-long conversation with them. It might not convince anyone on it&#39;s own, but it&#39;s still useful to have.</p>

<p>__</p>

<p>Some subjects take a while to understand, that is true. You could have an electrical engineering diagram that covers two pages and someone could spend hours trying to figure out what&#39;s going on. Whereas a thirty page Archie comic takes ten minutes to read and there&#39;s not really anything you need to &quot;get&quot;.</p>

<p>__</p>

<p>If you tried to publish your book in a bookstore, yeah you could definitely get your book taken down for copyright infringement. If you publish it as a torrent / on the Pirate Bay, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much that anyone could do about it to stop it. Music/movie piracy is still a thing these days, despite clear breach of the copyrights held by major players in the industry. Then again, people who haven&#39;t broken any copyrights can get their stuff taken down (see this bit on &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/3gcmvc/antipiracy_group_hits_indie_creators_for_using/">Pixels</a>&quot;).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also <a href="https://wikileaks.org">Wikileaks</a> or <a href="http://cryptome.org/">Cryptome</a>, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the way to go? <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jul/16/bradley-manning-wikileaks-security">Here&#39;s an article</a> on how Bradley Manning got caught. Hm. It says it wasn&#39;t because of Wikileaks, but from talking to the wrong sort of person.</p>

<p>What is your preferred method(s) of distribution? What methods have you considered/heard about? Are you interested in seeing if there&#39;s other methods available that might work better for you? Maybe you could talk to people who have had (ordinary) books published and ask what methods they considered before they settled on one? There&#39;s probably forums/blogs you could look through.</p>

<p>__</p>

<p>Okee dokee. I just watched about half of that video you posted about secret societies (figured I should get some idea what specifically you&#39;re talking about before rambling further). That sounds like someone who knows what they&#39;re talking about, pointing out real evidence, and being reasonable and rational rather than someone getting really excited and saying, &quot;OMG, triangles!!!&quot; like one sometimes sees on YouTube. That was actually pretty interesting (I&#39;ll probably finish it later, I think that was about as much as I could absorb at once).</p>

<p>So, they assert their dominance (in one way at least) via physical forms on the ground? I suppose that&#39;s one difference between actually ruling the world and liking to imagine you do - leaving a mark upon it.</p>

<p>Google is pretty big into world domination. It&#39;s not even hidden, but people like their search engine and their &quot;Don&#39;t be evil&quot; kinda-slogan, so they get cut a lot of slack.</p>

<p>Should we oppose any force which attempts to rule the world? How do the Masons compare to Google?</p>

<p>__</p>

<p>Who to trust... a dog, probably. They&#39;re pretty straightforward about whether they like you or want to maul you. Oh, I know! Rosanne Barr. She ran for President and did stuff with Occupy Wall Street and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLTsdC0lasc">spoke out about Hollywood BS</a> (13min 6sec). People watched her show for years, and she&#39;s very grounded/normal in the show, so she&#39;s not going to be seen as &quot;some crazy&quot; when she talks about this sort of stuff.</p>

<p>I dunno, is any of that helpful? Got any questions you&#39;d like me to think about more to see if I come up with something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, Weird Al Yankovic does parody music, but he&#39;s someone just about everyone loves and judging from his &quot;Foil&quot; and &quot;Party in the CIA&quot; videos, it seems he has at least some interest in these topics: &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic - Foil: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urglg3WimHA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urglg3WimHA</a> , &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic - Party In The CIA (Parody of &quot;Party In The U.S.A.&quot; by Miley Cyrus): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-CG5w4YwOI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-CG5w4YwOI</a></p>

<p>The Juice Media puts out rap news videos every so often. They&#39;re independent, just a few guys making what they want. RT liked their videos so they have syndicated... I&#39;m not sure how many, but I saw one that they put on their channel. The Juice Media did good work on the Net Neutrality topic, and have also done one on the New World Order: Net Neutrality [RAP NEWS 25] (6min 22sec): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xSP_T0VqU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-xSP_T0VqU</a> , The New World Order - with Russel Brand &amp; Bill de Berg (RAP NEWS 30) (7min 6sec): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nSjPdT788">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4nSjPdT788</a></p>

<p>John Oliver is on HBO, and did good work on the Net Neutrality topic: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (HBO): Net Neutrality: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU</a> (13min 17sec). He covers a variety of topics including prisons, police militarization, civil forfeiture, predatory lending, and so on. He does one show a week with a major segment that can last over 15 minutes, so there&#39;s time to reasearch topics and provide more information than just a sound bite. He seems like a reliable source of information.</p>

<p>&quot;Jim Carrey Continues His Activism: Why Vaccines Should Not Be Mandatory&quot;: <a href="http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/08/15/jim-carrey-continues-his-activism-why-vaccines-should-not-be-mandatory/">http://www.collective-evolution.com/2015/08/15/jim-carrey-continues-his-activism-why-vaccines-should-not-be-mandatory/</a> Jim tends to get mocked for being an &quot;anti-vaxxer&quot; though, and don&#39;t know if he&#39;s interested in other subjects. Might be other celebrities who are doing activist things you could look up, see if what they go on about is close to what you look into.</p>

<p>Stefan Molyneux does stuff for <a href="https://freedomainradio.com/">free domain radio</a>. He gives pretty interesting/in depth talks on things. To quote the about page, &quot;With host Stefan Molyneux, topics range from philosophy to economics to art to how to achieve real freedom in the modern world. Passionate, articulate, funny and irreverent, Freedomain Radio shines a bold light on old topics - and invents a few new ones to boot!&quot; Here&#39;s one I think is good: They Control Humans With Words. (20min 9sec): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJOeKvK6Yw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJOeKvK6Yw</a></p>

<p>Alex Jones is a bit too fear-mongering for my taste. Even if things are that important, being in a constant state of panic is way too stressful, and without specific goals as to what to do with that fear to respond to it, it&#39;s not useful, either. It&#39;d be like... if your body was always in a 103 degree fever. Not healthy. So, I listened to him for a bit, but he&#39;s too much for me. Also, some people here have been saying they think he&#39;s controlled opposition.</p>

<p>One question would be, how does one determine trustworthiness? I think playing some games of Mafia (or Werewolf Mafia - same game, different theme) (in real life perferably, not online) is good for helping with reading people and knowing when someone&#39;s bullshitting/being straight with you.</p>

<p>I guess the question is, what level of trust do you need? Is it more, &quot;If I don&#39;t do this right, it won&#39;t gain traction&quot; or &quot;If I don&#39;t do this right, the people who I&#39;m working to expose will sabotage my efforts, or worse&quot;? Would you feel comfortable directly contacting people who you haven&#39;t really &quot;vetted&quot; but don&#39;t seem blatantly the sort who would or might backstab you, or do you need a middle man who knows who you can and can&#39;t talk to about things to help you navigate who to discuss this information with? </p>

<p>Doctors, therapists, and lawyers have confidentiality agreements, if you need a sounding board who isn&#39;t going to spill the beans. I&#39;m guessing doctors and therapists wouldn&#39;t know who to talk to, but I&#39;d think lawyers would be fairly well-connected as part of their job and might have some idea of where you could look to bring these topics up with. Maybe ask one who specializes in whistle-blower law? I&#39;d think whistle-blowers would face a lot of the same questions you have for keeping safe while releasing information and making sure it has the needed impact.</p>

<p>Are you looking for journalists, celebrities, alternative media, anyone who is reasonably well known and isn&#39;t seen as a crackpot regardless of field, people even if they are unknown who you have direct experience with to know they&#39;re not a crackpot who might be willing to give speeches?</p>

<p>Could look up celebrities who went to Occupy Wall Street and see what they had to say. For example, &quot;Lupe Fiasco on Building 7, 911 truth and New World Order&quot; (13min 25sec) : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rCxIjd0Wtc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rCxIjd0Wtc</a> </p>

<p>Hm. Are there any professors at your local college/university who would be interested in these topics? And/or journalism students who are actually interested in investigative reporting and are not just there to get a degree? </p>

<p>Does any of that help? Anything else you&#39;d like me to think about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an exiled 32 degree freemason and occultist,  I&#39;ve been contemplating a few books that cover your thoughts with much added. .   Problem I run into when sharing with others is that there is seldom anyone that can follow a fraction of what I dispel within minutes of beginning.   </p>

<p>I think a non-formal approach to &quot;steps&quot; or levels of information when dealing with the lay man is most appropriate for dispensing any information of substance. .  Obviously, the secret societies divested its knowledge in varying &quot;degrees&quot; or levels. . ;)</p>

<p>Maybe we should collaborate,  as I too am working on some &quot;texts&quot; of enlightenment to the masses. .  Too many Americans have no idea of the role the occult plays in our countries local and foreign policy and subscribe to religions that promote low effort thinking.  </p>
