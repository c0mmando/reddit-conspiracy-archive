       Serious question: How do you reconcile the fact that biometrics, computer networks, and location services provide very real benefits and value to users, stuff people
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       want, so they will voluntarily use and even pay for them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will you at least acknowledge that these technologies have real benefits and people really want them while you're sweating about how they could be abused by the evil totalitarian state?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the invention of the telephone also a sinister plot by the Ebil Tewwible Totalitawian Goberment? Because, like, you can't tap people's phones unless you trick everyone into getting a phone?

       there is no need to attach surveillance technology to the positive benefits of lets say biometrics except being a complete cluster fuck evil dick goverment.
      </p>
      <p>
       so you want a secure way to enter in your house? why your biometric fucking data need to be uploaded in the cloud, on a server in a country that you are not part off, have different laws than what the laws of your country are, and those laws let the goverment to access your data and analyze it so that it can find a better way to fuck you in the ass?
      </p>
      <p>
       you are tying the benefits to the crap and you are somewhat saying is the way to go.

       99% of RFID chips can only be read from a few feet away. There are battery powered chips that can be read from longer distances -- several yards, under ideal conditions (like, insignificant blocking material like metal or water) -- but this could never be used for tracking people.

       First of all, whoops, I didn't tone it down as much as I meant to. I've re-toned down my original post. (Someone came over right when I was editing that and I skipped on of my snotty replies.) So, sorry again for being a jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate the thoughtful response. I was acting out of frustration with generalized panic and should not have directed at you. You make good points in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally get that bad things can happen with this technology, in fact bad things definitely WILL happen and already ARE happening with this technology. But I differ from OP and a lot of the really panicky types in two respects:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) I don't think fingerprint technology, and the marketing efforts surrounding it, exist for the sole purpose of creating a database of citizens, per OP's paranoid suggestion. That suggests a level of conspiracy that goes way beyond anything reasonable. (But I know, there are some people who will not consider anything except the most extreme and all-encompassing conspiracy theories.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like the telephone, or the internet: These are technologies that exist for perfectly legitimate reasons and would exist even if every government and corporation in the world respected our privacy and civil rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) I don't think the surveillance and "government control" currently go to anywhere near the extremes the most paranoid among us suggest.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a long, long history of the US government using the FBI and other law enforcement to repress leftist political movements - going back well over 100 years. Just the other day someone posted a thread about the FBI's attempt to destroy Martin Luther King. (And I would not doubt they were the people who assassinated him.)  But there is almost no evidence that the government infiltrates and undermines right wing movements. And the funny thing is that probably a good 95% of the really super paranoid conspiracy theorists are on the far-far-far right - the very people who have the least to worry about when it comes to government tyranny.

       When I was in elementary school, we all went on a "field trip" to the police station. They showed us the jail cells, let us play with their sound-proof glass, and then fingerprinted each and every one of us before we went home. That seemed cool at the time too.

       Why shouldn't they? Everyone -- workers included -- find it more convenient. You know how fast it is? And secure? Much faster and much more secure than a password. Plus, people don't forget their fingerprint, so there's no fucking around trying to get your fingerprint reset because you forgot it.

       Face it: Most people are not living in terror all the time, afraid of life on earth. Most people don't shit their pants when they find out they can unlock a register with their finger.

       This is not about the harrowing threat of incipient fascism. This is about the constant terror originating from inside your own head -- your own demons, paranoia, and fear of the world outside the four walls of your home.

       Passwords are used to secure cellphones.  Nobody is using a secure fob/physical key to access their cellphone just to make a call to their mom.  Furthermore, script kiddies can easily hack most passwords via software found on Google.  However, it is vastly harder to hack Biometrics with a valid password that evades those programs found on the web.  So the tech industry is pushing that security combination.

       There is no need for a physical key for this device when the idea is that it is always on your person.

      <p>
       The real reason for the security of unlocking your phone with a password is just to keep other people from browsing your device during those few moments you may set it down and not have it on your person, it's not an anti-theft measure it is a privacy measure, completely different.

       Okay, not imagine what a more intelligent adult with actual electronics engineering education can do, and look at what they currently DO do, your electronic devices are very insecure as far as the context of how other people can hack them, should you be in a place to be hacked.

      <p>
       It's even more vastly harder to break into those places when secured with physical keys and locks, because anybody wishing to breach said physical security has to do so physically, which usually requires they be there physically themselves, which allows you to catch them.

       I would rather stick with technology which requires potential criminals to leave their homes rather than hiding behind a computer behind 5 layers of obscurity.

       Biometrics alone are not very secure.

       Biometrics combined with two-factor authorization is exceedingly secure.

       It would be very impractical from a tech standpoint for a fingerprint scanner to actually record a visual copy of the fingerprint. The software analyzes certain identifiable features with some likelihood of displaying uniquely. If anything the fingerprint scanning is just a misleading attempt to create a false sense of security. There are plenty of secure ways of keeping your information, they just require more education and effort - so most people treat like a low priority.

       Don't be insulting. If you'd like to clarify your point I'll respond accordingly, but it seemed pretty clear. There's already a pretty massive fingerprint database maintained by the FBI. Many public processes already involve getting your fingerprints taken, and fingerprints have a fairly narrow spectrum of usefulness. I'm sure they could find some malicious use for our scan data, but they already have access to plenty of other sensitive data sources that would be much more useful.

       Do you think that it is possible that subroutines inside the fingerprint-scanning software running on modern cellphones will store a copy of the data from  the fingerprint scan, and send a copy of it to Utah, before deleting that data from Android RAM after the authentication routine has ended?    Because, I do.

       Went to a
       <strong>
        THEME PARK
       </strong>
       recently and they were giving away "free passes for a month" with tickets that day. HOWEVER, to get into the park, since we now had "passes", we had to scan our fingerprints to link our identity to our passes.  "To protect your passes, so no one else can steal them."
      </p>
      <p>
       I said: "I'll take the risk. I paid, now let me in."
      </p>
      <p>
       The refused to let me in without a fingerprint linked to the pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said to the girl: "Scan YOUR fingerprint."
      </p>
      <p>
       She refused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I called for a manager - who is an 18 year old kid who tells me:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It's just a biometric link to the pass. The machine doesn't store anything, it's just the ridges on your finger." (Yeah, douche, my fingerprint - and if it isn't stored - how the fuck will it work next time ? )
      </p>
      <p>
       Needless to say I did NOT put my prints into the system. However the person I was with didn't care and scanned their print twice.

       yeah, they definitely are stored, and there definitely is a database for each print reader. you can actually download software development kits and sample code for common fingerprint readers and look into the code to see how it works. Every single one has sample code for an interface that registers users into a database the first time they use the fingerprint reader. once you've been recorded into the database the software will be able to recognize your print at later times and associate the stored information with it.

       It's funny, really, because fingerprints are the most insecure thing – very easy to steal. I had a better idea – fingernails. The system would then even be able to determine what kind of growth would be congruent with the amount of time since having last scanned would look like, and then it updates each time you scan. So, even if you "gave your fingernail" at some point, it would have a limited shelf life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once someone steals your fingerprint – that's it, you're fucked for life.

       I was never fingerprinted in school. California native. Graduated 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted I was arrested, and subsequently fingerprinted, so my prints are in already. But no, students who aren't criminals don't get printed. Teachers and faculty do. But that's a very different reasoning.

       Not as a matter of course but plenty of places do that "safe child" thing at schools and malls where you can get your child fingerprinted in case they get kidnapped or something. I never got why- I mean, unless they find your dead body that can't be identified otherwise, I don't see what it helps. It's not a mandatory thing though, like the other guy was suggesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, if someone wants your fingerprints, it wouldn't be hard to get them. People sometimes overestimate just how much they really matter in the grand scheme of things.

       This is what you said originally, which is patently false.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't 'do it when you're in elementary school'. What you're talking about are programs (optional ones) that are often not even endorsed by the school. They're $200 'kits' parents pay for because they're being guilted into it by marketing that tugs at heartstrings. "Wouldn't you do everything you can to save
       <em>
        your child

       ?"
      </p>
      <p>
       But your comment very much implied that this was an unavoidable consequence of public schools, and again, having been through having my prints taken as a child-criminal, no: Schools and the school system keeps exactly
       <em>
        zero records
       </em>
       of children's fingerprints. None.

       First of all, whoops, I didn't tone it down as much as I meant to. I've re-toned down my original post. (Someone came over right when I was editing that and I skipped on of my snotty replies.) So, sorry again for being a jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I appreciate the thoughtful response. I was acting out of frustration with generalized panic and should not have directed at you. You make good points in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally get that bad things can happen with this technology, in fact bad things definitely WILL happen and already ARE happening with this technology. But I differ from OP and a lot of the really panicky types in two respects:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) I don't think fingerprint technology, and the marketing efforts surrounding it, exist for the sole purpose of creating a database of citizens, per OP's paranoid suggestion. That suggests a level of conspiracy that goes way beyond anything reasonable. (But I know, there are some people who will not consider anything except the most extreme and all-encompassing conspiracy theories.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just like the telephone, or the internet: These are technologies that exist for perfectly legitimate reasons and would exist even if every government and corporation in the world respected our privacy and civil rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) I don't think the surveillance and "government control" currently go to anywhere near the extremes the most paranoid among us suggest.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a long, long history of the US government using the FBI and other law enforcement to repress leftist political movements - going back well over 100 years. Just the other day someone posted a thread about the FBI's attempt to destroy Martin Luther King. (And I would not doubt they were the people who assassinated him.) But there is almost no evidence that the government infiltrates and undermines right wing movements. And the funny thing is that probably a good 95% of the really super paranoid conspiracy theorists are on the far-far-far right - the very people who have the least to worry about when it comes to government tyranny.

       This is true of
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       technology. No technology exists which is inherently evil or inherently good. Technology is neutral: it's just
       <em>
        things
       </em>
       . Things can't be anything but neutral. It's that old saying: "It's not the gun that's dangerous, it's the guy holding it." The person makes the good or evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       All technology can be used for good or bad purposes. See nuclear weapons. The adapted policy of MAD has ensured that wars are never as big as WWII again. All because a few bombs exist. See GMOs: Yes, it could devastate the planet if it was let out of control, but it can also
       <em>
        feed
       </em>
       the planet, and there are a lot of hungry people out there.

       Just to play devil's advocate, you should be aware that all these cell-phone providers don't have to be complicit with the NSA/FBI/Whatever in order for those acronym-agencies to get their fingerprint data. According to Snowden, pretty much anything on a cell-phone is suspect to a backdoor, and the telecoms don't even have to lift a finger to let them in: NSA has their very own key. So while it may be that it's not 'for the
       <em>
        sole
       </em>
       purpose of collecting data', it's not a big leap at all to think that it could be used
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       collect data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that devil's advocate play aside, this still doesn't make sense to me: why should NSA want fingerprints? I mean really? They're not the ones investigating crimes, they don't investigate US citizens (officially). What would be the point? I honestly can't think of one.
