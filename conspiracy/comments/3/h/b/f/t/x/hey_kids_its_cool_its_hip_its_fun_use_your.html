    <div class="md"><p>First of all, whoops, I didn&#39;t tone it down as much as I meant to. I&#39;ve re-toned down my original post. (Someone came over right when I was editing that and I skipped on of my snotty replies.) So, sorry again for being a jerk.</p>

<p>I appreciate the thoughtful response. I was acting out of frustration with generalized panic and should not have directed at you. You make good points in this regard.</p>

<p>I totally get that bad things can happen with this technology, in fact bad things definitely WILL happen and already ARE happening with this technology. But I differ from OP and a lot of the really panicky types in two respects:</p>

<p>(1) I don&#39;t think fingerprint technology, and the marketing efforts surrounding it, exist for the sole purpose of creating a database of citizens, per OP&#39;s paranoid suggestion. That suggests a level of conspiracy that goes way beyond anything reasonable. (But I know, there are some people who will not consider anything except the most extreme and all-encompassing conspiracy theories.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like the telephone, or the internet: These are technologies that exist for perfectly legitimate reasons and would exist even if every government and corporation in the world respected our privacy and civil rights.</p>

<p>(2) I don&#39;t think the surveillance and &quot;government control&quot; currently go to anywhere near the extremes the most paranoid among us suggest.</p>

<p>There is a long, long history of the US government using the FBI and other law enforcement to repress leftist political movements - going back well over 100 years. Just the other day someone posted a thread about the FBI&#39;s attempt to destroy Martin Luther King. (And I would not doubt they were the people who assassinated him.)  But there is almost no evidence that the government infiltrates and undermines right wing movements. And the funny thing is that probably a good 95% of the really super paranoid conspiracy theorists are on the far-far-far right - the very people who have the least to worry about when it comes to government tyranny.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why shouldn&#39;t they? Everyone -- workers included -- find it more convenient. You know how fast it is? And secure? Much faster and much more secure than a password. Plus, people don&#39;t forget their fingerprint, so there&#39;s no fucking around trying to get your fingerprint reset because you forgot it.</p>

<p>Face it: Most people are not living in terror all the time, afraid of life on earth. Most people don&#39;t shit their pants when they find out they can unlock a register with their finger. </p>

<p>This is not about the harrowing threat of incipient fascism. This is about the constant terror originating from inside your own head -- your own demons, paranoia, and fear of the world outside the four walls of your home.</p>

<p>Passwords are used to secure cellphones.  Nobody is using a secure fob/physical key to access their cellphone just to make a call to their mom.  Furthermore, script kiddies can easily hack most passwords via software found on Google.  However, it is vastly harder to hack Biometrics with a valid password that evades those programs found on the web.  So the tech industry is pushing that security combination.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=18122">WRONG</a>, please stop lying, you are wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Biometrics combined with a valid password is vastly harder to hack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Harder, not impossible, and for some people it is actually very easy to obtain those passwords, the hardest part arguably is making the fake fingerprint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Passwords are used to secure cellphones. Nobody is using a secure fob/physical key to access their cellphone just to make a call to their mom.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no need for a physical key for this device when the idea is that it is always on your person.</p>

<p>The real reason for the security of unlocking your phone with a password is just to keep other people from browsing your device during those few moments you may set it down and not have it on your person, it&#39;s not an anti-theft measure it is a privacy measure, completely different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, script kiddies can easily hack most passwords via software found on Google. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, not imagine what a more intelligent adult with actual electronics engineering education can do, and look at what they currently DO do, your electronic devices are very insecure as far as the context of how other people can hack them, should you be in a place to be hacked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, it is vastly harder to hack Biometrics with a valid password that evades those programs found on the web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s even more vastly harder to break into those places when secured with physical keys and locks, because anybody wishing to breach said physical security has to do so physically, which usually requires they be there physically themselves, which allows you to catch them.</p>

<p>I would rather stick with technology which requires potential criminals to leave their homes rather than hiding behind a computer behind 5 layers of obscurity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be very impractical from a tech standpoint for a fingerprint scanner to actually record a visual copy of the fingerprint. The software analyzes certain identifiable features with some likelihood of displaying uniquely. If anything the fingerprint scanning is just a misleading attempt to create a false sense of security. There are plenty of secure ways of keeping your information, they just require more education and effort - so most people treat like a low priority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t be insulting. If you&#39;d like to clarify your point I&#39;ll respond accordingly, but it seemed pretty clear. There&#39;s already a pretty massive fingerprint database maintained by the FBI. Many public processes already involve getting your fingerprints taken, and fingerprints have a fairly narrow spectrum of usefulness. I&#39;m sure they could find some malicious use for our scan data, but they already have access to plenty of other sensitive data sources that would be much more useful. </p>

<p>I said: &quot;I&#39;ll take the risk. I paid, now let me in.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s just a biometric link to the pass. The machine doesn&#39;t store anything, it&#39;s just the ridges on your finger.&quot; (Yeah, douche, my fingerprint - and if it isn&#39;t stored - how the fuck will it work next time ? )  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, they definitely are stored, and there definitely is a database for each print reader. you can actually download software development kits and sample code for common fingerprint readers and look into the code to see how it works. Every single one has sample code for an interface that registers users into a database the first time they use the fingerprint reader. once you&#39;ve been recorded into the database the software will be able to recognize your print at later times and associate the stored information with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, really, because fingerprints are the most insecure thing – very easy to steal. I had a better idea – fingernails. The system would then even be able to determine what kind of growth would be congruent with the amount of time since having last scanned would look like, and then it updates each time you scan. So, even if you &quot;gave your fingernail&quot; at some point, it would have a limited shelf life.</p>

<p>This is what you said originally, which is patently false. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t &#39;do it when you&#39;re in elementary school&#39;. What you&#39;re talking about are programs (optional ones) that are often not even endorsed by the school. They&#39;re $200 &#39;kits&#39; parents pay for because they&#39;re being guilted into it by marketing that tugs at heartstrings. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you do everything you can to save <em>your child</em>?&quot;</p>

<p>But your comment very much implied that this was an unavoidable consequence of public schools, and again, having been through having my prints taken as a child-criminal, no: Schools and the school system keeps exactly <em>zero records</em> of children&#39;s fingerprints. None. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, whoops, I didn&#39;t tone it down as much as I meant to. I&#39;ve re-toned down my original post. (Someone came over right when I was editing that and I skipped on of my snotty replies.) So, sorry again for being a jerk.</p>

<p>I appreciate the thoughtful response. I was acting out of frustration with generalized panic and should not have directed at you. You make good points in this regard.</p>

<p>I totally get that bad things can happen with this technology, in fact bad things definitely WILL happen and already ARE happening with this technology. But I differ from OP and a lot of the really panicky types in two respects:</p>

<p>(1) I don&#39;t think fingerprint technology, and the marketing efforts surrounding it, exist for the sole purpose of creating a database of citizens, per OP&#39;s paranoid suggestion. That suggests a level of conspiracy that goes way beyond anything reasonable. (But I know, there are some people who will not consider anything except the most extreme and all-encompassing conspiracy theories.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like the telephone, or the internet: These are technologies that exist for perfectly legitimate reasons and would exist even if every government and corporation in the world respected our privacy and civil rights.</p>

<p>(2) I don&#39;t think the surveillance and &quot;government control&quot; currently go to anywhere near the extremes the most paranoid among us suggest.</p>

<p>There is a long, long history of the US government using the FBI and other law enforcement to repress leftist political movements - going back well over 100 years. Just the other day someone posted a thread about the FBI&#39;s attempt to destroy Martin Luther King. (And I would not doubt they were the people who assassinated him.) But there is almost no evidence that the government infiltrates and undermines right wing movements. And the funny thing is that probably a good 95% of the really super paranoid conspiracy theorists are on the far-far-far right - the very people who have the least to worry about when it comes to government tyranny.</p>

<p>This is true of <em>all</em> technology. No technology exists which is inherently evil or inherently good. Technology is neutral: it&#39;s just <em>things</em>. Things can&#39;t be anything but neutral. It&#39;s that old saying: &quot;It&#39;s not the gun that&#39;s dangerous, it&#39;s the guy holding it.&quot; The person makes the good or evil. </p>

<p>All technology can be used for good or bad purposes. See nuclear weapons. The adapted policy of MAD has ensured that wars are never as big as WWII again. All because a few bombs exist. See GMOs: Yes, it could devastate the planet if it was let out of control, but it can also <em>feed</em> the planet, and there are a lot of hungry people out there. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutaree">Yes there is.</a> That&#39;s just one example, I could show others. I mean, what was Waco if not &#39;undermining&#39; a right-wing movement or organization? Ruby Ridge? <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/08/07/fbi_right_wing_terror_is_real/">Here&#39;s even more examples of the government going after right wing groups.</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just to play devil&#39;s advocate, you should be aware that all these cell-phone providers don&#39;t have to be complicit with the NSA/FBI/Whatever in order for those acronym-agencies to get their fingerprint data. According to Snowden, pretty much anything on a cell-phone is suspect to a backdoor, and the telecoms don&#39;t even have to lift a finger to let them in: NSA has their very own key. So while it may be that it&#39;s not &#39;for the <em>sole</em> purpose of collecting data&#39;, it&#39;s not a big leap at all to think that it could be used <em>to</em> collect data. </p>

<p>Now that devil&#39;s advocate play aside, this still doesn&#39;t make sense to me: why should NSA want fingerprints? I mean really? They&#39;re not the ones investigating crimes, they don&#39;t investigate US citizens (officially). What would be the point? I honestly can&#39;t think of one. </p>
