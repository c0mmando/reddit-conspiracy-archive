<p>UFO literally means &quot;<em>Unidentified</em> Flying Object&quot;. If you see something you <em>know</em> is an alien craft, that&#39;s not a UFO anymore  now is it? </p>

<p>Further, if you see a group of childs balloons filled with neon gas released into a thunder storm, you&#39;ll see floating &#39;orbs&#39; of brightly colored lights, flashing about. The neon will receive charge from the air and energize, causing it to light up (this is how neon signs work: electric charged gas). </p>

<p>They&#39;ll move very erratically (being in a storm and just balloons) and from a distance, you might not make out what they are (but you&#39;ll <em>see</em> them because again, bright flashing lights in the sky).</p>

<p>They&#39;re &quot;UFOs&quot;, definitively. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an alien.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You used the term &#39;Ufology&#39;. That&#39;s a decent assumption on the part of OP. Go google &#39;Ufology&#39;. See what comes up. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll answer it for you: Alien shit. Alien shit comes up.</p>

<p>Ufology is pseudoscience. It masks itself as scientific when in reality, it&#39;s just superstition. Using the &#39;ology&#39; suffix is an attempt to sound scientific. It&#39;s a load of horsecrap. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not about to call you ignorant for not thinking like I do, but I want you to be aware of what &#39;ufology&#39; is. Trust me: It&#39;s not generally accepted as &#39;the study of unidentified and classified test aircraft&#39;. Because that&#39;s what most UFOs are in most cases: just normal aircraft that a typical person doesn&#39;t recognize. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why the &#39;flying wing&#39; designs being tested in secret just also happened to be the exact same shape as the &#39;Alien UFOs&#39; being reported. Because they were the same thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wikipedia:</p>

<p><strong>Ufology is the study of reports, visual records, physical evidence, and other phenomena related to unidentified flying objects (UFO). UFOs have been subject to various investigations over the years by governments, independent groups, and scientists. The term derives from UFO, which is pronounced as an acronym, and the suffix -logy, which comes from the Ancient Greek λογία (logiā).</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to UFO sightings, certain supposedly related phenomena are of interest to some in the field of ufology, including crop circles,[42] cattle mutilations,[43] and alien abductions and implants.[44] Some ufologists have also promoted UFO conspiracy theories, including the alleged Roswell UFO Incident of 1947,[45][46] the Majestic 12 documents,[47] and UFO disclosure advocation.[48][49]</p>

<p>Skeptic Robert Sheaffer has accused ufology of having a &quot;credulity explosion&quot;.[50] He claims a trend of increasingly sensational ideas steadily gaining popularity within ufology.[50] Sheaffer remarked, &quot;the kind of stories generating excitement and attention in any given year would have been rejected by mainstream ufologists a few years earlier for being too outlandish.&quot;[50]</p>

<p>Likewise, James McDonald has expressed the view that extreme groups undermined serious scientific investigation, stating that a &quot;bizarre &#39;literature&#39; of pseudo-scientific discussion&quot; on &quot;spaceships bringing messengers of terrestrial salvation and occult truth&quot; had been &quot;one of the prime factors in discouraging serious scientists from looking into the UFO matter to the extent that might have led them to recognize quickly enough that cultism and wishful thinking have nothing to do with the core of the UFO problem.&quot;[51] In the same statement, McDonald said that, &quot;Again, one must here criticize a good deal of armchair-researching (done chiefly via the daily newspapers that enjoy feature-writing the antics of the more extreme of such subgroups). A disturbing number of prominent scientists have jumped all too easily to the conclusion that only the nuts see UFOs&quot;.[51]</p>

<p>I knew it wouldn&#39;t take long for you people to equate &quot;flat earthers&quot; (which are massively downvoted here) with other real conspiracy theories here like sourced anti-vax posts (always upvoted). Have you fallen for those &quot;flat earth&quot; troll tactics or are you just lumping their tactics in with other discussions on purpose?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I always think this gets taken the wrong way. Questioning is one thing, absolutely abolishing belief is another. Hell ill confess, ever since 9/11 i&#39;ve been extremely suspect to any sort of &#39;world news event&#39; that happens, im not saying &quot;DUN TRUST DA NEWS! WEAR YA TINFOIL LADDIES!&quot; im saying that, before we get the full picture, we shouldn&#39;t draw conclusions.</p>

<p>For instance, what OP said, sure, if their is evidence that they didn&#39;t free fall, id gladly read about it, hopefully from a trusted source and not some anonymous person on a forum. But when discussion or even just having an open mind to certain things marks you as &#39;crazy&#39; or stuff like that, it really bums me out. Im not saying reptiles rule the planet and the world is flat because the moon is a giant dragon egg.</p>

<p>Im saying keep an open mind, read both sides, draw your own conclusion on the event, be vary of &#39;hugbox&#39; syndroms. If the truth comes out, with reasonable scientific evidence to support the claim. Then fine, I was wrong on that subject, but this is what i believed at that time.</p>

<p>If anything it goes to show at what lengths people are willing to go now a days to shut down someone who has a different view on things than them.</p>
