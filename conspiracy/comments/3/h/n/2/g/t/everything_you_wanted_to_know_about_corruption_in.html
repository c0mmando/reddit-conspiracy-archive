          WASHINGTON -- A group of scientists at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday sent a letter to President-elect Barack Obama's transition team pleading with him to restructure the agency, saying managers have ordered, intimidated and coerced scientists to manipulate data in violation of the law.

          “Much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. As one participant put it, “poor methods get results”.

         In 2009, Dr. Marcia Angell of the New England Journal of Medicine wrote:
         <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/jan/15/drug-companies-doctorsa-story-of-corruption/">
          “It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.”

         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_misconduct">
          In many scientific fields, results are often difficult to reproduce accurately, being obscured by noise, artifacts, and other extraneous data. That means that even if a scientist does falsify data, they can expect to get away with it – or at least claim innocence if their results conflict with others in the same field. There are no "scientific police" who are trained to fight scientific crimes; all investigations are made by experts in science but amateurs in dealing with criminals. It is relatively easy to cheat although difficult to know exactly how many scientists fabricate data.

        Here's one scientist who was caught faking data.
       </a>
       This is what he had to say after he was exposed:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After years of balancing on the outer limits [of scientific integrity], the grey became darker and darker until it was black, and I fell off the edge into the abyss. I’d been having trouble with my experiments for some time. Even with my various “grey” methods for “improving” the data [i.e. ‘QRPs‘], I wasn’t able to get the results the way I wanted them. I couldn’t resist the temptation to go a step further. I wanted it so badly. I wanted to belong, to be part of the action, to score.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This went on for years and years until finally a few whistleblowers exposed him and a massive amount of effort went into figuring out how much bullshit he published. You should expect that this is pretty common, since tons of studies directly contradict others. Somebody is lying...

          A systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that around 2% of scientists admit to have falsified research at least once (1). Up to 33% admit other questionable practices such as plagiarism, duplicate publication, undisclosed changes in pre-research protocols or dubious ethical behavior (1). There can be no doubt that discovered cases of research and publication misconduct represent a tip of an iceberg and many cases go unreported (2).

       Did you read half the links?  Half the corruption comes from the government.  And worse, when it's taxpayer funded everyone thinks it's uncorruptible and listens to it-- and even WORSE, when it's taxpayer funded, congressmen think it's real science and pass idiotic stuff like the "tell everyone fats are unhealthy and they should eat pasta instead" initiative.

       This issue also swings the other way, with the FDA creating study guidelines that purposefully reduce the efficacy of drugs in the study findings. Read up on Margret Hamburg (recently retired head of FDA) and her link to hedge funds.

       Only one I know of, but I actually came to knowing about this corruption through my following of a particular biotech stock Mannkind (MNKD). The saga is long and continuing even to today, but in an attemped tl;dr format I will say that the FDA sandbagged their incredible insulin product on purpose in order to benefit Hamburg's hedge fund links - which were her husband and another lowlife named Martin Shkreli. The study was designed such that the advantages of the drug would not be highlighted in the results, so that it could not be classed as a "superior" product to existing drugs in it class, but rather as a "non-inferior", which is like saying it's just the same as existing drugs (when it's actually not, and way way better. Think industry, game-changing better - like a healthy functioning pancreas, but in the form of an inhaler). It's out on the market today, but nobody knows about it, and part of the problem is because of the games the FDA played with the approval process. There's also suspicion that Sanofi, a huge global pharmaceutical company and Mannkind's partner, is purposefully sandbagging the advertisement and distribution portion of their agreement. The story is actually a bit more complex than that, with a large portion of it actually focusing on Shkreli's proxy involvement with the approval process, but that's the basic rundown.

       edit: this link tells a lot about the afrezza (the product I am referring to, made by Mannkind) approval process corruption and what I meant by Shkreli's interference:

       Cracked did a decent article on pretty much the same thing this week, thanks for sourcing this, I always try to use stuff like this when my doctor tells me I should try anti-depressants. She hates dealing with me.

       Honestly, the best anti-depressant is just not reading this sub and related information. Ignorance truly is bliss sometimes.

       There's plenty of physical things you can do. Eat right, exercise, take cold showers, call your friends and family, stop drinking, etc. You're not allowed to drink on anti-depressants. I wonder if they controlled for that during the studies on their effectiveness.
