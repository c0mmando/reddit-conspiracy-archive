       Ok so it's pretty clear that the stickied post about planned parenthood is an agenda being pushed by certain mods here. The fact that a) a majority of the users in the thread want it to be unstickied, and b) it was at 0 karma last I checked, should warrant its removal
      </p>
      <p>
       The users have spoken. And that's what this site is for, right? The users?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious manipulation of he sub and like others have noticed and pointed out its occurring around the same time as last year; around 9/11. Same exact pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never got involved in the reddit drama and mod abuses and all that, as I wasn't close to the situation. But I followed that thread since the min it was posted. I saw how a few users, lead by fly tape, manipulated the conversation. Anybody questioning why the video was stickied or questioning the content of the video itself was labeled an "abortion lover" and "evil"....
      </p>
      <p>
       The users wanting the thread to be unstickied probably outnumber those who want it 3 to 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting the thread be taken down. I'm against censorship. But the thread should only appear at the top of the sub based on its own merit, not because the mods feel it's important.
      </p>
      <p>
       This community is falling apart, and it's hardly the typical users' fault. We need to move IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry it was a bit of a rant post, but I felt like enough people were questioning the post and why it was stickied.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: the post has had the sticky removed.

       Right now, only 3 mods need to OK a post for a sticky. I've made the suggestion that
       <em>
        5
       </em>
       mods need to give the go ahead in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I voted against this sticky, but it had already reached 3 and the decision was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 5 mods aren't always active at once, this will ensure that some time passes to make sure that everything is on the up and up and the right decision is being made for the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully this will prevent further problems.

       Shills bury loads of threads on this sub that aren't stickied.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the issue alot of people have with it is the image it gives to the outside about how serious and note-worthy our sub is. They presumably feel this is average content not worthy of broadcasting to the broader viewer base as a post we want highlighted.

       Way to dodge my question. I'm still waiting for an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just because you think it's trivial doesn't mean it is. Clearly a lot of people are angered over it, so let them have heir opinions too. You're in the minority here. That doesn't mean your opinion is wrong. But obviously people care, so get over it. You don't. We get it.

       So you say your out 6 times but stay around. That's funny. And obviously it was important as far as this community goes because it was removed. And a mod messaged me telling me they need to review the whole voting process for stickies... I think I had a point and the feeling was shared by some of the other mods.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: idk why you're dragging his out with me while simultaneously saying "I'm done", saying that "if you don't like it downvote it and move on".... If you don't like my post and my comments downvote them and move on. Oh wait you already did the downvoting, so I guess it's time to take your own advice and move on.

       It's fucked to admit, but there are blatant agendas pushed on this sub. Reddit in its entirety has been compromised, and conspiracy is no exception. If we can't have a place here to have open conversation without outside influence, I don't want to be a part of it anymore.

       Yup. I mean I knew this would come. Hell its been here, but it's just gotten so bad. With the race baiting shit, and these obvious mod abuses, its never been so bad.

       Same here. I guess it's just one of those things that sound perfect on paper, but the human variable will inevitably fuck it up and make it a horrible thing. The phrase "this is why we can't have nice things" comes to mind, sadly.

       Especially considering the blatant agenda of the creators of the videos, it becomes even more obvious what we read here is bought and paid for. I even had to bail out of that post because of the massive onslaught of downvotes towards anyone who expressed even slight skepticism.

       Most likely. Really, a couple users and mods here look pretty bought. Some only talk about certain things or post from the same two or three blogs. They're not really good at hiding it.

       Yea, you were in that thread early too. And i saw you comment in the other thread where flytape linked the same video...

      <p>
       Downvotes just for asking for proof of what the video claimed.

       One of the videos they linked was just a fucking talking head on CNN. I bought he last place that would be considered "proof" would be this sub.

       I'm more disappointed that a mod in this sub would get caught up in any propaganda bullshit that's currently being used by the MSM. Reading that thread was similar to watching a FOX news episode.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also noticed that people were calling out some portions of the video as art props and not real fetuses. Stay vigilant people. If something elicits a strong emotional response step back from the situation for a minute and see if there's any data being withheld.
