       The hits just keep on coming when it comes to the health benefits of meditation. Research is now emerging that would justify implementing this practice within hospitals and schools (some already do) as well as including it in treatment recommendations for various diseases. Not long ago, an eight week study conducted by Harvard researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) determined that meditation literally rebuilds the brains grey matter in just eight weeks. It was the very first study to document that meditation produces changes over time in the brain's grey matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, they've released another study showing that meditation can have a significant impact on clinical symptoms of gastrointestinal disorders, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study showed that elicitation of the relaxation response (a physical state of deep rest that changes the physical and emotional responses to stress) is a very big help. The study comes out of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). T
      </p>
      <p>
       his is the very first study where the use of the "relaxation response" was examined in these disorders, and the first to investigate the genomic effects of the relaxation response in individuals with any disorder. The report was published in the journal PLOS-ONE. (source) Given the two studies cited above, and all of the other documented health benefits of meditation, this should open the door for more studies to examine the benefits of meditation for a wide range of diseases. "Our results suggest exciting possibilities for further developing and implementing this treatment in a wider group of patients with gastrointestinal illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several studies have found that stress management techniques and other psychological interventions can help patients with IBS, at least in the short term; and while the evidence for IBD is less apparent, some studies have suggested potential benefits. What is novel about our study is demonstration of the impact of a mind/body intervention on the genes controlling inflammatory factors that are known to play a major role in IBD and possibly in IBS." - Brandon Kuo of the gastrointestinal unit in the MGH Department of Medicine, co-lead author of the report. (source) For those of you who are unaware, IBS and IBD are chronic conditions that produce similar symptoms which include; abdominal pain, and changes in bowel function, like diarrhea. IBD also includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which leads one to suffer from severe inflammation in all or part of the gastrointestinal tract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science has shown us that stress intensifies these symptoms, which is why this study regarding meditation and these diseases holds a great deal of importance. The relaxation response has been subject to several studies that clearly show that its regular practice (induced by meditation) directly affects physiologic factors such as oxygen consumption, heart rate, blood pressure and again, stress and anxiety. It was first described over 40 years ago by Herbert Benson, director emeritus of the Benson-Henry Institute and co-author of the paper presented in this article. The study had 48 adult participants, with 19 of them being diagnosed with IBS and 29 with IBD. There was weekly relaxation response training, as well as in their home for 15 t0 20 minutes each day. A common misconception about meditation is that you have to sit a certain way or do something in particular to achieve the various benefits that it can provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do is place yourself in a position that is most comfortable to you. It could be sitting cross legged, lying down in a bed, sitting on a couch etc, it's your choice. That being said, I do not doubt that sitting in a certain position allows energy to flow more freely through you body, but above all (in my opinion) comfort is of utmost importance. It's not about trying to empty your mind, and as the first study cited in this article states, it's about the "non-judgmental awareness of sensations, feelings and state of mind." Let the thoughts, feelings and emotions that pop up present themselves, don't judge them, and let them pass. Make peace with whatever you are experiencing. I also believe that meditation is a state of being/mind. One can be engaged in meditation while they are on a walk, for example, or the time they have right before they sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout the day, one can resist judging their thoughts, letting them flow until they are no more, or just be in a constant state of peace and self awareness. Contrary to popular belief, there is more than one way to meditate.

       What a wonderful thing to read today when I was thinking last night I need to learn to meditate hoping it would help with my anxiety. The thought that came in my mind was that I can't because I can't shut my brain off long enough to make it silent to meditate.

       I wouldn't say
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       attempt, though the mind-emptying approach (shikantaza form of zazen, specifically) is difficult at first because it runs 180° counter to our mental habits, requiring time and patience. I've found it to have profound benefits, but of course diff'rent strokes...

       I have IBS and can attest to the efficacy of meditation. Part of what is thought to cause the condition is a chronic "miscommunication" between the digestive system and the brain. The calm, focus, and mental isolation that can be attained through meditative practice is invaluable in bridging this gap of control in your body.

       Ever since a certain health event, I began to meditate. Best choice ever. I think better and faster. I notice things I would have never noticed before. I'm more happy. Even negative events have trouble bringing me down. It's great.

       When your body is in stress (fight-or-flight mode) it takes blood away from your bowels and moves it to your extremities, so that you can fight or flight.  So it's no wonder that keeping in a relaxed state for a while can have the opposite effect.

       Oh, I get it. You can see the same push in dealing with anxiety. There are a lot of psychologists who will just write you a script for Xanax instead of first trying CBT and other forms of therapy.

       It should be noted that while meditation is one known method of triggering this "relaxation response," it's the attainment of that state, and not meditation itself, that causes the abatement of these health symptoms. The implication being that if you are able to trigger that state through some other means, the positive health effects will be experienced just the same.

       That may be true, but only to a certain extent.

       We know very well that taking a pharmaceutical or recreational drug can, at times, bring you to the same meditative state, the relaxation response... However, the effects are very different on the body over time.

       No, it's literally and precisely true. The "relaxation response" is a distinct physiological state that has been shown to come about in response to meditation, and it is only to that state that these health benefits correlate, according to the actual Harvard report. The way you feel about relaxation and drugs has no bearing on what has been demonstrated by these experiments, and you have no idea what you're talking about.

       Regardless, how one arrives at that 'relaxation response' is the question.

      <p>
       As an example, a pharmaceutical or recreational drug may allow you to get there just like meditation.  However, meditation doesn't have negative side effects.  Some of these drugs do.

       Nobody ever said Xanax causes this physiological relaxation response. Feeling relaxed and entering into this physiological state are two completely different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't suggest things like Xanax or smoking crack - I would sooner suggest something like not bullshitting yourself and keeping a healthy attitude. However, I'm not necessarily an expert. All I'm saying is that it's completely possible that something else triggers this state, and meditation is not the cause of the health benefits.

       The 'relaxation response' that you are referring to doesn't just come about through meditation.  As you know, here is your own words, "The implication being that if you are able to trigger that state through some other means".

       The significance of this quote is that the state can come about through many activities, some of which may be harmful, including pharmaceuticals.

       When I mentioned not bullshitting yourself, what I meant is that, in a hypothetical scenario where I am to propose a means of attaining to this physiological state, I would propose not bullshitting yourself as completely general advice to a completely general audience. If that hurts your butt and you consider it imposing, I'm sorry, but your understanding correctly is your own responsibility, as my explanations are entirely clear.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may be possible that this physiological state can be attained to through avenues that also include a degree of harm, but that has no bearing on what I've actually said. All I've said is that it's the physiological state, and not the meditation, that correlates to the health benefits - which came directly from the source of the study. You are arguing against me as though I've argued in favor of taking drugs to attain to this state, but my actually taking that position only exists in your imagination, and so too does drugs having these effects only exist in your imagination.
