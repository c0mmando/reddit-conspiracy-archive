       That would be called an ideologue. Blind adherence to an idea or ideology. You find this disease more commonly afflicting those adhering to the left/right paradigm ideologies.

       Most here tend to have their own thoughts on individual matters and don't rely on ideology to tell them how to feel about individual subjects.

       I can almost guarantee the hack was faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that story about that Duggar guy having an account there? First they talk about the hack, then a couple days later they use a "famous" person to bring it back up and have it circulate more.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a distraction.

       I don't believe the hack was faked, however, I think the Duggar story is very telling. The data has been poured over by many IT/Netsec analysts, and it appears legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hack also turned out emails from other people, such as
       <a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">
        president@whitehouse.gov
       </a>
       . But oddly, the media only mentions these things with a qualifying statement "It appears that e-mails were not validated properly, as no one claims Obama was a member".
      </p>
      <p>
       So on one hand they'll totally write off who they found if they're
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       important or
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       famous, but on the other, they'll drag this guy through the mud like they caught him red-handed at a brothel - all over someone using his e-mail. Could've been him. Could've been someone entirely different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ashley Madison got hacked. I believe that. What I don't necessarily believe is that A) all the users were cheaters, and thus deserved it [95% males, ergo, many users didn't 'benefit' at all because statistically, they couldn't have unless they were all gay] or B) all the users were using their actual information, and not just something made up.
      </p>
      <p>
       AM was a well orchestrated scam, followed by a separate, yet equally well-orchestrated hack. The idea that everyone in that database is also a philanderer is absurd and statistically impossible.

       I created an AM account back in 2006. I can confirm that back then, no confirmation of email accounts were done. Confirmation emails leave a paper trail a spouse can follow back to Ashley Madison. The email is there for account retrieval purposes, leaving your spouse to guess what account you could have possibly used.

       you know those are fake right? whitehouse.gov does not actually host any email addresses. just to take this point further - people spent time BEFORE there was a threat of a hack to set up multiple fake email addresses for Obama on this thing. Like, time out of their day.

       The way I look at it is it was a private company and it's users volunteered that information to the company. The difference being the NSA does not ask for consent. It just takes.

       Charging you to delete your info? That's pretty scummy. It's like, small time blackmail. "Here's a site you can use to cheat on your partner with! Come one, come all!

You know, it'd be a real shame if *ahem* our server were to get hacked and your spouse were to find out about that little affair you had...

       The difference is it is a private corporation doing business with private individuals. It then becomes a mater of security and trust. The company had a severe lack of security and the individuals were way to trusting. Both will suffer the consequences.

       I may be mistaken, but i believe all the account passwords were encrypted with a one way hash. That means all that really got stolen was credit card info, and personal info. This isn't a huge breach because people still have control over their accounts and can cancel cards. The bank will most likely refund any fraudulent fees. Due to the low amount of actual damage, i could see this as a fake or planned hack.

       one argument I've seen speaking out against NSA-corporate invasive personal data collections/retention is that corporations have a proven culture of ignoring data security - time and again, corporations have demonstrated they don't give a shit about safekeeping private citizen data until after a "hack" creates bad publicity - and the schadenfreude with AM is that their poor data security practices have come back to haunt them to allow the rest of us to say "we told you so".
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that AM is also morally low is in that sense icing on the cake that feeds into a satisfying sense of karma coming home to roost.

       On AskReddit, I've seen, "What's your deepest, darkest secret?" and there were over 2000 replies. People ask for shit like that, and a lot of people actually respond. I've always wondered why people are so willing to give up that sort of information about themselves over the internet. No one knows who is actually looking at that stuff. Granted, anybody can make an account here, but I bet this site sees IP addresses. If the government ever needed those, I guarantee Reddit would be ready and willing to give that stuff up.

       As far as I'm concerned, the more money you have, the less privacy you deserve. Why? Because money equals power, and power must be monitored.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I'm beyond ready to debate this topic with anyone that think's they have even the scrapings of a point to make. I'm also certain I can prove I'm right. People with money have an inherent role to play in the economy, a responsibility, if you will.
