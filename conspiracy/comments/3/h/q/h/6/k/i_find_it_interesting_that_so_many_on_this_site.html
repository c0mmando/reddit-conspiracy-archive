    <div class="md"><p>I can almost guarantee the hack was faked.</p>

<p>Remember that story about that Duggar guy having an account there? First they talk about the hack, then a couple days later they use a &quot;famous&quot; person to bring it back up and have it circulate more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe the hack was faked, however, I think the Duggar story is very telling. The data has been poured over by many IT/Netsec analysts, and it appears legitimate.</p>

<p>The hack also turned out emails from other people, such as <a href="mailto:president@whitehouse.gov">president@whitehouse.gov</a>. But oddly, the media only mentions these things with a qualifying statement &quot;It appears that e-mails were not validated properly, as no one claims Obama was a member&quot;. </p>

<p>So on one hand they&#39;ll totally write off who they found if they&#39;re <em>too</em> important or <em>too</em> famous, but on the other, they&#39;ll drag this guy through the mud like they caught him red-handed at a brothel - all over someone using his e-mail. Could&#39;ve been him. Could&#39;ve been someone entirely different. </p>

<p>Ashley Madison got hacked. I believe that. What I don&#39;t necessarily believe is that A) all the users were cheaters, and thus deserved it [95% males, ergo, many users didn&#39;t &#39;benefit&#39; at all because statistically, they couldn&#39;t have unless they were all gay] or B) all the users were using their actual information, and not just something made up. </p>

<p>AM was a well orchestrated scam, followed by a separate, yet equally well-orchestrated hack. The idea that everyone in that database is also a philanderer is absurd and statistically impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>one argument I&#39;ve seen speaking out against NSA-corporate invasive personal data collections/retention is that corporations have a proven culture of ignoring data security - time and again, corporations have demonstrated they don&#39;t give a shit about safekeeping private citizen data until after a &quot;hack&quot; creates bad publicity - and the schadenfreude with AM is that their poor data security practices have come back to haunt them to allow the rest of us to say &quot;we told you so&quot;.</p>

<p>The fact that AM is also morally low is in that sense icing on the cake that feeds into a satisfying sense of karma coming home to roost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On AskReddit, I&#39;ve seen, &quot;What&#39;s your deepest, darkest secret?&quot; and there were over 2000 replies. People ask for shit like that, and a lot of people actually respond. I&#39;ve always wondered why people are so willing to give up that sort of information about themselves over the internet. No one knows who is actually looking at that stuff. Granted, anybody can make an account here, but I bet this site sees IP addresses. If the government ever needed those, I guarantee Reddit would be ready and willing to give that stuff up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, the more money you have, the less privacy you deserve. Why? Because money equals power, and power must be monitored.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;m beyond ready to debate this topic with anyone that think&#39;s they have even the scrapings of a point to make. I&#39;m also certain I can prove I&#39;m right. People with money have an inherent role to play in the economy, a responsibility, if you will.</p>
