    <div class="md"><p>Just because I don&#39;t agree with your narrative, doesn&#39;t make me obtuse.</p>

<p>This is a common train ride for tourists.  (Amsterdam to Paris, cmon...)  Furthermore, backpacking or train jumping in Europe is very popular for Americans with expendable cash, especially service men with a long time off.</p>

<p>If THEY&#39;RE using it for propaganda, they&#39;re not doing too well (or not tonight, I&#39;ll give you that).  I watched some 24 hour news earlier and they talked more about Trump and Bush talking shit on each other than this train incident, which was hardly a blurb in comparison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, some people on the thread pointed out about the noise</p>

<p>but accordint to this video, if its the same kind of train, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mapiL4s14ms">there is almost no noise indeed</a>, and I assume they could have heard the weapon loading or w/e.</p>

<p>And them noticing something unusual and being close to the &quot;terrorist&quot; makes 100% sense imo, but why dont they claim something like this? All reports so far gives me the impression of &quot;oh well, we were on the train. and out of pure luck we heard the terrorist on the bathroom and... the rest is history :) &quot;. And thats what I think its the  oddest in all of this...</p>

<p>But I take any &quot;terror&quot; attack with a grain of salt, because there&#39;s always more going on than we are made to believe.

When I travel abroad I also make sure to pay attention to my surroundings, being American isn&#39;t always a good thing and some people will make a situation out of it (hence why some suggest putting Canadian flags on your bags). They are trained military professionals and there has been a large amount of immigration/Islamic tension in Europe recently, makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Most of the trains I&#39;ve been on (although not in France) have been pretty noisy. All kinds of clanking and clattering and whooshing. Enough noise to make it hard to carry on a conversation with the person next to you.</p>

<p>But perhaps French trains are so quiet you can hear small mechanical noises coming from the toilet. Who knows?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ha....obviously you&#39;ve never been on a highspeed european train ! The only way they could have possibly heard someone loading a clip into an ak47....is if they&#39;d had their ear to the door....and then it&#39;s doubtful ! </p>

<p>Two other points....the guy was already on their radar. That sounds familiar. And the marines were attached to the US Embassy....most likely intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont think so. it was a high speed train heading to paris from amsterdam.</p>

<p>the footage they showed was in arras, france. so i guess that was the next stop or it could&#39;ve just been where an official chose to speak.  i didn&#39;t see anything interesting live and they were just talking details about the train and people, not the footage or arras.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Charlie Hebdo attacks were carried out by two French citizens of Algerian descent, the Paris supermarket attack was carried out by another French citizen who was of Malian descent</p>

<p>In the Paris train attack, the suspect reportedly got on the train at Brussels and is of Moroccan descent</p>

<p>It appears the gunman was stopped by three Americans (so far we know one was a member of the airforce, the second a national guardsman) a British national was also involved</p>

<p>I have traveled on this train in the past, it&#39;s normal for there to be a lot of different nationalities on board as it serves Brussels and Paris</p>

<p>Also the security is really lax for these trains, easy to board with a backpack, it even crossed my mind several years ago that if someone wanted to smuggle a bomb on board it wouldn&#39;t be hard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some strange things:</p>

<p>• Story &amp; accompanying pictures are very underwhelming for a usual terrorist attack story. </p>

<p>• The emphasis on there being US Marines on the train</p>

<p>• The writing style of this article is almost satirical in nature, it&#39;s like the author wanted us to know it&#39;s bullshit: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3206426/U-S-Marines-armed-gunman-onboard-high-speed-train-Amsterdam-Paris.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3206426/U-S-Marines-armed-gunman-onboard-high-speed-train-Amsterdam-Paris.html</a></p>

<p>Edit: They have altered the story considerably (which I&#39;m sure is normal once more info has come, but still strange). All the pictures are different now. It was US Marines, now it is a national guardsman &amp; an air force guy. One of them was critically injured yesterday, now he is untouched in a picture holding a medal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They can&#39;t even get the story straight of things like how it happened.  One story is the jumped the guy right as he came out of the bathroom. with his AK slung over his shoulder.  Another story has it happen that they charge him after he&#39;s fired a shot, but in the brief moment while he&#39;s charging the action on the weapon.  Doesn&#39;t make any sense unless the AK malfunctioned after the first shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, some are reporting that it was a Marines others are saying it was an airforce guy and a inactive national guardsman.  I can tell neither of them were marines by their long hair.  And if one was shot and the other is in critical condition why is there a picture of them receiving some heroism medal less than six hours after the event?  Like nothing happened.  Seems weird that you would reroute the train and continue through crossing the border into France when the shit went down in Belgium.  The shirtless terrorist?  Why was he shirtless, did he get on the train without a shirt?  Don&#39;t they have rules about that in Europe?  You&#39;d thing someone would have said something to him when they were checking his bags before boarding the train. Took it off to be more comfortable taking a big dump I guess.   </p>
