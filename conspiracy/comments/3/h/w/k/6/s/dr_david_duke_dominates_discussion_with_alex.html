        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=331&amp;v=sPa1wLvCovE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=331&amp;v=sPa1wLvCovE</a></p>

<p>David Duke’s appearance on the Alex Jones show was an incredibly important moment for pro-White and pro-European causes. This is a significant milestone because many people including myself came down this road by researching conspiracies. Whenever people begin investigating conspiracies surrounding events like the 9/11 attacks and others, it is easy to come across material relating to Alex Jones. The bottom line is that his audience represents one of the largest groups of people who can be converted to our political movement.</p>

<p>For many years I’ve been one of the biggest critics of Jones for any number of reasons. So with that said, I was actually surprised that he went through with bringing Dr. Duke on to his show. I do think he deserves some credit for at least taking the steps to bring Dr. Duke on for a discussion. It is true that he was sort of in a no-win situation after he shot his mouth off about wanting to challenge Dr. Duke to a debate. He either had to interview Dr. Duke and get torn apart on the issue of Jewish supremacy or he chickens out and is targeted with endless mockery and ridicule. Even still, I think some credit is due despite how much there is to dislike about Mr. Jones.</p>

<p>As expected, Dr. Duke totally dominated the discussion during the interview. It was nothing short of a flawless victory for Dr. Duke. I don’t think anyone who watches or listens to it would disagree. Dr. Duke covered a tremendous amount of ground on the Jewish question including exposing Jewish control over the banking system, Hollywood, the media and academia. He also exposed the Jewish role in financing the Bolshevik revolution, how Jewish tribalism is working against people of White European descent, the Jewish role in World War II and so much more. As the interview proceeded, Jones had nothing he could say to respond to all of the facts Dr. Duke presented. It got to the point where he was left complaining about how the information was giving him a headache and making him nauseous. He even resorted to inserting a plug for his super male vitality penis juice product half-way through the interview.</p>

<p>It was total intellectual domination from start to finish by Dr. Duke. Jones continued to perform all sorts of mental gymnastics to justify his stance that Jewish tribalism and supremacy are not a root cause of the many problems we have. A stance that was simply impossible to maintain in light of the information that Dr. Duke provided him. It left him completely discredited. A caller from Germany who appeared to be a fan of Jones even criticized him for being politically correct.</p>

<p>Racial superiority. In the video debate he speaks of no such thing. He may of had those views in his early years (30 years ago), but he doesn&#39;t express them now. You realize that can happen right? People can change.</p>
