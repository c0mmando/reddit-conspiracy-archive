       I just feel like I'm stuck in a game I don't want to play, this never-ending cycle where I work just so I have a place to sleep and food to eat so I have energy to go to work again. It seems like the structure of our society is an endless ladder where each wrung is another "thing" we work to obtain that never satisfies for long,  as there's always the next wrung, the next "thing" that's supposed to fill some hole we feel inside. It's like we're all stuck in a hamster wheel, moving real fast but never going anywhere. We experience the same things over and over. We've stopped growing, creating. Technology has stagnated our evolution, made us all complacent and distracted. Most of the country is on some type of drug to take away the pain, be it legal or illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And meanwhile, while our country spends their lives striving to own things that are supposed to somehow validate our value, half of the world goes to bed hungry. Millions of people work in dismal factories for pennies a day to make all the trinkets that our society is obsessed with having. Corporations are raping the earth of its resources and all of its species in the interests of "profits" which don't even really exist, theyre just numbers in some screen. People starve, people kill, wars are waged, for numbers on a screen. It's like I used to live in the matrix, and I took the red pill, and now I see how reality really is, and it's not something I can ignore. I can't just put my head down and participate in the rat race cause that's what I'm told to do. It doesn't make any sense. It's all so wrong. And the worst part is that no one around me seems to see, they just continue on in blissful ignorance never thinking about, or maybe just ignoring(because it's easier that way), anything outside of their little bubble of existence. I can't even relate to anyone anymore. Everyone around me seems to be addicted to a game that I can't enjoy anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will finish by saying that anyone who exhibits excessive greed and hunger for power over others should be removed from society and treated for their ego driven psychosis. It is greed that has crippled humanity. It makes me sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ends my rant, that will help nothing.

       This is where you are completely wrong.  Corporatism has stopped our growing and creating.  Technology should have freed us by now, but it is clearly being kept from the masses on purpose.  Go watch Thrive for more info.

       If the average person had the resources required to invest in current technology the world would be a much better place.

       Imagine if every home owner had solar and or wind power systems creating renewable energy. Or even if we converted our old abandoned buildings into vertical solar farms. Hell, most home owners can barely afford to repair their cracked driveway and wet basements.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's a large factor in the overall progress of "mainstream" technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at cell phone technology. It's obviously more complicated and has jumped light years ahead of desktop technology. But that's due to cell phones becoming more affordable to the average consumer. (And because the government wanted an efficient way to spy on everyone)

       Im with you OP. Idk how its going to end, but sometimes I wish it would just hurry up and do it already. In the mean time I will continue smiling and making others smile, because thats what makes my life great. Not money, because I have none, not power because ive never known that. Just simply self made happiness. Good luck bro.

       Over and over again I have said that there is no way out of the present impasse. If we were wide awake we would be instantly struck by the horrors which surround us... We would drop our tools, quit our jobs, deny our obligations, pay no taxes, observe no laws, and so on. Could the man or woman who is thoroughly awakened possibly do the crazy things which are now expected of him or her every moment of the day?

       I used to feel, and still do, the same way. What really though helps for me is trying to make a difference on a micro scale.

       Helping out at the homeless shelter, volunteering and sincerely trying to help others has made life way more bearable.

       I feel your pain. I see what you see. All you can do is enjoy those fleeting little moments of happiness you have in life. This game the "elite" are playing is going to come crashing down on their heads, and it won't be long now. So, enjoy the little things because in the not too distant future, those things won't be there.

       It is truly messed up. But think of it this way: never in our history have intelligent, cogent, dedicated individuals like yourself been able to reach and affect so many minds. We are truly at an inflection point technologically, socially, and even in terms of altering our planet's climate for the rest of posterity. Keep taking the time to plant small seeds -- your efforts will appreciate with returns on the investment.

       I feel you man. For most Americans I feel like thats life, just working just to survive the next day, week, or month. When I was growing up everything seemed fun and awesome, I had a lot of friends, went to good schools, was always having new experiences and stuff. But once you graduate college and start to get a real job, its like, "what do we do now? Nobody prepared me for this part of life. It was always, yes go to college, and get a good job!".... And then what? I realized its all up to you what you want to do with the rest of your life. Dont let any government, politician, or corporation decide for you. Change always starts from within. Remember what mahatma ghandi said, "be the change you wish to see in the world". So be more environmentally friendly, be more considerate, be kinder, and more awake/educated/informed. Because your behavior will spread to people around you, and around them, and so on.  that's what the elite relies on, you not knowing any better. And I think you will feel better knowing you've done your part to make this little planet were on for a while just a little better :)

       That's because major parts of the planet are overpopulated. This is a natural cycle - a species or breed thrives in some area, they over-tax the natural resources, then they starve back down to a naturally sustained level.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what makes it indescribably worse?
      </p>
      <p>
       Western do-gooders who want to "feed the world" - which causes populations that
       <em>
        cannot feed themselves
       </em>
       to begin to overpopulate the area. Then, they need even more subsidy from the do-gooders until the do-gooders finally give up ...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... then you have babies starving to death...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... repeat the cycle again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best solution for a sustainable planet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mind your own freaking business and stop worrying about "the other half."

       Primarily because the US keeps bombing them and stealing their natural resources.  That's a drastic simplification of course but you get the idea.  Ever read confessions of an economic hitman?  Also, check out the presentation I posted in this thread if you have some time (it's long 80 mins).

       That is absurd. Various third world countries that have never been bombed by the US are still, in fact, third world.

       Cool, I'll check this one out. I enjoyed the zeitgeist films in general (not sure if they are associated). My comments are in relation to the view that even if we are severely underpopulated, theres not much worth liking. But this comes from an old misanthrope waiting for a ticket to the next life.
