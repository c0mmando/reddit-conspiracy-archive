<p>Your first &quot;red-flag&quot; should be the cost of the program. There is a rule of thumb that says &quot;Nothing is free.&quot; and it&#39;s true. While the new version isn&#39;t costing you anything directly SOMEBODY is still paying for it. The company in question pays a lot of people a lot of money to write this code and produce this product. Keep that in mind while reading this, because it is important.</p>

<p>Next you need to ask yourself; If I&#39;m not paying for this who is? While I cannot answer this question with 100% certainty, we can use logic and reason to figure it out. It&#39;s possible that the company who made the program is giving it away out of the goodness of their hearts, but let&#39;s be honest - what is the likelihood of that in reality?
No, to answer your question you must ask yourself who stands to benefit by giving away hundreds of thousands, yea, even millions of man-hours of work? You can be certain that it is not the company who payed the workers. So lets scratch that off of the list...</p>

<p>Remember all of the talk about encryption? Remember all of the talk about how for our &quot;security&quot; some are demanding back-doors to this encryption? Remember this company&#39;s history of providing back-doors to other entities in the past? - now it starts to come together doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Now put yourself in the position of the one calling the shots in this company. You have released 2 operating systems since 2009 into a market that is saturated. You also have the problem of a shrinking market because of easier to use, and cheaper mobile devices. Yet the problem remains, your company must sell more operating systems, after all you have paid a lot of talented people a lot of money to produce it... What will you do?
Now imagine that an entity that you have already worked with in the past offers to subsidize hundreds of thousands of licenses in return for a small favor. A favor you already have a history of being willing to comply with. This provides the company with guaranteed income, and the ability to GIVE AWAY your product. And it provides the entity in question a back-door to the encryption on millions of devices all over the world. It&#39;s a win-win .... right?</p>

<p>Well yes! It IS indeed a win-win.... for everybody except for the person who received the free product.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The non-conspiracy answer here is that Windows is no longer their focus. They want to be a software as a service provider like Adobe. The more people who run windows the more they can tie into their office subscriptions. It is like taking a hit on selling an xbox console because you know people will have to buy your games, which is where you really sock it to &#39;em.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the correct answer.</p>

<p>Operating Systems have long been a main product of Microsoft,  but times change.  Now they have to compete with the likes of companies such as Google, who offer Android and Chrome platforms free of charge.  <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-windows-monetization-plan-services-are-the-new-attach/">Microsoft said last December</a> that going into the future, they will focus more on an end-run strategy that is less about making money on operating systems, and more about making money off of <em>apps and services that tie into their operating systems</em>.  In today&#39;s market, it simply isn&#39;t an option to make most of your revenue by selling operating systems. </p>

<p>I work in a laboratory, and we have machines that cost well over $100,000 with some closer to $500,000.  We get these machines free of charge.  Why?  Because the manufacturer knows that once we&#39;re established with the machine and put it into use, we&#39;ll spend far more money on reagents and parts and everything we need to use the machine in the coming years.  They spend millions of dollars and countless hours researching and developing these machines only to give them away for free (it&#39;s a lease, actually, but so is Windows... you never actually &quot;own&quot; Windows), because they know where the real profit is going to come from.</p>

<p>IMHO this free for a limited time is just about personal upgrades. It&#39;s marketing vs. their competition which is also free(Google/MacOS/Linux). Their real cash cow are the system builder licenses with pre-installed Windows. Afaik they also plan some kind of subscription service for business usage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course they are giving Windows 10 away for free, have you seen the sales charts for Windows 8.1? Microsoft has lots of money lying around, but it doesn&#39;t take an economics genius to see the writing on the wall. Computers are slowly fading into the background. A lot of what you want to do on a computer can be done on a tablet, or your phone. The need for a PC in the home is getting less and less as the decades move on. Plus Windows 8 was more of a disaster for MS than it was a help. So yes, I think it makes a lot of sense for them to &quot;give&quot; windows 10 away for a time. No conspiracy about it, just business. </p>

OSX upgrades are free.</p>

<p>Microsoft is just late to the game.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t trust microsoft, sure, I agree, but don&#39;t inherently trust ANY software, there could be all types of shit in Windows but that has nothing to do with the cost of the OS.  Microsoft doesn&#39;t make their money selling copies of Windows....this isn&#39;t the early 90s anymore.</p>

<p>Can somebody point me to an article with legitimate concerns about Windows 10 documented?</p>

I thought it was suspicious because the crap being said was something like your kids are so much better off cause they get to grow up with computers that listen to them and some other things I don&#39;t recall but remember it made me stop and go holy s%!@/! It seemed like they we&#39;re describing the wet dream of every dictator ever.</p>

<p>This is literally how all other operating systems work. Once you acquire the software, you get free updates. It doesn&#39;t matter if it was on the computer when you bought it or you upgraded to a new OS. This isn&#39;t anything new.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Windows 10 is not free!  It is only free for existing Win7&amp;8 users.  You must own a legitimate copy of Windows to qualify for a free Win10.  Pirates can get Windows preview versions for free (very latest OS, but can have bugs etc).  Even then Win10 is only free for 12 months.</p>

<p>Microsofts reasoning is to speed up the uptake of this OS.  Win7 took a couple of years to get established, Win 8 was extremely slow to establish.  Supporting several operating systems uses a lot of expensive resources.  </p>

<p>Oh and Win10 is brilliant.  Everything runs faster, photoshop loads quicker, gaming is improved, less HD thrashing etc.  Oh and you can ask cortana to find hot porn without taking your hand off your cock..... What&#39;s not to like?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They don&#39;t need Windows10 for that:-)</p>

<p>IMHO this free for a limited time is just about personal upgrades. It&#39;s marketing vs. their competition which is also free(Google/MacOS/Linux). Their real cash cow are the system builder licenses with pre-installed Windows. Afaik they also plan some kind of subscription service for business usage.</p>
