    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s not only the deadly, deadly ionizing radiation of the Van Allen belts. But there&#39;s also the deadly, deadly ionizing radiation that exists outside of Earth&#39;s magnetosphere.</p>

<p>The alleged Apollo astronauts had an aluminum capsule and spacesuits made of nylon. The idea that they didn&#39;t suffer any forms of radiation sickness is ridiculous. Further, each alleged astronaut had a radiation dosimeter which measured the amount of radiation each astronaut received. When they got back to Earth, NASA determined that each dosimeter had rads dosages within theoretical expectations. But in the preceding 40 years, we&#39;ve determined that the moon gives off much more radiation than initially theorized. Why wasn&#39;t this additional radiation detected on the dosimeters?</p>

<p>The Apollo missions were used as a diversion from the Vietnam war and was used to funnel money to the defense department to weaponize space. As the years go on, it becomes more and more obvious we never went to the moon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no rocket scientist, but this is one conspiracy theory I just can&#39;t fathom. Today we can land rovers on Mars and launch satellites into deep space to circle Pluto, but couldn&#39;t land a man on the moon in 1969? That defies common sense. Anyway, legend has it that 12 men actually walked on the moon, and this (<a href="http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/in-the-shadow-of-the-moon/"><em>In the Shadow of the Moon</em></a>) is their (damn good) story...told in their own words.    </p>

<p><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s2ch3.htm">http://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s2ch3.htm</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/apollo-rocketed-through-van-allen-belts">http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/apollo-rocketed-through-van-allen-belts</a></p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">Wikipedia: Van Allen radiation belt</a>:</p>

<p>The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners. <strong>The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely to send spacecraft though only the thinner areas of the outer belts</strong>. </p>

<p>Astronauts&#39; overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=58&amp;amp;v=t57KgcnQQaQ">rare interview with Neil Armstrong</a> on evoTV in Australia. At 40mins40secs into the interview, host Alex Malley confronts Neil with conspiracy theories that he never walked on the moon. The most compelling proof starts at 41:50 when footage of the actual 1969 landing is juxtaposed against modern Google Moon imagery. If that doesn&#39;t convince you that Neil walked on the moon, then I suppose nothing short of you going up there yourself (and retrieving the camera he left behind) will do.</p>

<p>This is not true in any meaningful sense; in fact it&#39;s exactly the opposite. Most of the energy expended during the Apollo flights, for instance, was spent accelerating the spacecraft and its upper stage to orbital speed. It takes about 9,500 meters per second of Δv to go from the launch pad to Earth orbit. From there, it only takes a <em>total</em> of about 3,200 meters per second to escape the Earth entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anywhere you want /can travel to with the tech. you have. Yes mars as an example.</p>

<p>But with the right tech. leaving earth would be alot easier so in that case it would be mute... IE anti gravity. or something similar. If you don&#39;t know breaking free of earths gravity is what takes up most of the fuel used in takeoffs. And that is why it would be easier to have a moon base. (with our current tech)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/apollo-rocketed-through-van-allen-belts">http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/apollo-rocketed-through-van-allen-belts</a></p>

<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">Wikipedia: Van Allen radiation belt</a>:</p>

<p>The Apollo missions marked the first event where humans traveled through the Van Allen belts, which was one of several radiation hazards known by mission planners. <strong>The astronauts had low exposure in the Van Allen belts due to the short period of time spent flying through them. Apollo flight trajectories bypassed the inner belts completely to send spacecraft though only the thinner areas of the outer belts</strong>. </p>

<p>Astronauts&#39; overall exposure was actually dominated by solar particles once outside Earth&#39;s magnetic field. The total radiation received by the astronauts varied from mission to mission but was measured to be between 0.16 and 1.14 rads (1.6 and 11.4 mGy), much less than the standard of 5 rem (50 mSv) per year set by the United States Atomic Energy Commission for people who work with radioactivity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Common sense is pretty much irrelevant here. What matters is the actual <em>quantities</em> of radiation and the actual <em>quantities</em> of energy/mass involved in moving objects around. I could say that it &quot;defies common sense&quot; that a man could lift a truck with one hand, but if the truck only weights 50 pounds, it suddenly becomes plausible -- what matters is the <em>quantities</em>, not the names we give to things.</p>
