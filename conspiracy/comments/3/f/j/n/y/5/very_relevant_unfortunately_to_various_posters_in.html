<p>Really?  It&#39;s hypocritical to suggest that there&#39;s a link between being mentally deficient and being incapable of treating human beings equally regardless of their skin color or race?  You might need to go back and recheck your &quot;critical thinking&quot; abilities there, Einstein, because there is exactly nothing prejudice or derogatory about calling someone mentally deficient who IS mentally deficient, nor is there anything hypocritical about calling someone racist who in point of fact actually <em>is a racist</em>.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Well, racism most definitely is one of the most prevalent ways (if not <em>the</em> most prevalent way) to keep the masses divided and at odds with one another.  This is most definitely correct.  However, the statement that &quot;bigotry based conspiracies are always false&quot; seems quite a bit too general to be valid.  You&#39;d have to be more clear with regard to what you mean by that because the fact of the matter is that A) bigotry <em>does</em> indeed exist, B) conspiracies most definitely do exist as well, and C) sometimes (but not always) A and B most definitely do work together.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Correct, but we are not just talking here about the fact that racism has been used for conspiratorial purposes.  This is correct, and, again, I do not disagree with this.  We are saying that there are various member here in this very sub that have fallen into the ignorant, racist, bigoted thinking themselves - and <em>that</em> is something that should be done away with and rooted out.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>do you think there is a link between racism and conspiratorial views?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No.  That is not to say that no racists have conspiratorial views.  Of course they can.  All types can have conspiratorial views.  However, having conspiratorial views <em>does</em> tend to take a bit more “outside of the box” type thinking - and although there <em>are</em> most definitely some racists that have conspiratorial views (as demonstrated in this very sub, unfortunately), the more capable one is of actually thinking outside the box, the more capable one tends to also be of realizing just how negative, bad for you, and (yes) manipulated by TPTB is racism itself.  Excluding the mentally imbalanced, those aware of the conspiratorial end of things on this planet also tend to be more critical thinkers than the average person - and those that are more critical thinkers tend to understand just how self-defeating racism actually is.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that there <em>are</em> racist types in the conspiracy fields and in this subreddit still, but these are generally people that are simply not intelligent enough to break through their indoctrination regardless of what type of information they come across.</p>

<p>It&#39;s included in your apparent failure to understand that, as I said above, racism seems to be a hallmark of a low-thinking individual regardless of <em>what</em> political leaning they might have.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get lost in that.  Understand, as a matter of fact, that it doesn&#39;t really matter whether one is a &quot;republican&quot; or a &quot;democrat&quot;, as they&#39;re <em>both</em> two sides of the same evil coin anyway.  Don&#39;t lose the forest for the trees.</p>
