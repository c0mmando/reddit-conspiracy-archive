       What's prejudice about suggesting a link exists between being prejudice and being dumb/mentally deficient?  If there's a link,

        there's a link

       You obviously see the problem considering you left out the socially conservative portion of the "link." This is bigotry plain and simple.

       I don't even care one way or the other about "socially conservative" this or that.  The
       <em>
        point

       is that (as I already said) being racist
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed a mark of mental deficiency regardless of what type of...political "spin" or whatever you try to put on it.

       Really?  It's hypocritical to suggest that there's a link between being mentally deficient and being incapable of treating human beings equally regardless of their skin color or race?  You might need to go back and recheck your "critical thinking" abilities there, Einstein, because there is exactly nothing prejudice or derogatory about calling someone mentally deficient who IS mentally deficient, nor is there anything hypocritical about calling someone racist who in point of fact actually
       <em>
        is a racist
       </em>

      <p>
       Well, racism most definitely is one of the most prevalent ways (if not
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       most prevalent way) to keep the masses divided and at odds with one another.  This is most definitely correct.  However, the statement that "bigotry based conspiracies are always false" seems quite a bit too general to be valid.  You'd have to be more clear with regard to what you mean by that because the fact of the matter is that A) bigotry
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       indeed exist, B) conspiracies most definitely do exist as well, and C) sometimes (but not always) A and B most definitely do work together.

      <p>
       Correct, but we are not just talking here about the fact that racism has been used for conspiratorial purposes.  This is correct, and, again, I do not disagree with this.  We are saying that there are various member here in this very sub that have fallen into the ignorant, racist, bigoted thinking themselves - and
       <em>
        that

       Yes I agree with your second statement about some conspiracy users.  I don't like those kind of posts and yet while there is some effort to keep the level down, I am not convinced banning all racist 
posts is a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       and as for item one when I say false it does not mean that the conspiracies don't exist but they only exist because they were created by the group in power in order to stay in power and could be ended, but since they are so useful they are cultivated and encouraged.

       Interesting study, thanks for the post. I guess it shouldn't surprise anyone that stupid people have stupid beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do you think there is a link between racism and conspiratorial views? I would be surprised by that especially considering the study links racism and social conservatism, and I doubt there are many social conservatives on this subreddit.

      <p>
       No.  That is not to say that no racists have conspiratorial views.  Of course they can.  All types can have conspiratorial views.  However, having conspiratorial views
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       tend to take a bit more “outside of the box” type thinking - and although there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       most definitely some racists that have conspiratorial views (as demonstrated in this very sub, unfortunately), the more capable one is of actually thinking outside the box, the more capable one tends to also be of realizing just how negative, bad for you, and (yes) manipulated by TPTB is racism itself.  Excluding the mentally imbalanced, those aware of the conspiratorial end of things on this planet also tend to be more critical thinkers than the average person - and those that are more critical thinkers tend to understand just how self-defeating racism actually is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is unfortunate that there
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       racist types in the conspiracy fields and in this subreddit still, but these are generally people that are simply not intelligent enough to break through their indoctrination regardless of what type of information they come across.

       Implicit biases (eg racial and social discrimation) are always manifesting we simply cannot "shut them down", yet they shouldn't affect our judgment and ability to rationalize and sympathize.

       This is exactly correct.  There
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       differences between individuals, and between
       <em>
        groups
       </em>
       of individuals.  This is a fact, of course.  However, and as you said, there is no reason why this should affect our judgement or ability to empathize, sympathize, and be a rational, critical thinker on behalf of any given situation independent of one's race.

       trying to paint this sub as racist, then you cannot be more summarily incorrect.  I'm stating that some individuals in this sub most definitely

       Seems like you're totally missing the point here.  Some people ARE in fact very much racist.  Saying there's a link between low IQs and racism isn't demonizing.  It's, as I've already stated, a simple observation.  There's a big difference between the two things.

       No.  Anyone who denigrates others on the basis of their race is a racist.

       It's included in your apparent failure to understand that, as I said above, racism seems to be a hallmark of a low-thinking individual regardless of
       <em>
        what
       </em>
       political leaning they might have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get lost in that.  Understand, as a matter of fact, that it doesn't really matter whether one is a "republican" or a "democrat", as they're
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       two sides of the same evil coin anyway.  Don't lose the forest for the trees.

       very smart, and an inability to understand that human beings are equal regardless of their race or skin color.
