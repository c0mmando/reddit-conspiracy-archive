       I think humans have colonized much of the solar system. Civilization on Earth has, I think, risen and fallen multiple times, over hundreds of thousands of years, each time crashing back to near Stone Age level.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Think about what you, yourself, would know how to do if civilization broke down and all these technologies just stopped working. Maybe I could build a generator, maybe.. if I had some wire... But I don't know even how to mine for copper, let along smelt it. To paraphrase Joe Rogan, you could leave me in the forest for 1000 years and I'd never figure out how to build an iPhone.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       But a small group is able to keep and occult the knowledge and technology each time. While the rest of us are rebuilding from Stone Age, they're zipping about in anti-grav saucers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's the big secret. And as we find older and older archeological sites, the picture becomes more and more clear: Humans have been around for a
       <strong>
        very
       </strong>
       long time, and somebody doesn't want us to know about it. There is a reason for that.

       I honestly have no idea any more. So much dicey shit about the moon landing and other stuff. This is a good question to ask, but one area where I really don't have much in the way of concrete hypothesis anymore.

       Bro, that really isn't true. Both NASA and other, independent scientists, have announced several times over the past few decades that they think they have found evidence of alien life. The problem hasn't been that they haven't released the information, but rather that nobody seems to pay any attention to it.

       That is patently false. I believe the moon landings are faked. Arrive at that realization and then you will take the same path as I have in questioning other things NASA says. If you don't question the moon landings even one bit, then see you later when you do.

       You really are obtuse, aren't you? The ISS exists, and there are many independent photographs of it. Funny how every time that is brought up - including information on how to see it for yourself - you very quickly run away from the conversation, never to return. Are you really that terrified to find out that you may be wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me, have you ever heard of Occam's Razor? It's a lot easier to believe that the space program exists than there is some sort of global conspiracy by thousands of people and dozens of countries that has been maintained in near-perfect secrecy for the last 60 years...

       Occam's razor would dictate that in fact, ISS doesn't exist. The assumptions you are making about the people who rule over us are all good, just, truthful and benevolent has been proved wrong time and time again. Think about before Galileo proved the world was round. Most people thought it was flat. That didn't make it true. Don't you know that the same logic applies here. Just because most people believe something, it doesnt have to be true. Most people simply parrot lies that they hear from media and authority figures anyway. Is that too hard for you to understand?

       Now who is making assumptions? I never said any of that. Believe it or not, there is a possibility where the leaders are not benevolent and the ISS to exist.

      <p>
       And if the ISS doesn't exist, what about all the independent observations of it? Is everyone around the world who posts a picture of it from their backyard part of your giant conspiracy? Not every photo of it comes from NASA.

       Tell me, have you ever bothered to actually

       up in the sky with a telescope and follow the instructions that are posted online? I know it's difficult for you to comprehend, but there might actually be something up there besides your tinfoil hat. And you could actually find out something for yourself rather than listening to a random Youtube video (which

       I am saying it is easy to do so if you have the proper equipment, which I don't happen to have. And I'm not going to spend several hundred dollars just to prove a paranoid nutcase as yourself wrong.

       There are plenty of other examples of civilian photographs of the ISS out there

       one happens to be one of my recent favorites, but there are plenty of others. You just refuse to accept any of them because of your paranoia that all images are faked by every single person in the world.
