        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/bombshell-cdc-destroyed-vaccine-documents-congressman-reveals/">Source</a></p>

<p>“…the [CDC] co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the [MMR vaccine] study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.” (William Thompson, CDC researcher)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On July 29, <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4546421/rep-bill-posey-calling-investigation-cdcs-mmr-reasearch-fraud">US Congressman Bill Posey made his last stand on the floor of the House</a>. </p>

<p>Granted five minutes to speak, he laid bare the lying of the CDC in a now-famous 2004 study that exonerated the MMR vaccine and claimed it had no connection to autism.</p>

<p>“No connection to autism” was the lie.</p>

<p>Congressman Posey read a statement from <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/22/cdc-whistleblower-revealed-william-thompson/">long-time CDC researcher William Thompson</a>, one of the authors of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754936">2004 Pediatrics study</a> designed to determine, once and for all, whether the Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine could cause autism.</p>

<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/the-big-one-cdc-whistleblower-goes-public-now/">Thompson saw and participated in violating the protocol of the study</a>. He was there. He helped his co-authors destroy documents that would have shown an MMR-autism link.</p>

<p>You can see a rush transcript of Congressman Posey’s remarks <a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2015/07/breaking-news-congressman-posey-on-house-floor-cdc-authors-of-2004-mmr-paper-destroyed-documents.html">here</a> (on the ageofautism.com website), which includes his reading of a statement from whistleblower Thompson.</p>

<p>Posey pleads with his colleagues for a Congressional investigation.</p>

<p>Of note: two of the CDC researchers on the infamous 2004 study, who according to Thompson, destroyed vital documents, are <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/new-cdc-whistleblower-video-more-autism-fraud/">Coleen Boyle</a> and <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/cnn-asks-serial-lying-liar-to-comment-on-the-cdc-whistleblower-scandal/">Frank DeStefano</a>. They are both high-ranking executives at the CDC in the area of vaccine safety.</p>

<p>This calls into question every single CDC study, under their tenure, that claims vaccines are safe.</p>

<p>CDC whistleblower Thompson’s statement, which Posey read on the House floor, includes this bombshell:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“However, because I [Thompson] assumed it [destroying the documents] was illegal and would violate both FOIA and DOJ requests, I kept hard copies of all documents in my office and I retained all associated computer files. I believe we intentionally withheld controversial findings from the final draft of the Pediatrics paper.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thompson has the smoking-gun documents. So does Congressman Posey. I believe others do as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>So: publish them. Publish them now.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>There are lawsuits to be filed. Eleven years have passed since the CDC committed its crime of concealing the MMR vaccine-autism connection. How many parents, never informed of the truth, have permitted their children to receive this vaccine? How many children have been struck down by the vaccine?</p>

<p>The lawsuits should be filed against the CDC and the individual authors of the 2004 study. Lawyers must depose every CDC employee who had knowledge of the crime.</p>

<p>And what about the fact that the MMR vaccine is one of the shots that has been mandated, by law, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/mandatory-vaccination-california-is-ordering-genetic-alteration/">in California</a>, in other states, and in <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/australia-vaccine-war-update-the-people-slaves-to-the-state/">Australia</a>? </p>

<p>Mandating neurological destruction of children is a crime that must be investigated and punished. If these states (and other countries) insist on keeping the MMR on their schedules, they are guilty parties.</p>

<p>Here, for background, <a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/category/autism/">are earlier articles I wrote about whistleblower Thompson</a>, starting when the story broke in the summer of 2014.</p>

<p>Understand what we are dealing with here, in terms of public exposure: the author of a peer-reviewed and published study; the author who has worked for many years at the CDC; the author who participated in destruction of vital documents; the author has come forward and admitted his crime and the crime of his colleagues. This kind of confession never happens.</p>

<p><em>But it did happen.</em></p>

<p>And this story and what it means must not die, no matter how major media outlets try to spin it or ignore it.</p>

<p>Parents who are, in ignorance, allowing their children to receive the MMR vaccine, must be informed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQT5dS6mq4U">They must know what is going on</a>. They must know the danger to their children.</p>

<p>Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, Germany, France, India, China, South Africa…wherever the MMR vaccine is given…parents must be made aware they’re gambling with their children’s lives.</p>

<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/open-letter-to-australian-pm-tony-abbott-the-mmr-vaccine/">Government officials anywhere in the world</a> who make this continuing crime possible are liable.</p>

<p>So are manufacturers of the MMR.</p>

<p>Get busy. Expose the truth.</p>

<p>Pay the extra cost 100-200 dollars to get vaccinated for measles, wait a month then get the stand alone mumps vaccine, wait a month then get the stand alone rubela vaccine.</p>

<p>You have more options than being ignorantly anti-vax or ignorantly pro-vax.</p>

If the other kids are vaccinated they run very little to ( its been proven vaccines are less than 90% effective...) no risk of getting the disease.

    <div class="md"><p>Hello brunes,</p>

<p>So it seems you&#39;re rather new to this topic, you believe Mumps is as deadly as Ebola, you are also unaware that the Merck scientists involved with making the Mumps vaccine have blown the whistle that Merck forced them to fake the efficacy tests by adding animal antibodies, this is because the vaccine doesn&#39;t work and should never have been allowed on the market.</p>

<p>Keep in mind the Mumps vaccine is live virus, this means it spreads the disease itself.</p>

<p>I understand that you&#39;re either simply repeating something you heard from one of the paid pharmaceutical propagandists, or that you are one of the paid pharmaceutical propagandists, whatever the answer is I would strongly recommend that you refrain from posting such irresponsible comments given that it&#39;s now been admitted that the MMR vaccine is causing Autism, by CDC whistleblowers who were part of the cover-up.  Autism is lifelong and leaves children is a total mess, whereas Mumps is short-term and so mild that most people don&#39;t even know they&#39;ve got it.  That&#39;s why the late Dr Maurice Hilleman (former Merck Vaccine Chief) once remarked that it would be ludicrous to ever create a vaccine for such as mild illness as Mumps.</p>

<p>Have a lovely day!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most the pro-vaxx people are just paid to post propaganda, the MMR is one of the most dangerous jabs, I&#39;d strongly recommend you don&#39;t risk leaving your little girl neurologically disabled.  There are no diseases worth worrying about in the First World, whereas vaccines they carry serious risks.  Here are two expert doctors who have not sold out to Big Pharma, they both explain why no vaccine is worth the risk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFQQOv-Oi6U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFQQOv-Oi6U</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVE2l2RJ8lY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVE2l2RJ8lY</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched so many parents see their child go vaccine-disabled e.g. Diabetes Type 1, Regressive Autism, Asthma, Motor Neurone Disease, MS, Muscle Wasting Diseases etc.  These are the real things to be scared of, we shouldn&#39;t be scared of catching spots for one week and having a runny nose, that&#39;s not a real problem.  The pharmaceuticals want you sick for life with a vaccine-induced disease, that way they get to sell you drugs for life.</p>

<p>Quotes from their meeting</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>What&#39;s so difficult to accept? That history may not be as simply cut and dry as some would have you believe? That although millions of people died in slave labor camps, that they were perhaps not intentionally killed? Unlike the eisenhower death camps where germans were intentionally left to starve to death even though the americans had food to feed them. </p>

<p>The germans are notoriously efficient people, if they were hell bent on literal genocide poorly built zyklon b gas chambers (designed for delousing) would be the last thing they would do.</p>

<p>They would do what the americans did...round everyone up and starve them to death. Which is not what was observed in the concentration camps. The prisoners were fed, until the end of the war when even the germans were starving. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, I believe I clearly addressed his question because the health standards prior to the post war 20th century era could be considered comparable to that of a 3rd world country currently. My information shows that there was a considerable, almost total decline in mortality from the disease prior to introduction of the vaccine. And if we aren&#39;t concerned with mortality rates, then why are we vaccinating? to avoid the mild inconvenience of being sick for a week? </p>

<p>Secondly, a decline in the mortality rate is indicative of a declining contraction rate which one would assume meant a decline of non-death related side effects.</p>

<p>We vaccinate as a risk management technique firstly against death, and secondly against physical/mental impairment. Whether it&#39;s to avoid dying from the disease ourselves or passing it to someone that could potentially die from it (an infant, for example), we&#39;ve been coerced into vaccination participation based on data that is not a reflection of the efficacy of the vaccine, but of the social standards of health and wellness. </p>

<p>Relatedly, it has now been shown that the CDC not only twists data to serve a bias/agenda, but they straight up - with awareness and intention - destroy data that would undermine their ability to continue to push an unnecessary drug. They have proven themselves not to be trustworthy, so why would you take their word on anything?</p>

<p>We vaccinate for 3 reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to avoid the .3% chance of dying from getting sick (the modern chance of dying from measles according to the same wiki article)</p></li>
<li><p>to avoid what with measles is the extreme discomfort of having it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others.[4][6]...symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104.0 °F), cough, runny nose, and red eyes.[1][3] A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms.[3] Symptoms usually develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7–10 days.[4][5] </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>to not spread it to others, especially those that are more vulnerable to measles ( the elderly, the people with compromised immune systems, the poor). </p></li>
</ul>

<p>considering that without vaccines you would be getting infected with many more diseases, not just measles, I wouldn&#39;t want to be rolling the dice that many times. </p>

<p>As you can see, these people are being accused/convicted/sentenced, <strong>not</strong> for some paranoid fantasy, but for <strong>the CRIME of conspiracy</strong>, as defined above.</p>

<p>Generally accepted  history holds that Hitler and his henchmen formulated a SECRET PLOT (it was not widely known among the German people, let alone the outside world) to disenfranchise, delegitimize, round up, imprison and ultimately murder over 11 million human beings - the majority of which were Jews. If that it true, The Holocaust was a <strong>CONSPIRACY</strong>.</p>

<p>Others insist that much of the history of the era was exaggerated or fabricated by the Allies (and others) to demonize the Germans, &quot;justify&quot; Allied atrocities, etc. If that it true, it was a <strong>CONSPIRACY</strong>.</p>

<p>Believe it, or not, the Holocaust was definitely a conspiracy, only question is, who were the conspirators?</p>

Above right: This is the plaque currently on display at Auschwitz (2002) - note the suddenly reduced number of victims to 1.5 million - a casual reduction in the number of deaths by 2.5 million.</p>
