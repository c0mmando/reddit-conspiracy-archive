<p>I hate this conflation.  I&#39;m a creative type, and I had a good year where I was a &quot;1% er&quot; because I had written some stuff people really liked.</p>

<p>And yet I have never been a nephew of a congressman, or a connected business guy, or any of the other government-string people who I get lumped in with as 1%ers.  </p>

<p>Also, I forever resent that I wasn&#39;t able to save what I earned in that one good year to tide me over in the future because a lot of economic non-thinkers had decided that when I have a good year, I should get taxed massively.</p>

<p>Progressive taxes are <em>hell</em> for artists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t mean it that way, you misunderstand.</p>

<p>My point was that the people who make the decisions and push this kind of stuff are not the peple who make $1,000,000 or even $10,000,000 a year. They are the people with billions and trillions in assets, with bloodlines that go back to royalty...they are untouchable and they can make a person in the 1% look like they&#39;re poor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I understood what you meant.  I was giving kudos-- and then I threadjacked to do my own bitching, because just because of one good piece of artwork I ended up as &quot;the hated, the despised, the unholy 1%&quot; for a year.  And taxed like I had daddy&#39;s trust fund there to always keep me in wine and caviar!  </p>

<p>So I agree-- there&#39;s a huge difference between the world&#39;s royalty, and a successful artist or businessman.  I resented being lumped in with them.  </p>

<p>I know not everyone holds to my beliefs in the bible. </p>

<p>But in bible prophecy, it speaks of a new world order to usher in the mark of the beast where people wont be able to buy or sell without it. They want a feudal system again, a world feudal system where everyone is a slave to their elite bloodline. </p>

<p>Then look at the recent discovery video of the Skull and Bones initiation &quot;process&quot; for its chosen. Which is a Masonry proxy.</p>

<p>They utilize media, pharmaceuticals and group psychology to keep the &quot;people/slaves&quot; suppressed enough not be able to to decipher their plans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone keeps assuming that the .01% are a united group.  They aren&#39;t.  They are struggling amongst each other for power.  Each person gets congress to rig the system a little bit more in their favor.  If they play it as a zero sum game, where they get money for themselves at the expense of other rich, it will get rejected.  Thus they all take it from the rest of society.  They know the system will break but the only way to fix it is for all of them to say &#39;lets keep the power as it currently stands&#39;.  This is great for the top few but the people below won&#39;t stand for that, they want to be at the top too because they earned it.  So they continue.  </p>

<p>The status quo can&#39;t be maintained because it is all about game theory amongst the richest of the richest and their desire for power and control.  The Nash equilibrium is at a point where society collapses and they flee the country with their loot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greed. Because they want MORE and at this point they think they can be obvious in their TAKING of it.</p>

<p>Some - very few - understand it&#39;s becoming a problem. Buffet carries a pretty consistent message that the government needs to correct the misbalance. A few others of the wealthiest have suggested that they KNOW there will be an uprising unless the system gets fixed.</p>

<p>But most... most are stupid and blinded by greed.</p>
