       This feels like too much censorship to me. I learned about the 1993 bombing incident from watching Bill Hicks interviews on YouTube and was genuinely surprised to hear that even

        Clinton bombed Iraq
       </a>
       . The mods said you can't post about the Clintons at all since Hilary is running for office, but it has nothing to do with her and was 22 years ago WTF

       Folks, the media company that owns reddit is an ultra "liberal" Democratic party aligned firm that is run by hard core Zionist Jews.

       So I looked that up and yeah Reddit
       <del>
        is
       </del>
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       owned by
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond%C3%A9_Nast">
        Condé Nast
       </a>
       . The owner of Condé Nast is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Irving_Newhouse,_Jr.">
        Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr.
       </a>
       and he is Jewish, but that doesn't mean the moderators of every subreddit are the owners of the site. Although yes there is definitely a bias here because they also could have claimed it had ties to Jeb Bush since it was his father they allegedly tried to assassinate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: So apparently they did some shuffling around in 2011, and Reddit's majority shareholder is now
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Publications#Reddit">
        Advance Publications
       </a>
       ...the
       <strong>
        parent company
       </strong>
       of Condé Nast.
       <strong>
        Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr.; Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr.

       No but if you look at all the moderators for the default subs, political and news subs, or any others that get a lot of traffic (TIL), you'll see a glaring pattern emerge in who mods those places.  Conde Nast owning Reddit isn't new information either, it's out there for anyone who took the time to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny think is half the outraged redditors have no idea about this and think it's 'tin-foil hat thinking' that majority of reddit is not only censored but given a direct narrative to follow.

       Don't feel like you're thinking too deeply here. You bring up a good point: with our discussions being held to the public but kept in this little sub, it allows easy monitoring of our every thought. Your inquiry gives reason to the fact that this sub hasn't been shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       However,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       isn't the only place harboring conspiracy discussions. There are hundreds of websites that discuss general conspiracy theories, thousands that discuss specific theories, and tens of thousands of forums on various websites (which
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       would be considered part of) which people discuss this stuff, as well as millions of emails, instant messages, and PMs that are sent every year which perpetuate all kinds of conspiracy theories. To think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       holds everything the US Gov needs to know about conspiracy theories is absurd. However, it presents enough useful facts so that if Reddit were indeed taken over by anyome affiliated with the US Gov, that it wouldn't be shut down.

      <p>
       I'd still submit myself to the idea that 1 right winged wingnut attempting to sort out his own personal beliefs on a sub he moderates.

       I'm on mobile right now, but I'd like to see every sub that guy moderates. Also, I'd like to see everything that mod who deleted the benign post in
       <a href="/r/space">
        /r/space
       </a>
       moderates. Perhaps they could be up to something.

       Reddit constantly and consistently displays a very conservative, racist streak. What fucking liberal conspiracy is this? Reddit used to be a liberal website, now it's filled with angry white American kids who now think being a white trash redneck is what is cool.

      <p>
       Just count how many times some angry American white dude calls someone a SJW. You basically need to be a Klansman on this site to avoid being called a SJW.

       Look at what gets upvoted the most, look at the comments, and stop this nonsense of a liberal conspiracy. It's the same shit the right do in the media, even when the media is already biased towards the right, pro-war etc... the right still complain in order to move the centre further to the right.

        The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum - even encourage the more critical and dissident views. That gives people the sense that there's free thinking going on, while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of the debate. --Noam Chomsky

       Welcome to the era of dynasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume it would be beyond the pale to post a TIL about Neil Bush having dinner with the Hinkleys the night before the assassination attempt. Or that he ran over his housekeeper. Or his involvement in the S&amp;L crisis. Or his company marketing FCAT testing software to Florida schools while Jeb was in office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Or George HW Bush being in Dallas at the time of the JFK assassination. Or Prescott Bush's involvement with the Nazis. Is WWII now off the table in TIL?

       It was linked on this sub not to long back about a person or company or organization I don't remember that was hiring people to make accounts on reddit and downvote/upvote the posts they wanted you to for pay. It wasn't a lot of money but if you had enough accounts working this angle I'm sure you could make a living at it. I would dig up the link but I'm on  mobile and its late. Whenever I am in a controversial thread I scroll to the deep bottom to see if there is a hidden comment that has been intentionally downvoted to oblivion.

       The problem with that statement is that negative accusations need to be proven, TIL can be detrimental to a standing candidate or in this case, a standing candidates husband which could sway voters or for better words be used for propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to stop their sub-reddit from becoming /conspiracy or /politics they put a simple rule in, keep TIL general and not about the candidates, especially not personally. Had this person been smart, they would have not went out of the way to make it look so propagandized.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can still get your point across without using such a biased head line and subliminally lead users into figuring out information on their own. In this case, that wasn't done.

       I completely agree. If you really try almost anything can be tied to recent politics. It makes me laugh that they claim it was because of ties to Hilary when they also could have said it had ties to Jeb Bush since it was his father who they supposedly tried to assassinate.

       Did anyone else feel at the time of his sex scandal that we were being told a dick joke to distract from something else that government were up to? I was only around 16 at the time and the Internet was still a dial up piece of shit and I didn't really have the inclination to figure it out. Can anybody add any credibility to this theory?

       Supposedly Kenneth Starr looked into a huge number of Clinton scandals and decided to zero in on Lewinsky because he felt it would be the easiest to prove - there's a reason Bill was known as Slick Willie. So he got the conflicting depositions - Clinton assumed Lewinsky would cover up for him - and the rest is history.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can imagine deeper conspiracy theories like Starr was forced to avoid collateral damage associated with the other scandals (e.g. don't tarnish the Bushes), but there's no evidence of that and there is enough motive available to believe the surface story that Starr was tasked with taking down Clinton and he went about it the most effective way he knew how.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, it is true that 99% of the public has forgotten about or never knew about the dozen other Clinton scandals (shameful that the term "Rose Law Firm" will not ring a bell even with Republican voters), but that's just because they're not paying attention.

       That answer is spot on. I don't recall the timing of the two, the Lewinsky scandal and NAFTA, but I do remember the feeling of how this never ending he said she said, and Republican witch hunting ( they were seething mad) was hiding something more important that the government, and their best friends the MSM wanted you to hear. It happens a lot if you add it up some sensationalist story will run for weeks all the while behind closed doors your jobs being sent over seas and someone other than you is getting a tax break inside a bill for proper restraining of your dog. So, I feel it, too.

       Smells like a coup a Reddit.  Every outlet for truth and free speech has been hi-jacked to maintain status quo - including this one.  Reddit is no longer Reddit.  I can't tell the disinfo from the alternative news from the faux news from the mainstream bullshit anymore.  Conclusion?  There is truth but it is buried so deep in manipulated layers of controlled media and propoganda that it will never see the light of day.

       Yeah I've started to refer to reddit as eddit, all they do is edit the content that doesn't follow their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just learned about r/undelete about a week ago and it has made me lose all faith in reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to make a clone of reddit without moderators where content will only get deleted after a majority of the user base votes it to be. The users will be the moderators. The post would have to receive a certain amount of traffic first and you would have to battle multiple accounts but I'm sure someone could figure it out...and even then it wouldn't be deleted completely, just a warning that this content was overwhelmingly down voted, then you could still view it if you wanted. I hate it when someone deletes a comment and all the replies are out of context after that.

       Dude...I don't think you realize....Reddit is owned,operated, and controlled by a bunch of liberal douchebag teenagers who love kommies and Dimocrats.  Posting things that reflect negatively on the Dimocratic party is not allowed, and/or downvoted into oblivion.  We can't let facts get in the way of the mantra. Dimokrats = good. Republicans = bad.  Now get with the program, komrade.

       You have no idea how much trouble I've had finding the right place to post this. If you could please point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.

       I tried r/todayilearned and they deleted it due to ties with Hilary?????
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried r/history but it's politics so it got deleted there

      <p>
       I tried r/politics but apparently it's too old so also deleted
      </p>
      <p>
       So where is the appropriate place for this because I didn't know about this and I'm sure a lot of other people would be interested. There might a subreddit related to politics with a very small user base that I could find and it would get absolutely no attention. So what good is that. It
       <strong>

       history but has to do with politics. I just learned about it today but it doesn't matter. Reddit needs to drop the R because all it does is eddit content that a few moderators don't want to see

       Man...I totally feel your frustration. At least posting it here got some views from people, even though you are pretty much preaching to the choir. The mods have sticks up their asses, just like anyone else with power develops. I don't understand how they sleep at night.

       So a user should be able to decide where to post. The mods should question the post but not remove it for some absurd made up reason. That draws suspicion. But in reality, we don't live in a perfect world of everyone being on the same page.

       check out this story I;m gonna post--as soon as the reddit karma fixes itself----totally shows how the un(Clintons)did 911

      </p>
      <p>
       mossad agents were arrested by Mexican police on 10-10-01 --trying to attack the Mexican congress building--and of it's subsequent censorship by all pro u.n. media---except for cnn reporting it for half a day
      </p>
      <p>
       getting caught with fake Pakistani passports and bombs
      </p>
      <p>
       it is kind of my "duty' to spread this story around---in the name of overall "justice"---it was labeled as a "conspiracy theory" and not posted in the rhistory section
      </p>
      <p>
       I am well meaning---and would enjoy talking to you guys//answering questions---or hearing opinions--and maybe some advice--to help get the message spread a little bit
      </p>
      <p>
       no conflict---just friendly conversation---the way I see it---this story is going to completely shake the foundations of the earth
      </p>
      <h2>
       thank you kindly!
      </h2>
      <p>
       anyways--this smoking gun has "short circuited" about 3 other sites---and is not a typical "conspiracy theory"---in that it is on the front page of the biggest msm newspaper in mexico

       It doesn't do this, ever - vote fuzzing is one thing, but karma never just "fixes itself". So you should post that story as a thread now, instead of in a hard-to-find comment in an unrelated thread.

       Now, if you mean fix as in "rigged", that's a different story.
