       Jews don't control everything. There are some people that publicly present themselves as jewish but there are many other races and religions involved. Now that's assuming they actually believe that. I'm inclined to think they are more into occultism than Judaism or Christianity.Their race or religion has nothing to do with the crimes they commit and bringing it up constantly accomplishes nothing aside from making your position unappealing to most. Also, limiting yourself to Jews will cause you to miss out on a lot of other stuff that doesn't involve Jews....bad people are bad people regardless of race. The stuff you post is simple minded conspiracy fluff for people that like to pretend it's all the Jews. I'm not denying many Jews are in positions of power and are involved. I'm saying I doubt they're really Jewish AND they aren't the only group of people running the show.

       They are part of the picture undoubtedly... It's just unnecessary to constantly throw Zionist-Jew in every title. It's not all Zionist jews running The show and it doesn't make anything they do better or worse so it's pointless to constantly put it there.

       The bigger issue I have is the black v white narrative you contribute to. You act like black people standing up against police brutality are denying that white people are also abused... They stand up for their community specifically but that doesn't mean they stand against white people. There some naive people who I would consider the mirror image of yourself who do think all whites are bad, the vast majority doesn't. They aren't saying "only black lives matter" they are saying "black lives matter too."

       Does it matter? These are individual people with separates thoughts and opinions. Of course the media tries to portray them in a certain light and steer them a certain way, but they do that with everything... The tea party, occupy wall st, etc. Police brutality is real, black discrimination is real. The individuals who go to marches and protests are real people with real concerns.... The same group you're interested in also works to keep black ghettos filled.

Comcast is sometimes described as a family business.[23] Brian L. Roberts, Chairman, President, and CEO of Comcast, is son of co-founder Ralph Roberts. Brian owns or controls just over 1% of all Comcast shares but all of the Class B supervoting shares, which gives him an "undilutable 33% voting power over the company".[24] Legal expert Susan P. Crawford has said this gives him "effective control over its [Comcast's] every step".

       I never tried to dispute those claims. I'm saying Zionists are a part of a larger picture. There are more people and groups involved. Also, focusing on their religion is pointless as it comes off as racist and drives people away. This group of people does bad things, that's it.... No need for race to be involved especially when There are clearly other races and religions involved.

       Dude, I wish I could help you. But its like watching a pack of rabid hyena's tear apart a sheep right in the middle of the herd. These jidf work in packs. Rabid animals, spreading the disease of lies.

       Yes, what op states is the root of this planets ills.  There are many more evils, but none as insidious as Jews.
