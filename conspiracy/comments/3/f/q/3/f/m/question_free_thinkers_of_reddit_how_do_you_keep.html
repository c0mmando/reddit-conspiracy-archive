       So, I am somewhat new to this way of thinking (~3 years), and throughout these years I have encountered countless facts/historical events/news that seem to never fail to shock, enrage and disappoint me.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, when I go out there and talk to my family and friends about these issues, they tend to brush me off as some hippie or a radical socialist or a delusional conspiracy theorist blabbering on about nonsense when I am using facts to deliver my points across.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just talking generally here - with the relentless corruption and hidden evil in the world and with irrational sheeple refusing to face the truth with you, how do you guys keep yourself from, you know, giving it all up? What keeps you going?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have hope in humanity, I do... It's just extremely hard to keep that up sometimes. Any tips?
      </p>

       Yeah, I used to get upset trying to reach people with facts and truth when they obviously didn't want to hear it. Its frustrating and can wear you down but after awhile I just kind of accepted that all I can do is live my own way, and leave others alone to chose their own path, and just watch how it plays out. I think that's basically all anyone can do.

       I feel a good bit safer than I think the  blissfully ignorant are because TPTB won't be able to use the element of surprise against me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen 'good ol boys ' networks all my life and easily believe that's what is running things, but on steroids and at a grand scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that they obviously have no consciences and no limits as to what they might do.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end,  I'm as safe as anyone else is. I just have a clue as to what to expect where they don't. They'll be freaked the fuck out while I  will be able to keep a more level head.

       Have you ever listened to George Carlin? I often found myself hating the world around me for the incessant lies we are told, the unquenchable thirst of greed and the like that keep our horrible world spinning. I would get so angry and filled with hatred that I couldn't even stand to live in such a corrupt world. Until I listened to Carlin.
      </p>
      <p>
       George Carlin was renowned for his constant criticism of the world around us and how we as humans have managed to really fuck it all up. When asked how he kept sane, and how he was able to watch it all unfold without constantly being filled with anger and rage, Carlin explained how he had stopped taking an "emotional take" in all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he meant, and I wholeheartedly agree, is that if you want to remain sane, you simply cannot have an emotional investment in all of this. It's better to just sit back and watch the show. Or, the "freak show" as he commonly called it. By removing any emotion from the grand scheme of things, and by looking at the world around us simply like you're watching a show, it makes it a lot easier.

       Willful separation of knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know things aren't exactly great and I don't close my eyes or ears to that but at the same time I remember to enjoy the things I have while I'm living here on this planet. My friends, food, reading, just quietly sitting outside looking at the sky from my porch (
       <em>
        sometimes for hours
       </em>
       ), learning, meeting new people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could make a longer list of the things I love more about being alive than the things I find disturbing or that I hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is to remember to remember those things because while I'm out there trying to be positive all the bad things are waiting outside the door doing push-up's hitting the gym and waiting to bring me down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in short... for me it's all about maintaining perspective of what I can and can't control and accepting that.

       You choose not to be depressed. You can create happiness, calm and peace from within. They are all internal traits, irrespective of what is happening outside. It's hard at times, but don't let it disturb your inner world and inner state of mind. Socialize, be good to people, enjoy the little things in life. Good luck!

       And with a good reason. Jade Helm the equivalent to the ATO in Ukraine. With the difference that in the U.S. it is an anticipatory thing, while in the eastern parts of Ukraine it is a full throttle genocide. Though understand me not wrong. In case some armed formations would do anything in the U.S. that the rebels in Donbass did, then it would take the same guise as in Ukraine - an oppressive operation against the people.

       The NWO are the real, guys behind the curtain. Not those said to be in here. We do not know their names and even if we do know their names, we think of them as not important of mentioning - this is how good at social management they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO, as we know it today to be called could be really named as the Global Predictor. Predictor because they work on the principle of Predictor-Corrector. They have developed mechanisms and methods of predicting the future movement of an object and therefore they have become really good(the best i could say) in the social management through predicting society behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Global Predictor comes from the ancient times of Egypt. There, they were the Hierophants - the priesthood. And they were the actual rulers of Egypt, not the Pharaohs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a line state - Nile and on both side of it the settlements, it was hard when the population grew bigger in numbers, to provide for every1 the necessary. So Egypt when onto wars with other state in the region and in most of the times lost. This has made the priesthood think of an another way to win the surrounding opponents. They came up with ways that could be classified in
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EFTd0KZ.jpg">
        this chart
       </a>
       - the so called ''civilized partnership'' - the way of conquering the enemy without him realizing it(depicted on chart). In order though to make these methods(of cold war/civilized partnership style) they had to have respectively an army. This army was to become a tribe of Semites - the Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       The jewish project, which lasted 42 years, aimed to form a man, who sees no difference between good and evil and blindly follows a predirected plan. Jews spread across the world to fulfill this plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a conspiracy. This is an outcome of historical events research - leading to this conclusion.
