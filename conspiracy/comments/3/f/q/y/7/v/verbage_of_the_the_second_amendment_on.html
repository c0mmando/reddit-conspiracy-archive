    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;well regulated militia&quot; was the state militia. It was not a private army that served however the citizens wanted it to. It was under the authority of the governor of the state and ultimately under the President. One of the major reasons that the second amendment exists was because of the fear of a national army during peace time. The states were concerned that if Congress funded a standing federal army there would be no need for state militias to protect the states and that Congress would eventually disarm the state militias in order to make the individual states rely on the federal government for protection. Most of the states sent in drafts for consideration of what became the second amendment. Only two states, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts (I think, or maybe it was Vermont) included language in their drafts that mentioned anything about right to own guns for self defense, hunting, etc. All the other states wrote a clause that would have ensured that conscientious objectors wouldn&#39;t be forced to serve in the state militia. When Madison actually wrote the second amendment he ignored all of this and intentionally left out any mention of self defense in the amendment. Madison was a federalist. It is ridiculous to believe that he wanted the citizens to have a legal right to attack their government. Rebellion and insurrection were threatening to tear the country apart in the first Washington administration. George Washington himself had to ride out to personally stop one of the rebellions. They were well aware of the threat when they were drafting the Constitution.</p>

<p>On the contrary - they CAN take them away - through trickery, coercion, intimidation, or if necessary, by FORCE.</p>

<p>And that is what makes the Second Amendment / RKBA so important to the preservation of a &quot;free&quot; society: It is the ONLY amendment that has TEETH - giving the People the ultimate power of VETO over unjust laws put in place by a tyrannical government that no longer seeks to serve the interests of the governed.</p>

<p>The jesus myth occurs at least 14 times in recorded history prior to the one you reference. Research &quot;cult of Mithras&quot;.

<p>Wrong.  Jefferson wrote that people are &quot;endowed by their Creator.&quot;  Jefferson was a Deist who rewrote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible">New Testament</a> to <em>remove</em> every single mention of Jesus performing miracles, because Jefferson believed that Jesus was no more than a human being.  </p>

<p>Jefferson rejected that Jesus was the Messiah.  He rejected that Jesus was the Son of God.  He rejected that Jesus was immortal or capable of performing miracles.</p>

<p>So when Jefferson uses the word &quot;Creator,&quot; do you think that he is referencing the Christian &quot;God&quot;?  Why then are you using that term? </p>

The rights do not come from man. They do not come from society. They come from nature, the wind. Right and wrong. It is really that simple. The government is simply a monopoly on violence used to secure the property rights of the exploitation class. When a person accepts that their rights come from the government they actually are putting faith in that government. People give up their natural rights when they accept civil rights. Or slave rights. Faith is the opposite of knowledge. Know thyself and stand for truth. The government gets its rights from the people. We grant it its power. It does not give the people anything. The people give the government its legitimacy. The mentality you have concerning the rights of man is seriously disturbing. Read Thomas Paine not Marx.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No they aren&#39;t. The government wasn&#39;t formed until almost 15 years after that. We went through an entire failed government of a confederacy before we got to the government we have now. You can&#39;t take the language of the declaration and apply it to the US Constitution as if it was all the same idea. Completely different peoples with different ideas as to how a government should act wrote those things. Jefferson was very much opposed to the Constitution. He didn&#39;t even acknowledge that it was an actual constitution because it was never actually signed into being, but only &#39;witnessed.&#39; Jefferson referred to it as a compact many times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of his disciples sliced off an ear of one of the people that came to arrest him. Maybe he was just trying to avoid unnecessary violence, but maybe he was saying that anyone who commits acts of violence deserves to have that violence brought on them. Most likely, though, the guy was a complete fabrication and nobody named Yeshua ben Yosef ever existed, or at least never said those words in that garden.</p>
