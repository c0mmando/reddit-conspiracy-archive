If instead those funds were released back to taxpayers, that money would have still made it to banks in the form off people paying of debts.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree completely.  They were able to steal peoples houses by making money too easy to get.

    <div class="md"><p>Money can not be the root of all evil, due to the point @Rockran mentioned.  We need to look deeper, something which money stands for.  Something that money helps one obtain.  After all, money is nothing if a large community doesn&#39;t value it&#39;s sum.</p>

<p>What comes to mind as the root of all evil is Power.  Power over others and power over natural resources; Power over the community.  Power opens up a greater ability to ensure your genes, and your children&#39;s genes, success.  So I&#39;d say <strong>given the personal belief (whether true or false isn&#39;t the point here) there is either a local, global or universal limit on resources, sex and the opposite gender, land, food, amongst others can all be considered roots of evil.</strong></p>

<p>Note that the most interesting point I&#39;d like to emphasize is Power over Community.  No wonder why there are certain invisible forces that seek a united New World Order.  This plays well with the theory that evil will seek to unify the hierarchy of as many people as possible.  In my opinion Anarchy is the opposite, which is why it is smeared &amp; slandered by those in power, and wish to maintain their power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is basically my conclusion as well. When you boil it all down the simplest way to describe our current world paradigm is;</p>

<p>&#39;It&#39;s all about control&#39;</p>

<p>Control and power are the same thing. You could make an argument that the &#39;love of wealth&#39; led to the &#39;lust for power&#39; but one does not accumulate extreme wealth without a tremendous amount of control over many other peoples. It appears at some point that people then become addicted to the control/power and they are consumed with gaining more power. Eventually money just becomes a means to and end, more wealth = more power. These extreme wealthy then use other people&#39;s &#39;love of wealth&#39; to control them, which is basically how the World&#39;s Central Banks control the world today.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve speculated that the &#39;love of wealth&#39; is simply a perversion of the basic innate survival instinct; that people &#39;stored&#39; food for lean times. So therefor the more wealth the more one was prepared for famine, drought, natural disaster.</p>

<p>With that being said I will agree that humankind will forever remain in bondage as long as &#39;love of wealth&#39; dominates the mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent thoughts.  Money as a universal storage can be said to be the best ... and worst characteristic.  To be fair, I really am not sure if the perversion you noted by those in power outweighs the value of increased collaboration and production within societies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your thoughts are most excellent as well. As for does the perversion outweigh the benefits... It&#39;s a fascinating paradox. Imo the current world we live in (the dominant control structure) is based on 3 foundations; Control, Deception, Greed. And yet there are many awesome and beautiful things created from this, many of which benefit humankind. I don&#39;t believe any technology is inherently good or evil, but we know that inevitably any new tech gets used for both. Another paradox is how many technological advances have been driven by war or the military. Like for instance... the Internet. One other point that I rarely see mentioned is how destructive the process of creating these new technologies is; how many resources required, how much energy is needed, and how much waste is produced... much of it toxic.</p>

<p>We know of many cultures around the world and throughout history who have not fallen into this trap of &#39;selfishness&#39;. But unfortunately the current ruling control system(s) seems hell bent on destruction. Could humankind&#39;s survival instinct to store become our downfall? Maybe, when storing turns into hoarding, when the few hoard so much there is nothing left for the many. Funny I&#39;ve never thought of TPTB in terms of being &#39;hoarders&#39;, but that&#39;s exactly what they are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://capitalismmagazine.com/2002/08/franciscos-money-speech/">“So you think that money is the root of all evil?” said Francisco d’Anconia. “Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow capitalist magazine.  what a great source.  And to answer his question, my answer is YES.  Because the points he makes are false.  </p>

<p>Slave owners for one example make money off the hard work and backs of others.  If that isn&#39;t mooching I don&#39;t know what is.  And yet those slave owners have masses of money.  Some of the biggest moochers of all time,who claim the product of the slaves labor by tears for themselves.  So yes, I do consider that evil.</p>

<p>Think Scrooge McDuck. He had all that money and he just kept that shit in a vault and swam in it all day.</p>

<p>Point is the weathly stash their cash in a vault. People like you and I spend money, therefore stimulating das economy. And then...happy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you exempt Ebenezer Scrooge/A Christmas Carol, which Disney did make a version with Mr. McDuck in it, Scrooge was a rather affable fellow, though. He cared about his family. He wasn&#39;t out to ruin people&#39;s lives or rule over them. He believed in hard work which is what got him where he was.</p>

<p>Sure, he&#39;d swim in the vault, but he went on adventures and did other things, too.</p>

<p>Sure the comics don&#39;t touch on the economic consequences of someone making <em>that much</em> money but not spending it, but the preference to not waste money on things you don&#39;t need isn&#39;t evil, and there might be options to fix the problems unidirectional cash flow causes without him giving his money away.</p>

<p>Honestly I think money itself is broken if you <em>have</em> to spend what you&#39;ve earned in order for other people to eat.</p>

<p>Imagine if upvotes were currency, and if you got upvoted a lot no one else could be upvoted until you gave those upvotes you accumulated away.</p>

<p>I wonder what alternatives we could come up with besides cash?</p>
