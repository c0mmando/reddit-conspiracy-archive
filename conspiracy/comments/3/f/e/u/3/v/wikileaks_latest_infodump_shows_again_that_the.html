        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150731/09240231811/wikileaks-latest-info-dump-shows-again-that-nsa-indeed-engages-economic-espionage-against-allies.shtml">Source</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With all the revelations that have come out about the NSA and our foreign and domestic spy programs, it can, at times, become difficult to parse out exactly what we&#39;re supposed to be getting pissed off about and what is the exact kind of spy-work we ought to expect the alphabet agencies to conduct. Some of the groups that are involved in getting these revelations out there don&#39;t make it much easier, of course. </p>

<p>Take as an example the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/nsa-japan/">latest Wikileaks info-dump</a>, which chiefly concerns the NSA&#39;s spy program against our ally Japan. From the press release accompanying the documents:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Today, Friday 31 July 2015, 9am CEST, WikiLeaks publishes &quot;Target Tokyo&quot;, 35 Top Secret NSA targets in Japan including the Japanese cabinet and Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi, together with intercepts relating to US-Japan relations, trade negotiations and sensitive climate change strategy. The list indicates that NSA spying on Japanese conglomerates, government officials, ministries and senior advisers extends back at least as far as the first administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which lasted from September 2006 until September 2007. The telephone interception target list includes the switchboard for the Japanese Cabinet Office; the executive secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga; a line described as &quot;Government VIP Line&quot;; numerous officials within the Japanese Central Bank, including Governor Haruhiko Kuroda; the home phone number of at least one Central Bank official; numerous numbers within the Japanese Finance Ministry; the Japanese Minister for Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa; the Natural Gas Division of Mitsubishi; and the Petroleum Division of Mitsui.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now, what Wikileaks is doing is mashing together the NSA spying on the Japanese government, our ally, with Japanese industry. That&#39;s silly, in my estimation. In fact, much of the hand-wringing that goes on about our spy networks spying on allies seems naive in the extreme, as if to suggest that our closest allies aren&#39;t conducting similar spy programs on our government. </p>

<p>You can insist, if you like, that America should not be spying on her allies, but then I get to insist that you grow up, because that&#39;s exactly the kind of work you want the NSA doing.</p>

<p>But on the economic side, things get a little murkier. The NSA <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-spy-agencies-mounted-231-offensive-cyber-operations-in-2011-documents-show/2013/08/30/d090a6ae-119e-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814_story.html">has insisted for years</a> that the agency does not engage in economic espionage, actions which would put it out of the norm for how we treat our allies. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also been clear for some time that the NSA is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150629/16134031494/nsa-despite-claiming-it-doesnt-engage-economic-espionage-engaged-economic-espionage.shtml">full of crap</a> in this regard. This latest Wikileaks dump fleshes out just how much economic espionage we do against our allies, even very close allies like Japan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;The documents demonstrate intimate knowledge of internal Japanese deliberations on such issues as: agricultural imports and trade disputes; negotiating positions in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization; Japanese technical development plans, climate change policy, nuclear and energy policy and carbon emissions schemes; correspondence with international bodies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA); strategy planning and draft talking points memoranda concerning the management of diplomatic relations with the United States and the European Union; and the content of a confidential Prime Ministerial briefing that took place at Shinzo Abe&#39;s official residence.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s just more egg on the face of government and security officials who have claimed to have kept their hands clean of economic espionage. There&#39;s sure to be more of interest in the documents as they get parsed out, but if nothing else we can be reminded that the NSA is a spy agency and that its officials have been caught lying over and over again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to be clear, these files are from the 2006-2007, during the bush administration not the Obama Administration and although Presidents do need to clear somethings, these are orders carried out under executive rule from old standing presidents. I felt this needed to be said as others might feel the need to jump to conclusions that are incorrect. Because the house has been republican and the president has been democratic there has been ALOT of fighting within both groups on who can control what. </p>

<p>To me, it is currently clear that Snowden and Wikileaks are spies for the republican party, not heroes as suggested, by making old news, new news, they have somehow connected these leaks to the Obama administration or at least tricked a lot of people into believing it was the Obama Administration that started it, which is not the case at all.</p>

<p>The same thing was done to Saddam after 9/11 happened, they somehow linked Saddam to 9/11 even when the news clearly said over and over again, it was Osama Bin Laden who was the mastermind behind the attack. </p>

<p>The new ideas of America are not the old, please remember that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This type of behavior is a ploy, started by conspiracy theorist like Alex Jones to group all politicians together. This detrimental to the America people to believe that their is literally only one side all working together to enslave man kind, as if there would no opposition. What if the only opposition was in fact the same people who people on sub hate the most?</p>

<p>Just saying, lets be a little more open to the ideas that are pushed on us, lets investigate a little hard on why people like snowden decided to work for the goverment in the first place and all of a sudden switch teams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a ploy, alright, but I don&#39;t think Alex Jones is involved. If you haven&#39;t noticed, the wealthy have completely circumvented democracy over the last 20 years. Have yourself a good look: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org">www.opensecrets.org</a>.</p>

<p>Ever notice how the phrase conspiracy gets used when there is an inconvenient truth that needs to be suppressed?</p>
