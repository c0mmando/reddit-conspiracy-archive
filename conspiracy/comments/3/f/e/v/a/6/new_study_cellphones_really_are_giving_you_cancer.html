         meta study

       “For example, using your phone for just 20 minutes a day for five years increased the risk of one type of brain tumor threefold, and using the phone an hour a day for four years upped the risk of some tumors three to five times, study author Igor Yakymenko said.”

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It’s something that has been dubbed a ‘conspiracy theory’ for some time: the notion that pressing your cellphone against your ear could be causing some serious damage. In fact, I remember being called ‘crazy’ about 5 years ago by a medical professional for investing in a pair of headphones in order to go hands-free with my calls.
       </p>
       <p>
        But then again, I’ve also been called ‘crazy’ for going against Monsanto’s Roundup (now
        <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/21/roundup-cancer-who-glyphosate-">
         admittedly linked to cancer

       <p>
        But here’s what this study truly means. Once again, we now find that it is essential to take your health (and knowledge of true health) into your own hands, and take your own measures to decrease your daily exposure to dangerous factors. Whether it’s avoiding additives in the food supply, or limiting your cellphone use and going hands-free.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, studies like this one serve one major purpose: to remind us that we should be using common sense and knowledge to better protect ourselves each day.

       You're arguing the meta study has meaning for those outside of the scientific community. It doesn't. Review articles are summations of study intended for those who study the field. If you studied the field, you would understand why the hypothesis is bullshit. 
You dont.
Instead you want your ignorance to warrant fear about cell phones.
You clearly have a biased agenda, and haven't updated your post to reflect the facts. You fixed a typo, and left a misleading post about oxidative stress. I'm shocked that users tolerate this level of a scientific illiteracy amongst moderators. 
There are legitimate concerns about cell phone use based in science, but you aren't expressing them. Please find an expert, before you further alienate those who can discern scientific literature.
