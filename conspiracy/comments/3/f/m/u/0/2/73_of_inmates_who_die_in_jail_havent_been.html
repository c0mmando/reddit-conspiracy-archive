       Being arrested for a crime isn’t supposed to be the same thing as being convicted, yet many people awaiting trial suffer the ultimate penalty—death—while they’re in custody.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/mljsp0012st.pdf">
        A report
       </a>
       (pdf) by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) shows that 73% of those who die in jail haven’t been convicted of a crime. In addition, 29% of those who die are African-American, more than double their percentage of the U.S. population at large.
      </p>
      <p>
       Studies have shown that black people are more likely to be held while awaiting trial, partly because they are assigned higher bail amounts, by thousands of dollars, than whites are. For that reason, African-Americans are more likely to be stuck in jail awaiting trial even for minor offenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       BJS found that 31.3% of all jail deaths in 2012 were by suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas jailers appear to show a particular indifference towards life. There have been 140 suicides in Texas jails since September 2009, according to the Houston Chronicle. That’s one every two weeks. Inmates with known mental problems, even those who have attempted before to take their own lives, are put into cells with the same means to suicide that they used previously. Not surprisingly, some inmates take full advantage of those second chances at death. But identifying at-risk inmates is the key.
      </p>
      <p>
       “What is issued in the cell is secondary to properly identifying an individual that may have suicidal ideations,” Brandon Wood, director of the Texas Commission on Jail Standards, told the Chronicle. “After reviewing deaths in custody over the last few years, we keep identifying lapses in observation and proper screening.”

       Impossible. Only someone with your massive intellect could deduce something like that. Obviously if they're waiting for a trial, they must be guilty!
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait, except you're supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of all of that, who cares if they're waiting for a trial or even if they are actually guilty? None of that really matters, they don't deserve to die because of it

       Use the statistic of "73% of suicides in Jail haven't been convicted" is as fucking dishonest as you can get.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of those being held in Jails are awaiting trial.  The main purpose of Jail is to house those awaiting to be convicted, or eventually being found not-guilty.  Once they are convicted, and sentenced then they go from Jail to a prison.

       No.

      <p>
       It suggests that only people in Jail are awaiting conviction, and convicted people are passed onto prisons. That use of the "73% of Jail inmates haven't been convicted of a crime" is absolute, and intentional fraud.

       I can break it down into even further if you can't grasp that point yet.

       They haven't been convicted, unless they died the night they were convicted, before they were moved to a prison.... It's not innacurate, they were awaiting their trials. Why would it make anything different? they are still dead.

       That's not at all what it suggests. Most people in jail are awaiting trial so it makes sense that most people that die in jail are also awaiting trial. That was his very simple point. I'm still trying to figure out what yours is.

       But why does that matter? Why even feel the need to remind people that those in jail are awaiting a trial? Its a given...to me it suggests that hes trying to remind readers that they are criminals, somehow lessening the impact of their death.

       You misquoted the article and made a point that is irrelevant to the poorly worded statement. 73% of people who die are unconvicted, many of them would have been found guilty. The inevitability of that conviction has absolutely zero relevance to the issue other than being a statement of facts, the problem lies in the people dying while awaiting conviction. Jail should not be such a dangerous/inhospitable/unpleasant place that people are dying or offing themselves in considerable numbers. You blew up one tiny aspect of a stat that had no relevance to the article. No one was saying those 73% were innocent, just unconvicted. You created a red herring that derailed discussion.

       You said "73 percent of inmates who committed suicide were not convicted" the article says "73 percent of inmates who died were not convicted" of those who died around 30% committed suicide. You also misinterpereted the stat. You went after the "not convicted" aspect, which is not important and if it was they were only saying these (mostly men) had not had their day in court to get a sentence or acquittal.

       Ok.  I did unintentionally switch "died" with "suicide" in the quote.  I thank you for the correction.

      <p>
       It doesn't change my argument.  The is the author of the article that used the "73% DEATHS are not convicted" in his title to intentionally mislead the reader about actual numbers, and the exact cause of the death isn't listed.... either at the hands of other inmates, suicide, or police assault.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only actual stat I read was "140 have committed suicide in jail since 2009."  Which was preceded with "Texas Jailers are Indifferent"

       The article says "73% of those who die in jail have not been convicted" meaning 73% of
The deaths in county jails are people who have not had their day in court yet. That's appalling, that means you can be accused and indicted on criminal charges and die before you are able to see a judge, jury and verdict

       Or the fact that most jailhouse suicides are committed by intoxicated/drugged up individuals who aren't thinking clearly.

      <p>
       INb4: "it's their job to make sure they don't die!" Yeah, true. But COs aren't robocops. There are up to 1500 inmates in the larger county jails. Can a limited staff keep eyes on them 24/7? As long as the officers are doing their rounds, they can't be faulted for a drunk asshole hanging himself.
