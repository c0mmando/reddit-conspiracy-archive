<blockquote>
<p>Boy or girl. Public school or private school. If the Rhode Island child is middle-school age, it is now mandatory to receive a Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. </p>

<p>The jab would most likely be a Gardasil shot, made by Merck - studied for less than two years in about 1,200 children under age 16 before it became licensed and fast-tracked by the FDA. Coincidentally, this vaccine is currently under investigation by the European Medicines Agency (but apparently it is turning out to be <a href="http://sanevax.org/hpv-vaccine-investigation-leaves-crucial-questions-unasked/">a weak one</a>).</p>

<p>This proves once and for all how the side-effects of multi-trillion dollar pharma companies with bottomless salaries toward propagandists, plus bloated lawmakers and government agencies - is actually a dangerous form of insanity. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/search/label/vaccine-information">Forced injections</a> of chemical cocktails that have proven to be deadly in teenagers might have been recognized as child endangerment in the past. Now it&#39;s just par for the course since the passing of California&#39;s SB 277 which mandated vaccines for all students.</p>

<p>Rhode Island is just following suit - which is precisely why parents tried to stop SB 277. If some vaccines are mandated, what if all of them get thrown into the mix, including a couple hundred in the pipeline, and parents lose all control to decide when or if their child is jabbed?</p>

<p>As naturopath <a href="http://www.healthnutnews.com/mandated-vaccines-finding-our-path-to-freedom/">Rosanne Lindsay</a> recently wrote:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;In June, California became the first state to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/06/30/california-vaccination-bill-sb-277-signed-by-governor-becomes-law/">mandate vaccination</a> for all children attending public and private schools. Similar mandates will apply to all <a href="http://www.sb277.org/ca-sb-792-forced-adult-vaccines.html">adults working in daycare settings</a>. There are currently <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/fighting-forced-vaccination-in-america-in-2014-58-bills-in-24-states-threatening-right-to-refuse-vaccines/">58 bills in 24 different states</a> that would limit your rights when it comes to vaccines, or lose your job. A proposed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2232/text">Federal law</a> will attempt to jab the entire nation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Associated Press <a href="http://www.turnto10.com/story/29664097/rhode-island-mandates-hpv-vaccine-for-seventh-graders">has reported</a> that starting this coming school year, middle school students must receive the jab unless they have medical or religious exemptions (both are difficult to obtain):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Tricia Washburn, chief of the office of immunization for the Rhode Island Department of Health, said the Centers for Disease Control found no safety concerns with the vaccine. &quot;The bottom line is that HPV is the most sexually transmitted disease in the U.S.&quot; she said. &quot;We are interested in protecting the public health. We feel it shouldn&#39;t be treated any differently than any of the other vaccines recommended by the CDC.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually, this vaccine in particular should be treated differently than other vaccines. By different, I mean extra banned - or for a person to have the secured freedom to opt-out. It has been shown to be deadly, injurious, and unnecessary given how the immune system can overcome warts. (<a href="http://www.nvic.org/Vaccines-and-Diseases/hpv.aspx">Quick facts</a> about HPV) </p>

<p>By the <a href="http://www.nvic.org/NVIC-Vaccine-News/July-2009/Preventing-Gardasil-Vaccine-Injuries-Deaths.aspx">summer of 2009</a>, this fast-tracked vaccine already caused more than 15,000 thousand reports of vaccine reactions, including more than 3,000 injuries and 48 deaths.</p>

<p>Rhode Island incorporates all CDC-recommended vaccines into the state&#39;s school immunization regulations because their Department of Health directly creates such laws/mandates. Virginia and Washington, D.C. have likewise joined in mandating the HPV shot.</p>

<p>Parents keep saying that if they knew that the HPV vaccine prevented cancer, of course they would do that for their child. Do they not know that HPV can be fought off with the human immune system? Do they not wonder at mandating this vaccine for boys? Do they not mind at losing the option of at least postponing the jab until their children reach their late teens?</p>

<p>A petition to repeal the regulation can be found through a Facebook group called Rhode Islanders Against Mandated HPV Vaccinations. Rhode Island will have a hearing in August to answer concerns.</p>

<p>So much more can be said about the dangers of the HPV vaccine. <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2015/04/hpv-vaccines-danish-documentary.html">At least one documentary is devoted</a> to shining light on the damage this abominable jab has done to ravage young women&#39;s lives and rob them of bright futures. </p>

<p>Not to mention, it was just reported on mainstream news this past Spring, that <a href="http://www.naturalblaze.com/2015/04/cbs-gardasil-vaccine-can-cause.html">Gardasil vaccine can cause infection with higher risk HPV strain</a>. Isn&#39;t that akin to giving someone cancer? It is ridiculous how homeopathy and herbals are cast in a crazy light when they have safely and effectively brought remission to various types of wart manifestations.</p>

<p>But if that sounds like a pipe dream, consider this: a study using <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mushroom-extract-cures-hpv-infections-110614">human test subjects</a> found that ACHH (mushroom compound) fully eradicated HPV from some of the women who took the supplement for six months, due to its immune-boosting action supported by around <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-10/jai-hii102914.php">20 human trials</a>. </p>

<p>One article in March claimed that the disease didn&#39;t even show up in a blood test after that time for some of the participants. That&#39;s incredible given the dormant nature of viral warts.</p>

<p>From a monetary standpoint, the average $50 per bottle beats out the average $116 per HPV shot (3 shots are required) and any resulting side-effects which can include seizures, brain inflammation, POTS, autoimmune conditions like lupus and more.</p>

<p>That few hundred dollars would be much better spent on such a safe, effective option should teenagers find themselves in that situation. Either way, parents would probably prefer having that information and having those options open - instead of draconian measures that expose their child to high risk in order to benefit corporations that do not strive to provide safe products.</p>

<p>Mandates such as Rhode Island&#39;s only further take away any incentive to bother with safety. There will be no accountability afterward. Parents who outsourced their responsibilities, however, will feel that accountability acutely should they find that their children&#39;s health deteriorated after the gates are closed. This blatant removal of civil liberties cannot be acceptable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I happen to believe that most vaccines should be mandatory.  Mostly because there are a lot of children who legitimately cannot have vaccines yet for various reasons.  It&#39;s unfair to others who need us to be protected on their behalf.  That being said... Schools still argue over sex ed and what to teach and nurses get fired for giving out condoms to sexually active kids.  I think we should teach our kids to be safe instead of assuming they&#39;ll get HPV. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree here. Vaccination works on the heard mentality where is the 99% can get the vaccine do get it, the ones that can&#39;t get it for medical reasons will be protected as well. HOWEVER, the HPV vaccination shouldn&#39;t be mandatory as the only way to get it is though unprotected sex (all sex, yes oral counts) And like you say almost all schools fight over sex ed and, unfortunately, teach abstinence only &quot;sex&quot; ed. </p>

<p>Before mandating a vaccine for a virus that is only transmitted through sex, IMO, Real sex ed should be taught which includes teaching kids how to use a condom correctly and show how effective they are with real SCIENTIFIC FACTS instead of the made up &quot;facts&quot; used by abstinence only people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol.  Not just talking about HPV guys.  I&#39;m for all vaccinations.  No one wants any diseases coming back.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that although smallpox and various other diseases are pretty much eradicated in the western world, the rest of the planet still has a lot of nasty diseases.  All it takes is an infected carrier coming through customs and coming into contact with an unvaccinated person.  Sounds like a movie.  Scary, right?</p>

<p>And no, my infant won&#39;t be catching HPV.  But you know as well as I do that a lot of middle school age children do begin experimenting with sex.  Whether we want that to happen or not.  </p>

<p>So yes, I believe vaccines should be mandatory in schools.</p>

<p>The HPV vaccine is included in &quot;all vaccinations&quot;.  So I ask again, since you&#39;re &quot;for all vaccinations&quot; (and thus are <em>for</em> the HPV vaccine as well), how do you imagine your infant/small child would catch HPV?  Why is that vaccine necessary for an infant?  Please explain in as much detail as you can.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But you know as well as I do that a lot of middle school age children do begin experimenting with sex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We aren&#39;t talking about middle school age children, the HPV vaccine is given to kids younger than 1 year old.  By the time they reach middle school ten or more years later, this vaccine will have worn off in almost all cases (this is also true of nearly every other vaccine - they lose effectiveness within 10 years).</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure you would rather a profit driven corporate body who affords 3 lobbyists to every congressman influencing health care policy. I&#39;m sure there are no conflicts of interest there, eh?</p>

<p>I am not arguing against vaccines, I am arguing against bad science - as someone who&#39;s extensively studied the topic, I can confidently say that the HPV vaccine doesn&#39;t have a leg to stand on. The risks outweigh the benefits and there are no longterm studies done on the cumulative health effects of these vaccines - honestly, there aren&#39;t even well defined short-term effect studies done as Merck petitioned this vaccine for fast-track with the FDA.</p>

<p>I would love to hear a defence on this topic rather than an attempt to attack or discredit. Please, enlighten me if you will. If you truly believe in the medicine behind it, you must have some reason - and either your argument is strong enough that you should have no reason to fear subjecting it to scrutiny and rebuttal, or you acknowledge on some level that you are deferring your understanding to supposed experts with vested interests and would rather not have your illusion of reality shattered by someone who gives enough of a shit about the topic to have the research to back up their claims - and maybe change your understanding.</p>

<p>There is no Anti-vax/pro-vax agenda, don&#39;t let media propaganda blind you to the reality of the debate. There is only safe or unsafe. I am not debating vaccines with you, I am in this instance questioning the validity of the science behind the HPV vaccine. Knowing how that science works, allows me to do this unbiasedly. Maybe you should educate yourself on the matter.</p>
