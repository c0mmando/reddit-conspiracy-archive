        The European Parliament then mandated extensive action against mass surveillance. Their recommendations were passed in full on September 5, 2001. Six days later, the Twin Towers came down. Any plans for limiting mass surveillance were buried with the victims of 9/11, and never formally published.

       Doesn't saying 'no big deal we already knew about that' just diffuse the outrage? I mean I know we want to feel smart and knowledgeable but  shouldn't we be screaming these things from the roof tops? Isn't it our job too remind people who've forgotten or inform people who never knew? How does sweeping
 them under the rug of 'omg I already knew this' help anyone?

       The most disturbing in all this is their relentlessness in attacking and making life impossible for people trying to uncover their vomit inducing projects and doings.

       ECHELON is sadly not news, though I picked up a few interesting things, such as the European Union report of September 5th 2001 putting restriction on mass surveillance, which annoyed the NSA greatly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to put my tinfoil hat on, one as to wonder if the resistance of Europe -that they apparently consider 'pigs'- against US/UK hegemony is not the cause of it's current economical downfall. After all the US as proven that economical warfare is the best to take down dissident nations a peg or two. And also since all that economical turmoil started mass surveillance as accelerated in many European countries, as well as the Americanization of Europe in politics, finance (I find it very evident in countries such as France), and reshaping of public sector (privatization).

       You know, I watched Pain &amp; Gain last night and we need some do-ers right now. A few hundred million of them. Our ancestors made changes when they were tired of oppression. It's almost impossible to mobilize people and make change when everyone is complacent and apathetic. OWS had the right idea but it needs to be bigger, longer and everywhere. We have the people, we have the resources but we do not have the will. I believe nature and necessity will force our hand or our children's hand but it will be too late by then. Obama is right, we need to do something to save the planet and ourselves right now.

       You can see the radar domes from the google map street view. Search menwith hill, Yorkshire Norte, United Kingdom.  I like looking at stuff like this, imagining all the workers who take part. That's the part I find hard to believe about most conspiracies. That so many people can keep their mouths shut.

        These things were surprising because for several decades people who accused the government of these things were insulted and dismissed as "conspiracy theorists". They were told to "put their tinfoil hats back on".

        The majority of people didn't believe this would even be possible. People kept supporting the US government and said that it is the government standing for freedom and democracy and only does things to protect the American people and its allies. They believed the whole world will be better off if everyone just trusts the US, the only country worthy of such trust. Generations of people - both in American but also overseas - have been brainwashed for generations to believe these things and to dismiss criticism of the US.

        Countless of people are surprised by this. But the saddest part is: Most people don't even know of these things. Because there is an effort by US-controlled media to drown these things in a sea of irrelevance. The only reason Americans even hear about these things in a small way is because they need to be kept delusional about how free their press is.
