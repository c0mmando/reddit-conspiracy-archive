       The video is a stepping stone for me, and hopefully it will be for someone else out there too.

       I have heard that the battle we are in, is a spiritual one, but I really never understood what that meant before now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Deagle is good with words; short and straight forward. It is just the way I like it. It might not be for others, but what the heck - Information must be shared non the less.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't go into more details right now, but I will keep an eye on, and participate in the comments.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       EDIT: The video is the first of 3, called "Prognosis for Planet Earth. I found the original video in the archives of Project Camelot
       <a href="http://projectcamelotportal.com/component/k2/item/2689-bill-deagle-prognosis-for-planet-earth">
        here

       EDIT 2: I have been chasing a white rabbit. I think you know him. In my search, I have also been chasing
       <em>
        myself
       </em>
       . But that was only revealed through the chase itself. Ultimate search later became that of origins. Spirituality have appealed to me before, but found no recipe quickly enough to ground myself before mr. Rabbit had something new to urgently show me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Main focus for me, was to share the spiritual side of the video. The rest was a bonus. I hope you have a pleasant day. I have to sleep now.

       I have been stumbling around in the labyrinth in the dark for a long time, but already half way through the first video, it resonated to the point of my having to share the information with others. I am still a "work in progress" mind you, but I feel I am on the right path at last. I'll share more as I move along.

        I know exactly what you mean. But so many people point towards it, and it takes a lot for me to accuse another human being of lying. Dr. Deagle's information in general fills the gaps of the mysteries very extensively, almost to the point of being unbelievable, because it seems too good to be true. And his calmness can easily be picked up as cocky too. But his information feels right you know. Intuitively. So I'll go with that for now. (I'm still not finished with the first video).

       Well, my good man, you better get VERY used to it, because in this line of inquiry and investigation, you will surely come across

       Well, just keep investigating then.  Reference and cross reference the information you come across.  See what others say about him, and also simply go with your gut as well.  If the info sounds valid, then simply give it a tentative affirmation - but only a
       <em>
        tentative
       </em>
       one, because you may later uncover information that may turn previous data on its head.  A true critical thinker must be willing to discard with previously held perspectives regardless of how valid they may have seemed if they ultimately prove themselves to be incorrect.  Such are the treacherous and tempestuous waters we swim in when looking for the truth about things TPTB (the powers that be) work diligently to keep hidden.

       What do you mean that your critical thinking attitude toward ETs has “mellowed”?  It would seem that our perspectives and senses should remain sharp as a tack - especially in these areas - for there is certainly chicanery around every corner, and it is oftentimes difficult to tell what is true from what is false.

       This is the reason why I often make sure and quote/copy and paste those statements I’m responding to.  More than once has it been that I response at length to someone, then go to post it, and find that the individual has deleted their comment!  It can be frustrating at times.  :)

       Well, realize that “occult” just means “hidden”, so a
       <em>
        lot

       of things can fall under the heading of “occult” - some things jargon-filled, some
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       so jargon-filled.  Things can indeed get pretty heady and complicated, but I often think about

       Realize that there is nothing through the use of any external or artificial method that cannot be dually accomplished and far surpassed through self discipline, and the use of a focused, determined, steady mind.  External artifices often dig one further into the hole of detriment because not only is one using a crutch in an attempt to accomplish a state that can and should be obtained without it, but A) the use of the crutch makes one’s ability and resolve weaker in the process, and B) the very state itself that is accomplished through the use of the crutch is ultimately self-defeating since it hinders the very tool that one needs in order to see clearly in the first place:  A focused, stable, sober mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that hinders your ability to think clearly and pointedly is ultimately detrimental.

       I think our exchanging like this and in this manner can be looked upon as something more than just “ping-pong”.  I like to look at it as the sharing and exchanging of ideas and information - the learning and teaching of things where it regards what at times are some very interesting and enriching concepts that can help us become better critical thinkers, and better beings in general.

       DMT: Elevation of consciousness is goal. No crutch. An aid. I am taking it slow. Being born in a very strict country, where governance of own consciousness has become a taboo has taken it's toll. DMT will "snap" me out of it, back into who I want to be. I have experiences with psychedelics, and have only positive things to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attitude towards ET: Only positive. I've come to terms that some might not be benevolent, but that's ok. We live in a duality. So we can't avoid that one. Ultimately; I have never accepted that we are alone anyway. Universe is to big and too old for us to crown ourselves the pinnacle of evolution. Everybody telling me otherwise have later revealed themselves to be too closed-minded for my taste anyway.

       100% on the same wavelength on that one. Information exchange is the most precious tool we can ever get our hands/minds on. The universe is built upon this principle, so better get on board, people!

       I like that one. Thank you. There is a reason I have not yet done it, and that is because my thoughts have been very closely aligned to your statement. But I am also an experimenter. I care more for my experiences to give knowledge to others, than for myself to have "a good time", which is not at all the point. I can reveal a little, but nothing too personal still; trips to the subconscious is a psychologist worst nightmare. -He might lose his job!

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The gravest fear that has rippled through humanity from the technology industry is that, someday, almost all of our jobs will be replaced by robots.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The writer is looking at this dynamic from the perspective of the enslaving fiat currency paradigm that we've been trapped in for so long where we have to work like slaves left and right in order to earn a few fiat currency pennies so we can keep from starving/dying/becoming homeless and/or destitute.  It's a "debt slave" algorithm we get plugged in to growing up, and it's what our entire educational system is geared toward making us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is that a society where all our work is automated and we have robots doing all the mundane tasks for us - leaving human beings actually
       <em>
        free
       </em>
       to pursue what we really WANT to do with our lives - is the very thing that could lead to a utopia where we wouldn't have to work like slaves to get from point A to point B.  The idea that a predominately automated civilization would be the "gravest fear" of humanity is actually patently absurd.  It could be the very
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of what he asserts.

       I hear that. The gates of heaven are always open there will be people coming and going and coming back. One day every knee will bow and tongue confess. No one will be in "hell" that doesn't want to be there

       Yep, there is no hell infact. Fire is symbolic of the holy spirit converting a person.

        But the fearful, and unbelieving, and to abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. (Revelation 21:8)

       <p>
        Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, Nor theives, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11)

      <p>
       I understand the Holy Spirit being represented by fire but I'm not sure the 'lake of fire' is the same thing.  There seem to be quite a few places that the Bible is adamant the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom, that they'll be judged, and will suffer.  I can understand how '1 Cor 6:9-11' and 'Rev 21:8' can be interpreted as temperary suffering as they are baptized by fire, but 'Rev 14:11' and 'Rev 20:10' seem to imply eternal suffering for Satan and those who take the mark.

       Hey,  I think we are all in similar boats.  Trying to figure it all out.   One thing is certain, be careful how far down the rabbit hole you go.  This guy is pretty righteous.  His name is Marcus.  But after I went through the video series he does, a lot of shit starts making sense.

       Here is an intro to where you will want to start.  You can find the other videos on YouTube if you look for them.  Let me know what you think.

       Too late my friend ;o) I've been without guidance, and have dipped into every hole I could find since -99. It was the only way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've been writing out several notebooks and diaries, to try and preserve the sanity along the way, and I have saved over 300 GB (150 000 items) of material I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       can convince others too. (and in case the internet just disappears one day).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to worry. My search ended with the video I posted today. Holy fuck. 16 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you so much for the video. -Great piece(!) to introduce my family into the new paradigm with. -They are badly conditioned still. This will make the transition much easier for them.

       The subject matter is interesting, but I dont like that this guy Bill Degal is using a lot of buss words like he doesn't know what he is talking about. For instance: a computer model is not cybernetic. Cybernetic is a reference to the electro-mecanical aspects of interfacing with the body.
