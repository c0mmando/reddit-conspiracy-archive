    <div class="md"><p>Lots of historians and officials alike support the strong argument that the war was already over and dropping the Atomic bomb was completely unnecessary to defeat Japan, but was instead deployed as a method to show Russia the true firepower of the U.S. and effectively jumpstart the Cold War.</p>

<p><strong>Eisenhower</strong> stated: </p>

<p>In [July] 1945… Secretary of War Stimson, visiting my headquarters in Germany, informed me that our government was preparing to drop an atomic bomb on Japan. I was one of those who felt that there were a number of cogent reasons to question the wisdom of such an act. </p>

<p>During his recitation of the relevant facts, <strong>I had been conscious of a feeling of depression and so I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of ‘face’.</strong> The Secretary was deeply perturbed by my attitude….</p>

<p><strong>Admiral William Leahy</strong>, the highest ranking member of the U.S. military from 1942 until retiring in 1949, and who was at the center of all major American military decisions in World War II – wrote:</p>

<p><strong>It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>The Real Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>In the years since the two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, a number of historians have suggested that the weapons had a two-pronged objective …. It has been suggested that the second objective was to demonstrate the new weapon of mass destruction to the Soviet Union. By August 1945, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States had deteriorated badly. The Potsdam Conference between U.S. President Harry S. Truman, Russian leader Joseph Stalin, and Winston Churchill (before being replaced by Clement Attlee) ended just four days before the bombing of Hiroshima. The meeting was marked by recriminations and suspicion between the Americans and Soviets. Russian armies were occupying most of Eastern Europe. <strong>Truman and many of his advisers hoped that the U.S. atomic monopoly might offer diplomatic leverage with the Soviets. In this fashion, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan can be seen as the first shot of the Cold War.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what really brought the Emperor to his knees was the end of the Sino-Soviet nonaggression pact. The Japanese were ready for a full scale American attack from the east, and with Tokyo-Osaka firebombing raids having brought <em>more</em> deaths than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, they were ready to fight til death. </p>

<p>But when the Soviets attacked a few days <em>before</em> the official ending of the agreement, they feared the same fate as Nazi Germany, territorial partition, humiliation, and of course execution of the emperor, they decoded to surrender to the Americans, under the excuse of the bomb. Such story came to be written in textbooks, and becoming <em>fact</em>. </p>

<p>Also the second bombing was for further &quot;scientific research&quot;, due to its better location. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eisenhower also stopped the allied troops on the western outskirts of Germany effectively allowing the Russians to enter alone turning a blind eye to the rape of Berlin. Over 2 million women raped and around 4 million dead and tortured civilians.</p>

<p>edit- thinking back, this alone is much worse than both 9/11 and Hiroshima/Nagasaki combined. The Rape of Berlin is the most offensive occurance in human history and hopefully it is properly avenged one day.</p>

<p>Ironic, considering that&#39;s what the japs did to everyone else. They invaded entire cities and towns and made all the men, women and children line up, and have &quot;killing competitions&quot;  and see how many they could kill with swords before they got tired. Oh and not to mention they raped women and shoved swords up their vaginas. Japs murdered 18 million civilians, kid. </p>

<p>A couple hundred people that died from the atom bomb was a fraction of 18 million civilians. </p>

<p>Too bad the US only made 2 bombs, we should have wiped out the entire barbaric country. </p>

<p>The <strong>Japanese military and government</strong> did, like I said.  There is a big distinction between the military/government and the civilian population.  This should be obvious.</p>

<p>Do you live in the US?  Would you like it if a bomb was dropped on your head, killing you and everyone you know and love?  I mean, the US is waging illegal wars all over the world - so they&#39;d be totally justified in dropping a bomb on <em>you</em>, right?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yikes.</p>

<p>I think the US is a barbaric country and that you and your family should be killed as retribution.  Oh, we also need to kill all of the children and babies that live in your city also, because they&#39;re obviously to blame for the actions of the military and government.  What say you?</p>

<p>You should look into some of the things Russia did during the war.  Or some of the things the US did during the war.. like, ya know, dropping two nuclear weapons onto two civilian cities that had no military value whatsoever.  Or some of the things the US has done since.</p>

<p>But again, government/military =/ civilians.  Very simple concept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the japanese are far from innocent. they were committing horrendous acts themselves. far worse than anything the US has ever done. they were also given plenty of warning and chance to surrender before the bombs were dropped. however, they would rather die than give up. i do feel bad for the kids and animals though. they really had no choice. the leaders in japan during that time definitely made some really horrible choices.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made it about 15 minutes in before I had to shut it off. </p>

<p><strong>What a load of horseshit.</strong></p>

<p>Imagine you wanted to learn about a scientific process that was as complex as nuclear physics. Who would you ask about that? </p>

<p>Why, a Yoga Instructor, of course. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m a 32 year old American living in Thailand where I teach Yoga and Wing Chun part-time while exposing the New World Order full-time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the narrator. From his youtube page (linked below). Sorry for the ad-hominem, but really.. what else is there to address? The video doesn&#39;t evidence a thing. It purports that TNT was used... but doesn&#39;t offer any witnesses or anything like that to back that up. It purports that the scientist Galen Winsor went about eating plutonium and bathing in reactor water, but here&#39;s the thing: I can&#39;t find <em>thing one</em> about him. You&#39;d think for someone described like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is without question one of the world’s foremost authorities in nuclear radiation measurement.  And he’s recognized by members of the Atomic Energy Commissions of all the major nations of the free world.  Mister Galen Winsor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>..Might be mentioned by IAEA, NRC or at least the Manhattan Project history papers. But he&#39;s nowhere to be found. In fact his only claim to fame appears to be that video he made. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>But okay: He just puffed up his reputation. That&#39;s not surprising. But here&#39;s the smoking gun of Mr Winsor: Winsor <em>knows we built and used nuclear bombs</em>. From less than four minutes into the very video presentation that this Yoga Instructor uses as evidence, he states this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now… In 1945 I was a Navy radio man out in the Pacific on a destroyer, aim’n for Japan.  We had a one way ticket.  That’s all you get: just one way.  So, as we … um, as we’re becoming proficient at our business of fighting war, the Manhattan Project caught up with us, and did a job.  Now, the weapon that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945, was a U-235, fully-enriched U-235, weapon … where the material was seperated and purified in Oak Ridge, TN.  The one that was dropped August 9th, on Nagasaki, was a Plutonium weapon, made at Hanford.  But to those of us out in the Pacific it was quite interesting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Winsor&#39;s word only counts for something when it&#39;s supporting the Yoga Instructor&#39;s ideas, but it&#39;s totally misinformed when it asserts <em>exactly the opposite of the intended message</em>. Interesting.</p>

<p>Edit: More interesting and even more telling! This youtube doc posted consists of the last third being the &quot;full&quot; speech given by Galen Winsor. What you don&#39;t know is that it&#39;s not the <em>full</em> speech: It&#39;s been edited so that the parts quoted above were cut out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejCQrOTE-XA">Here&#39;s the original</a>. I&#39;m now 100% certain the documentary maker is just a liar trying to drum up youtube views. </p>

<hr/>

<p>There&#39;s zero scientific experience behind this. There&#39;s no knowledge of physics at play here. This is on par with flat-earth &#39;theory&#39; in its horrendous lack of scientific context (surprise! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQArDd3ybp7wm37TTmKu9Wg">The filmmaker is also a proponent of that theory too</a>). </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but this just isn&#39;t compelling at all. </p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s a cardboard cutout!&quot; ... &quot;Or the sun!&quot; ... &quot;Or a laboratory composite!&quot; </p>

<p>Actually it&#39;s almost certainly just that he&#39;s never seen/used/heard of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapatronic_camera">Rapatronic Camera</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyways I&#39;m not trying to convince anyone of anything&quot; - really? I mean, seriously?! How could this dude possibly say that with a straight face? Because he&#39;s being intentionally manipulative and deceptive. That&#39;s how. He&#39;s trying to monetize his youtube account.</p>

<p>Speaking of &quot;dripping with smugness&quot;... I guess it takes one to know one.</p>

<p>But beyond that, you&#39;re simply wrong as to the &quot;sole concept&quot; of the website.  You should try reading the arguments presented as opposed to disregarding it entirely based on the way the site looks, you may actually learn something.  It&#39;s pretty obvious that your mind is already made up on the subject though.</p>

<p>And dude - every single time you get in an argument with someone (which is often because you are incredibly condescending and argumentative from what I&#39;ve seen), all of their comments are downvoted.  It is clearly you downvoting them like a petulant child, there&#39;s no need to lie about what&#39;s totally obvious to anyone with two eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the disclaimer but who said anything about you being a shill?  I just think you&#39;re condescending and closed-minded and seem to enjoy getting into arguments with people for some reason.  </p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s cool if that&#39;s your thing but it gets kind of tedious, especially in this case where you&#39;ve been dismissive and talking down to me from minute 1.  And I see you doing this all over the sub to other people too who are trying to discuss something with you or present an argument.  You just come across poorly, I hope you aren&#39;t like this when you talk to people in real life.</p>

<p>I addressed it by agreeing with you that the video was shit and presenting you with an alternative argument complete with its own evidence.  You didn&#39;t even pretend to read any of it and dismissed both the link and me with a wave of your hand (and a downvote).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re totally ignoring my point: The documentary maker, the guy who&#39;s video you posted, has <em>purposefully manipulated his evidence in order to support his claims</em>. Why do you think he left out the parts where Winsor admits the bombs exist? Because he didn&#39;t want to undercut his own message: You&#39;re being <em>manipulated</em>.</p>

<p>Re: The trees. They didn&#39;t avoid it. They are burnt: Nuclear blasts <em>do</em> cause fire. They&#39;re also stripped of <em>all</em> their foliage, dead and barren. They&#39;re still standing because the blast wasn&#39;t big enough to rip their root structures from the ground: Remember, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were relatively small bombs. </p>

<p>And of course you&#39;re aware that root structures can stretch deeper than the tree is tall, and can also spread wider than it is at it&#39;s widest, yes? Roots are strong. That&#39;s why we use that word to convey the idea of strength. Ever been in a car accident involving high speed and a tree? The tree won&#39;t budge. It&#39;ll rip the steel in your car to shreds before the tree moves an inch. Again: Roots are strong.</p>

<p>You can play this &quot;oh then he&#39;s in on it or he&#39;s just gullible&quot; card all you like: You&#39;re projecting. Just admit that not every video you see on Youtube is real. That shouldn&#39;t be <em>that</em> hard to accept.</p>

<p>After doing quite a bit of research on the matter,  I can assure you quite like that.  Heck... the news were heavily censored but initial reports were actually very sceptical of the &quot;nuke&quot;  bombings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here you go:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sULjMjK5lCI">Nuclear Hoax - Nukes Do Not Exist!</a></p>

<p>It took me a long time to consider what this fellow is putting forth. I have read and researched everything on &quot;Nukes&quot; I could find for the past few years, seen a boatload of lectures from physicians and have come to the conclusion ... &quot;Nukes&quot; are just part of the massive propaganda we are being subjected to.</p>

<p>This website compiles a bunch of info on the matter if you are interested: <a href="http://www.big-lies.org/NUKE-LIES/www.nukelies.com/forum/">http://www.big-lies.org/NUKE-LIES/www.nukelies.com/forum/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. I see I hit a patriotic nerve with my comment, but here goes my take.  Germany lost the war, and as such ... the &lt;victors&gt; painted Germany out as being &quot;Evil&quot; and we are all taught how they &quot;killed 6 million Jews&quot; ...</p>

<p>Consider the fact that the 6 million number was <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2013/02/10-newspapers-from-1915-1938-claiming-6-million-jews-long-before-the-holocaust-even-happened-2578152.html">decided upon a long time BEFORE WWII</a>, also ... consider the fact that the number has  <a href="https://socioecohistory.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/jewish-estimate-sees-number-of-holocaust-dead-drop-to-2-8-million/">been revised on numerous occasions</a>, also consider the fact that although the number has been revised, in many western countries just TALKING about the Holocaust™ is illegal.  If one questions the &quot;official&quot; story, they are called out as &quot;Holocaust deniers&quot;.</p>

<p>I can only hint that not many people know  <a href="http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Genocide_against_the_German_people">Germans were also subjected to genocidal crimes</a>, I will not even go into  the bombings and death of millions of German and Japanese <strong><em>civilians</em></strong>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28HhSdn_Nso">See this documentary</a></p>

<p>Also, last but not least, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_HxJTS1n9s&amp;amp;list=PLRNbzK2W6kSuGV4v58hi_VBjb_wcKTIaM">different version of history from what you were taught</a>.</p>

<p>I am not saying everything in the above is the absolute truth, what I am saying is that there is so much propaganda from <strong>both</strong> sides. It is impossible to have a proper version when all you have is one side of the story.  The allied armies spread just as much propaganda as the Germans did,  after all ... propaganda is an important aspect in the art of war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical American counter-argument.  You do not have much to say apart from that patriotic &#39;we are the best - the other side was crazy&#39; bullshit you are all brainwashed into believing.</p>

<p>Here are a few quotes for you, sad sap:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I go back to America, after a few days I am once again filled with this kind of angry alienation and disgust with this thing there that America has got - you have no idea how pervasive it is there. The public relations and propaganda put out by the corporate mono-culture there is so pervasive.</p>

<p>Robert Crumb</p>

<p>The Marine Corps is the Navy&#39;s police force and as long as I am President that is what it will remain. They have a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin&#39;s.</p>

<p>Harry S Truman</p>

<p>Museums are managers of consciousness. They give us an interpretation of history, of how to view the world and locate ourselves in it. They are, if you want to put it in positive terms, great educational institutions. If you want to put it in negative terms, they are propaganda machines.</p>

<p>Hans Haacke</p>

<p>This is the secret of propaganda: To totally saturate the person, whom the propaganda wants to lay hold of, with the ideas of the propaganda, without him even noticing that he is being saturated.</p>

<p>Paul Watzlawick</p>

<p>Propaganda is amazing. People can be led to believe anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the creation of the FED in 1913 the same group who controlled the UK controlled the USA. That power wanted war with Germany for economical reasons.</p>

<p>There are some french diplomatic papers(French Yellow book) available which document the position of the UK government just before the war. WW1 was no accident even <em>if</em> the murder of Archduke Ferdinand was just the action of some independent serbian nationalists or if there was some deeper conspiracy.</p>

<p>The Lusitania false flag operation was used by these elites to change the strong opinion of the US population to remain neutral.</p>

<p>With the treaty of Versailles the same elites which controlled the UK and USA set the conditions for WW2 because they didn&#39;t accomplish their goals with WW1, the breaking of german economical independence. The territory losses in the east of Germany with the corridor to Danzig would only lead to the next war as they were unacceptable and impracticable.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have to tell you that Wall Street financed the Bolsheviks and also the recovery of the german industry+NS party. They set the condition for the next big european war.</p>

<p>Do you think it was just an oversight that Prescott Bush who provided resources to Germany during WW2 itself (to keep that war going) wasn&#39;t punished for &quot;treason&quot;? As a cherry on top his son and grandson were gifted with the highest position of power in the USA...</p>

<p>You should also read the declaration of war by Japan. Economical boycotts and blockades are usually the pretext for any wars.</p>

War criminals are not confined to the Axis Powers alone. Roosevelt and Churchill are no less war criminals than Hitler and Mussolini.

    <div class="md"><p>Do not argue by authority, it is sign of mob mentality.</p>

<p>But what a nice thing? Put them all in the same sack and distribute the responsibilities equally. </p>

<p>I know that in a ordered crime, the executor gets 15 years and the one who ordered 25 to life. So when talking about war crimes and crimes against humanity, seek those who benefited of it all the most - the west(U.K. and U.S. the most and the rest of the gang less). </p>

<p>Sure every1 is to blame. But those behind closed door are worse.</p>
