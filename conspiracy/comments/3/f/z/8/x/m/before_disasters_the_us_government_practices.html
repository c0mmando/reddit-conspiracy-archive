       Title says it all. We've been experiencing fiber cuts at a rate I've never seen. Two cuts two years ago in Cali was unprecedented in the frequency and type. It's happening now in states all over. Especially the south west and North west. Last week an internet backbone router was taken down that impacted EVERY wireless and wireline provider in multiple states. This is no coincidence. This is something I've never seen before. Hop on to a bridge call during one of these outages. The phrase should be reworded 'swears like a network engineer' men and women are currently working 24 hour shifts Manning a bridge call and corporate chat rooms trying to figure this out (as always) but it's different. The fiber cut in Montana happened on a line owned by Nu-Telecom. They were speaking to ONE GUY who stated he was receiving info by email only. At 9pm the number our NOC had for the company went dark. Out of service. We couldn't speak to the company that owns the fiber. That's unheard of. This was an outage meeting PUMA 900k criteria(Potential user minutes affected). That means mandatory FCC notification of the outage and mandatory updates to FCC contacts. That's on our end and the fiber provider. Something is not right.

       I have docs from the trouble tickets I'm going to post tomorrow once I'm back. But I agree I NEED other engineers here. I can NOT call them out by name for obvious reasons. It's even obvious who I am and what I do based on what I'm posting but I'm safe.

       I live in Kentucky and at&amp;t service went completely out for a entire day on August 4 we had internet but our phone service was out. Its just funny because my father worked for them and the 3rd was his last day and he worked on at&amp;t equipment so basicly its my fathers fault.

       I'm sorry, I'm not really a tech person, what does this mean? When you say "fiber cuts," are you talking criminal behavior? People physically cutting fiber so systems go down? Or are they just "cutting out" inexplicably?

       I think pretty much everybody who frequents this subreddit senses something is up in September. Do you have any more information?

       I think he's deducing is that there have been massive, yes, cuts of fiber service across the US very frequently lately compared to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't just happen, which makes it suspicious along with upcoming September economic events.

       I'm not exactly sure if access is being cut or if the wires are physically bring damaged. If it is the latter, that's very strange.

       These wires have been physically cut. The too-short CNN story quotes the FBI saying likely suspects are "...normal telecommunications maintenance workers or [those who] possess tools consistent with that job role."
      </p>
      <p>
       Disturbing. Of course, if this is a big plot, they certainly would have people on the "inside."

       I'm increasingly thinking September will be some kind of giant digital attack, maybe vaporize the banks? That would end the huge pile of debt that is a cancer on the world. Or one of the cancers. The pedophile thing is pretty bad, too.

       From what we've heard from Reagan, Clinton and others who are part of the Illuminati/Luciferian/Satanic cabal, the one thing that could unify humanity is an alien invasion. We've been hearing about it for years, and now X-Files and Twin Peaks -- both with key alien subplots -- are returning. They are gearing up, again.

       I work in one of the larger Telecom companies in the Midwest. I work directly with the NOC as well as other fix agents but I am not a telecom engineer. We see fiber issues all the time but especially in GA, TN, MI, and MT. I'm not sure that I could say we have seen an increased number of cut fiber instances, but it sure is a lot. Currently we have a cut fiber in Michigan, but it is likely related to the storms that passed through a few days ago.

       Just like when the undersea cables get cut. Cut an obvious spot, have the timing perfect, while up/down-line you insert implant/splice/bend/sniffer(I hear you don't even need to cut to sniff fiber these days!), make sure stats are the same so no one sees the implant, now you have a backbone tapped!

       one such outtage was Monday July 8th, TW telecom was the provider stated, there was a Fiber line"cut" (their words not mine) between pleasonton CA and walnut creek CA. I believe this is San Ramon area but I would have to double check.
