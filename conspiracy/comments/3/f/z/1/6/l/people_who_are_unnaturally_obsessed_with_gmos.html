    <div class="md"><p>thenewmachine seems to interest me even more, that one replies to 3 different types of posts as far as # of comments:</p>

<p>There is a surprising amount of posts where there are literally 2 comments and 2 comments only.</p>

<p>There are also a lot of times where there are between 10-15 comments.  This seems to be a majority of them.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are the large posts, normally 198-220 comments.</p>

<p>Also, I like that the one post that this user commented on that aren&#39;t related to GMOs is a comment defending wherearemyfeet, the person right below thenewmachine on your list.</p>

New Zealand has incrediblely tight laws regarding GMOs, infact a large part of our international image relies on us not using them (although we have limited trials involving certian strains).  The research published by FSANZ offers nothing to be worried about. And potential gains I hope the government is considering for out future agriculture. </p>

<p>if you want to call me a &#39;shill&#39; for nature then please go ahead, but i actually support transgenics for research, therapeutic use, bioremediation, producing pharmaceutical products like insulin and even the fake rennet for cheese</p>

<p>i support and use transgenics in my research but i do not agree with its use as part of our food supply especially when we are under no pressure to use it</p>

<p>it serves the r/GMOmyths agenda to claim people who disagree with g.m.food or want it labelled are &#39;anti-science&#39; but it isn&#39;t true.. the real &#39;anti-science&#39; people are the ones who cling to old results for ideological reason and will not even consider new data brought forth by new research using new more powerful methods</p>

<p>if you looked in my history you&#39;ll notice i mostly post in biology/biochemistry/physics/science based subs. wherearemyfeet &amp; adamwho aren&#39;t even biologists they don&#39;t even attempt to analyze the data they simply regurgitate propaganda from gmoanswers &amp; geneticmisinformationproject</p>

You&#39;ve made a list of people you feel are shills, and use your bot and a percentage to justify it, but fail to add people doing the exact same thing (if not worse) for the other side. </p>

<p>You&#39;re just using arbitrary measures as &#39;proof&#39; that people who disagree with you are shills. </p>

<p>Check out ragecry, a dude who you&#39;ve had a pat on the back conversation with in a thread about pointing out shills. According to your bot 70% of the threads he posts in are about GMO or Monsanto. Why isn&#39;t he on the list? Oh wait, because he agrees with you. </p>

<p>Henrycorp mods like 170 subreddits, dozens of which are just tools for posting anti-gm propoganda. NOTHING SUSPICIOUS THERE JUST A REGULAR JOE INTERESTED IN GM.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re so one-eyed about the whole thing that you have to pretend like a vague &#39;suspicious&#39; definition you have justifies the inclusion of anyone you don&#39;t agree with vs people you do, which is a shame because your bot is actually quite handy and the results can be quite interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I told you and your crew over and over again the traits that I look for. There are even some regular users of /gmomyths that had high percentages as well, but were not added simply because I either didn&#39;t observe them well enough yet or because they just didn&#39;t fit like the ones on the list do. </p>

<p>The bot simply searches the title for Monsanto/GMO-related keywords, but the user has to be manually searched. It doesn&#39;t screen all of reddit to find these users. I searched users who I found to be suspiciously shilly after observing their arguments and activity. The bot simply helps to add information to my suspicions and to either strengthen or weaken my assumption. Funny enough, all of my suspicions seemed to be strengthened. I have said many times that it is not the absolute proof of anything, but it is information to be aware of.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t observed ragecry at all because before I had made this bot, I never saw him. He wasn&#39;t in a single debate during the time I was in the debate, before and around the time I made the bot. Neither was Henrycorp. And I&#39;m not going to just add users to the list if I haven&#39;t taken a closer look at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adapt and modify operations? Do you seriously believe there is some sort of united, organised group out to argue with you on the internet? </p>

<p>I mean, just look at that &#39;terminator&#39; seed link, he was clearly frustrated that it was being mentioned in a GM argument because they have never existed in a commercial product. You choose to link random websites before backtracking, and consider his exasperation as evidence he&#39;s a shill? </p>

<p>Maybe people who are arguing with you on the internet are doing so because they like to argue on the internet. Maybe these people happen to be interested in the topic of GM, and maybe they&#39;ve ended up defending Monsanto because (as you would have seen/been part of) you can&#39;t mention GM without people bringing up the supposed evils of Monsanto. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question for you. You seem very willing to believe that companies spread misinformation over the internet to increase their profits. Could you visit a couple of the posts you listed at look at how many times easily disprovable myths about GM/Monsanto (suing farmers, terminator seeds being used etc) get mentioned and wonder why might that be? Why would these factually incorrect things constantly be spread around the internet? </p>

<p>It might make sense if there was some industry that stands to profit immensely from public fear of GM. They might even fund campaigns to get GM food labelled, or sponsor anti-gm studies, documentaries and conferences! Oh man, there&#39;s no way something like that would get by you eagle eyed conspiracy theorists though! No sir, if you can pick up all these shills there&#39;s no way you&#39;d be tricked! </p>

<p>There are literally dudes who admit they make their money from organic farming and putting people off conventional agriculture arguing in these threads, yet I (who works in VFX in a country that doesn&#39;t grow GM crops and has no monetary interest at all in the topic) get pinned as a shill because I am soooo tired of all the misinformation being spread around by people who have just watched Food Inc and don&#39;t understand that people aren&#39;t under oath when they are making documentaries. </p>

<p>GOOD WORK DETECTIVE YOU&#39;VE CRACKED THE CASE</p>

<p>I even said that I didn&#39;t think that they were commercialized yet. She still continued to argue that they &quot;do not exist&quot;. How did I backtrack? Random websites? I linked a site of an organization at Berkeley, official patents, as well as a study where they genetically-modified plants to be sterile. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll repeat what I said to her...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not convinced that terminator seeds are real, because I didn&#39;t care to be convinced. I just find doubt in proclaiming the fact that they absolutely do not exist and feverishly arguing it, even with evidence of the patents, the technology, anecdotal evidence, and countries making rulings on them. I wasn&#39;t the one that brought it up and this was the first time I even discussed it.    </p>
