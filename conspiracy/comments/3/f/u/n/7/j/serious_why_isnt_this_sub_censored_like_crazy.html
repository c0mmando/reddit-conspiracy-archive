    <div class="md"><p>r/conspiracy is possibly the free-est sub on reddit. How many people are shills? Who knows? They&#39;re definitely around though.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing with free speech. Crazy people can say goofy stuff. Shills can post junk. Fringe racists hang around here.</p>

<p>It&#39;s up to the reader to sort through it for themselves and decide what is worthwhile and what isn&#39;t. Free speech allows stupid, crazy, sometimes racist stuff.</p>

<p>Thoughtful people will find their way through the muck, taking away that which was worthwhile and ignoring the pflaff. This is freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit doesn&#39;t care.  In truth it rarely cares as long as you don&#39;t disturb the defaults or make too much noise elsewhere.  Spez may be making the &quot;quarantine&quot; thing official, but that is sort of how it always was.</p>

<p>Jailbait got banned because it started getting the attention of the MSM.  FPH was nearing that level, and had reached the point that even if it remained self-&quot;contained&quot; by reaching the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> so much the containment wasn&#39;t effective.  Along the way a few subreddits were nuked along with them.</p>

<p>For the most part what gets posted in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> stays in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.  Things only blow up here, for the most part, after they&#39;ve been excluded from most other places.  So the flow of users is to here, not from.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think &quot;they&quot; care. You know why? Because 95% of the population doesn&#39;t care, and they&#39;re not open to the possibility that something fishy is going on behind the scenes. 95% of the population laughs at conspiracy theories, look at r/conspiratard. as someone else said, this sub is looked at as a freakshow. Anyway, unless the general population really started to wake up, a small group of people with information can&#39;t do much, IMO. Now, a push is being made to group conspiracy theorists in with terrorists and other extremists? Thought control is on the way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll tell you how - because this subreddit is so full to the brim with people posting &quot;jews jews jews zionist jew jew jew&quot; stuff all the time that the vast majority of, well, basically everyone will just dismiss everything here out of hand. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole point, I think, of the unchecked influx of holocaust deniers and stormfronters (or people pretending to be those, who are mysteriously helped by the mods who sticky threads and AMAs made by holocaust deniers who are themselves weird and easily debunked whackos - and they all sort of showed up here at once, all of a sudden, and many of them use multiple accounts). If you point this out, the mods will ban you. There is plenty here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that is censored.</p>

<p>If you leave all the stuff that would normally be censored free here - and connect it with all of that - you make it irrelevant and laughable to most people. It&#39;s a tactic, deceive / disinform meaningful ideas and information by connecting it to bullshit / disempower / distract / create tension / etc. Make sure all &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; have an outlet ... one which is constantly associated with complete bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree wholeheartedly but I take an issue with the &#39;holocaust deniers&#39; being an invalid conspiracy. Of course the holocaust happened but did it happen in the way it is written in history?
There are many new findings that suggest it is not. I am not a denier that would be idiocy [hence I agree with you] but we must allow those that are &#39;suspect&#39; of the official version to bring forward their evidence and discuss it.
Also about the mentioning of Jews, there are clear trolls/shills out there using anti semitism to bring this sub down but again we should not EVER disallow opinions that are well outlined and MAY have a point to them [or not - therefore discussions].</p>

<p>It is up to the readers to discern between those posts that deliberately show us up as either racist or crazy and those that may have some truth to them. If you educate yourself about a subject you will be able to do so and help to make others make up their minds.</p>

<p>Censoring or taking certain opinions off because they could possibly be made by shills will not help in any way, shape or form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people built a narrative around holocaust, so even holocaust revisionism is harmful to their ideas. So they throw them in the same hole as deniers. Entire philosophies, movie characters, and doctrines based on the propaganda around the strawman image of the nazis.</p>
