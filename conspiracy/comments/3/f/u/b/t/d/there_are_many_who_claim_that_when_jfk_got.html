<p>It depends on the caliber. He didn&#39;t look like his head got shot with a rifle tip at all to me. It looked like a .45 at 4-5 feet. The rifle would have emptied his whole head out. He still had half of it. </p>

<p>The quality of the film is too poor to make that claim.</p>

<p>The quality is too poor to identify a gun or gunshot from the driver.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t think the limo would accelerate after Kennedy was shot?</p>

<p>The driver should have sped up quicker. Either the  driver waited for the kill shot or dealt it out. The passenger was already aware of shots getting fired before the headshot too. </p>

<p>No matter what I didn&#39;t come up with this theory myself. I came across it and I can see it because it seems to fit what I see in the video. You might not ever see it. That will never change my mind though. If I come across something better I&#39;ll be open to it but I&#39;m just not buying that it was a guy in a storm drain. </p>
