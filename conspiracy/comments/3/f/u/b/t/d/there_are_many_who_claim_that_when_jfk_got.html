       shooter was the one responsible. He was clearly shot from the front. Everything is a rich man's trick is an excellent doc. For all of those who haven't seen it, watch it!

       You would like to think so and I have seen footage that sort of looks like that may have happened, but it just doesn't fit the known facts....much like the official story.  His head would have gone the other direction if that was where the shot came from.

       It depends on the caliber. He didn't look like his head got shot with a rifle tip at all to me. It looked like a .45 at 4-5 feet. The rifle would have emptied his whole head out. He still had half of it.

       Fair enough, tough to say for sure.  It's all conjecture at this point, which is why they always do a massive cover-up after one of these scenes.  Look at the immediate aftermath of 9/11 for more evidence.

       Agreed. It sad that humanity has been lied to so much and it's worse how accepted set narratives are. The upside is that I believe we are living in the times that we will get all the answers we wanted and even some that we didn't.

       Just watch the The Zapruder Film in slow motion. You'll see him look back once and shoot on the second look. The limo accelerates after the second look back making it more obvious that it was him. Believe what you want though.

       The driver should have sped up quicker. Either the  driver waited for the kill shot or dealt it out. The passenger was already aware of shots getting fired before the headshot too.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter what I didn't come up with this theory myself. I came across it and I can see it because it seems to fit what I see in the video. You might not ever see it. That will never change my mind though. If I come across something better I'll be open to it but I'm just not buying that it was a guy in a storm drain.

       Exit wounds are bloodier than entry wounds. If the bullet entered from the front, blood spray should've gone out the back of his head. Yet the blood spray exited from the front.

       A bullet will cause a minor amount of ejection backwards, with a mass ejection forwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this basic fact in mind, we would expect some of Kennedy to be ejected backwards, with most of him ejecting forwards - Which is what we see.

       Well your photo doesn't show the back of his head :/ - However that does appear to be the front, The upper front of his head if you want to get a bit more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you look at the video, we see the blood spray from the front of his head. How can there be so much blood spray from the front, if he was shot from the front?

       That is an autopsy photo. It clearly shows a small entry wound in the front and a huge exit wound in the back. Just like the vid you posted of the fruit.

       Now for once don't derail the conversation, don't say you cannot see what is there, don't make things up. Just say you were wrong and move on to the next thread.
