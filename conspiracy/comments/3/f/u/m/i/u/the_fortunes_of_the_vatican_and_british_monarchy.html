       I have looked in-depth repeatedly for years now on just how vast the wealth of the Rothschilds is and it is nearly impossible... actually no, it's impossible... to get a handle on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either a lot of us are fooled into thinking they are truly devious masters of the universe or they have us fooled into thinking that they are not because if they are they hide that money really well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish I could find some comprehensive breakdown somewhere. One that isn't a site that looks like it was made in 1999 on a free Geocities account. There is nothing worse than trying to show your friends and family some critical information they should think about and 95% of it comes from web pages that look like they were made by some kook living in his basement who is obsessed with the Comic Sans font and having a patterned background of stars on black across their terrible website with blinking titles/headlines written in bright green.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just looks so uncredible... "Sure jasenlee, the Rothschilds control everything. Could you show us some links to the lizard people controlling our minds through untold alien powers next?".

       You can't value entire countries currencies lol. Their power comes from their ancestors scams that essentially makes them owners of all central banks. We will never know the depth of their wealth. On the reptilian stuff, read about it if you haven't. It's not going anywhere anytime soon.

       Since the formation of the (un)Holy Roman Empire there has been a struggle for world power between the Roman Catholic Church and world Jewry. The 'Los Alumbrados' (illuminati) was founded by Marrano's (Spanish Jews who converted to Catholicism under pretense to avoid persecution). Adam 'Spartacus' Weishaupt was a Jew that became a Jesuit, then disaffected and was behind the creation of the Bavarian Illuminati in conjunction with the Rothschilds. The purpose of the Illuminati was for the Rothschilds and Jews to take power away from the Catholic Church that had dominated up to that time. Weishaupt said “We will infiltrate that place [the Vatican] and once inside we will never come out. We will bore from within until nothing remains but an empty shell.” The Illuminati is the precursor to Atheistic Communism with it's goal being to destroy all religion.

       Are you saying that the enlightenment was a a jewish plot?  Every group has fought with the church.  Nobody likes being tithed and most groups just end up schisming.

       I think he should prove that "Jews" are somehow in charge when clearly Anglo Saxons are in possession of higher percentage of wealth and power. Seems like a clever obfuscation tactic rather than a genuine ideology. Even if it was it would be stupid, because there is no evidence that Jews control the world. Disproportionately powerful, sure but not the head of the whole monster. We don'f know whose in the floating cap stone and thats the point.

       Well the argument has been, for more than a hundred years, that "the jews" is a euphamism and tool for the rothschild cartel which has been the greatest supporter of zionism and probably has contributed immeasurably to jewish cultural ideology. And their relationship between the austrahungarian dynasties, world banking systems is demonstrated though hard to calculate in this century.

       I mean the windsors and family have tons of financial connections to the Rothschilds and their families are clandestinely related. I'm just saying there's a difference between Zionazi banksters like Rothschild and your average Jewish man.

       State Street and Vanguard are the biggest shareholders, i.e. all our pension funds. Weird how we own them and do not control them.

       This is something that needs to be investigated more and reported on more. I have tried repeatedly to tell people about this on this sub and others and people generally just told me that I was wrong for believing this. This is the ultimate structure of the real control. This is what we should be looking more closely at.
