    <div class="md"><p>I have looked in-depth repeatedly for years now on just how vast the wealth of the Rothschilds is and it is nearly impossible... actually no, it&#39;s impossible... to get a handle on it. </p>

<p>Either a lot of us are fooled into thinking they are truly devious masters of the universe or they have us fooled into thinking that they are not because if they are they hide that money really well. </p>

<p>I wish I could find some comprehensive breakdown somewhere. One that isn&#39;t a site that looks like it was made in 1999 on a free Geocities account. There is nothing worse than trying to show your friends and family some critical information they should think about and 95% of it comes from web pages that look like they were made by some kook living in his basement who is obsessed with the Comic Sans font and having a patterned background of stars on black across their terrible website with blinking titles/headlines written in bright green. </p>

<p>It just looks so uncredible... &quot;Sure jasenlee, the Rothschilds control everything. Could you show us some links to the lizard people controlling our minds through untold alien powers next?&quot;. </p>

<p>But then I found out on a podcast from his own account that he had lost control of his site years ago and it&#39;s now owned and operated by momentum developments llc who are just trying to sell his books that they own the publishing rights to.

    <div class="md"><p>Since the formation of the (un)Holy Roman Empire there has been a struggle for world power between the Roman Catholic Church and world Jewry. The &#39;Los Alumbrados&#39; (illuminati) was founded by Marrano&#39;s (Spanish Jews who converted to Catholicism under pretense to avoid persecution). Adam &#39;Spartacus&#39; Weishaupt was a Jew that became a Jesuit, then disaffected and was behind the creation of the Bavarian Illuminati in conjunction with the Rothschilds. The purpose of the Illuminati was for the Rothschilds and Jews to take power away from the Catholic Church that had dominated up to that time. Weishaupt said “We will infiltrate that place [the Vatican] and once inside we will never come out. We will bore from within until nothing remains but an empty shell.” The Illuminati is the precursor to Atheistic Communism with it&#39;s goal being to destroy all religion.</p>

<p>(For the record I&#39;m a non-church affiliated bible believing Christian.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the argument has been, for more than a hundred years, that &quot;the jews&quot; is a euphamism and tool for the rothschild cartel which has been the greatest supporter of zionism and probably has contributed immeasurably to jewish cultural ideology. And their relationship between the austrahungarian dynasties, world banking systems is demonstrated though hard to calculate in this century.</p>
