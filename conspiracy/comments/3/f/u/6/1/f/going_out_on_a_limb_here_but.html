       is anyone else having re-accuring apocalyptic dreams?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like not every night or every week but like once a month. Just about every month I have a dream where I see these crazy unidentifiable lights in the sky followed by a very clear meteor/comet/asteroid hitting in the distance, followed by a massive explosion and a shower of debris. So much debris that I quickly become buried chest deep. At which point I just make my peace with that reality and give way to whatever is next. Upon which I die, and begin to see the destruction from a few miles up and it is incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably the only one. This isn't a conspiracy. But has anyone else experienced anything similar? It started about two years ago and now seeing all fringe Sept. 2015 event theories, its making me curious to say the least.

       When you're fed this bullshit in media of all forms your mind reacts in kind.  Turn off your TV.  Stop consuming the propaganda.  If anything does happen, be ready to do what you know in your heart is right.  Whatever that is.

       I neither watch tv or give the media any attention. that said, I have had a recurring nightmare for the last decade of a truly bizarre end of the world happening that starts with a clear, nice day, and then the sounding of a hunting horn of some sort. it permeates everything. it is omnipresent. the sky darkens from light to dark blue and gets darker and darker as the sun expands and begins to turn into a red supergiant. the earth quakes terribly, ripping everything apart as all things begin to catch fire, and suddenly, all is nothing but a living hell on Earth, all are dead, immolated, and naught remains but charcoal planet.

       I have a theory that may pertain to some of the comments here as well. 
Have you ever walked out to your car and started humming a song then turned the car on and the song is playing on the radio?
Ever heard stories of someones fillings picking up the radio station?
Your head is a receiver and we are all picking up every signal at all times but the brain (ego) filters out info that it does feel is urgent. 
All of these signals and everyone's thoughts are bouncing around all the time but we are not in tune with our environment enough to be able to decipher this info. It's likely we would be so overwhelmed that a simple task would be difficult to focus in on with so much info bombarding our conscious. Unconsciously however, we are able to let some things filter in. Edgar Cayce said everyone's unconscious mind is connected. I'm not sure if that's true or not but it's something to think about.

       I had that happen to me once, but it was bizarre. The doubly nuts thing about was that I was living in the deep, deep south, and the Elvis Costello song "Alison" was suddenly in my head and I started whistling it. When I got in the car, I don't recall if it was the first radio station I turned on or one I clicked to, but they were playing "Alison." You NEVER heard songs like that where I was living, and I never heard another Elvis C. song on the radio before or after during my time living there. That's always creeped me out.

       Yes. The universal consciousness
       <em>
        is real
       </em>
       . I've seen it more as a tsunami wave, forming off in the distance (I'm on the beach). It could've been caused by a meteor/asteroid or something else. But, definitely a ELE (Extinction Level Event).

       Answer the question. Have you personally seen it, or are you only going by what people have told you? Pretty simple yo, not sure why you are making it so complicated. Answer, yes or no? Once again, your spelling and grammar is horrendous.

       I've been having dreams like that for the past 20 years or so... Crashing massive space ships.. Impressive UFOs appearing and floating above.... Symbols symbols symbols... or...... But whatever. Elites are planning a false flag involving «aliens», so they can set up the one world government.  It's been long time coming.. Just like everything else masonic, it's hidden in plain sight. The Watchmen graphic novel shows it well.

       It's just your mind processing all the information on this sub. Usually when I watch a video of a nuclear explosion, I'm bound to dream about it within the next few days. This week I'm re-reading Dune, and I've had quite a few dreams about being stranded in the desert, or there being an immense worldwide drought.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I do believe there might be a financial crisis, I'm almost certain that there's not going to be an apocalypse of any kind.

       These things were falsely predicted for a good couple of thousands of years now :)

       Just guessing, and this might sound weird, but you could be seeing what's happening in an alternate timeline. The soul incarnates in multiple timelines simultaneously in order to have more experiences and thus growth. You are however aware of only one timeline -this one. 
Now there are many theories about how timelines interact and intersect - if you go to the sub Glitch_in_the_matrix you'll find plenty of stories of people that have seemingly not only dreamt about other timelines but had vivid actual experiences where their reality or memory changed (both seemingly timeline-bleed-in effects). Many even claim they have completely shifted timelines (for example - suddenly the neighbor 's car was a different color or the whole layout of a place they know well changed (a new building appears from nowhere) and anyone they ask says it has always been that way) , which is imho impossible - but very weird and scary nontheless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously check out some of the posts on that sub if you feel like it- even from a spiritual/esoteric mindset that I'm coming from, half of the stories there are unexplainable.

       Gosh I wonder why there's a subreddit devoted to making fun of this one? I honestly tried liking this sub but I get the feeling everybody here is on benefits, mostly delusional trying to come up with a convincing story for the psychiatrist to get that new med.

       My friend spoke with me a couple of months ago about a very realistic reoccurring dream she has been having about an asteroid destroying Earth and she asked me if I had heard anything about any comets or anything and I did tell her about the rumored one in September, though I made sure she knew that I don't necessarily believe those rumors. I don't know, but it's interesting!
