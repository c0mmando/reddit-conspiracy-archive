        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Under the new reddit policies, they are implementing bans  on some subreddits (recently, <a href="/r/coontown">/r/coontown</a>) and quarantining others. I however think that the main goal is not to get rid of/silence these retarded subreddits, but to silence the truth movement/alternative news/conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Everyone knows what a ban is, but what does quarantine mean?</p>

<p><a href="https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205701245">https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205701245</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when we deem its content to be extremely offensive or upsetting to the average redditor. The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not wish to do so. Restrictions on a quarantined community include:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>    Requiring an account with a verified email address</li>
<li>    Requiring an explicit opt-in</li>
<li>    No custom images</li>
<li>    Will generate no revenue, including ads or Reddit Gold</li>
</ol>

<p>The important part of this is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A community will be Quarantined on Reddit when <strong>we deem</strong> its content to be extremely offensive or <strong>upsetting to the average redditor</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what is talked about on here that may be offensive to the average reddit user (in no particular order)?</p>

<ol>
<li>9/11</li>
<li>USS liberty</li>
<li>Operation Paperclip</li>
<li>Intelligence agencies creating faux terrorists/boogie men around the world</li>
<li>Critical of the government (politicians are puppets), call out the shadow government</li>
<li>GMO&#39;s/hormones in our food effecting people&#39;s genetics/hormones</li>
<li>Critical of the militarization of the police and police brutality</li>
<li>Critical of these endless wars, and call out the truth behind them</li>
<li>Critical of the PC SJW agenda</li>
<li>Zionism influencing US Politics and foreign policy</li>
<li>Israel and Palestine, and the war crimes Israel is committing (Israel treats Palestinians like the Nazi&#39;s treated the Jews)</li>
<li>The transgender agenda</li>
</ol>

<p>Just to name a few. </p>

<p>Now any of those could be deemed by any &quot;average reddit user&quot; as offensive, which puts us in the cross hairs. As I&#39;ve said above, quarantining a subreddit will put restrictions on that subreddit. My main concerns with the restrictions are these:</p>

<ol>
<li>    Requiring an account with a verified email address</li>
<li>    Requiring an explicit opt-in</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are asking, okay what&#39;s wrong with that?</p>

<ol>
<li>By making people verify their email address, it makes it less likely a lurker (on the fence conspiracy theorist/truth seeker) will stop by and see what alternative news is being talked about here. Many people come here from say <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> to see another side of the story. This adds an unnecessary step (people are lazy), most &quot;average redditor&quot; will not enter their email address, go to said email inbox and press the verify link. It will also do away with throwaway accounts.</li>
<li>By requiring an explicit opt-in, this will stigmatize <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> (and other alt subs) with the likes of other quarantined subreddits. Hence, associating us with some of the most vile subreddits on reddit. This too, may also deter people on the fence or mildly interested in ever seeing alternative news/conspiracy theories. Because the opt-in implies, topics talked about inside this sub were determined to qualify it to be quarantined (racist, hateful, blah blah, etc). I imagine it will be a splash page similar to 18+(porn) subreddits. Most people will just say &quot;fuck it&quot;, I&#39;d rather look at cats and funnies or a subreddit like <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> or <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>, etc. Only truly curious people will do these steps (I say 20% actually would). This further segregates alternative news/theories from people who need to know this information</li>
</ol>

<p>By doing these two very things, the truth movement is quarantined from the very people, who need to/should see it. I see this as an overall strategy of censoring the internet and I feel like now with the reddit changes and how the FCC will be regulating the internet (net neutrality), things will only get worse for the truth movement. </p>

<p>Welcome to the new internet, a bastard child created by 1984 and A Brave New World.</p>

<p>TL;DR: We desperately need a new platform and we all need to come together and figure out how we can do this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many people commonly describe schizophrenia as &#39;hearing voices&#39; or something similar.  However, delusions are also a common symptom of schizophrenia.  For example, you have concluded that the world is flat because you can&#39;t observe the spherical shape directly.  This is an inability to connect the established results of many experiments with reality of a spherical earth, that rotates in space.  This is a delusion.  No amount of evidence will convince you that this is true because your disease has affected the way your brain works.  </p>

<p>Please, you should really seek professional help.   </p>

<p>Based on a simple analysis of your text, I can see that you are displaying an almost textbook example of an inability to connect the dots, if you will, which is commonly displayed by schizophrenics.  You will need the aid of advanced psychiatry and psychology techniques and therapies.  Unfortunately, you will not be able to make requests.

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has opened my eyes too, and I love the community. I&#39;m already on voat, but their recent Incorporation in the US has me at my doubts. I&#39;ll stick around here for as long as possible, I just think this community has enough diverse people within in to be able to come together and brainstorm a new platform. I have many ideas as do many others. This is just kind of like a writing on the walls, the tsunami wave is coming. Best see it before it hits and have a plan. Cheers!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was banned for 24 hours recently for asking questions in an AMA.  The mods said it was for &quot;trolling&quot;, but since all I was doing was asking questions, and I&#39;m a regular member, commenter and contributor to this subreddit, I think it&#39;s something more sinister.  I think it&#39;s the precursor to a crackdown.  I agree with the OP that this is just the beginning of making this subreddit less useful.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a shame because it literally is the only subreddit I read on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Quarantine, on the other hand, would have the opposite effect. Some would flee, the ones who stay become an insulated and effectively silenced community, not being able to branch out to other and new redditors.</p>

<p>Divide and conquer would be awfully effective under a quarantine. </p>
