<p>The rule is not an example of arbitrary censorship because Redditors can still view content from a NP link whether or not they can discern how to easily change the subdomain.</p>

<p>Since the subdomain can be easily changed, the rule is obviously a deterrent instead of a method to completely stop brigading.</p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s coders have nothing to do with it. NP is set up, used by, and enforced by moderators. Not Reddit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re glossing over a lot of ambiguity and variability here, but to keep this simple, we&#39;ll say yes, NP only works if mods enable it. Every sub is different and so what &quot;works&quot; means can vary from sub to sub quite a bit. But it&#39;s sufficient for now to say that NP will do nothing unless the mods have taken affirmative steps to make it do <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>So if you go to an np.reddit.com link and see the vote/comment buttons, it&#39;s because the person posting the link was giving the target subreddit the option to use NP (perhaps as required by the rules wherever they posted it), but the target subreddit&#39;s mods did not exercise that option.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you explain what you mean by &quot;the person posting the link was giving the target subreddit the option to use NP?&quot; </p>

<p>Your writing here is very ambiguous and unclear, but rather than wait for you to clarify, let me just explain a couple of things:</p>

<p>(1) Any subreddit can be accessed at the np.reddit.com<a href="/r/subreddit">/r/subreddit</a> URL, whether the sub has decided to enable NP or not. Mods do not have to &quot;enable NP&quot; in order to the sub to be accessible at the NP.reddit.com address.</p>

<p>(2) If mods choose to, they can customize their CSS to render pages differently when the NP language attribute is discovered in the URL. Exactly how pages render differently is up to each sub to decide for themselves.</p>

<p>Some subs decide to use the discovery of NP to hide voting buttons. Some use it to display a message warning  you to not participate. There are a lot of different ways it can be implemented.</p>

<p>If a particular sub lets you see the voting buttons or the comment field when you are in NP mode, then yes, you could say &quot;the target subreddit&#39;s mods did not exercise [the] option&quot; to hide them.&quot;</p>

<p>So two questions:</p>

<p>(1) What&#39;s your point?
(2) I thought you were going to tell me what I got wrong. You started by saying I misunderstood something. What have I misunderstood?</p>

<p>Subs can be banned if the mods are negligent in letting them be used to organize brigades. Part of the mods responsibilities are to discourage and prevent brigades. If they have decided to enforce stricter rules, it&#39;s because they are doing their jobs and trying to protect the users of this sub.</p>

<p>Also, if the deletion is done by an automod, it&#39;s not arbitrary. I don&#39;t know how their automod works, but generally it&#39;s going to delete everything that matches a certain rule. In other words, it would delete <em>every</em> link that doesn&#39;t use np. That&#39;s not arbitrary; it&#39;s just the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do, probably better than you. NP is used by some subs on their discretion. There are other subs that enforce (or not) NP rule. And, unless some policies in this sub have changed, here&#39;re the rules of 3 subs I frequent:</p>

<ul>
<li>r/conspiracy will let normal reddit links but with an automod warning (which is annoying as fuck)</li>
<li>r/european only allows np-links, automod deletes normal links</li>
<li>r/theredpill allows no reddit links at all (screenshot or archive site required)</li>
</ul>

<p>From a few comments here and there I can surely say that site coders are lazy as fuck (see shadowbans VS no &quot;normal&quot; site-wide bans). Check out the source on github to see how whe whole site is nothing more than a &quot;hack&quot;.</p>

<p>Why are users required to add np.reddit.com to their urls? </p>

<p>Oh, I think I figured out what you&#39;re upset about. Tell me if I&#39;m wrong: Someone posted a link in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to another sub outside of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, but they failed to use the NP link when doing so.</p>

<p>And then, an <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> automod deleted the post. Is that right?</p>

<p>In that case, it&#39;s simply prudent moderation. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> does not want to get in trouble for brigading. So the mods have (I&#39;m guessing) decided to prohibit outbound links that don&#39;t use NP. They are trying to demonstrate due diligence and conscientiousness so they cannot be accused of being a brigade sub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#39;t reddit control subdomains?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you mean &quot;control?&quot; As a writer, you really need to think about how ambiguous your writing is. </p>

<p>Reddit accepts language attributes in the domain. You can access any sub using any language attribute. You can go to any of these:</p>

<p><a href="https://fr.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">https://fr.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a><br/>
<a href="https://de.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">https://de.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a><br/>
<a href="https://en.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">https://en.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a><br/>
<a href="https://jp.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">https://jp.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a><br/>
<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure exactly what you think it means to say &quot;reddit controls subdomains.&quot; </p>

<p>NP is just a CSS hack -- a user convention -- that leverages the NP language attribute to render different CSS.</p>

<p>About the deleted posts:  are you sure they were deleted for violating NP? And who deleted them, admins or mods? Do you know the difference between the two? And do you know whose prerogative it is to implement NP? Hint: not the admins. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NP only works if the target subreddit&#39;s mods have enabled it, and in the most popular implementations it also only works if you visit the page via a np.reddit.com URL (another option is to hide the buttons from all non-subscribers regardless of URL). So if you go to an np.reddit.com link and see the vote/comment buttons, it&#39;s because the person posting the link was giving the target subreddit the option to use NP (perhaps as required by the rules wherever they posted it), but the target subreddit&#39;s mods did not exercise that option.</p>

<p>Yes?</p>
