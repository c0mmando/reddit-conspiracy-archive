       Thanks for the info, I'll have to look into this. Just thought I'd comment that in firefox I always disable the referrer address due to privacy concerns because I don't think websites need to know the last address I visited.

       I agree every computer on the Internet can be hacked (regardless of security restrictions). However, I wasn't commenting on security. Just mentioning that by disabling my browser's referrer header it would prevent reddit (or any other website) from being able to "simpl[y] tell where [I] came from".

       Sure, but because you are logged in to reddit it's still possible for them to very easily track if you came from another subreddit and voted in a subreddit you aren't subscribed to (or whatever the vague rule is).

      <p>
       The rule is not an example of arbitrary censorship because Redditors can still view content from a NP link whether or not they can discern how to easily change the subdomain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the subdomain can be easily changed, the rule is obviously a deterrent instead of a method to completely stop brigading.

        Why enforce it with bans instead of just changing the links automatically? Are reddit's coders stupid?

      <p>
       Reddit's coders have nothing to do with it. NP is set up, used by, and enforced by moderators. Not Reddit.

      <p>
       Big difference.

       Link submission script? What's that?  I hate to say it, but your post is incoherent. It's impossible to tell what exactly you're trying to say with your "technical" details. Yes, servers log referrers. So what? What is your point? And yes, code can be used to edit strings, including URLs. But again, what's your point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither of those techniques are used to impose NP on cross-sub links. So what possible relevance do they have to your point?  If the rule is to impose censorship, wouldn't Reddit implement the two techniques you refer to?

       So then it was moderator action. Has nothing to do with "reddit" the company, or reddit's programmers, or reddit's rules.

       It's all about the mods who manage the sub.

       You need to learn about the difference between mod and admin on reddit. It's pretty significant.

       NP only works if the target subreddit's mods have enabled it, and in the most popular implementations it also only works if you visit the page via a np.reddit.com URL (another option is to hide the buttons from all non-subscribers regardless of URL). So if you go to an np.reddit.com link and see the vote/comment buttons, it's because the person posting the link was giving the target subreddit the option to use NP (perhaps as required by the rules wherever they posted it), but the target subreddit's mods did not exercise that option.

      <p>
       You're glossing over a lot of ambiguity and variability here, but to keep this simple, we'll say yes, NP only works if mods enable it. Every sub is different and so what "works" means can vary from sub to sub quite a bit. But it's sufficient for now to say that NP will do nothing unless the mods have taken affirmative steps to make it do
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       .

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Can you explain what you mean by "the person posting the link was giving the target subreddit the option to use NP?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Your writing here is very ambiguous and unclear, but rather than wait for you to clarify, let me just explain a couple of things:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Any subreddit can be accessed at the np.reddit.com
       <a href="/r/subreddit">
        /r/subreddit
       </a>
       URL, whether the sub has decided to enable NP or not. Mods do not have to "enable NP" in order to the sub to be accessible at the NP.reddit.com address.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) If mods choose to, they can customize their CSS to render pages differently when the NP language attribute is discovered in the URL. Exactly how pages render differently is up to each sub to decide for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some subs decide to use the discovery of NP to hide voting buttons. Some use it to display a message warning  you to not participate. There are a lot of different ways it can be implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a particular sub lets you see the voting buttons or the comment field when you are in NP mode, then yes, you could say "the target subreddit's mods did not exercise [the] option" to hide them."
      </p>
      <p>
       So two questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) What's your point?
(2) I thought you were going to tell me what I got wrong. You started by saying I misunderstood something. What have I misunderstood?

       Yes. Because the mods are trying to demonstrate due diligence in discouraging brigades, because brigades go against Reddit's rules. They want to show they are not letting their sub be used as a platform for rule violation. It's a simple convention to show good faith.

       I have no idea;  you'd have to ask the mods that. They may have recently decided to be more rigorous in their enforcement of anti-brigading policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subs can be banned if the mods are negligent in letting them be used to organize brigades. Part of the mods responsibilities are to discourage and prevent brigades. If they have decided to enforce stricter rules, it's because they are doing their jobs and trying to protect the users of this sub.

       Also, if the deletion is done by an automod, it's not arbitrary. I don't know how their automod works, but generally it's going to delete everything that matches a certain rule. In other words, it would delete
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       link that doesn't use np. That's not arbitrary; it's just the opposite.

       You don't even know what NP is for. It's a simple CSS "hack" that will tell you that you shouldn't vote on shit (or hiding the vote buttons altogether). Also,
      </p>
      <pre><code>url.replace('www.reddit', 'np.reddit');
</code></pre>
      <p>
       is BS because there's something you could call a localized url, e.g. fr.reddit.com for the French translation of the site. So basically you'd go after all localized links.

       I do, probably better than you. NP is used by some subs on their discretion. There are other subs that enforce (or not) NP rule. And, unless some policies in this sub have changed, here're the rules of 3 subs I frequent:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        r/conspiracy will let normal reddit links but with an automod warning (which is annoying as fuck)
       </li>
       <li>
        r/european only allows np-links, automod deletes normal links
       </li>
       <li>
        r/theredpill allows no reddit links at all (screenshot or archive site required)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       From a few comments here and there I can surely say that site coders are lazy as fuck (see shadowbans VS no "normal" site-wide bans). Check out the source on github to see how whe whole site is nothing more than a "hack".

       That might be my fault as I wrote to the mods that they should either remove the annoying "warning" or start enforcing the NP rule. They are probably too lazy to search-replace thousands of links (and I'm not sure they have the permission to edit comments).

       Oh, I think I figured out what you're upset about. Tell me if I'm wrong: Someone posted a link in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to another sub outside of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , but they failed to use the NP link when doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then, an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       automod deleted the post. Is that right?
      </p>
      <p>
       In that case, it's simply prudent moderation.
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       does not want to get in trouble for brigading. So the mods have (I'm guessing) decided to prohibit outbound links that don't use NP. They are trying to demonstrate due diligence and conscientiousness so they cannot be accused of being a brigade sub.

       What do you mean "control?" As a writer, you really need to think about how ambiguous your writing is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit accepts language attributes in the domain. You can access any sub using any language attribute. You can go to any of these:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://fr.reddit.com/r/conspiracy">

       <br/>

        https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure exactly what you think it means to say "reddit controls subdomains."
      </p>
      <p>
       NP is just a CSS hack -- a user convention -- that leverages the NP language attribute to render different CSS.

       I have no idea how their automod is set up or how they enforce their rules. But the mods here are generally very accessible and willing to have an open dialogue. I'm sure if you politely address your questions to them, they could explain it in great detail.

       In fact, you should do so and then post what they tell you here. There might be others who would be interested to hear what you learn.

       <em>
        mods

       Who's to say they aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been a post on the front page all day that says they are working on better ways to deal with brigades.

       Until then, you are angry because the rule was enforced here recently. Well... it was enforced for a very good reason. The administration has shown that it is perfectly happy to use brigading as a reason to get rid of some subs, so any leniancy at all cannot be tolerated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure otherwise why you are making this thread since you have no more info than anyone else, and you should understand the reason for the enforced rule recently as well.

       I'm not angry. I'm suggesting the rule is stupid and arbitrary, and does nothing to solve the problem.

       Well it's not arbitrary because the reason is to keep the admins off the subs back.. Nor stupid for the same reason.

      <p>
       The problem is the admins, not the rule we are forced to have because of the admins.

       Why enforce it with bans instead of just changing the links automatically? Are reddit's coders stupid?

       I still want to know what you're talking about with link submission script.
      </p>
      <p>
       About the deleted posts:  are you sure they were deleted for violating NP? And who deleted them, admins or mods? Do you know the difference between the two? And do you know whose prerogative it is to implement NP? Hint: not the admins.

       NP only works if the target subreddit's mods have enabled it, and in the most popular implementations it also only works if you visit the page via a np.reddit.com URL (another option is to hide the buttons from all non-subscribers regardless of URL). So if you go to an np.reddit.com link and see the vote/comment buttons, it's because the person posting the link was giving the target subreddit the option to use NP (perhaps as required by the rules wherever they posted it), but the target subreddit's mods did not exercise that option.
