       "New York City police say they held a young man down and beat him in a Target store because he “refused to identify himself” Saturday evening in an incident caught on video.
      </p>
      <p>
       The beating could have been much worse if it was not for the growing crowd of witnesses either recording or yelling at the cops to stop beating him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, more cops came out of nowhere to control the restless crowd, which appeared ready to start pulling officers off the man they were beating.
      </p>
      <p>
       The young man, whose name has not been released, was charged resisting arrest, obstruction of governmental administration, trespassing and disorderly conduct, according to Patch, who reached out to the NYPD for comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, those are typical contempt-of-cop charges police use when they can’t determine if an actual crime was committed. Like shoplifting, for example, which is what a person would normally be arrested for inside a retail store. Or at least outside it once they walk out with the merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, those are all misdemeanor charges that generally don’t require a beat down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patch also reached out to Target who said their employees were the ones who called police:
      </p>
      <p>
       And Target’s press office says in a statement that Target employees were the ones to call police: “At Target, we take the safety and security of our guests, team members and property very seriously. Following concerning behavior by one of our guests, the team contacted law enforcement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The video, recorded by a man named Michael Rolland, lasts almost 15 minutes, but it’s within the first minute that shows the beating. It currently has just more than 2,000 views but it is quickly going viral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rolland posted the following on Facebook:
      </p>
      <p>
       The response was totally disproportionate and put his life at risk. From what I can tell they were beating him on the back because he refused to let go of the Bible (or other large gilded book) he was holding onto.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book is ripped out of the man’s hands around the :49 mark in the video and tossed aside and nobody else seems to pay it any mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The  incident took place in Flatbush, Brooklyn and involved officers from NYPD’s 70th Precinct.  Police told Patch that the incident is “under internal review.”

       I went through this in a local community college where I was meeting with a group of philosophers in the library. At exactly 10:01, they lock everyone inside the library and the only way out was to show proof of I.D. to the rent cop security pieces of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guard put me in cuffs for refusing to show my I.D. and held me in their comedic security trailer, where he had a whole paper of bullshit trumped up charges on before he was going to hand me over to real cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       I basically negotiated my way out of there via apologizing to the sociopath, then immediately filed a police report, did a story on security abuse in the school paper and the township, had a blog up with is picture and his name, and spent two weeks sneaking around campus posting wanted posters with a picture of his face and a description of what he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       He eventually got fired

       I'm an atheist and as much as I would like to beat people who evangelize, they don't deserve to be beaten by cops. I think we are all curious as to what the alleged crime he committed was that he would be required to identify himself.

       Gold edged pages, thick like a bible but still bendable due to the paper used, a brown leather looking but not too thick cover, and a little page marker string hanging out one end.

       Probability it is a Bible: 98%
