       People used to laugh at me when I told them I think life on Earth was seeded from outer space. They'd start droning on about abiogenesis like life couldn't have started here in any other way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patiently, I would explain how there is no logic in abiogenesis as a theory (i.e. If the Earth was barren then it would work against the proliferation of life) and no evidential support for it as a theory (i.e. It has never been witnessed in a laboratory). Still, who can argue with large groups of people chanting that you're an idiot? You can't beat that argument.

       Fascinating. I thought this was a troll at first (maybe it was!), and he was going to be some salivating nut job, but his thinking and mine are close, if not entirely parallel, on a number of key issues. I'll just take these two from his RationalWiki:-
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Joseph argues that many of the mainstream scientific positions that he rejects, including abiogenesis and the Big Bang are actually religion masquerading as science.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I agree with him 100 percent about abiogenesis, because abiogenesis is not science. There is literally nothing scientific about it. The way that science works is that you conduct experiments and then base your conclusions on those experiments. In the case of abiogenesis, science has done it the other way around. It has concluded that life originated on Earth and conducted experiments to try to prove those conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree with him about the Big Bang, unless of course he is saying it isn't the complete picture, which even most physicists would agree is true. The Wiki quote might in fact be a little bit out of date, because the Big Bang is no longer the mainstream theory. Rather, Inflationary Theory has superseded it, because the evidence shows that in its infancy, the universe was much bigger than it should have been. Now, of course, he is right that scientists are once again making assumptions (in this case "plugging holes" in a duff theory), but the fact that space is expanding means that it must have been much closer together in the distant past. This is the evidential basis on which the Big Bang sustains itself. What be believe presently might not be entirely true, but for me that one fact convinces me that we are at least on the right track.

       The Big Bang is complete and total nonsense debunked in total by quantum mechanics in an accurate description of the redshift phenomenon as a photonic quantum event resulting from the variability of the dielectric constant as light moves through space plasma. This effect has been described best by Dr. Ari Brynjoflsson, a top government scientist assigned to many classified military projects and the world's foremost expert on radiation and quantum mechanics and the inventor of modern magnetometers. He was a protege of Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi and his laboratory tested and proven descriptions of spectral line shifting quantum photonics is beyond contention. He is now deceased.

       Plus, Plasma Cosmology proves Big Bang is nothing but a big fraud.

       No, you're talking about the Doppler Effect, and it is quite real. The Doppler Effect proves the expansion of space.

       No, sorry, it doesn't. Do you want to take the red pill or the blue pill? Ari Brynjolsson's Plasma Redshift effect is beyond contention. It has been proven in the laboratory and in countless Solar experiments. Your Doppler Effect isn't even rational when applied to Spectral Line Shifting. Doppler and Spectral Line Shifts are two completely different wave distortions. It's unit of measure is the photon and therefore is the realm of quantum photonics, not cosmology. The Spectral Image is an expanding spherical wave front of a Plane Wave. It can not be shifted by means of Doppler.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be quite easy for a "quantum head" to comprehend the photonic nature of redshift. It is not the garbage that some Catholic monk wants you to think. Enrico Fermi and Niels Bohr had it right - Georges Lematre was a fraud, and so are all of the other religion pandering frauds lined up behind him. Real science supports Plasma  Cosmology and Ari Brynjolfsson.

       They aren't even the same types of redshift. Redshift is a spectral shift of the absorption lines. Light is an electromagnetic phenomenon and it follows and is dominated by electromagnetic rules. It doesn't care about the expansion of space. The spectral lines are an electrical distortion pattern created by the electrical influences on the atomic level. Like an electrical interference pattern, they can be adjusted by altering ionic nature of the atom. This field of physics is known as Ionic Spectroscopy or Plasma Spectroscopy. These fields of standardised physics taught at the graduate level prove Big Bang is a myth quite easily. Redshift and Blue Shift can be controlled through Electron Spectroscopy and are done so on a daily basis. Imagine your relativistic electron shell extended millions of lights years over the electron plasma space environment. That is a virtual Ion with a massive electron shell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sun has a Redshift. Various Quasars and "laser stars" show relative motion across the Milky Way that would imply velocities of many times the speed of light if they were at their Doppler implied distances. Face it kid, your cosmological paradigm had been built on a myth. I know, I was once where you are now. I got my degree in physics and mainstream science is nothing more than a joke and a propaganda front for funding from creation obsessed masses.

       So there are two types of redshift. One which proves the universe is expanding, and one which proves that it isn't? Gotcha.

        They aren't even the same types of wave man. The "spectral image" is a Plane Wave made in distinct quantum events. It's a wavefront.Do you understand? A quantized event - a Plane wave. Do you understand the difference between the plane wave which the Spectral Image is, and the stretchy rope that you are mistakenly believing represents light?

      <p>
       With respect, since you do not seem to understand this basic fact, please permit me to point out that colour is an electromagnetic phenomenon which occurs because certain materials absorb different parts of the light spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are doing is throwing a bunch of complicated words at me which don't actually mean anything. You are unable to explain what you mean in simple terms because:-
      </p>
      <p>
       A) You do not understand it.
B) You are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as simple as that, really. The terms "redshift" and "blueshift" simply refer to the fact that the human retina absorbs a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum dependent upon whether a distant wave is moving towards or away from us. The point is that, since the evidence comes from the human retina, something which senses only electromagnetic radiation, then it's fucking concrete that redshift is an electromagnetic phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       In future, might I politely suggest you stick to the subjects you understand? Thanks.

       You're being intentionally obtuse. Plasma Redshift is a laboratory proven fact. The ability for Doppler to create a spectral line shift has never been demonstrated in the laboratory.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, electron plasma, such as that which can be found on laboratories here on Earth, in the atmosphere of the Sun, interstellar and intergalactic environments; have been proven to shift spectral lines in the same fashion as observed in stellar spectra.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple case of supporting evidence:
       <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402608000089">
        Laboratory Proof
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The one test which claims to have shown evidence of spectral line shifts due to doppler, can actually be proven to be attributed to Plasma Redshift. World renown award winning quantum physicist, Dr. Ari Brynjolfsson addresses virtually every argument supposedly in favor of Big Bang Creationism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some works of Brynjolfsson's can be found below, in which the false doppler interpretation is replaced with the correct laboratory verified Electron Plasma interpretation:

       Not just the writings of Bohr and Fermi, as mentioned earlier; but even the writings of Fritz Zwicky,

        On the redshift of spectral lines through interstellar space
       </a>
       , all predict and support the possibility of the electron plasma mechanism that would later be perfected by Brynjolfsson. I have dozens of more references I could provide you with, the history of Big Bang Creationism is one of bumbling scientists admitting its falsity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such as this admission from none other than
       <strong>
        Edwin Hubble
       </strong>
       himself in his paper
       <a href="http://nimble.nimblebrain.net/hubblepaper.html">
        <em>
         The Problem of the Expanding Universe
        </em>
       </a>
       explaining that the expanding universe theory doesn't match observation unless ad-hoc fudge factors are added. In fact, we can even note how Hubble received funding for his research from religiously-biased individuals looking for proof of a universe created by God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only is there not a single piece of evidence in support of the expanding universe e.g. Inflation model, every purported claim of evidence can be easily refuted. Big Bang Creationist claims have all been successfully refuted by many modern scientists such as those in the video
       <em>
        Universe: Cosmology Quest
       </em>
       -
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFFl9S39CTM">
        Part I
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb_EWnXCu2w">
        Part II
       </a>
       . They've also been successfully refuted by other world renown scientists such as Halton Arp and Anthony Peratt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even touching on the research of Halton Arp, let's take as another example the plethora of "
       <em>
        faster-than-light
       </em>
       " quasars in our own Milky Way Galaxy like TON202.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, Big Bang Creationism is one of the single most useful litmus tests in exposing credible &amp; non-credible individuals. You don't have a leg to stand on kid. Better call on your backup to help you out, you're obviously out of your depth.

       His views on evolution startled me at first. First it sounded like he was denying it, but when I read deeper he just thinks Darwinian Evolution is wrong (i.e. that it is based entirely upon natural selection). I think that he might very well be in the right ball park with the idea that life is evolving
       <em>
        towards
       </em>
       something, and that whatever it is, it is already pre-programmed. The reason I believe this could be true is because science can't explain the origins of the genetic code. A code is essentially a mathematical key used to share information between specific recipients (i.e. cells, in this instance), and it does raise the question whether a code can even exist before the intent to communicate creates it (i.e. intelligence). Certainly, there are no other known examples of a naturally-occurring code, so there is that too.

       I agree with this abundantly. Humanity has a tendency to overcompensate when it finally overthrows oppression, and this can be witnessed in the emergence of atheist "preachers" like Dawkins. The fact is that, if you want to remain within the domain of reason, you have to go agnostic. Evolution doesn't disprove God. You could just as easily argue that it proves him, and he put it there on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Dawkins isn't right about a lot of stuff, btw. But he does have a tendency to go over the top sometimes.

       it is a theory based on available evidence, which is how science is done. Much science is done through formulating a theory and then using experimental research to prove or disprove that. If you have evidential proof that abiogenesis is impossible I'd like to see it.

       I hear you, except that experiments that fail are not the same as disproving a theory. I think you are probably right, but that still leaves the door open for someone finally figuring out the right cocktail of things that do result in spontaneous genesis.

       Not at all, but you began today by calling me a bumbling idiot because
       <em>
        you

       don't understand that spinning gravitational fields cause magnetism. You interpret gravitational magnetism as a "dipole" force which spits people into space. Not gonna lie: it irked me a bit.

        This poorly exposed and tested consequence, gravitomagnetism, refers to the field that is supposedly created when a massive body rotates rapidly. Gravitomagnetism is misleadingly named - it is not magnetic - the force created emerges from gravity, not electromagnetism. But it is called gravitomagnetism because of the mathematical similarity between the equations that describe this effect and the creation of a magnetic field. In the same way that a magnetic field is created when a charged object rotates, a gravitomagnetic field is created when a massive body rotates.

       Lol. You

       understand the concept of anti-gravity. In Einstein's equations, both mass and pressure contribute to a gravitational field. In theory, it is possible for a planetary body to exert so much negative pressure that gravity is forced to blow instead of suck. This is what anti-gravity is. It has nothing to do with the idiotic shit you keep rambling on about.

       If Earth was getting bombarded with life spores as well as comets, meteors, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, it could explain how life was able to take a grip. What makes zero sense is the assumption that life just decided to "pop up" in that hellish environment.

       Not for sure, true. But what can be proven for sure? All I'm really trying to do is let people know that abiogenesis has no current evidential basis to support it, and it is the only one of the top few theories which has been reasonably tested. At some point, after so many failed experiments, after so many failed attempts to animate chemicals into organic matter, you have to begin thinking that maybe you're on the wrong track.

        They aren't even the same types of redshift. Redshift is a spectral shift of the absorption lines. Light is an electromagnetic phenomenon and it follows and is dominated by electromagnetic rules.

       So there are two types of redshift. One which proves the universe is expanding, and one which proves that it isn't? Gotcha.

        They aren't even the same types of wave man. The "spectral image" is a Plane Wave made in distinct quantum events. It's a wavefront.Do you understand? A quantized event - a Plane wave. Do you understand the difference between the plane wave which the Spectral Image is, and the stretchy rope that you are mistakenly believing represents light?

       With respect, since you do not seem to understand this basic fact, please permit me to point out that colour is an electromagnetic phenomenon which occurs because certain materials absorb different parts of the light spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are doing is throwing a bunch of complicated words at me which don't actually mean anything. You are unable to explain what you mean in simple terms because:-
      </p>
      <p>
       A) You do not understand it.
B) You are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as simple as that, really. The terms "redshift" and "blueshift" simply refer to the fact that the human retina absorbs a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum dependent upon whether a distant wave is moving towards or away from us. The point is that, since the evidence comes from the human retina, something which senses only electromagnetic radiation, then it's fucking concrete that redshift is an electromagnetic phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       In future, might I politely suggest you stick to the subjects you understand? Thanks.

       I thought I just explained that you haven't made any argument. You've just rambled sheer nonsense without any logical point holding any of it together.
