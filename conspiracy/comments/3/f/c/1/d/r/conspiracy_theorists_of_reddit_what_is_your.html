    <div class="md"><p>Yep. And not given to sick or immunocompromised children! If the child is sick, postpone it and don&#39;t charge the parent for the second visit. If vaccination is so important, do it right. And stop gaslighting parents whose kids have had adverse reactions instead of investigating and figuring out how we can stop it. </p>

<p>There are simple ways to make them safer, but we&#39;re so stupid as a culture that we can&#39;t openly talk about them for fear of having to actually fix a problem that might require reducing a pharma exec&#39;s fat paycheck by a tiny little speck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The war-horse of the medical tyranny crowd is polio</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So it is a fact of history that the numbers dropped precipitously before the Salk vaccine was widely distributed. Now, let’s start with 1954 when medical researcher and virologist Salk actually came up with his inactivated injectable polio vaccine. That same year, the government redefined polio.
<a href="http://www.thevaccinereaction.org/2015/06/the-salk-miracle-myth/">http://www.thevaccinereaction.org/2015/06/the-salk-miracle-myth/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That being said the elite are obsessed with organic food and purity, and unsurprisingly there&#39;s two classes of vaccines.  Super pure ones for the elite and sterilization / autism / alzheimers for the rest of us - it was a big scandal in Germany when this was reported.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Spiegel Online is reporting that German Chancellor Angela Merkel and government ministers will receive a special, additive-free H1N1 vaccine. “The Vakzin [vaccine] does not contain disputed additives — contrary to the vaccine for the remainder of the population,” reports the newspaper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also vaccines have this special protection in law where if they hurt / kill you - you can&#39;t sue the manufacturer in the courts, so they go to &quot;Vaccine court&quot;. And even though its frequently called a kangaroo court -- they do acknowledge injury from vaccines and pay out  $250,000 if your child is killed from a vaccine.</p>

<p>My mom knew a boy who got autism from vaccines, but she helped him detox with the Son-Rise project and was cured of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I call bullshit on the vaccination crusaders. I used to know a nice old lady who was fucking adamant about it, to the point that she did independent journalism regarding it. I never dared argue with her, but I don&#39;t buy into it myself.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong. I see the danger in letting the state inject you with shit you don&#39;t know the first thing about. I actually think there might be terrible problems with this in the future, once society starts to wise up to the way things work. Right now though, I think they&#39;re worth the perceived risk. I&#39;ve been vaccinated against polio and smallpox and I never had any adverse effects.</p>

<p>Though a guy in my class did get jaundice straight after he was vaccinated, in fairness.</p>

<p>Well, I&#39;d say that accusing a government of poisoning/infecting its own citizens is a massive claim. That&#39;s not necessarily to say that it isn&#39;t true (proven I believe, that various Filipinos were infected with syphilis by the US), but I am going to need to see massive evidence before I believe it.</p>

<p>It would seem more plausible to me that if there were a conspiracy they would do the reverse, and withhold a vaccine in order to keep selling people medicine.</p>
