        QUOTES OPPOSING TPP:

       "Let's be clear: the TPP is much more than a "free trade" agreement. It is part of a global race to the bottom to boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street by outsourcing jobs; undercutting worker" - Bernie Sanders (See Link Above)

       “I’m opposed to it. We shouldn’t be in a race to the bottom for the cheapest labor in the world.  That diminishes us as a people and it hurts our economy. ” - Martin O'Malley (See Link Above)

       "The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business...this is a bad deal." -Donald Trump (See Link Above)
      </p>
      <p>
       "I did not vote for NAFTA...I reserve the right to desist, to make sure we are negotiating deals that remain in the best interest of our American workers and our country...that’s what bothers me about this trade deal. We are trusting someone who is not worthy of trust."
-Rick Santorum (See Link Above)
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think free trade is a wonderful thing, but I think it needs to be done the right way. We are a republic, and that means that the people are in charge through their representatives, and the president is only one person. And I think we need to have much more input. These are very important agreements that need to be made."
-Ben Carson (See Link Above)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nobody has seen this trade pact except for a few that go into the secret room. Most of the senators who are pushing it haven't even read it," he said. "And it's very likely to turn a lot of power over to some multinational body that is not answerable to the United States taxpayers."

       they still don't like the exposure people like Trump and RP get when they run for president and people go see them speak and vote from them.  You don't just shut up and put your head down and let them do what they want. Do you think "the establishment" is happy about Trump owning Anderson Cooper and saying (refering to bush and lobbists) "My lobbyists could make a politcian jump off this railing.  They're totally telling him what to do, like a little puppett, and the same with hillary and the same with all the rest.  Like, the CIA recruited that guy out of college to prevent this sort of thing from happening (and b/c he's a Vanderbilt).  What the video, Anderson visibly cringes when Trump says

       As one who voted for Gary Johnson after Obama-puppet Romney displaced Ron Paul, I know if 3% would vote against the evil duopolists supporting the Bush crime family's latest Mitrack O'Bomney in 2016, a real impact on America from supporting "people who have zero fucking chance" could happen.  People who want to vote for the winner have long been giving voting a bad name.

       The more I think about it the more I realize that not everything and everyone are under control of TPTB. 
Sure, they have incredible leverage and can make nearly anything manifest to their will, but they do not control everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wholeheartedly believe there are some individuals in politics that are not under TPTB Dominion.
      </p>
      <p>
       They cannot write things into existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys done give yourself enough credit. 
We have willpower, some of these candidates have willpower too. 
So yeah, TPTB have pretty much chosen all the presidents but I believe it's plain to see, and quite obvious, that not everything is going according to their plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are becoming more and more aware everyday. Sometimes it's the programs TPTB produce (mass media, cultural trends etc.) that wake people up. All it takes is reason to see wtf is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can do this, guys and gals. We still have a fighting chance.

       Ur kinda weird bro 382,000 link karma in ten months?  Of course you support TPP and start a comment with "Lol" and reduce the debate surrounding TPP to "labor protectionism arguments."  You  don't want America to exist, you want multinationals to pay "brown people" to make all our shit for $2 a day and destroy wages and any hope for a middle class. lol good for your, that is the ideal world according to

       TPP isn't just about trade at all; but you aren't concerned with that I guess it doesn't fit your narrative.
