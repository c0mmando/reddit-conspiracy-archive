But I really feel we need to draw the line somewhere. By undergoing surgery they aren&#39;t actually changing their sex. I will always see them as their original sex. Bruce Jenner to me is still as manly as ever. Moreover, i feel that this is completely manufactured and allowed to happen by the US govt. It is going to set a bad precedent for the future generations. Anyone else feel this way?</p>

<p>As for why transgender-ism is NOT a mental disorder, I&#39;ll let professionals explain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The American Psychological Association (2011) explains that a “psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.”</p>

<p>Are you serious right now? Some one&#39;s identity. I identify as a black female (I&#39;m white and male), should a parent/society allow me to pursue this? Is it cool for me to do this, or would you say I need to seek mental health?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A child is neutral up until puberty. You are a sick fucking person if you do/allow this for a child. If they feel this way after puberty, fine. But to allow a child to do this, imo, is neglect. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling</p>

<p>Then what is all this gender dysphoria? From what I understand people become extremely depressed and withdrawn while experiencing &quot;dysphoria&quot;. </p>

<p>That is impossible! People will always have an opinion that may offend someone. That doesn&#39;t mean that they are not allowed to say it. That&#39;s what freedom of speech is.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Truth is not racist, prejudice, or bigoted. The truth is the truth. If a call a tranny mentally ill that may offend them, but does calling a schizophrenic mentally ill offend them, also?</p>

<p>Nobody thinks that surgery can change chromosomes. But SRS can change your sex, aka your genitals. And for what it&#39;s worth, you yourself might have XX, XY, XXY, XXXX chromosomes and not even know it. Chromosomal disorders are more common than transgender people are. Do you consider a cisgender man with XX chromosomes to be a woman because of his karyotype? Have you had yourself tested in case you&#39;re actually intersex? I doubt it. Chromosomes are important but they&#39;re not everything. For instance, even in the absence of a Y chromosome, XX-chromosomed trans men are able to experience facial hair growth and deepened voices as a result of hormone replacement therapy. Not all genetic information relating to sex is contained on those two chromosomes. Once again, I have to wonder how informed you actually are on this topic. I doubt you have a medical degree of your own and I doubt you&#39;ve done any significant research into this topic. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not glorified... it is plastic surgery. Nobody in the universe has ever denied that. You&#39;re arguing against a person who does not even exist. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So if you REALLY actually cared for these people, you would support healing their BRAIN - the cause of the problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s been tried and it doesn&#39;t work. Conversion therapy causes suicide rates to skyrocket and doesn&#39;t prevent gender dysphoria. Treating the body, on the other hand, through hormone replacement therapy and occasionally through surgery IS effective and does reduce suicide rates, life dissatisfaction and the manifestation of gender dysphoria. This is scientific fact, it&#39;s the agreed consensus of the greater medical community. Everybody who is informed on this topic disagrees with you. You&#39;re just wrong. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But no one even suggests that, now do they? </p>

<p>They do, every day. I literally get told exactly word for word that by the same idiots every day. But again, none of them have medical degrees, and none of them have even bothered to read the wikipedia page of the word &quot;transgender&quot;. Why on earth should I listen to them? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you at the least admit the dysfunction is in the brain, not the genitals?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a case study that proves this wrong. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer">David Reimer</a> was a cisgender man (a man born with male genitals and male chromosomes) who, due to a botched circumcision, was given a vaginoplasty and raised as female. Now, according to you, his brain would not be flawed, and thus he would not be transgender; he should have been happy to live as a woman. However, he showed all of the same symptoms as transgender people do throughout his life, until he decided to change his name (to David) and transition to male. I think you&#39;ll agree that the problem here was his body, not his brain. This is exactly the same situation that transgender people are in. Although we&#39;re given the wrong genitals earlier than Mr Reimer was, his case proves that we cannot be &quot;mentally ill&quot; because someone who would otherwise have lived a normal, mental illness-free life was able to become &quot;transgender&quot; through the manipulation of his physical body alone. Essentially, you don&#39;t need to touch the brain to make someone trans, just the body . Because our brains are normal. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or do you think that people&#39;s &quot;identity&quot; i.e., thoughts, come from the penis or vagina?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course I don&#39;t think this. I think that people&#39;s identity is in the brain, and that thus when the brain declares something about identity, it&#39;s right. You seem to think that just because the genitals disagree, the brain must be wrong; essentially you think that the genitals are better judges of someone&#39;s mental identity than the brain is. </p>

<p>The body is a vehicle. You can cut off an arm and the person, though wounded, is still the same. You can give them a tattoo and they&#39;re the same person. But mess with the brain and you&#39;ve changed their identity. That&#39;s why conversion therapy is so unethical; horrific though it may be, being transgender is a part of my identity and self-determination. It&#39;s given me life experiences I would have missed out on without it. Changing that part of me would change who I am into a different person. That&#39;s something no amount of surgery can do. </p>

<p>They DID change his sex. They failed to change his GENDER IDENTITY. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction">They&#39;re two different things</a>, and we don&#39;t need to change our genders, gender is decided by the brain so that&#39;s the part we don&#39;t want to change. Honestly, you&#39;re trying hard, but you really just seem very very uninformed. It&#39;s nice that you&#39;re being at least polite to me, unlike some people, but I wish you&#39;d do a little more research on the topic before trying to debate about it, just like how I don&#39;t debate with the CEO of Guiness on brewing techniques. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>David Reimer&#39;s brain thought &quot;male&quot; but he had a female body. The problem, as you just agreed, was with the body in his case. Why are you contradicting yourself? Consider David a &quot;control&quot; experiment. If, by changing the body of someone with no mental illness, you&#39;re able to replicate the circumstances in which a transgender person is &quot;created&quot;, then you prove that transgender people can be created solely as a result of a flawed body, even in the absence of a flawed mind!</p>

<p>In any case though I think you&#39;re missing the point. This isn&#39;t an argument of which of the two, body or mind, is right or wrong. If I had been born in a female body, then my female mind would have been happy. If a man had been born into my male body, he would have been happy. Neither are inherantly flawed, they&#39;re <strong>just mismatched</strong>. The round peg and the square hole are both fine individually, they just don&#39;t fit together!</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter whose FAULT it is. I can try to explain what being transgender is like to you until the sun implodes, but ultimately the only facts that matter are these:</p>

<p>-There is a problem: mind and body don&#39;t match.</p>

<p>-Changing the mind to match the body doesn&#39;t work and raises suicide rates.</p>

<p>-Changing the body to match the mind does work and lower suicide rates.</p>

<p>Why do you keep arguing against hormone treatments that work? You sound like the one who doesn&#39;t want to &quot;heal sick people&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly this is just something I can&#39;t really explain to you if you&#39;re not trans. For you, your mind and body match, so there&#39;s no &quot;seam&quot;, no separation, no difference. You can just see yourself as one being.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re trans, everything about your body feels wrong. Not because it&#39;s broken, but because it&#39;s not the right one for you. Square peg, round hole. You don&#39;t need a brain scan because you just know.</p>

<p>I like to compare it to keyboards. I learnt to type on an azerty keyboard. When I type, I don&#39;t have to think about the keyboard, the buttons, the &quot;body&quot;; my fingers know what to press and where to spell each word. The keyboard is just an extension of myself. But if I have to use a Qwerty? ugh, it&#39;s just awful. Sure, some letters don&#39;t move, and a lot of the big stuff, like the space bar, are the same. But when something&#39;s off it&#39;s just atrocious. I can&#39;t write anything with an English keyboard because it&#39;s all wrong. And when I&#39;m writing on an English keyboard, I&#39;m able to tell that the reason I hate it is because I expect a French keyboard beneath my fingers. </p>

<p>Now, the analogy is flawed. Typing is learned, and can be relearned. But as conversion therapy&#39;s failure has shown, you can&#39;t learn how to not be trans. It doesn&#39;t work. What you can do is give them hormones, change around some of the keybindings and move a few letters around. Sure, <strong><em>technically</em></strong> it&#39;s never going to be a &quot;TRUE&quot; french keyboard; it&#39;s just an English keyboard with z and w swapped and some fancy code modifications. But it allows me to type.</p>

<p>The ultimate proof that I&#39;m &quot;right&quot; is simply the success of my treatment method (hormone replacement therapy). Those that disagree with me support a treatment that raises suicide levels and does nothing to alleviate dysphoria, whereas mine allows those that suffer from dysphoria to live the semblance of a normal life, albeit one marred by the protests of the uneducated and the bigoted. For whatever reason, people take personal offense at the idea of somebody not being how they seem on the outside. Whether it stems from jealousy, religion, homophobia or fear of the unknown I can&#39;t say. All I want is people to stop treating me like shit. </p>

<p>Can you explain to me how others treat you badly? I am interested in that as well, if you would like to share.</p>

<p>Oh and is it possible that there might be a cause that could be making you think and feel these things and that maybe this should be addressed, instead of things like hormones and surgery?</p>

<p>Thanks for explaining to me! I&#39;m sorry that you feel the way you do though. And I hope that you are able to find peace and happiness. </p>

<p>Sorry for asking so many questions!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to have a broken body. I mean, dysphoria can manifest itself in extreme cases as self-mutilation (some trans women attempt to castrate themselves for instance) but that&#39;s not typical and is usually just a targeted form of the self-harm / suicide brought on by depression. </p>

<p>On the whole, though, I&#39;m aware that my body is technically functional. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the right one for me. I&#39;m trans because my brain is expecting a female body, and an autopsy would support this. The differences between the two genders and the differences between the disabled and the able-bodied are just so unrelated that it&#39;s silly to compare them. </p>

<p>Someone with BID would be trying to rip the keys out of their keyboard. I don&#39;t want to break my keyboard, I want to swap it out for a new one that&#39;s better suited to my needs. As a rule trans people are fairly rational and aware of what causes our desire to transition. I don&#39;t suffer from BID so I can&#39;t explain too well what I mean to you, but think of it this way. Doctors aren&#39;t idiots. They know what they&#39;re doing. And they know that BID and gender dysphoria are innately different. They have different causes, different symptoms, and different treatments. They only appear remotely similar to laymen.</p>

<p>Consider the case of David Reimer. He was a cis man, and thus had a male brain, male sex organs, male chromosomes etc. If being transgender was a mental illness, he wouldn&#39;t have it. And yet, when a failed circumcision led to a vaginoplasty and his parents raising him as female, he exhibited all of the same symptoms as a transgender child. In adulthood he even attempted to transition to male, but sadly I think the news of his past led him to suicide once he found out.</p>

<p>Now, if the brain had no role in the self-determination of gender, then after being raised as female with a female body, David would have identified as female. But instead, because of his male brain, he recognised that his body was wrong for him. This proves that gender dysphoria is not caused by a flaw in the brain but by a mismatch between the mind&#39;s gender identity, which is fixed at birth and can never be changed, and the physical manifestations of one&#39;s sex.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain to me how others treat you badly? I am interested in that as well, if you would like to share.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to spend a decent amount of my life simply justifying my own existence. Many people, though not ill-meaning and simply uninformed, seem to think they know better than the medical professionals that I work with for my transition. Most of them haven&#39;t even read the wikipedia page on transgender people and still believe that I&#39;m a &quot;freak&quot;. If I were to go outside presenting as female (the gender I identify with) then I would be called a &quot;tranny he-she&quot;, which means that for the time being I have to crossdress by wearing male clothes and pretend to be a man every day. If in the distant future my life was in a situation where I wanted to date others, I&#39;d be in the dangerous position of having to reveal my genitals to complete strangers. Many men and women have violent reactions upon learning that the person they&#39;re attracted to &quot;used to be a man&quot; or &quot;is secretly a man&quot;. If you wait any longer to make sure they&#39;re not a murderer or a sociopath you just open yourself up to claims that you &quot;led them along&quot;, which can worsen their reaction. Trans women have an average lifespan of 32 years because of suicide and anti-trans violence. 42 percent at the age of 20 have attempted suicide before, bearing in mind that those that succeeded didn&#39;t survive to enter the poll. We&#39;ve got nearly double the unemployment rates of the average population because it&#39;s legal to fire someone for being trans. And of course we get people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> accusing us of trying to &quot;recruit&quot; children through brainwashing. Yeah, sure. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh and is it possible that there might be a cause that could be making you think and feel these things and that maybe this should be addressed, instead of things like hormones and surgery?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cause is the mismatch between mind and body. My brain is fine and my body is fine, but they don&#39;t fit together. There&#39;s no &quot;mental cause&quot;, i&#39;m not mentally ill because I&#39;m trans, there&#39;s nothing to fix. Round peg, square hole. Instead of hacking away at the peg to make it square, why not just find a round hole for it? </p>

<p>In the end, it doesn&#39;t matter at all whose FAULT it is. I can try to explain what being transgender is like to you until the sun implodes, but ultimately the only facts that matter are these:</p>

<p>-There is a problem: mind and body don&#39;t match.</p>

<p>-Changing the mind to match the body (conversion therapy) doesn&#39;t work and raises suicide rates. Example case: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Leelah_Alcorn">Leelah Alcorn</a>. It&#39;s not only a waste of time and money, it&#39;s also barbaric. There is no cure to the brain because the brain isn&#39;t flawed. What else are you suggesting, lobotomies?</p>

<p>-Changing the body to match the mind (Hormone therapy) does work and lower suicide rates. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand tbh why you&#39;re trying to argue against a cure that so obviously works. Its success is supported by countless studies and polls. It&#39;s the scientifically accepted treatment the world over, and yet random people on the internet with no medical degree think they know better.</p>

<p>Do you have any studies you can show me that support conversion therapy and show flaws in hormone therapy? Because I&#39;ve never seen one that was reputable. I really think if you&#39;re going to keep arguing this stance you should try to back it up instead of attempting to debate around an illness you obviously don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m sorry, I know I&#39;m being rude, but it&#39;s just frustrating having to explain this every day of my life. I&#39;ve had a pretty rough day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on there! lol. I was reading and then had to stop at lobotomies. I think it&#39;s possible that it is being approached all wrong, just like most things in our society. I think there just needs to be more discussion and understanding. Then maybe we could get a different perspective on it in order to find a solution that is not as harsh as surgeries or hormones and other chemicals. </p>

<p>I find it interesting that you assume that I would want these terrifying treatments when what I really want is something that is less damaging and with less risks. You might consider surgery and hormones as solutions, but I feel that they can just make it more difficult to find a cause and it possibly brings with it a lot of negative side-effects while causing more confusion than solving anything.</p>

<p>If you do not feel the same way as those with body identity integrity disorder in the way that you see the disconnect from your body and mind, then it just seems like you are unhappy or unsatisfied with the body parts that you have. Is this correct? </p>

<p>Nobody wants to age either, but is everyone going to think that stopping aging or death with technology or pills is a good idea? Nope. I&#39;ll be the one that wants to stay with what is natural, along with many others. I might eat more vegetables and fruits, drink more water, exercise, get more sleep, and lower my stress and exposure to carcinogens, but that&#39;s pretty much it. Aging and death is natural. I might not like it, but I&#39;m going to go with it and try my best to accept it.</p>

<p>I feel that what is going on is a toxin/societal issue. And could possibly be a very strong toxin/chemical issue if you are younger. They are finding that babies are being exposed to more and more chemicals even in the womb. Then if you were given crap formula, add that to it. Then add that to the increasing amount of vaccines that are administered. Then add that to all the artificial, chemical-laden, GMO crap that most of us eat now. Then add that to all the carcinogens in the air and in the water.</p>

<p>When it comes to society, it doesn&#39;t really make us feel satisfied with how we are born. They always want us to wear this, be like this, do this, look like this, or buy this in order to be happy. I think very few people are truly satisfied with the way that they look and the way that they are. Especially at a younger age, this is almost always true.</p>

<p>No I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s a cure. It might work for you, but I&#39;ve heard and read a lot to know that it doesn&#39;t work for everyone. And I think it&#39;s especially cruel to let it happen to kids. Stopping puberty with hormones should not even be an option and I think it&#39;s completely insane. You might trust western medicine/AMA, but for allowing this alone, makes it really hard for me to trust them at all. However, there are plenty of other reasons that I have for not trusting them, but we won&#39;t go into that today.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what a reputable source is to you, I am one that will pay attention to personal stories, keep them in mind, and then compare that to the sources. With personal stories I have more of a connection emotionally, but it also depends on how sincere and genuine the person is. Usually, when it comes to an individual that is telling their own personal stories, there is no agenda, but nowadays on the internet, it&#39;s not the case with all the shills coming in, but I feel pretty confident in my ability to gauge a person&#39;s integrity and honesty. I would just go research sex change regret or transgender regret reversals. You can choose to see both sides or only one side, but just like many other topics, each side will say the other side is wrong and will usually debunk each other. Though you have to be even more aware with this topic considering that this is the new idea that is being currently whored.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to show you any studies. As soon as I am asked for studies, I feel suspicious to be honest. Especially, when all I did was ask you some questions. I am mostly just trying to understand you. I have my own opinion and you have yours. I&#39;m not trying to prove you wrong or anything. I just want the right, safest, and the most intelligent thing to be done, instead of just rushing into what they feel is the quick fix.</p>

<p>This is everything I said to you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain to me how a female or male mind would be described?<br/>
Are they getting brain scans before they learn that their mind does not match?<br/>
I guess I&#39;m wondering how would they know that they have the opposite gender&#39;s mind? How would it be defined by someone?<br/>
Okay, this sounds really familiar! Many similarities if you do some research on it.

<p>I don&#39;t really consider those things as debating. I was asking you questions.
So saying something like the following was really unfair to me and honestly I have the right to debate on anything I care about in any way that I want.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really think if you&#39;re going to keep arguing this stance you should try to back it up instead of attempting to debate around an illness you obviously don&#39;t understand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless, it&#39;s okay. I understand that you probably just feel like you are being attacked whenever speaking about this topic, even though that&#39;s not the reality of the situation. You didn&#39;t have to explain if it was going to make you feel worse and I&#39;m sorry I stressed you out. I hope you feel better and you don&#39;t have to worry about responding because I&#39;ll understand.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I believe an adult should be able to do with their body and money whatever they wish so long as it doesn&#39;t infringe the lives and liberties of others.  This includes unnecessary plastic surgery for aesthetics.  However, a doctor prescribing such elective cosmetic surgery as a solution to a mental problem is pure malpractice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is how I feel. The kids are innocent in all this and I just want them to be protected from all this madness. </p>

<p>I agree with you that if adults want to make the decision in dramatically altering their appearance with surgery or their natural bodily processes with chemicals because they are unhappy with it, they should be able to, but if they are confusing the kids into making these decisions, it drives me insane. Although with adults making these decisions, it still affects me because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good or healthy for them, but I won&#39;t protest it too much since that&#39;s what they really want.</p>

<p>Yea, I&#39;m still in disbelief of how doctors will even prescribe these things and that it&#39;s become acceptable to offer these solutions to kids especially. I agree that it is malpractice! </p>

<p>Notice how content-free this person&#39;s post is.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no fact, no logic, no argument.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a long drawn out way of name-calling. I especially like the reference to &quot;fucking young Earth creationist.&quot;</p>

<p>You see, for progressives - who have a completely unscientific munderstanding of virtually everything: race, sex, economics, biology - their &quot;best enemies&quot; are Kansas fundamentalists that believe in &quot;biblical creationism.&quot;</p>

<p>So these progressives pretend that everyone who doesn&#39;t believe in whatever their cause-du-jour is is some sort of religious nut.</p>

<p>Of course, they believe completely unscientific things. That the physical brain has no influence on IQ, that all ethnic groups evolved in exactly the same way with exactly the same cognition regardless of environment. That sex and race are all &quot;social constructs&quot; and have nothing to do with biology.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they are called &quot;liberal creationists&quot; because their ideas are just as absurd and non-scientific as those of the Kansas fundamentalists that want to put &quot;evolution is only a theory&quot; on Biology textbooks.</p>

<p>Transsexualism is a disorder of the brain. That&#39;s why a perfectly functional body, male or female, feels &quot;wrong&quot; - because of a brain disorder.</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, it&#39;s very similar to the disorder where someone feels like a perfectly functioning arm or leg &quot;doesn&#39;t belong&quot; to their body. This disorder, like transsexualism, often leads to self-mutilation.</p>

<p>The problem is in the organ of the brain - not in their limbs - or their genitals.</p>

<p>Of course, &quot;progressives&quot; don&#39;t give a shit about these people. &quot;Progressives&quot; love a good freak show. They love to pose as somehow &quot;tolerant&quot; while mentally ill people get mutilated by unethical doctors. If you object to this completely inhuman and unethical butchery of people with serious mental illness, that makes you ...</p>

<p>... I don&#39;t know, what is their boogey man du jour? &quot;Reactionary.&quot; &quot;Intolerant.&quot; &quot;Conservative.&quot; Etc.</p>

<p>You just contradicted yourself a third time. If gender identity is a social construct, why did David Reimer want to transition to male? He was socialised as female, shouldn&#39;t he have become a woman? </p>

<p>Gender ROLES are a social construct; one that you seem to support, given your post history which includes such gems as &quot;Why women shouldn&#39;t vote&quot; and &quot;How to date women 10 years younger than you&quot;. </p>

<p>This happens, but it&#39;s very very rare. A tiny tiny percentage of transgender people detransition. And just so you know, you&#39;re still showing your ignorance. Once again you seem to think that all that&#39;s involved in transition is surgery. Please, for the love of god, do some damn research! You&#39;re so hopelessly uninformed, it&#39;s really quite sad. It&#39;s almost like you enjoy your own lack of knowledge. How can you hope to have a debate or defend your point of view when you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about? But then, what should I expect from a redpiller... scientific rigour?</p>

<p>So now you&#39;re saying that the body doesn&#39;t decide gender, the mind does! You agree with me, and contradicted yourself a fourth time. Heh.</p>

<p>Look, you&#39;ve sort of become boring to talk to. At this point you&#39;re just spouting redpill pseudoscience and ignoring every argument I make in favour of repeating whatever moronic mantra it is that you&#39;ve been last inspired to add to your vocabulary. You&#39;ll never do any research and you&#39;ll never bother to think twice about your views. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re about 14 years old and just overcompensating for a late puberty, but on the offchance you&#39;re actually an adult and still hold these views I wish you the best of luck with your future endeavours. Maybe one day we can look back on this and laugh. In the mean time, try to think just a little longer every time someone disagrees with you. You might find they have something worth saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that no one wants to find a cure for these people&#39;s brains shows this isn&#39;t medicine - it&#39;s something else.</p>

<p>If this was about fixing a medical condition - they would try to fix the medical condition - not mutilate people&#39;s bodies.</p>

<p>There is a similar brain dysfunction that causes people to believe their limbs - arms, legs - don&#39;t really &quot;belong&quot; to them.</p>

<p>Is the cure for this condition to cut off people&#39;s arms and legs? Of course not - their arms and legs are fine. It&#39;s a brain condition.</p>

<p>But when it&#39;s a similar issue with thinking their penis or vagina doesn&#39;t &quot;belong&quot; - we pretend it&#39;s not a brain problem.</p>

<p>Why? Gender politics, apparently.</p>

<p>Yet, the same people call these people mentally ill:</p>

<ol>
<li>Schizophrenics</li>
<li>Delusional</li>
<li>Anorexic</li>

<p>...To just name a few. Aren&#39;t anorexic people considered mentally ill because they <em>perceive</em> their body larger than it actually is? Hence why they do what they do (starve themselves)... So if a person is staring into the mirror and thinking they should have female or male body parts, how is that any different than the delusions of an anorexic person? Right, because it&#39;s in their damn minds and it&#39;s the same thing. We treat these people, we don&#39;t call em heroes and we sure as shit do not encourage their delusions.</p>

<p>I do not think transpeople should be ridiculed and shunned from society. But, at least call it for what it is, a mental illness.</p>

<p>I said it is different because they have the choice of whether or not they physically change.  Also hating a part of your body =/= a mental disorder.  I dislike that I was born with a large nose, (which results in people calling me a Jew) does that mean I have a mental disorder? Think about it, there is literally no difference aside from the fact that transgender people want to change a particular organ that is used in reproduction/decides the gender that they are.  Transgender people don&#39;t think that perceive their body in a different way, they think that the inside of their body is different than the outside.  They don&#39;t look at themselves and think, &quot;I&#39;m the opposite gender&quot;.  That&#39;s just ignorance on your part if you think that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument sucks but you are solely basing it on physical change. The anorexic does not have the ability to un-see their delusions without help. Even with help, they could still see themselves that way and not starve themselves. Same thing with a transgender. Okay, they do not physically change themselves, but in their minds they are still seeing it. Same with an anorexic. Treatment doesn&#39;t cure an anorexic person from seeing delusions, what treatment does do, is help the person understand that, that&#39;s what it is, a delusion. It&#39;s not real, just in your head. Which helps them not starve themselves and could help a transgender person from chopping of their own dick and getting tits.</p>

<p>I know nothing about this subject, but are you saying that it&#39;s not considered to be any kind of disorder? If so, is that to say it&#39;s now considered to be absolutely natural and normal? (because that seems a little odd)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been to a crazy house before as my sister has severe autism, ocd and is schizophrenic. While you are correct that ALL don&#39;t cause bodily harm, alot of them do.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Anyone in the world can experience delusion, that&#39;s why I said what I said. Delusion is to general a thing to diagnose, someone can have a situation where they have delusion and 15 mins later never experience it again.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, you are not talking about self harm but I am, because my original point was that these are classified as MENTAL ILLNESSES.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Yes but if you know everyone has a dick and vagina, why don&#39;t you criticize every female for such a thing or every male? Could the ultimate answer boil down to simply because you are not sleeping with them, why do you care?</p>

<p>With robotics, there have been a lot of recent reports that people are being attacked for wearing tech like the Google glasses or trying to make robotic eyes. You can understand why allowing transgenders as the opening stepping stone to allow robotic tech to become the norm right? Otherwise those soldiers with limbs blown off aren&#39;t able to feel SAFE in a world where people think something out of the world is pretty much the end game, I can see it now Bill O&#39;Reilly, &quot;Cyborgs in your workplace, who are these people, and what they can do to you&quot;. </p>

<p>If transgenders and gays get more laws in place, it becomes a normal thing, it means it&#39;s not a big deal, people don&#39;t feel weird, hell people would actually tell some of the people they are sleeping with that they aren&#39;t what they appear and feel safe to be honest as to not make the other party make a mistake, although I will miss Jerry Springer. I won&#39;t even speak on the tax, insurance and credit scams that go unnoticed because their no real core aim for it.</p>

<p>I honestly think that most of the propaganda pushed to the masses is to enlighten them, basically to open their mind to new ideas, so many ideas that they people start to grab these ideas and use them or more of live off them. The idea of a different reality and that anything can change at any time. An idea of a war on ideas completely subjugated to change by whomever can grasp the meaning out of them. I feel that changes like this may seem silly or stupid but deep down, they are the most important changes that the world will ever see.</p>

<p>I am delusional in the sense that our perspective on reality is different but In my reality that is totally normal, it&#39;s simply because you live in the year 2015 while I&#39;m reaching for the future. We as a world need to stop living for the world of today, and start living for world of tomorrow. Yea we got some shit we got to handle before then but I&#39;m telling you salvation is just around the corner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to say, really. I see where you&#39;re coming from, definitely. It&#39;s a bit like Michael Jackson, pretty much everyone looked at him with a bit of pity – clearly he had Issues that caused him to seek to have his appearance repeatedly mangled by plastic surgeons until all that he had was irrevocably lost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, what does one think about men who for some reason <em>need</em> to have their dick or balls cut off because.... well I don&#39;t know why they want that exactly but I&#39;m sure it seems like a good reason to them. I&#39;m pretty sure no doctor can do that, ethically, no matter how many psychologists sign off that he really really really wants the evil sausage between his legs gone. None would do it.</p>

<p>But, for some reason, if it&#39;s for THIS reason, it&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not mental illness anymore. *shrug* It doesn&#39;t really make sense, eh.</p>

<p>When I think about SRS, I just get this big sense of disempowerment that it seems like it can&#39;t be the right thing to do, that it seems like a big mistake and that as a society to cheer this on rather than try to gain a better understanding about what&#39;s causing it, etc., we are indeed simply enabling a mental illness as some others have said.</p>

<p>How many of the current lgbt community members were molested or abused as children? I haven&#39;t seen any studies to that affect on their later decision making abilities when it comes to reproduction and passing on genes. </p>

<p>If instead we tolerated and didn&#39;t persecute them then they would die out or have drastically reduced numbers. IMO.</p>

<p>Forcing this abnormal behaviors acceptance by society is but one way the authoritarian parasites reduce their competition in society. </p>

<p>Sterilization, dangerous medical practices, harmful vaccination schedules, and pushing lgbt as normal to erode species propagating family structures. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t blindly hate lgbt folk they hate being forced to see them as normal when objectively they are abnormal. Cognitive dissonance displayed by ignorant masses often looks like hate to those with an agenda and a closed mind.</p>

<p>You write these two sentences together as if saying the second one makes the first one a tolerant statement. You cannot have it both ways, I said &quot;you people&quot; because you&#39;re part of a collective that has issues accepting that these kinds of people exist, that they are just as <em>normal</em> and <strong><em>natural</em></strong> as you or I.</p>

<p>Why do you care about the opinions of others? Do you want to force your worldview onto them or are you part of the lgbt community?</p>

<p>I care specifically about this opinion of yours because it negatively affects lives, I&#39;ve seen this kind of opinion literally cause the death of human beings. I&#39;m a heterosexual male but that really doesn&#39;t matter at all. I could be a lesbian transmanwoman-whatever and my statement would still be valid.</p>

<p>Lack of acceptance on such a scale is dangerous. I get that you don&#39;t think you&#39;re being intolerant, but that&#39;s not for you to decide. You can&#39;t say hurtful things and decide someone else wouldn&#39;t be hurt by it. </p>

<p>No one is encouraging people to BECOME trans-gendered, we&#39;re encouraging and supporting people who ARE trans-gendered. It&#39;s okay to be transgender. It&#39;s okay to be bisexual.

They exist and there&#39;s nothing you can do about it besides shrug and move the fuck on with your life. They do not need mental help.

    <div class="md"><p>Western civilization has fallen into a pit of perversion and corruption. We can&#39;t sink much lower, because we are close to the bottom. If you look back through history, very few cultures have been as perverse and corrupt as ours. Rome under the Caesars is one that stands out. Rome soon declined under that corruption, which was not only a moral corruption but extended to politics and the justice system.</p>

<p>People today just don&#39;t realize how completely defiled their souls are. They can&#39;t comprehend it. They&#39;ve been swimming in this fish bowl all their lives, and it has become pregressively more and more filthy, until the poor fish can&#39;t even see out through the glass, but to them it&#39;s still normal. They are swimming in raw sewage but it&#39;s normal to them because it&#39;s all they know.</p>

<p>We are literally a fallen people, all of us. If  you live in this society, you can&#39;t escape the stain. It is smeared on your from birth. What the average person regards as normal is completely vile and poisonous. A society such as ours cannot long endure. And ours won&#39;t endure.</p>

<p>The mullahs of Islam know this. They look at the West and they count the days until we collapse like a puss-filled cyst. And our society will collapse, spewing puss and filth in all directions.</p>

<p>The question is, where will you be when it collapses? Are you going to be one of the drones, the zombies, the sheep, who think this society we live in is normal and healthy? Or are you going to be one of the few who have come to understand that we are corrupt and poisonous and doomed to fail, soon?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not pretending to be some perfect person, I&#39;m just telling you, your mind is filled with filth. Your soul is black with disease and corruption. It stinks. You stink of foulness. So do I. So do we all in the West. There&#39;s no escape from the filth, unless you recognize it, and deliberately withdraw yourself from it.</p>

<p>You posted this first: </p>

<p>You were the first one to insult another poster</p>

<p>I, then, posted this, after your initial insulting post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Not many people know about the perversion and corruptness of Rome, shortly before it fell&quot;
Maybe in your backwoods shanty town. To the rest of the world, that&#39;s pretty much what Rome is known for</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see that you started the insult back-and-forth, then you&#39;re more delusional than I initially pegged you as</p>

<p>You&#39;re much less adept at critical thinking than you&#39;d like to imagine</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Gender identity&quot; is a social construct.</p>

<p>Gender is a social construct (unlike sex, which is biological and physical) remember?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have it both ways.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a lie, it&#39;s not true. In fact, we&#39;ve seen many cases where people have tried to reverse the plastic surgery.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, that is a LIE. They cut off the man&#39;s penis and pumped him full of hormones. That did NOT change his sex - that merely mutilated his body. He still had a y chromosome.</p>

<p>Unless you find a way to engineer people&#39;s chromosomes - this is just plastic surgery and hormone poisoning.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you have to invent fake socially constructed categories like &quot;gender identity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gender&quot; is a social construct, remember?</p>

<p>Sex is physical.</p>

<p>mind </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, notice they use the word &quot;mind&quot; - instead of &quot;brain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brain&quot; is a physical organ of the body.</p>

<p>&quot;Mind&quot; is like &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; - a philosophical concept with no actual physical reality to it.</p>

<p>Hence &quot;two spirit&quot; and other such religious concepts.</p>
