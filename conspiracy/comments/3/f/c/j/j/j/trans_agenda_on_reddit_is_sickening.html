       I'm by no means old fashioned and take an empathetic stand for people who identify as trans. But I really feel we need to draw the line somewhere. By undergoing surgery they aren't actually changing their sex. I will always see them as their original sex. Bruce Jenner to me is still as manly as ever. Moreover, i feel that this is completely manufactured and allowed to happen by the US govt. It is going to set a bad precedent for the future generations. Anyone else feel this way?

       Honest question: why do you give a fuck what other people do with their life? Even if all the ilk you're spewing WAS true... it wouldn't change the fact that their choices don't affect you at all, so what gives you the right to speak out against their existence?

       I'm pretty sure most people do not give a fuck (I don't). Just don't call it normal. It's a mental disorder and shouldn't be shoved down peoples throats as normal. Are delusions normal? No. Is schizophrenia normal? No. We do not shun these people, we help them. We do not encourage them and call them heroes. That is wrong and abnormal.

       By labeling someone's identity as a "mental disorder" you
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       shunning these people. A child who is trans-gendered and is told that they're unnatural is a child that is being discriminated against, do you not see that?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why transgender-ism is NOT a mental disorder, I'll let professionals explain:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The American Psychological Association (2011) explains that a “psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder.”

       Are you serious right now? Some one's identity. I identify as a black female (I'm white and male), should a parent/society allow me to pursue this? Is it cool for me to do this, or would you say I need to seek mental health?

       A child is neutral up until puberty. You are a sick fucking person if you do/allow this for a child. If they feel this way after puberty, fine. But to allow a child to do this, imo, is neglect.

       Have you ever met a trans-gendered individual? Or is all this crap you're spewing just from the internet..? There are so many scientific falsehoods in this comment I'm not even going to bother with this shit anymore. All I ask is that you keep your opinions to yourself so that other human beings aren't harmed by it. Because your opinion hurts people. I know you don't think it does, but it really fucking does.

       Go fuck yourself. I can say what I want, even if it hurts your feelings. Remember the saying, we were all taught as kids? Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.

       That is impossible! People will always have an opinion that may offend someone. That doesn't mean that they are not allowed to say it. That's what freedom of speech is.

       Truth is not racist, prejudice, or bigoted. The truth is the truth. If a call a tranny mentally ill that may offend them, but does calling a schizophrenic mentally ill offend them, also?

       How are you comparing mental illness to racial hatred? Your arguments are weak and irrational, to say the least.

       Where is this so called truth in your argument? I just don't see it... just a bunch of hateful opinions... that's not fucking truth. You have an opinion. That's it. It isn't truth just because you say it is...

       I can make that comparison because you are showing symptoms of someone who is prejudice against a specific minority. Somehow you don't recognize this... I don't see why you're so devoted to being against these people.

       It's the same as thinking that gay people are "broken" and need to be sent somewhere to "fix" them. The people who ran gay-conversion camps thought they weren't prejudice either. I get your bigotry is coming from a place of ignorance and probably not hate, but that doesn't make it any less unacceptable.

       Why do mentally ill people get help? Can you convert a schizophrenic? No, people of yester years used to perform exorcism on them. Gay camps to transform people are a religious retardation. I'm talking about actual mental health. BTW, I'm not religious, you ignorant fuck.

       Lol I didn't say you were religious, I was making something called a comparison. You don't have to be religious to incorrectly label a population of people as "broken" and claim that they must be "helped." Because that's precisely what you're doing. Like I said, I get that what you're saying

        isn't

       coming from a place of hate, but understand that there's nothing mentally, societally, or morally wrong with a transgender person. It's who they are, just live and let live.

       If you have a limb amputated and experience phantom limb syndrome, is that a mental health issue because your brain doesn't match up with your physical body? No, the problem is obviously the fact that you had your limb amputated.

      <p>
       Nobody thinks that surgery can change chromosomes. But SRS can change your sex, aka your genitals. And for what it's worth, you yourself might have XX, XY, XXY, XXXX chromosomes and not even know it. Chromosomal disorders are more common than transgender people are. Do you consider a cisgender man with XX chromosomes to be a woman because of his karyotype? Have you had yourself tested in case you're actually intersex? I doubt it. Chromosomes are important but they're not everything. For instance, even in the absence of a Y chromosome, XX-chromosomed trans men are able to experience facial hair growth and deepened voices as a result of hormone replacement therapy. Not all genetic information relating to sex is contained on those two chromosomes. Once again, I have to wonder how informed you actually are on this topic. I doubt you have a medical degree of your own and I doubt you've done any significant research into this topic.

       It's been tried and it doesn't work. Conversion therapy causes suicide rates to skyrocket and doesn't prevent gender dysphoria. Treating the body, on the other hand, through hormone replacement therapy and occasionally through surgery IS effective and does reduce suicide rates, life dissatisfaction and the manifestation of gender dysphoria. This is scientific fact, it's the agreed consensus of the greater medical community. Everybody who is informed on this topic disagrees with you. You're just wrong.

       I have a case study that proves this wrong.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer">
        David Reimer
       </a>
       was a cisgender man (a man born with male genitals and male chromosomes) who, due to a botched circumcision, was given a vaginoplasty and raised as female. Now, according to you, his brain would not be flawed, and thus he would not be transgender; he should have been happy to live as a woman. However, he showed all of the same symptoms as transgender people do throughout his life, until he decided to change his name (to David) and transition to male. I think you'll agree that the problem here was his body, not his brain. This is exactly the same situation that transgender people are in. Although we're given the wrong genitals earlier than Mr Reimer was, his case proves that we cannot be "mentally ill" because someone who would otherwise have lived a normal, mental illness-free life was able to become "transgender" through the manipulation of his physical body alone. Essentially, you don't need to touch the brain to make someone trans, just the body . Because our brains are normal.

      <p>
       Of course I don't think this. I think that people's identity is in the brain, and that thus when the brain declares something about identity, it's right. You seem to think that just because the genitals disagree, the brain must be wrong; essentially you think that the genitals are better judges of someone's mental identity than the brain is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The body is a vehicle. You can cut off an arm and the person, though wounded, is still the same. You can give them a tattoo and they're the same person. But mess with the brain and you've changed their identity. That's why conversion therapy is so unethical; horrific though it may be, being transgender is a part of my identity and self-determination. It's given me life experiences I would have missed out on without it. Changing that part of me would change who I am into a different person. That's something no amount of surgery can do.

       , and we don't need to change our genders, gender is decided by the brain so that's the part we don't want to change. Honestly, you're trying hard, but you really just seem very very uninformed. It's nice that you're being at least polite to me, unlike some people, but I wish you'd do a little more research on the topic before trying to debate about it, just like how I don't debate with the CEO of Guiness on brewing techniques.

      <p>
       David Reimer's brain thought "male" but he had a female body. The problem, as you just agreed, was with the body in his case. Why are you contradicting yourself? Consider David a "control" experiment. If, by changing the body of someone with no mental illness, you're able to replicate the circumstances in which a transgender person is "created", then you prove that transgender people can be created solely as a result of a flawed body, even in the absence of a flawed mind!
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case though I think you're missing the point. This isn't an argument of which of the two, body or mind, is right or wrong. If I had been born in a female body, then my female mind would have been happy. If a man had been born into my male body, he would have been happy. Neither are inherantly flawed, they're
       <strong>
        just mismatched
       </strong>
       . The round peg and the square hole are both fine individually, they just don't fit together!
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter whose FAULT it is. I can try to explain what being transgender is like to you until the sun implodes, but ultimately the only facts that matter are these:
      </p>
      <p>
       -There is a problem: mind and body don't match.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Changing the mind to match the body doesn't work and raises suicide rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Changing the body to match the mind does work and lower suicide rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you keep arguing against hormone treatments that work? You sound like the one who doesn't want to "heal sick people".

       Honestly this is just something I can't really explain to you if you're not trans. For you, your mind and body match, so there's no "seam", no separation, no difference. You can just see yourself as one being.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're trans, everything about your body feels wrong. Not because it's broken, but because it's not the right one for you. Square peg, round hole. You don't need a brain scan because you just know.

       I like to compare it to keyboards. I learnt to type on an azerty keyboard. When I type, I don't have to think about the keyboard, the buttons, the "body"; my fingers know what to press and where to spell each word. The keyboard is just an extension of myself. But if I have to use a Qwerty? ugh, it's just awful. Sure, some letters don't move, and a lot of the big stuff, like the space bar, are the same. But when something's off it's just atrocious. I can't write anything with an English keyboard because it's all wrong. And when I'm writing on an English keyboard, I'm able to tell that the reason I hate it is because I expect a French keyboard beneath my fingers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the analogy is flawed. Typing is learned, and can be relearned. But as conversion therapy's failure has shown, you can't learn how to not be trans. It doesn't work. What you can do is give them hormones, change around some of the keybindings and move a few letters around. Sure,
       <strong>
        <em>
         technically
        </em>
       </strong>
       it's never going to be a "TRUE" french keyboard; it's just an English keyboard with z and w swapped and some fancy code modifications. But it allows me to type.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate proof that I'm "right" is simply the success of my treatment method (hormone replacement therapy). Those that disagree with me support a treatment that raises suicide levels and does nothing to alleviate dysphoria, whereas mine allows those that suffer from dysphoria to live the semblance of a normal life, albeit one marred by the protests of the uneducated and the bigoted. For whatever reason, people take personal offense at the idea of somebody not being how they seem on the outside. Whether it stems from jealousy, religion, homophobia or fear of the unknown I can't say. All I want is people to stop treating me like shit.

       I don't want to have a broken body. I mean, dysphoria can manifest itself in extreme cases as self-mutilation (some trans women attempt to castrate themselves for instance) but that's not typical and is usually just a targeted form of the self-harm / suicide brought on by depression.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the whole, though, I'm aware that my body is technically functional. That doesn't mean it's the right one for me. I'm trans because my brain is expecting a female body, and an autopsy would support this. The differences between the two genders and the differences between the disabled and the able-bodied are just so unrelated that it's silly to compare them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone with BID would be trying to rip the keys out of their keyboard. I don't want to break my keyboard, I want to swap it out for a new one that's better suited to my needs. As a rule trans people are fairly rational and aware of what causes our desire to transition. I don't suffer from BID so I can't explain too well what I mean to you, but think of it this way. Doctors aren't idiots. They know what they're doing. And they know that BID and gender dysphoria are innately different. They have different causes, different symptoms, and different treatments. They only appear remotely similar to laymen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider the case of David Reimer. He was a cis man, and thus had a male brain, male sex organs, male chromosomes etc. If being transgender was a mental illness, he wouldn't have it. And yet, when a failed circumcision led to a vaginoplasty and his parents raising him as female, he exhibited all of the same symptoms as a transgender child. In adulthood he even attempted to transition to male, but sadly I think the news of his past led him to suicide once he found out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if the brain had no role in the self-determination of gender, then after being raised as female with a female body, David would have identified as female. But instead, because of his male brain, he recognised that his body was wrong for him. This proves that gender dysphoria is not caused by a flaw in the brain but by a mismatch between the mind's gender identity, which is fixed at birth and can never be changed, and the physical manifestations of one's sex.

       I have to spend a decent amount of my life simply justifying my own existence. Many people, though not ill-meaning and simply uninformed, seem to think they know better than the medical professionals that I work with for my transition. Most of them haven't even read the wikipedia page on transgender people and still believe that I'm a "freak". If I were to go outside presenting as female (the gender I identify with) then I would be called a "tranny he-she", which means that for the time being I have to crossdress by wearing male clothes and pretend to be a man every day. If in the distant future my life was in a situation where I wanted to date others, I'd be in the dangerous position of having to reveal my genitals to complete strangers. Many men and women have violent reactions upon learning that the person they're attracted to "used to be a man" or "is secretly a man". If you wait any longer to make sure they're not a murderer or a sociopath you just open yourself up to claims that you "led them along", which can worsen their reaction. Trans women have an average lifespan of 32 years because of suicide and anti-trans violence. 42 percent at the age of 20 have attempted suicide before, bearing in mind that those that succeeded didn't survive to enter the poll. We've got nearly double the unemployment rates of the average population because it's legal to fire someone for being trans. And of course we get people on

      <p>
       The cause is the mismatch between mind and body. My brain is fine and my body is fine, but they don't fit together. There's no "mental cause", i'm not mentally ill because I'm trans, there's nothing to fix. Round peg, square hole. Instead of hacking away at the peg to make it square, why not just find a round hole for it?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, it doesn't matter at all whose FAULT it is. I can try to explain what being transgender is like to you until the sun implodes, but ultimately the only facts that matter are these:
      </p>
      <p>
       -There is a problem: mind and body don't match.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Changing the mind to match the body (conversion therapy) doesn't work and raises suicide rates. Example case:
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Leelah_Alcorn">
        Leelah Alcorn
       </a>
       . It's not only a waste of time and money, it's also barbaric. There is no cure to the brain because the brain isn't flawed. What else are you suggesting, lobotomies?
      </p>
      <p>
       -Changing the body to match the mind (Hormone therapy) does work and lower suicide rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't understand tbh why you're trying to argue against a cure that so obviously works. Its success is supported by countless studies and polls. It's the scientifically accepted treatment the world over, and yet random people on the internet with no medical degree think they know better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any studies you can show me that support conversion therapy and show flaws in hormone therapy? Because I've never seen one that was reputable. I really think if you're going to keep arguing this stance you should try to back it up instead of attempting to debate around an illness you obviously don't understand. I'm sorry, I know I'm being rude, but it's just frustrating having to explain this every day of my life. I've had a pretty rough day.

       Hold on there! lol. I was reading and then had to stop at lobotomies. I think it's possible that it is being approached all wrong, just like most things in our society. I think there just needs to be more discussion and understanding. Then maybe we could get a different perspective on it in order to find a solution that is not as harsh as surgeries or hormones and other chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that you assume that I would want these terrifying treatments when what I really want is something that is less damaging and with less risks. You might consider surgery and hormones as solutions, but I feel that they can just make it more difficult to find a cause and it possibly brings with it a lot of negative side-effects while causing more confusion than solving anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not feel the same way as those with body identity integrity disorder in the way that you see the disconnect from your body and mind, then it just seems like you are unhappy or unsatisfied with the body parts that you have. Is this correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody wants to age either, but is everyone going to think that stopping aging or death with technology or pills is a good idea? Nope. I'll be the one that wants to stay with what is natural, along with many others. I might eat more vegetables and fruits, drink more water, exercise, get more sleep, and lower my stress and exposure to carcinogens, but that's pretty much it. Aging and death is natural. I might not like it, but I'm going to go with it and try my best to accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that what is going on is a toxin/societal issue. And could possibly be a very strong toxin/chemical issue if you are younger. They are finding that babies are being exposed to more and more chemicals even in the womb. Then if you were given crap formula, add that to it. Then add that to the increasing amount of vaccines that are administered. Then add that to all the artificial, chemical-laden, GMO crap that most of us eat now. Then add that to all the carcinogens in the air and in the water.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes to society, it doesn't really make us feel satisfied with how we are born. They always want us to wear this, be like this, do this, look like this, or buy this in order to be happy. I think very few people are truly satisfied with the way that they look and the way that they are. Especially at a younger age, this is almost always true.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I still don't think it's a cure. It might work for you, but I've heard and read a lot to know that it doesn't work for everyone. And I think it's especially cruel to let it happen to kids. Stopping puberty with hormones should not even be an option and I think it's completely insane. You might trust western medicine/AMA, but for allowing this alone, makes it really hard for me to trust them at all. However, there are plenty of other reasons that I have for not trusting them, but we won't go into that today.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what a reputable source is to you, I am one that will pay attention to personal stories, keep them in mind, and then compare that to the sources. With personal stories I have more of a connection emotionally, but it also depends on how sincere and genuine the person is. Usually, when it comes to an individual that is telling their own personal stories, there is no agenda, but nowadays on the internet, it's not the case with all the shills coming in, but I feel pretty confident in my ability to gauge a person's integrity and honesty. I would just go research sex change regret or transgender regret reversals. You can choose to see both sides or only one side, but just like many other topics, each side will say the other side is wrong and will usually debunk each other. Though you have to be even more aware with this topic considering that this is the new idea that is being currently whored.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't need to show you any studies. As soon as I am asked for studies, I feel suspicious to be honest. Especially, when all I did was ask you some questions. I am mostly just trying to understand you. I have my own opinion and you have yours. I'm not trying to prove you wrong or anything. I just want the right, safest, and the most intelligent thing to be done, instead of just rushing into what they feel is the quick fix.

       Ultimately, I believe an adult should be able to do with their body and money whatever they wish so long as it doesn't infringe the lives and liberties of others.  This includes unnecessary plastic surgery for aesthetics.  However, a doctor prescribing such elective cosmetic surgery as a solution to a mental problem is pure malpractice.

       I agree with you that if adults want to make the decision in dramatically altering their appearance with surgery or their natural bodily processes with chemicals because they are unhappy with it, they should be able to, but if they are confusing the kids into making these decisions, it drives me insane. Although with adults making these decisions, it still affects me because I don't think it's good or healthy for them, but I won't protest it too much since that's what they really want.

       Notice how content-free this person's post is.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no fact, no logic, no argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just a long drawn out way of name-calling. I especially like the reference to "fucking young Earth creationist."
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, for progressives - who have a completely unscientific munderstanding of virtually everything: race, sex, economics, biology - their "best enemies" are Kansas fundamentalists that believe in "biblical creationism."
      </p>
      <p>
       So these progressives pretend that everyone who doesn't believe in whatever their cause-du-jour is is some sort of religious nut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, they believe completely unscientific things. That the physical brain has no influence on IQ, that all ethnic groups evolved in exactly the same way with exactly the same cognition regardless of environment. That sex and race are all "social constructs" and have nothing to do with biology.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why they are called "liberal creationists" because their ideas are just as absurd and non-scientific as those of the Kansas fundamentalists that want to put "evolution is only a theory" on Biology textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transsexualism is a disorder of the brain. That's why a perfectly functional body, male or female, feels "wrong" - because of a brain disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I mentioned before, it's very similar to the disorder where someone feels like a perfectly functioning arm or leg "doesn't belong" to their body. This disorder, like transsexualism, often leads to self-mutilation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is in the organ of the brain - not in their limbs - or their genitals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, "progressives" don't give a shit about these people. "Progressives" love a good freak show. They love to pose as somehow "tolerant" while mentally ill people get mutilated by unethical doctors. If you object to this completely inhuman and unethical butchery of people with serious mental illness, that makes you ...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... I don't know, what is their boogey man du jour? "Reactionary." "Intolerant." "Conservative." Etc.

But he cautions that these findings may vary in different people whose sexual orientation is not that clear-cut, which his own research shows includes a majority of the population.

       You just contradicted yourself a third time. If gender identity is a social construct, why did David Reimer want to transition to male? He was socialised as female, shouldn't he have become a woman?

       This happens, but it's very very rare. A tiny tiny percentage of transgender people detransition. And just so you know, you're still showing your ignorance. Once again you seem to think that all that's involved in transition is surgery. Please, for the love of god, do some damn research! You're so hopelessly uninformed, it's really quite sad. It's almost like you enjoy your own lack of knowledge. How can you hope to have a debate or defend your point of view when you don't even know what you're talking about? But then, what should I expect from a redpiller... scientific rigour?

       Look, you've sort of become boring to talk to. At this point you're just spouting redpill pseudoscience and ignoring every argument I make in favour of repeating whatever moronic mantra it is that you've been last inspired to add to your vocabulary. You'll never do any research and you'll never bother to think twice about your views. I'm guessing you're about 14 years old and just overcompensating for a late puberty, but on the offchance you're actually an adult and still hold these views I wish you the best of luck with your future endeavours. Maybe one day we can look back on this and laugh. In the mean time, try to think just a little longer every time someone disagrees with you. You might find they have something worth saying.

       The fact that no one wants to find a cure for these people's brains shows this isn't medicine - it's something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was about fixing a medical condition - they would try to fix the medical condition - not mutilate people's bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a similar brain dysfunction that causes people to believe their limbs - arms, legs - don't really "belong" to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the cure for this condition to cut off people's arms and legs? Of course not - their arms and legs are fine. It's a brain condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when it's a similar issue with thinking their penis or vagina doesn't "belong" - we pretend it's not a brain problem.

      <p>

       I don't get why more people can't see through this. We are allowing people to mutilate their bodies and think that's okay! I know without a doubt, they will never ever be or feel like a woman no matter how much surgery they have. And I could never be with a trans woman, the thought of that is just repulsive.

       The whole purpose of the agenda is to help you see the perspective that gays/trans are people too and you should accept them because they are themselves and there is nothing wrong with that. We need to drop this trained Right Brain agenda, we are all catalyst and learn from what we see and hear from the day we are born. If no one ever told you it was wrong or weird you wouldn't think it, so I doubt future generations will at all.

       their body larger than it actually is? Hence why they do what they do (starve themselves)... So if a person is staring into the mirror and thinking they should have female or male body parts, how is that any different than the delusions of an anorexic person? Right, because it's in their damn minds and it's the same thing. We treat these people, we don't call em heroes and we sure as shit do not encourage their delusions.

       I do not think transpeople should be ridiculed and shunned from society. But, at least call it for what it is, a mental illness.

       How is chopping off your dick not harming your body? Also, implants can harm your body because it's silicone and they could burst. There are plenty horror stories about that (google it). Like I said, it's the same, all delusions. I'm not saying they should be ridiculed and shunned, just like schizophrenics shouldn't be. It's a mental disorder and should be treated/addressed as such. Sorry.

       That's another misconception, not all people who identify as another gender go through the surgery, as it is very expensive, just like implants.  It is the choice for the person to go through the surgery, it is NOT the choice of an anorexic person on whether or not they want to eat.

       Just because they do not go through with the surgery doesn't mean that they do not perceive their body a certain way and/or hate the body they were born with. Your argument kinda sucks. It's no different than an anorexic.

       I said it is different because they have the choice of whether or not they physically change.  Also hating a part of your body =/= a mental disorder.  I dislike that I was born with a large nose, (which results in people calling me a Jew) does that mean I have a mental disorder? Think about it, there is literally no difference aside from the fact that transgender people want to change a particular organ that is used in reproduction/decides the gender that they are.  Transgender people don't think that perceive their body in a different way, they think that the inside of their body is different than the outside.  They don't look at themselves and think, "I'm the opposite gender".  That's just ignorance on your part if you think that.

       Your argument sucks but you are solely basing it on physical change. The anorexic does not have the ability to un-see their delusions without help. Even with help, they could still see themselves that way and not starve themselves. Same thing with a transgender. Okay, they do not physically change themselves, but in their minds they are still seeing it. Same with an anorexic. Treatment doesn't cure an anorexic person from seeing delusions, what treatment does do, is help the person understand that, that's what it is, a delusion. It's not real, just in your head. Which helps them not starve themselves and could help a transgender person from chopping of their own dick and getting tits.

       Not saying that at all. If in your mind you truly think you are a female but born a male and want to physically change your sex (organs and all), then yes, that is a mental disorder. Not sure how you jumped to that extreme. Because I'm sure your are implying boob jobs, piercings, nose jobs, face lifts, etc etc.

       I know nothing about this subject, but are you saying that it's not considered to be any kind of disorder? If so, is that to say it's now considered to be absolutely natural and normal? (because that seems a little odd)

       I've been to a crazy house before as my sister has severe autism, ocd and is schizophrenic. While you are correct that ALL don't cause bodily harm, alot of them do.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Anyone in the world can experience delusion, that's why I said what I said. Delusion is to general a thing to diagnose, someone can have a situation where they have delusion and 15 mins later never experience it again.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes, you are not talking about self harm but I am, because my original point was that these are classified as MENTAL ILLNESSES.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Yes but if you know everyone has a dick and vagina, why don't you criticize every female for such a thing or every male? Could the ultimate answer boil down to simply because you are not sleeping with them, why do you care?
      </p>
      <p>
       With robotics, there have been a lot of recent reports that people are being attacked for wearing tech like the Google glasses or trying to make robotic eyes. You can understand why allowing transgenders as the opening stepping stone to allow robotic tech to become the norm right? Otherwise those soldiers with limbs blown off aren't able to feel SAFE in a world where people think something out of the world is pretty much the end game, I can see it now Bill O'Reilly, "Cyborgs in your workplace, who are these people, and what they can do to you".
      </p>
      <p>
       If transgenders and gays get more laws in place, it becomes a normal thing, it means it's not a big deal, people don't feel weird, hell people would actually tell some of the people they are sleeping with that they aren't what they appear and feel safe to be honest as to not make the other party make a mistake, although I will miss Jerry Springer. I won't even speak on the tax, insurance and credit scams that go unnoticed because their no real core aim for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly think that most of the propaganda pushed to the masses is to enlighten them, basically to open their mind to new ideas, so many ideas that they people start to grab these ideas and use them or more of live off them. The idea of a different reality and that anything can change at any time. An idea of a war on ideas completely subjugated to change by whomever can grasp the meaning out of them. I feel that changes like this may seem silly or stupid but deep down, they are the most important changes that the world will ever see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am delusional in the sense that our perspective on reality is different but In my reality that is totally normal, it's simply because you live in the year 2015 while I'm reaching for the future. We as a world need to stop living for the world of today, and start living for world of tomorrow. Yea we got some shit we got to handle before then but I'm telling you salvation is just around the corner.

       I feel bad for the kids mostly. Boys legitimately feel that they are girls just because they prefer the color pink or like to play with barbies... Uhh what! And some of the parents actually believe it too.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn't be so bad if people weren't so focused on or surprised by boys wearing skirts or something. Let the kids wear what they want to wear and do what they want to do without categorizing them as a specific gender based on those things. Then they probably wouldn't go mutilating/cutting out their body parts or taking hormones to stop puberty just so that they can fit into society's constructs, labels, and ideas.

Got great grades, had normal relationships, etc etc. They had their moments, but you'd never guess if you met them in the pub on a random night. Your comment is pretty retarded.

       Most schizophrenics will not fucking harm you and are completely normal people on the outside, albeit have a mental disorder. You know nothing about the mental health disorders that people are speaking of. You are being a bigot towards one group and bias towards another.

       The 'transgender' agenda does actually impact the real world, men can go into women's locker rooms, the doctor asks your child what gender they are, children are being propagandized with this evil garbage at public schools.  The media bombards us daily with a picture of Bruce Jenner in a lingerie and other stories 'normalize' it.  Its an agenda that has the full weight of the conspiracy behind it.

      <p>
       While its may be true that the man / woman on the street might want to live a private life and not bother anyone, that's not true of the forces mainstreaming the movement.

       Yeah the shills are shooting themselves in the foot. On one hand they are propagating tolerance but they don't extend the same to people with an alternate opinion. Hypocrites. I don't '"hate" transpeople and would always treat them with compassion, but I am arguing that such acceptance of something abnormal as normal is bad for society in the long run. Whatever, If you're trans, I feel sorry for you.

       It's hard to say, really. I see where you're coming from, definitely. It's a bit like Michael Jackson, pretty much everyone looked at him with a bit of pity – clearly he had Issues that caused him to seek to have his appearance repeatedly mangled by plastic surgeons until all that he had was irrevocably lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, what does one think about men who for some reason
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to have their dick or balls cut off because.... well I don't know why they want that exactly but I'm sure it seems like a good reason to them. I'm pretty sure no doctor can do that, ethically, no matter how many psychologists sign off that he really really really wants the evil sausage between his legs gone. None would do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, for some reason, if it's for THIS reason, it's ok. It's not mental illness anymore. *shrug* It doesn't really make sense, eh.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I think about SRS, I just get this big sense of disempowerment that it seems like it can't be the right thing to do, that it seems like a big mistake and that as a society to cheer this on rather than try to gain a better understanding about what's causing it, etc., we are indeed simply enabling a mental illness as some others have said.

       They used to be called female impersonators, which is a more descriptive reality-based moniker.  The controllers keep changing the language on us, and it makes it hard to think clearly which is the point of Newspeak.

       Yup, and you'll get downvoted to hell for calling it a mental illness. I can say that I feel like I'm a cat (delusional), and get the surgery to make me
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       like a cat, doesn't mean I can produce a cat. It's all in the mind, like schizophrenia. Bruce Jenner will never be a woman, because his internal body isn't a woman, it's male. He will never have a period, PMS, or a have the ability to birth a child.

       Your right, it may have been a bad analogy, but the point still stands. A female thinking she is a male with never produce sperm and a male thinking he is a female will never have ovum. These very characteristics set male and female apart. It doesn't matter what the brain says, because that should be viewed as a disorder and/or delusion. Not hating on them, just saying it for what it is. We do not encourage delusional people to embrace their delusions. That would be unethical and unhealthy.

       Meh, fuck it dude. I've made the case as have you and it's getting a downvote brigade. I liken it to telling a schizophrenic that these delusions are all in your mind and not real. That schizophrenic will fight your tooth and nail, because they
       <em>
        believe

       it's real. Sick, sad society we live in today, when honest people are trying to help people instead of encouraging delusions and calling them normal and heroes. SMH....

       BRo, the way to tell real people apart if they are downvoted to the bottom. :). I am glad that I find other people who get me. I am in no way propagating hate. In fact all people are equal. But we have to realize our governments are running the last lap of their sad sad game.

       Exactly. People think that you can't change something in the brain when in reality the brain is very programmable!!! The govt knows this very well, and they invest heavily in this, but obviously they don't want to let the people know this.

       Gay, lesbian, tranny, whatever are all unnatural from a biological and societal perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody "has to" accept them but we shouldn't discriminate against them. It's called tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The groups will eventually die out because they aren't reproducing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now when govt steps in and forces acceptance instead of tolerance they are fueling the groups numbers. One or two trans, gay, lesbian whatever can legally raise children due to govt dictate not societal norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       This causes the very malleable and easily influenced brain of a child to accept an obviously not normal behavior as normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       How many of the current lgbt community members were molested or abused as children? I haven't seen any studies to that affect on their later decision making abilities when it comes to reproduction and passing on genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If instead we tolerated and didn't persecute them then they would die out or have drastically reduced numbers. IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forcing this abnormal behaviors acceptance by society is but one way the authoritarian parasites reduce their competition in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sterilization, dangerous medical practices, harmful vaccination schedules, and pushing lgbt as normal to erode species propagating family structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       People don't blindly hate lgbt folk they hate being forced to see them as normal when objectively they are abnormal. Cognitive dissonance displayed by ignorant masses often looks like hate to those with an agenda and a closed mind.

       You write these two sentences together as if saying the second one makes the first one a tolerant statement. You cannot have it both ways, I said "you people" because you're part of a collective that has issues accepting that these kinds of people exist, that they are just as

       I care specifically about this opinion of yours because it negatively affects lives, I've seen this kind of opinion literally cause the death of human beings.

       Lack of acceptance on such a scale is dangerous. I get that you don't think you're being intolerant, but that's not for you to decide. You can't say hurtful things and decide someone else wouldn't be hurt by it.

       I do not care what others do with their bodies/lives. But to say something like this is normal and should be encouraged is wrong. You have no idea on where I stand with things. This agenda is getting pushed down our throats where as it shouldn't be. You are not a hero for come out as a tranny. You are you, you do not get a fucking pedestal. How is this so hard for you to comprehend? Do you really think tranny Jenner deserves a reality show about his "transformation". That is doing more harm then good to the community. They are people who suffer a mental illness, if they wanna mutilate their bodies, fine. Don't say it's normal and acceptable.

       I don't think any of us should give a fuck about Jenner. I don't get why she's a national headline it's retarded. But I very much support the LGBT community
       <em>
        BECAUSE
       </em>
       they are specifically persecuted against by many societies and cultures all around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is encouraging people to BECOME trans-gendered, we're encouraging and supporting people who ARE trans-gendered. It's okay to be transgender. It's okay to be bisexual. It's okay to be gay. These are not unnatural things. And saying that they are is an offensive statement that hurts people. You have no business deciding that it isn't natural. They exist and there's nothing you can do about it besides shrug and move the fuck on with your life. They do not need mental help. The only transgender people that need help are the ones that are having this terrible worldview that they are unnatural and wrong shoved in their face every damn day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine someone said you were unnatural, and that you should be changed to fit the rest of society. You wouldn't like that. How is this any different?

       I don't believe that he said that they should change at all to fit in with society. He just said that it's not normal and that the idea shouldn't be glorified. I agree with him.

       Western civilization has fallen into a pit of perversion and corruption. We can't sink much lower, because we are close to the bottom. If you look back through history, very few cultures have been as perverse and corrupt as ours. Rome under the Caesars is one that stands out. Rome soon declined under that corruption, which was not only a moral corruption but extended to politics and the justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
       People today just don't realize how completely defiled their souls are. They can't comprehend it. They've been swimming in this fish bowl all their lives, and it has become pregressively more and more filthy, until the poor fish can't even see out through the glass, but to them it's still normal. They are swimming in raw sewage but it's normal to them because it's all they know.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are literally a fallen people, all of us. If  you live in this society, you can't escape the stain. It is smeared on your from birth. What the average person regards as normal is completely vile and poisonous. A society such as ours cannot long endure. And ours won't endure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mullahs of Islam know this. They look at the West and they count the days until we collapse like a puss-filled cyst. And our society will collapse, spewing puss and filth in all directions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, where will you be when it collapses? Are you going to be one of the drones, the zombies, the sheep, who think this society we live in is normal and healthy? Or are you going to be one of the few who have come to understand that we are corrupt and poisonous and doomed to fail, soon?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not pretending to be some perfect person, I'm just telling you, your mind is filled with filth. Your soul is black with disease and corruption. It stinks. You stink of foulness. So do I. So do we all in the West. There's no escape from the filth, unless you recognize it, and deliberately withdraw yourself from it.

       No, that is a LIE. They cut off the man's penis and pumped him full of hormones. That did NOT change his sex - that merely mutilated his body. He still had a y chromosome.

       Unless you find a way to engineer people's chromosomes - this is just plastic surgery and hormone poisoning.

       "Brain" is a physical organ of the body.
