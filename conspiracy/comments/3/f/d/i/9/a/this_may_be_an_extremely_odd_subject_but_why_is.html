       It seriously looks like the moon is shaking about in an erratic manner, though not severely (as if it is a sort of spotlight manned by a human who is attempting to be completely centered,) with a sort of blue light radiating behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only noticeable when viewed with a completely solid to earth building, plain, mountain or tree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew it was supposed to be a full moon tonight, so my family and I ventured out to see the moon come up over the mountains, and I witnessed this sight I have never noticed before.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I probably seem insane at the moment, but I am just trying to figure this out, I am merely a human being observing with my own eyes things that are contradictory to my past teachings and beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have any input on this?

       I'm not being sarcastic. The moon isn't what they are telling you it is and people viewing shit themselves will prove it wrong. I'm gonna have a smoke and drink a beer on the porch and check out the moon. Give me 8 mins. My dog has to piss anyways.

       I'm in Northern America. The moon does look a little weird tonight. I usually keep track, always have a campfire (and look at the moon/stars). But there are a lot of clouds out now. Can you further explain what you saw?

       I'm in the west USA (Utah to be exact,) and though it's hard to explain I can try.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a very subtle shaking in the position, but viewable by my eyes (with glasses on, mind you.)  It just seemed so incredibly different than when I view it in the open sky.  Against the mountains it would move similarly to a spotlight attempting to be centered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I said that in my original post, but that's honestly the best attempt I have at explaining it.  It wasn't still as it rose above the mountains.  I could see it shift very slightly, left, right, up and down, over any solid plain I observed it with.  It was more of a tremor-like shaking if that helps any.  It didn't have any direct pattern, it just shook oddly, and very noticeably.

       is a decent channel, but it's on the fringe of things. Mentioning it will probably get me laughed at by some "redditors". I'm just an honest, open minded person looking to figure out the truth of things. Everything is a stepping stone. Enjoy. My Nordic ancestors would be proud of me.....

       You are truly an open minded person, I wish there were more people like us here. Once people get to fringe things, cognitive dissonance kicks in and the ridicules follow. We, as humans would be better off if we could exchange all ideas, no matter how fringe or blasphemous. I'm an idealist though, sigh.....

       Man, though I'm soaking up what I can from their other videos, I really enjoy what Crow777 has to say about chemical trailing planes, as I've been observing that "phenomenon" for years now.

       On your point, I agree completely.  Keep swimming upstream my friend, for it will only make yourself and the school that follows stronger.

       Yeah i doubt its a holograme, thats the kind of distortion you would get with heat. Looks just like what you would see on earth looking though heat waves to me.

       I think you are referring to
       <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-equipment/beating-the-seeing/">
        atmospheric seeing conditions
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "The air's light-bending power, or refractive index, depends on its density and therefore its temperature. Wherever air masses with different temperatures meet, the boundary layer between them breaks up into swirling ripples and eddies that act as weak, irregular lenses. You can see this where hot air from a fire or a sunbaked road mixes with cooler air above; those ordinary heat waves are astronomers' poor seeing writ large. Our windy, weather-ridden atmosphere is almost always full of slight temperature irregularities, and when you look through a telescope you see their effect magnified."

       Are you using a telescope or just the naked eye?
      </p>
      <p>
       Using a telescope, the moon will appear to slightly shake or shimmer due to the atmosphere, but you won't notice the atmospheric interference with the naked eye.

       There weren't any clouds or artificial ones around the moon as it rose over the mountains so I had a hard time feeling like it wasn't a genuine observation.

       I'm in the west USA (Utah to be exact,) and though it's hard to explain I can try.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was a very subtle shaking in the position, but viewable by my eyes (with glasses on, mind you.)  It just seemed so incredibly different than when I view it in the open sky.  Against the mountains it would move similarly to a spotlight attempting to be centered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I said that in my original post, but that's honestly the best attempt I have at explaining it.  It wasn't still as it rose above the mountains.  I could see it shift very slightly, left, right, up and down, over any solid plain I observed it with.  It was more of a tremor-like shaking if that helps any.  It didn't have any direct pattern, it just shook oddly, and very noticeably.
