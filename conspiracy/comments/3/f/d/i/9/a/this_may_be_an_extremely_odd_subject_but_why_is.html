        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seriously looks like the moon is shaking about in an erratic manner, though not severely (as if it is a sort of spotlight manned by a human who is attempting to be completely centered,) with a sort of blue light radiating behind it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only noticeable when viewed with a completely solid to earth building, plain, mountain or tree.</p>

<p>I knew it was supposed to be a full moon tonight, so my family and I ventured out to see the moon come up over the mountains, and I witnessed this sight I have never noticed before.</p>

<p>I know I probably seem insane at the moment, but I am just trying to figure this out, I am merely a human being observing with my own eyes things that are contradictory to my past teachings and beliefs.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any input on this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the west USA (Utah to be exact,) and though it&#39;s hard to explain I can try.</p>

<p>It was a very subtle shaking in the position, but viewable by my eyes (with glasses on, mind you.)  It just seemed so incredibly different than when I view it in the open sky.  Against the mountains it would move similarly to a spotlight attempting to be centered.</p>

<p>I know I said that in my original post, but that&#39;s honestly the best attempt I have at explaining it.  It wasn&#39;t still as it rose above the mountains.  I could see it shift very slightly, left, right, up and down, over any solid plain I observed it with.  It was more of a tremor-like shaking if that helps any.  It didn&#39;t have any direct pattern, it just shook oddly, and very noticeably.</p>

<p>On your point, I agree completely.  Keep swimming upstream my friend, for it will only make yourself and the school that follows stronger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are referring to <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-equipment/beating-the-seeing/">atmospheric seeing conditions</a>.</p>

<p><em>&quot;The air&#39;s light-bending power, or refractive index, depends on its density and therefore its temperature. Wherever air masses with different temperatures meet, the boundary layer between them breaks up into swirling ripples and eddies that act as weak, irregular lenses. You can see this where hot air from a fire or a sunbaked road mixes with cooler air above; those ordinary heat waves are astronomers&#39; poor seeing writ large. Our windy, weather-ridden atmosphere is almost always full of slight temperature irregularities, and when you look through a telescope you see their effect magnified.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the west USA (Utah to be exact,) and though it&#39;s hard to explain I can try.</p>

<p>It was a very subtle shaking in the position, but viewable by my eyes (with glasses on, mind you.)  It just seemed so incredibly different than when I view it in the open sky.  Against the mountains it would move similarly to a spotlight attempting to be centered.</p>

<p>I know I said that in my original post, but that&#39;s honestly the best attempt I have at explaining it.  It wasn&#39;t still as it rose above the mountains.  I could see it shift very slightly, left, right, up and down, over any solid plain I observed it with.  It was more of a tremor-like shaking if that helps any.  It didn&#39;t have any direct pattern, it just shook oddly, and very noticeably.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I&#39;m over the &quot;laughed at&quot; phase now and just hope every human on this planet would just share whatever information they have (as you just have,) and take it from whatever perspective they can.  And as such, I am grateful at what you have shared.</p>
