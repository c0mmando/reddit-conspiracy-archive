       Just a hunch, what do you guys think? Sounds like scapegoating to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Also this is the third time direct family members to Osama have been killed in a plane "accident." This is how his father and brother died too (separate plane crashes). I'd like to point out that statistically there is only a 1 in 11,000,000 chance a flight will have an accident. Name me another family that has had that many people die in separate plane crashes.

       Yup. Literally 12 hours after Saudia Arabia tells the 9/11 lawyers "you got nothing" a bunch of Bin Ladens die? Classic scapegoating. Royal Family and the Bush's get away clean, pin everything on the Bin Laden name again, just wait it'll happen.

       His dad died in the 60s in a helicopter crash, an era where aviation was still growing and obviously a non issue as this was before any current problems and his brother was flying an ultralight around really low in a dangerous area. Osama is one of OVER 50 children, and these people in the crash are not even blood relatives, there is literally thousands of potential family members, your not even grasping at straws here.

       I can't comment on a lawsuit but just the pure coincidence of dying in a plane crash are way to 'off' for me. I know they won't expect anyone to kick up a fuss, classic, " you're just a conspiracy nut" syndrome. But really? No one is that stupid to believe it was an accident.
Also, some of the crash site pictures are hilariously inaccurate.

       There's always more than one possible explanation. In this case, I can think of four.
      </p>
      <p>
       One: it is just a coincidence ( not very likely, but possible)
      </p>
      <p>
       Two: Some sort of payback (a lot more likely than #1)
      </p>
      <p>
       Three: There's an effort being made to tie up a few loose ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four: Deception. Kill a few Bin Ladens and reinforce everyone's pre-existing belief that they had a (primary) role in 9/11.
