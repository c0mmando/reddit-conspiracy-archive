<p>We are so constantly being bombarded by this one-sided stance that anyone who might dare question the effectiveness or necessity (much less the risks) is met with preemptive ridicule.</p>

<p>This opens the door for Big Pharma to start insisting we need to be inoculated for anything they say without question. And, of course, anyone who might resist is labeled a tinfoil kook.</p>

<p>I can accept that stance at face value. The less shit floating around out there that can kill/paralyze/make me sick the better!</p>

<p>The responsible way to hold big pharma accountable is to ask the important questions:</p>

<p>-How can we be sure there is enough oversight/3rd party testing of vaccines so we know they&#39;re safe?</p>

<p>-How are we sure taking all of them at once is wise? </p>

<p>-How can we be sure the CDC is insulated from the profit-driven industry well enough to protect us? There&#39;s big money at stake here and big money always brings the risk of corruption. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure what passes for science these days has lots of reasons. Calling it science does not make it so; and I can promise you that vaccines are wrong from start to finish, mercury or no mercury. The day we abandoned natural philosophy is the day real scientific reason died. Science since then has been a death cult, a worshiping of a dying nuclear furnace in the sky. A nihilistic last gasp party celebrating &quot;the inevitable heat death of the universe&quot;. An occult circlejerk where only the initiated can interpret the holy word of the Prophet Einstein. Only a credentialed cleric can weigh the scales of the canonical relativistic laws of physics. Blood for the blood god.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why should I believe injecting disease into healthy bodies is a good thing? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because &quot;dead&quot; hostile bacteria/viruses can still convey important information to our bodies immune system. It teaches our body how to fight something it hasn&#39;t yet, that way if it ever has to it&#39;s already prepared for it. That&#39;s the basic &quot;logic&quot; of it. Our immune system responds to the &quot;dead&quot; disease just as if it were real, at least at first. </p>

<p>Beyond that, sometimes things can go wrong. If not all of the &quot;bad&quot; is killed it&#39;s possible (but rare) for the original disease to infect you, aka &quot;getting the flu from the flu shot&quot;. But hey, sometimes planes crash or cars don&#39;t start... doesn&#39;t mean the science behind engines is wrong. </p>

<p>The science behind the basic theory of vaccines is sound, now does that mean drug companies are always on the level? Heck no. Should we be monitoring them more? I think so. Is there monetary incentive to cover up scandal? Absolutely, to the tune of billions! A vigilant public watch dog + government oversight is important for public safety no doubt, but there&#39;s no reason to get rid of valuable technology just because it&#39;s not perfect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy. Do NOT ever vaccinate. Ever. They are created by scum bag companies who DO NOT GIVE A FUCK AB HUMANS.</p>

<p>Mandatory vaccines are unreal. This is Brave New World stuff.</p>

<p>Big Pharma has the net crawling with trolls and the inherently brainwashed. YOU guys can go get all the shots you want from these SCUM Big Pharma companies.</p>

<p>It boggles my mind how all these people GET MAD and attack people who don&#39;t get vaccines from Corrupt Corporations which have literally committed dozens of crimes and been convicted of these crimes.</p>

<p>Ignorance is bliss I guess.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s trust big PHARMA GUYS! I wouldn&#39;t trust these companies to wash my car let alone INJECT an unknown highly toxic cocktail into my body.</p>

<p>• Routinely bribed doctors with luxury vacations and paid speaking gigs • Fabricated drug safety data and lied to the FDA • Defrauded Medicare and Medicaid out of billions • Deceived regulators about the effectiveness of its drugs • Relied on its deceptive practices to earn billions of dollars selling potentially dangerous drugs to unsuspecting consumers and medical patients</p>
