I&#39;m making a new film &quot;The Empire Unmasked&quot; exposing historical conspiracies, war propaganda, coups, and cover ups, the underworld of intelligence agencies, the global nature of narcotics trafficking, covert mercenaries, terrorist privateers, and of course what really happened on 9/11.  Ask me anything. 
I&#39;m raising money to pay people to make this film better we are about 90% of the way there <a href="http://funding.ancreport.com/projects/the-empire-unmasked/">http://funding.ancreport.com/projects/the-empire-unmasked/</a> everything raised after the goal will turnover into the next film which is about JFK. </p>

<p>Ok it is 10:20 japan time I started at 8:00 
Thanks for the AMA we had good questions. I was pleased. See you later on <a href="http://www.ancreport.com/">http://www.ancreport.com/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well for one it is about 4 hours long.  It will cover 911 so some of the information does overlap with WBD. However there is a lot more on 911 than what I did before. I did not know WBD was going to get a million views. Knowing that I put more effort into this one. I also learned more on the movie side of things than I did before. I am hoping to show the systematic problems we have and how 911 was actually not unique. The US and CIA have been the &quot;911&quot; for many different countries. In fact to scale most coups are far worse in scope and magnitude. This film will be going over events on both sides of the time line, backwards to the banana wars and Iran contra and forwards to Syria and ISIS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ve made several videos about both. 
Sandy Hook seems to me to be a real school shooting and I would like to look into SSRI drugs that were involved in that and many other shootings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so in the JIS report they give clues by saying things like &quot;a business man&quot; or &quot;an individual&quot; but they give an address of one of them, the guy helping Al-Hazmi and Al-Mihdhar with Omar Bayoumi for example. I corss checked that with open sources from NTY and Newsweek for example and deduced another name. Then from that figured out who his wife was, then looks at her bank and so on. Through a long process of deduction, verified by open news sources, I was able to map out the finances of the hijackers. This is a good question because its all explained in The Empire Unmasked. And I am making a text doc with that film for sources. Putting them in the film as screen shots was too cumbersome and confusing. I made a visual map and then link by time stamp to where I am drawling it from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow that will take a long answer.  I think looking for a sweeping quick fix-all is unrealistic. The best things is to chip away at it. That&#39;s how most changes have been with a few exceptions. I think state referendums are under used. But we have seen recently with drug laws for example how state by state people can start making changes to head in the right direction. Ultimately as long term goal though we have got to fix media. Until we can reach enough people very little of substance will change. This is a meta-issue. Step 1 turn off the TV</p>

<p>I believe Hillary will make her way into office, whether by vote machine fraud or otherwise.  There is always a silver lining in every election but it serves a purpose.  Bernie is that guy, and he represents the real change and hope the young people look for (he is the new Ron Paul).</p>

<p>IMO the purpose of having these diamonds in the rough, is to involve a larger populace in voting.   Voting constitutes the consent to have representation.  In other words, voting is the delegation of your personal authority and without sufficient voters, the game is void (tacit consent to be governed).  My 2 cents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would do like JFK or Reagan did and lower the tax rate but still increase the tax revenue. I&#39;d end corporate welfare, stop sending foreign aid, stop waging pointless wars, and possibly tax churches. I&#39;d do a lot of things. Separation of Business and State lays out what is killing our society. Look taxing rich people doesn&#39;t solve anything because tax money just goes to government and government spends trillions on wars and bailouts. This idea that giving the government more money is a solution is laughable there is no benevolent government looking out for the poor. Its better to just not steal people&#39;s money in the first place. How about lowering the cost of living instead of raising wages. Fix utility monopolies, stop guaranteeing student loans and inflating education cost, stop using protective regulations on healthcare industries, enforce anti-trust laws. There are tons and tons of things to do. Raising taxes is not one of them. That&#39;s like giving schools more money and expecting them to preform better. All you do is make them more expensive because the administrations eat the funds. Welfare doesn&#39;t work we have had it for decades and it made things worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks for the in depth reply - I appreciate the candor. I agree with almost everything you are saying, but in the end - the government is beholden to private banks.  Ultimately, after the magic of compounding interest everyone becomes a Greek.</p>

<p>Nearly 50% of taxes go to paying off a debt that constitutionally shouldn&#39;t exist (government printing debt free money towards infrastructure, etc).  This is the head of the snake IMO.  Without anyone attacking it, the solutions are temporary at best.  The US is now akin to a 25 year old with a 16,000 /yr job, and an equal amount of compounding credit card debt.  Kennedy had the right idea and was on target,  but fatally underestimated his opposition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s not the government&#39;s business to be involved in business. Look at African nations for example. If a business took out a loan they have to pay it back with their own money. If they don&#39;t the worst thing that can happen is they go out business. However when government takes out a Liam they have to pay it back with other people&#39;s money and if they don&#39;t they can destroy the whole currency and rob the entire nation and people who had no say in taking the loan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Ryan. Don&#39;t know if you&#39;re still here, buddy. I&#39;m tempted to ramble on incoherently about a bunch of stuff, but out of respect for you I&#39;m just going to ask a really simple question.</p>

<p>In your opinion, is the Israeli state getting stronger or weaker?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve personally experienced Hasbara trolls making brazenly open plays to subvert and manipulate online discussion in a number of different forums. On top of this, the political infrastructure in both the UK and mainland Europe is making renewed efforts to use the law to clamp down hard on those who criticise the Israeli state.</p>

<p>Is this desperation, or do you think they genuinely believe they can force public opinion their way by sweeping through all those who oppose them? Is it a display of power or of fear?</p>

<p>That&#39;s all bro.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

The Iran deal is good for Hezbollah. BDS is gaining ground and so the zionist billionaires are mobilizing against it.

<p>Completely agree with you on that. There needs to be solidarity with the Jewish left. When Jews get critical of Israel, it enrages the neo-cons because they can&#39;t use their generic accusations of anti-Semitism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Racism existed on both sides of the fence.   The articles of Confederation don&#39;t have openly racist things in them.   Our nation is racist now...   Racism didn&#39;t end with the winning of the war.   Racism will continue as long as ANY particular race or group feels they should have special treatment.   Special treatment is not equality.   Equality is what we should be seeking.</p>

<p>I read this a little earlier today:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/06/an-unarmed-white-teen-was-shot-dead-by-police-his-family-asks-where-is-the-outrage/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/06/an-unarmed-white-teen-was-shot-dead-by-police-his-family-asks-where-is-the-outrage/</a></p>

<p>As to the Confederate States... a lot of interesting history if you dig there.   I am opposed to racism, and slavery, but I do not let people enslave my mind by using my emotions against me.   I take in information and try to make a reasoned assessment.</p>

<p>There were even anti-slavery people that fought on the Confederate side.... Why is that?    Ultimately, it wasn&#39;t about slavery... though that ended up being the trigger that could emotionally galvanize action.    Don&#39;t get me wrong though... Slavery was an issue.   There simply was a lot more going on behind the scenes than that and it is often missed by people as it is hidden behind the Slavery/Racism curtain... people immediately think RACISM!!! turn off their mind, and don&#39;t bother looking at any of the other information.    This is naivete.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s because your sort want to steer the discussion AWAY from the slavery that protected in the constitution of the confederates.</p>

<p>Article 1 section 9:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yes, it is written black on white that the point of seceding was to protect the right to owning slaves as is stated in the first god damn article of their constitution.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t naivete, it&#39;s plain racism, put in law. Now you can go on and believe whatever bullshit the libertarians are paying to to believe, I honestly don&#39;t give two fucks, but at least try to be honest.</p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re talking about the articles of confederation, anyone knows those are documents preceding the declaration of independence of the united states and has nothing to do with the confederacy. Are you really mistaking these for the confederate constitution? Or were you bringing them up simply to try and muddy the waters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;sort&quot;... you don&#39;t know what &quot;sort&quot; I am.   Though you are already trying to group me which is bigotry... it is also how racism continues.</p>

<p>I did not know of that article... thanks for sharing it.  So it is not really an issue of &quot;sort&quot;, but I apparently missed that.</p>

<p>but I assure you a lot went on during that Civil War.  That was a big issue but there were other issues that were huge too.   That&#39;s what people who fought for the Confederates that opposed slavery typically were fighting for... though there was also some FEAR conscription stuff going on.</p>

<p>I am not trying to muddy the waters.   My main goal is to get people to realize that what continues to keep racism alive and strong is emphasizing racial difference.    I&#39;d like you, myself, and every other person to be treated EQUAL regardless of race, religion, sexual preference, gender, etc.   First and foremost I&#39;d like to see people as thinking of themselves not as part of a sub-group but instead simply as the HUMAN group.</p>

<p>Right now if you say &quot;Black lives matter&quot; that would get a completely different reaction than &quot;White lives matter&quot;.   Why?   One is politically correct at the moment, yet both statements are racist.    &quot;Human lives matter&quot; or &quot;All Lives matter&quot;, yet if I say &quot;Human lives matter&quot; the people from PETA might take offense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get paid by anyone.   Oh I did have another agenda.   The Civil War was not just about Slavery... the Confederate states did have some things they said that were &quot;Valid&quot; and a good point.   That doesn&#39;t make slavery right.</p>

<p>Slavery is not right at any point regardless of the &quot;Race&quot; of the slave.   So again I thank you for that article...  I learned something.</p>

<p>EDIT: Upvote for giving me an answer I learned something from.  Even though you tried to group me into a &quot;sort&quot;.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I decided to go one further.   I agree the Civil War was predominantly about Slavery and likely would not have occurred if not for that conflict.   However, I have seen some OTHER points brought up by Confederates that were valid.   It is likely it was them trying to justify their actions as being something other than slavery.   That doesn&#39;t make everything they had to say without reason.   Go back far enough though and Slavery is at the root of that war.   I mainly take umbrage to shutting ones mind down to information due to the negative actions of one person or group.   If that were the way we should behave then based upon the actions of the U.S. around the world  no one should listen to us because of the negative things we&#39;ve done.   However, we have done some good things, had some good ideas, etc.    It&#39;s not all bad.   It&#39;s also not all good.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: The south/confederate states went to war (fired the first shot too) over slavery.   The north went to war to keep the union together.   Lincoln even does not go against slavery in his inaugural address.    Though as the war progressed this changed.</p>

<p>EDIT 4: If you know where I can sign up to talk about Libertarianism and get paid for it, let me know.   I most identify with their platform.  I see the status quo administration as claiming to be for our best interests but all you have to do is look at the results of their claims regardless of party.   So I am not for GOP or Democrat.   I am also not so much strictly Libertarian.   I am a human.   I&#39;d consider voting for any of them if their voting record matches their speeches.   If their actions match their words, and I agree with their words.   I don&#39;t care about parties.   In fact I think the grouping and parties are huge part of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to see an open mind at work, I&#39;m not myself opposed to looking at all the points the confederates tried to make, whether to justify slavery or not. What I remain shocked at is how many libertarian talking heads try to make the civil war about something else than slavery.

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of it is that there are some pretty big issues that lead up the civil war that were not about slavery, and because our education system is so censored and shaped for specific things most people don&#39;t know that side of the civil war.   Yet I believe pretty much every U.S. educated person knows about the slavery aspect.   As a child and growing up Lincoln was my favorite president primarily due to the slavery issue.   It was only way later in life while I was self educating that I learned he did many of the things that began the process of the executive branch grabbing more power and shifting the balance of power.   That has continued since then with some presidents being worse than others.   Lincoln is no longer my favorite president, but I am glad slavery ended, and will always stand up for fighting that.</p>

<p>A lot of people discover Libertarianism and begin a path of thinking about different things.   Libertarianism is a very deep rabbit hole with many passages.   So you will have some people at various depths in that hole, and on completely different paths that speak up at times.   That does not make them representative of Libertarians as a whole.   There are far more types of people than Democrat, Republican, and Libertarian.    Just in my house alone I have more than three different perspectives.   It is dangerous to GROUP people up, but that is what the party system does.   That leads to US against THEM.   It seems like we try to turn everything into a sporting event or war, with US and the ENEMY.   This is where bigotry, and racism come from too.   Grouping people by race rather than just treating everyone as a human.   As long as people view themselves part of a race rather than just considering themselves a human we&#39;ll have the seeds for racism.   This applies to other forms of bigotry too.   It seems to be human nature to group up, and attack.  They&#39;ve seen this in studies of very young children.</p>

<p>Anyway... Quite the digression there on my part.   I don&#39;t really group myself with any political group.   I tend towards the Anarcho-Capitalist vein of Libertarian, but I don&#39;t adhere to any particular stance completely.   I try to keep an open mind and use reason and keep emotions as much in check as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put the blame on the Federal Reserve where it belongs.   It IS a private entity (though has the name Federal in it&#39;s title), so it is a Corporation.   It is in charge of all of the money, and has been through all of the depressions (&quot;recessions&quot;).   They were granted this power by our government during the time of Woodrow Wilson.   They were the prototype for the rest of the centralized Banks that are in all but a few places in the world.    Yet, this is also protected and empowered by the government.   The Federal Reserve cannot exist without the administration/government approval.   Their chair person is appointed by the President with Congressional Approval.   So, yes if you want to refer to the central bank.... the federal reserve, then YES I do blame it.   Yet, it is only the state that has empowered it, and the fact it control&#39;s the money is NOT a free market.   Which is why I believe I defined what I mean when I use the word Capitalist.   I am referring to free market capitalism, not crony capitalism, or corporatism.   The federal reserve is an arm of the latter two.   We have not had a free market for some time and that is partially what the Federal Reserve came into existence to control, thus no longer free.   There was a reason the founding fathers of the U.S. (most of them) were against Central Banks.   Yet banks as we know them today could not exist and operate in a truly free market.    </p>

<p>As to financial deregulating... what are they deregulating?   Essentially they are deregulating gambling.   I am not against a person gambling with their own money, though the ability to gamble with other people&#39;s money cannot exist without government intervention.   Well, I suppose it could if you willfully gave your money to an entity that you know they gamble on your behalf to try to give you profit.   If it is lost then that would be your problem, and responsibility.    Such a place and the people involved in operating it would not survive long in a free market.   However, when the government and the Federal reserve get involved the deregulation you are talking about allows people to gamble without your permission, or your knowledge they are doing so.   The fact you cannot demand information about what is being done with your money can only exist if the state Protects something and prevents you from having such a right.   Thus, no free market.</p>

<p>Basically it boils down to Cronyism being the &quot;root of all evil&quot; if you want to look for such a root, and cronyism seems to eventually infect all organizations bet they governments, capitalism, socialism, communism, religions, corporations, etc.    I have a theory of my own on why cronyism rises to the top and I&#39;ve only come up with one thing that might work to fix that, but that&#39;d be an even longer post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry but whenever I hear &quot;free market&quot; I remember that that was the economic system invented by the British Empire to keep it&#39;s dependencies subjugated by it&#39;s almighty financial power. There&#39;s no such thing as a free market when you have corporations who can buy out any government on earth, it&#39;s simply impossible to just hope that these corporations won&#39;t use their power to buy out politicians or lawmakers. There&#39;s also no such thing as a free market but that&#39;s another discussion. </p>

<p>I personally believe in the American system of economics embodied by people like FDR, Hamilton or Kennedy: a large private sector but also a government powerful enough to regulate the private sector and incentivize certain areas of research like Kennedy did with the space race or FDR did with the TVA, creating millions of high wage jobs. Where the free market encourages cheap labor, the American system encourages high wages and productivity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Free Market was not invented.   The term may have been invented.   Free Market is when people can freely exchange amongst each other for whatever goods, currencies, etc they agree to.   It is totally up to the parties what they offer and receive in that exchange.   A Free Market has absolutely nothing to do with the State/Government.   That is why we haven&#39;t had free markets, though people like yourself seem to think we did.   If the state is involved and making decisions about it, and manipulating it in any way then it is not free.</p>

<p>EDIT: The closest thing we have to it at the moment is the bitcoin market.   Though that is just one form of currency.  A free market would mean YOU get to decide what YOU are willing to exchange for goods, or your time.  Though if you are asking for an exchange or price that no one is interested in the exchange may not happen.   It is voluntary.   It doesn&#39;t even have to be a currency.   Currencies just make it easy and more portable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we should never had put sanctions on them to begin with. The Iran deal on a whole is a good thing. They get 100 billion dollars and they will be allowed to make nuclear energy for electricity. This is big because it frees up oil that they currently consume on electricity and will allow them to put in on the open market and make money. this helps everyone as competition lowers the price of oil which has many industry verticals. Some thing 100 billion is not so much. I disagree. Its not just the money its that Iran will be in the black not the red. Tha means they can pay for their own things and they will not have to borrow money and become a bank slave. </p>

<p>Unfortunately the reaction to the deal has been bad as Israel has brow beat the US into giving them 1.9 billion more a year on top of the 3 billion they already steal. The reason for this is because 75% the money is earmarked to be spent back on US weapons. The MIC and Israel have the &quot;special relationship.&quot; Also I am really mad about letting Johnathan Pollard out of jail in November. And that was because of the Iran deal. The US has to pay Israel off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats a very interesting video from Bibi... but how can you claim that the petrodollar doesn&#39;t matter?   once the Bretton Woods agreement dissolved (the gold exchange rates), isn&#39;t the petrodollar now the main factor in preserving the dollars world reserve status?  (which is what allows the US to accrue exponentially increasing debt).  If the petrodollar dissolves, a bretton woods 2.0 agreement would follow suit.  And the loss of USA&#39;s reserve status would most likely send the dollar into  much higher inflation rates.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>read the link I sent so that you may better understand what the reserve status really is. Look Iran, India and Japan all stepped off the petro dollar in the same year and it did not do a thing.  Its an exchange. It is like getting 4 quarters instead of a dollar. If I said you have to pay for gas in quarters, a dollar would still be four quarters no matter how much people demand quarters. Its like putting bills in a machine so you can play video games with coins. If you&#39;re currency is growing faster than the dollar like the Euro then it is good for you because you trade in Euros you get more dollars than the labor you put in to get the Euros and so your gas is actually cheaper. This petro dollar theme has been promoted by Rivero and Alex Jones and its just as stupid as peak oil. It has nothing to do with why we went to war in Iraq. They claim Saddam was getting on the Euro. 
1 the war propaganda for Iraq started in 1997 before the Euro or EU even existed. All the 2001-2003 bs was recycled papers form the neocons written in the 90s
2 There is no evidence Saddam was even doing this. Wikipeadia links to the economist but its not actually on the economist its just a comment that some random person made on the economist article with the claim about Saddam. 
3 There is overwhelming evidence that the US went to war for Israel. Colin Powell went to the UN with a mock vile of anthrax and read a speech prepared for him by dual ciziten Israelis. The entire Anthrax was from Al Qaeda who got it from Iraqis in Prague MYTH was created by the Israelis. They stated they witnessed a transfer of anthrax there. The anthrax notes also read death to America death to Israel. And yet we know now that Iraq didn&#39;t have anthrax and neither did Al qaeda. So guess who really sent it then... not petrodollars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your estimation of the recent (<a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/21/missed-calls-nsa-terrorism-osama-bin-laden-mihdhar/">foreignpolicy.com</a>) revelations that the NSA wasn&#39;t able to make the geospatial connection between Tweedle Dee &amp; Dum (Khalid al-Mihdhar in California &gt;&gt;&gt; Osama bin Laden in Yemen) prior to 9/11? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beyond eavesdropping on satellite signals from dishes on the ground, the NSA was also able to get inside satellites themselves, often through <strong>covert agreements with personnel of telecommunications companies and occasionally without the knowledge of upper management</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...companies like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmarsat">Inmarsat</a> (based in London) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuraya">Thuraya</a> (based in the United Arab Emirates).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#39;Our secret was that the Thuraya system had been broken for a long time—deep state secret,&#39; the [<em>anonymous</em> NSA] source said. The NSA, in other words, was able to monitor every call going into and out of the al Qaeda operations center in Yemen...including the <strong>221 calls</strong> that came in from bin Laden’s phone in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>After 9/11, <strong>Thomas Drake</strong>, a member of the <strong>NSA’s Senior Executive Service</strong>, was assigned to provide an overview of what the agency knew at the time of the attacks to a Senate subcommittee during a closed-door hearing. In his research, Drake discovered the transcripts of the calls from Mihdhar to the Sanaa [bin Laden] operations center. &#39;We essentially had <strong>cast-iron coverage</strong> on that safe house at least since 1996. People don’t realize how much NSA actually knew about the network,&#39; he told me during a recent dinner. &#39;Some of the best analysts, traditionally trained analysts, had essentially in early ’01 put together a pretty good picture,&#39; Drake added. (He left the agency in 2007 and was later indicted for leaking NSA documents to the Baltimore Sun. Those charges were eventually dismissed).</p>

<p>&#39;Inmarsat calls were very important,&#39; he said, &#39;and we knew that because NSA had told us … not only [in] the run-up to 9/11, but to the attacks in East Africa [in 1998] and other places.&#39; After collecting and translating its part of the intelligence, the CIA would request the remaining intelligence from the NSA &#39;so we could better understand it,” he said. “But we never got it.&#39;</p>

<p><strong>&#39;We sent about 250 electronic messages … and not one of them was ever answered</strong>,&#39; he claims. Nor did the NSA share the information with the FBI, according to the 9/11 Commission. </p>

<p>How were certain key phone numbers missed in surveillance—or were they at all? And why did the NSA refuse to share with the CIA and FBI the full details of what it collected from bin Laden’s operations center in Yemen?</p>

<p>This makes sense.</p>

<p>On a side note, did you notice the &quot;Inmarsat&quot; connection to Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 (via Wikipedia link above)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In March 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 passengers and crew en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. After turning away from its planned path and disappearing from radar coverage, <strong>the aircraft&#39;s satellite data unit remained in contact with Inmarsat&#39;s ground station in Perth</strong> via the IOR satellite. The aircraft used Inmarsat&#39;s Classic Aero service, which does not provide <strong>explicit</strong> information about the aircraft&#39;s location. Analysis of these communications by Inmarsat and independently by other agencies determined that the aircraft flew [explicitly] into the southern Indian Ocean.</p>

Things are not free to make they take lots of time to research and produce that&#39;s the reality of the situation. If im taking time off a paying job to work on the film then the film has to at least pay for itself. The more it make the more every gets in the future. </p>

<p>Hm, you should at least read the book if you&#39;re going to be that dismissive.</p>

<p>Not exactly. Where did you get that information?</p>

<p>Very credible researchers have put a lot of weight on Haslam/Baker&#39;s claims.</p>

<p>In all due respect, I wouldn&#39;t be so hasty to dismiss them, <em>especially</em> if you&#39;re making film on JFK.</p>

<p>IMO, it&#39;s a crucial piece of the puzzle, and should <em>not</em> be neglected.</p>

If someone is screaming about something like it is an imminent threat for example Ebola will go airborne, fukushima has radiation coming to California, Y2K will blow up nuclear sites, and then of course none of that happens and no real evidence was ever provided for those things anyway, then I would stop listening to that person especially if they never come back and say hey we said these things and you know what we were wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Ryan!</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had several AMA guests in the past who specialize in the concept of &quot;Breakaway Civilizations.&quot;</p>

<p>What&#39;s your opinion on the topic? Could there be a connection between a hypothetical Breakaway Civilization and the Deep State that was responsible for 9/11?</p>

<p>Do you think some sort of exotic technology was used on 9/11 (doesn&#39;t have to be Judy Wood-related)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Judy Wood is dead wrong. As for Breakaway Civ... it was more like a multinational shadow government which came as an outgrowth of intelligence agencies that grew enormously out of WWII. They have been carrying out covert operations for corporate interests not security interest for decades. Half a century now actually and this did contribute to 911. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who wants israel to exist and why?</p>

<p>It seems unlikely to me that the wealthy and powerful (both Israeli and non-Israeli) who support Israel do so because they care about the people who live there. Israel&#39;s value to them has to be in something else.</p>

<p>It is not a home for the Jewish people so miss me with that explanation. Jews are safer in the US and Europe. But even if they did need a homeland Canaan would be a poor choice. There are many places that are more fertile and safe.</p>

<p>Is it the proximity to oil or the control over Asian bound Caspian crude? Why would the company running the trans-israel pipeline prefer to fight to maintain it rather than trying to profit from another route? I realize that the money spent on protecting that monopoly probably exceeds the profits that are made but that money comes from the US not israel. Then again many of the people who support Israel are Americans;They pay for the wars to protect the Trans-Israel monopoly. Is it really worth it?</p>

<p>Is it to have a place to keep an eye on Saudi Arabia and make sure they manipulate currency in the favor of American banks? </p>

<p>I realize that the US only acts on behalf of Israel but what is Israel&#39;s value to the US? And what is it&#39;s value to the American zionists who support it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Ryan, I&#39;ve been following your youtube channel for the past few years and your analysis on geopolitics and social commentary has been hugely influential for me. So thank you for your awesome coverage world events. I promise I will donate one day when I get the money.</p>

<p>So one question I have is your thoughts on degeneracy.  You seem to have a libertarian perspective to a lot of your thinking, but at what point do we draw a line? For example, currently the media is constantly pushing transexuality, and they are winning seeing as how it is considered bigotry to refer to a transexual by their born (and actual) gender. It would appear that it will only get worse from here. Is there anyway to solve this for the better of the nation without being completely authoritarian? On one hand I want freedom to do what you please but on the other the stuff the media pushes these days is disgusting.</p>

<p>Second, I am curious as to your estimates of how many Jews died in the holocaust. </p>

<p>And lastly, you are mentioned often on 8chan&#39;s /pol/ board. You should do an AMA over there. it&#39;s a solid environment, much better than 4chan&#39;s. </p>

<p>Cheers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo ryan, Ive seen some of your documentaries and im friends with you on FB. some questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>well this isnt so much a question, but honestly, if i were you, id cool it with the anti-transgender posts. Its bad PR honestly and there really isnt a reason for it.</p></li>
<li><p>In your documentary about 9/11, i forget what it was caleld but i remember it was like 3 hours long and involved the anthrax attacks, the oklahoma city bombings, and the iraq war, you referanced alot of facts that were true, and tied them together in an interesting way. However, you also referenced rumors (israelis cheering on 9/11 in that van or whatever), and things which are entirely debunked (like the 2 trillion missing comment Rumsfeld made on 9/10/01) as fact. IMO your argument wouldve been stronger if you acknowledged they were disputed.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Sorry if im coming off as hostile, i usually like the stuff you post, i just want to hear your comments as these 2 things bother me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi Ryan. Thanks for putting yourself in the firing line. I&#39;m new to your work and am interested in folks that blow the whistle on shitty things being done to the populace. I do however believe in vetting those folks we&#39;d call true and right and have a question that just punches me in the face in need of asking.</p>

<p>A quick google search paints you as a rabid &#39;holocaust is a hoax&#39; proselytizer. If true can you point me to any truly compelling evidence outside of the usual shallow points seen in places like the racially charged and ignorance fueled parts of 4chan? </p>

<p>That stuff just doesn&#39;t hold water for me, and while I don&#39;t even care about the topic much, I&#39;d love to think a guy with your exposure and influence is spending his time on the things that are actually and actively harming us rather than something so easily refuted and proven wrong and in turn just a giant red herring for the easily influenced folks in the hive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a mistake to say there’s such a thing as “Holocaust lite.” There is only accuracy or inaccuracy. This is not a sport in which “extreme” is a goal. It’s also a mistake to claim that Irving’s views somehow coincide with his prison release. Some of his strongest pro-extermination material is from “Hitler’s War” and the Goebbels book, both pre-prison. If anything more recent caused Irving to alter his views, his ill-advised defamation case did expose a few weaknesses in his revisionism. But there’s no evidence his prison sentence affected his views. Irving, Mark Weber, and I all came to a very similar conclusion regarding the most accurate historiography of the Holocaust. We did it separately and not in cahoots with each other (I have not seen or spoken to Irving since 1995). It’s a historiography that pleases no one who approaches Holocaust history ideologically. It’s too revisionist for the mainstream, not nearly revisionist enough for the deniers. I can’t speak for Weber or Irving, but for me, I have no problem with disappointing all extremes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re being disingenuous with this question, but the way you&#39;ve written it sounds a lot like the style of language used by people who <em>are</em> putting forward what is actually a very strongly held opinion veiled diaphanously as a question.</p>

<p>Psychoanalyzing, you come across as either someone very much attached to the holocaust narrative, such as an ardent zionist, or (and I&#39;m going with this one) someone who has absorbed this mindset on account of the company they keep, not realizing that those around them are in fact presenting their very much biased opinion about the holocaust as if it were purely objective common sense.</p>

<p>rabid proselytizer, shallow points, racially charged, ignorance fueled, easily refuted, proven wrong, red herring, easily influenced... quite a collection of emotionally-charged bigrams, my friend!</p>

<p>What&#39;s the genesis of all this hate, man? What&#39;s it to you? What&#39;s your stake in this? Surely, any evidence emerging that whatever happened to the jews in WW2 wasn&#39;t as bad as we thought is a damn good thing. For every decrement of the 6 million figure, that&#39;s one less horrific death sustained on this earth. It was just a story. Your mom used to say that to you as a kid when you were frightened and you felt reassured, but now you&#39;ve grown up and what gives? You&#39;d be disappointed to hear they didn&#39;t really shoot Bambi&#39;s mother? </p>

<p>I am pretty sure his policy position was exactly what Ryan said; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>end wars, end the fed, cut corporate welfare, no bailouts, end foreign aid, abolish the IRS and several cabinets, and reduce spending by trillions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which are exactly the biggest problems we as Americans faces,  as well as the rest of the world face.  If he could have done half of these things,  there&#39;d be plenty of money to fund social security and the social safety net as you called it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah except that his campaign proposal wasn&#39;t that at all. You can look it up in the wayback machine if you want he proposed to cut 1/3 out of social programs like medicare, medicaid and food stamps, again, IN THE MIDDLE OF A DEPRESSION.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very cute for all the libertarians to try and impose nice thoughts and nice ideals on their political &quot;heroes&quot; but it might be good for everyone as a whole if that group could look itself in the mirror and think a bit more about everything. </p>

<p>From where I stand, libertarianism is for tools who want to commit suicide by cutting all the programs helping the poor, all the time listening to some old fart who made his followers off of the 9/11 truth movement and then stabbed that same movement in the back once he got back on national TV.</p>
