    <div class="md"><h2>The official government conspiracy theory in regards 9/11 and subsequent reports, are scientifically impossible, completely ridiculous and based purely on fantasy.</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles</p>

<p>This is evidenced by the fact the four simulations that NIST performed with their &quot;global LS-DYNA model&quot; None of the computer animations look anything like the actual observed collapse, the models and alleged simulations are not based in reality</p>

<hr/>

<p>Take a look</p>

<a href="http://i.imgur.com/3YLz3j3.jpg">7</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST’s investigation absolutely begins and ends in the realm of computer simulation, manipulating the numbers to try and achieve the observed conditions, which they couldn’t even do, regardless of this fact, a computer simulation does not constitute an explanation and computer modelling is, at best, only as good as the input it receives and NIST will not give us their numbers</p>

<p>They never even bothered to fully model the structure</p>

<p>And as far as the “withheld data due to national security” goes, until it is known and is in the public domain, it will be impossible for outsiders to know exactly what it supports, as it is right now, the NIST report can be considered a work of science fiction </p>

<p>Their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The fact that Building 7 underwent free-fall means that none of the building’s potential energy was used to crush the structure below it. All of its potential energy was converted directly into energy of motion (kinetic energy), leaving no energy to do anything else. Therefore, the lower section of the building could not have been crushed by the falling section. The destruction of at least 8 stories of the lower section of the building had to have been accomplished by other means to allow the upper section of the building to fall through it in free-fall.</p>

<p>NIST’s theory is that the failure of a single column near the east end of the building caused neighboring columns to fail in a progressive manner. This is contradicted by the observed simultaneous collapse across the entire width of the building, which fell with a level roofline. A progressive collapse mechanism would have led to a progression of failures, visible deformation of the building, and gradual, asymmetrical collapse. This is what NIST’s computer model shows, but it is not what was observed. What we observed was the sudden onset of free-fall across the entire width of the building, which can only be achieved by controlled demolition.</p>

<p><strong>Conspiracy</strong> - a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful</p>

<p>Bin Laden and his 19 merry men, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Theory</strong> - a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The US government explains that 19 hijackers crashed four aircraft, two into the WTC towers 1&amp;2, collapsing three towers 1,2&amp;7, they postulate WTC collapsed at freefall for 2.25 seconds, because fires, although they over no evidence, just a theory.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Which part of the US government conspiracy <strong>AND</strong> theory do you not agree with, or is it that you do not agree with the English language and it&#39;s meaning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This may be down to the fact that in 1967, the CIA created the label &quot;Conspiracy Theorists&quot;  to attack anyone who challenges the &quot;Official Narrative&quot;</p>

<p>Again, this is proven beyond a doubt, you can google this and read the official memo yourself.</p>

<p>This label is still being used today to label people who research the events surrounding 9/11, you have to ask yourself why this is, especially considering you will not find any American who totally agrees with the official conspiracy theory, because it makes no sense at all.</p>
