       We know that the Internet is fucking rigged! If I have to see one more redditor go off on the fact that reddit is controlled opposition or whatever I'll flip out for real. We all fucking know this. We are here to read, communicate, grab a quick piece of information and go on with our lives. Posting on reddit wasn't gonna do anything, that wasn't going to save the day. Being a REAL PERSON is where the change is coming from. Taking the time to alter your life, to transition into a new society, to survive the coming calamities; or, to accept our fate and tell others so that they may choose for themselves. Stop getting worked up about the way the world is. Sit back and have a beer, enjoy a sunset. Then wake up, do your job, show compassion, and find time to change your habits. Stop eating so much shit, stop wasting so much time on entertaining yourself when you could be bettering yourself.

       This part drives me the most insane with family and friends. It's a never-ending bread-and-circus show with them. I get asked
       <em>
        constantly
       </em>
       to join another selfie party at some sports bar or casino hotel room - everyone standing around holding big gulps filled with booze scrolling their phones. Twilight Zone on steroids.

       These things wouldn't be inherently bad if people were more responsible with their time, but we have bred a generation of people who are addicted to technology. I myself use my iPhone for my job and for a number of other things. If more people could moderate their own lives and show everyone how trivial all this social exposure is, we could come full circle with this addiction. The truth is, this way of living isn't sustainable; at all. I personally have let go of trying so hard to get others to see though. I think it's more important to work on myself so I can help others, and connect with people who are already on this journey.

       Read it its amazing. Go find an annotation to it. There also is a seriously good podcast by Frank Delaney that goes line by line. Go through the first few pages with Delaney and if you fall in love keep it up. It has so much. Everything imbedded in that book.

       It's been said of Joyce that he's the only writer in the English language who only wrote masterpieces.  You can't really go wrong with any of his works.  They're intimidating and dense and not easy reading, no doubt about it, but they're worth it - there's a reason he's held in such high regard.  It is literally impossible to read one of his books and
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be introduced to ideas and references and concepts that you've never heard of or considered before.  The man was a genius.

       Dear ihopeitsround,
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sensible and accurate advice is not going to go over well with the sizeable portion of r/conspiracy's contributors who believe that posting on an internet forum where everyone agrees with you is "getting the word out" and actually accomplishing something. These people labor under the delusion that they are somehow "fighting a battle," although apparently it's the sort of battle that doesn't involve getting up out of your chair or actually doing anything at all. They will read your advice and although you are correct, they will complain.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3fr7fd/wake_the_fuck_up/ctr5o4b">
        As a matter of fact they're already complaining.

       It just sucks because I am trying to do what I can to stimulate friction in my life and here online; to cause change. That's my only goal, in life, in general. People like you who may be on the fence or whatever, the way you brush us aside and spout falsehoods about us without thinking, it's detrimental. We are on the same damn team.

       You are somewhat correct, but let me leave you with this one thought.  How can you change the world if you cannot even change yourself?  I've been in this sub a long time and felt like you did, and I really wanted the world to change.  Eventually, I came to the singular realization that maybe instead of changing the world I just needed to change myself.

       I have come to the same realization and if you didn't get that out of the OP you didn't understand it. I just have so much care and interest in the world, I have to contribute. Let me leave you with an alternate perspective, because I've been down this philipsohical road for awhile. If everyone just bettered themselves, who takes care of the sick? Who makes the bacon? Who keeps an eye on the crimes of governments? Both the eastern and the western ways of thinking and living are rigged. The truth is somewhere in the middle. We're supposed to USE our focus and our attention to better ourselves AND our environment. Eventually enough people will be there, but we're sure as fuck not there yet.

       You post a lot of these sorts of things. Don't expect salvation and change to come from any individual, group, -ism, authority figure or from anywhere other than yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect you're so worked up because you haven't made the change(s) yourself and you're hoping for a momentum to join. If I'm wrong, why don't you post evidence of your own progress in order to inspire rather than posting wandering browbeating rants?

       Haha. I am by no means perfect but I am dilligently applying change to my life. Primarily, the way I treat other people. I treat them with respect. Secondly, my diet; I have eliminated meat as an addiction; sometimes I go a week with no meat. Eventually I hope to be completely vegan. Furthermore, I read a lot; I drink in different ideas, different perspectives. I work two jobs, am going back to school, and I support numerous other people spiritually, emotionally, and financially. Your on to something about me posting rants on here and me wanting others to join in on my ideas. However, it's not out of any kind of egoic struggle I'm facing. Why would I ever need to post proof of something like these? We're just two people on the Internet, having a conversation. I don't give a shit if you are having trouble believing in my authenticity; just message me privately if you wanna chat. I'm more of a private person.

       I just meant that expecting others to make the changes you want is a good way to waste your energy. The changes you're making pretty much parallel my own but I don't expect other people to do it. What I'm getting at is to lead by example instead of just telling people what to do.

       Okay. Well your absolutely right, I guess I am having kind of an emotional day. I do struggle everyday with something but I have crossed a threshold this year that I'm not going back on. I have to deal with a lot of people who are what I would call "falsely woken up" as in they think they are living an enlightened life but it is clear, at least to me, they aren't. That's where the OP came from, I have had a couple of mindboggling philosophical conversations lately. I never intend on tell others what to do.

       Thanks, OP.  Its a challenge in our world to live genuinely, and true to what we really want for ourselves.  Although I'm nobody close to who I want to be, your post at least got me to eat a salad tonight.    :-)   I need to stop caring about fucking video games, dude.  :-(

       Haha hey man I'm not trying to say don't have fun; just also find time to be constructive. Personally I drink, I smoke a joint here or there. I'm only 22 years old. I just, daily, work on my behaviors. I write it down, I take time to plan for the future. I have loads of water stored up. Just be the best you you can be; be thoughtful of your community; pick up litter; feed a homeless man if you run into one. Yada yada. I'm not asking anyone to solve world hunger, just love as much as you can, all the time. And good job on the salad man I'm trying to do that kind of thing just for health purposes. But also, for spiritual reasons.

       For me, this sub is about talking relatively anonymously and openly, without consequence, about what I perceive to be the greatest injustices of our time because we simply can't in public.  This is a place where normal, good people with everyday livelihoods can go to catch a fleeting glimpse of what's propping up our cultural illusions.  I think, for me, what I'd ultimately like to aim toward is expressing myself about these topics through art or protest.  I think that'd be real love and courage.  The small stuff is great, but we can't exactly get justice for 9/11 by eating salad and picking up trash, right?  I think we all come here to vent and learn because we're afraid of the consequences of doing it with our friends and families, let alone acquaintances and passersby.
