    <div class="md"><p>The Holocaust is beyond my lifetime and I steer clear of forming an opinion about it for that reason. Could it have been an epic Zionist ruse? Well, given the lack of physical evidence supporting it, then yes, it could. Does that mean it was? No, not necessarily. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll defend anybody&#39;s right to question anything they like though, without people cutting out cherry-picked quotes and using them as smear attacks. People who question the holocaust are usually met with the counter-argument that they are Holocaust deniers, which of course is not an appeal to reason, but rather to anger.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>did you ever consider that germany killed around 26 million russian soldiers but somehow couldnt kill the jews over many years inside their own borders? if their objective was to exterminate it would have been similar to the 20+ million white christians murdered by the jews during the bolshevic revolution. that and the 6 million number goes back all the way to the 1800&#39;s. jews have been milking it for over a century. its a load of shit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s particularly accurate. Firstly, many of the Russian soldiers they killed <em>were</em> Jews, and the same goes for the Poles. Secondly, I don&#39;t believe it was Hitler&#39;s intent to wipe out all the Jews. There were many people with Jewish heritage fighting in the German army.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is not accurate. The Bolshevic revolution wasn&#39;t a religious genocide. A political one, certainly, but it simply is not true to say the Bolshevik revolution was a Jewish genocide. Most of the deaths in your 20 million total were ordered by or occurred because of Stalin, and Stalin wasn&#39;t Jewish. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t make sense, either there was the mass murder with the attempt of genocide on the part of germany or not. If they had wanted to exterminate the jews, it would have been well within their capability. There wouldnt have been some farcical medical experiments and snydley whiplash-esque devilry going on. The nazis are a caricature of evil villains, more akin to a bond movie than real life.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a Jewish revolution. Just because some of the instigators were Jewish does not make it a &quot;Jewish revolution&quot;. It was a politically-driven (i.e. Marxist) revolution.</p>

<p>What an utterly absurd thing to say. You might just as well claim that general relativity is &quot;a Jewish concept&quot;, because it was written by a Jew. Or perhaps electricity is a semi-Buddhist concept? You know, because of Tesla? There is no causal relationship between Judaism and Marxism, and I would implore you to stop inventing such relationships where they do not exist in order to serve your own personal bias. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. One can&#39;t say about Buddhism or science, that people have an in-group bias or favoritism. It&#39;s not esoteric, there is free exchange of information without regard to personal anything. The same CANNOT be said about Judaism and Semites. Jews are known for the tendency for nepotism, its a global stereotype that exists because their holy text command them to segregate themselves from gentiles. Show me the corollary in science or buddhism to that. Jews work for the betterment of Jews, while whites are expected to police and fix the world. So global and cultural Marxism is being used to expand the power base of the Jewish people and have been since at least the establishment of England&#39;s first national bank by Lord Baron Rothschild who was a Jew. We then see England and France declare war on the only real opponent of communism at the time, Germany. Who was Prime Minister of England? Oh Winston Churchill, a Jew. Who led the Bolshevic communist revolution in Russia? Leon Trotsky, who&#39;s real name was Lev Bronstein, a tailor from the South side of Brooklyn. Gee is there a pattern emerging? How about that out of 19 traitors executed by the US govt, 18 of them were Jews? Marxism is a Jewish organization the same way the Mafia is Italian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was sarcasm obviously but it was based on a claim in the NTY that actually did try to say Jews were fed to a bear and an eagle. Adam Holland decided to seize on that and ignore everything else i ever said. The video he took a screenshot of opens up by saying, I don&#39;t deny &quot;the&quot; holocaust. What I take issue with is the word &quot;the&quot; as many people have been killed because of who they were and by the millions. Jews were also killed in WWII (but not every exaggeration bears and eagles, human hair mattresses, soap and lampshades, included, is true) as were many other people including Germans and Japanese etc. However when America killed Vietnamese (by the millions) or Koreans, or Iraqis, or when the IMF starves to death millions of Africans, none of those are considered holocausts or met with the same stigma and association to evil as Nazi Germany is for WWII. I for one think killing is killing. How can a country sitting on Native American graves preach about ideology as if it is innocent? If we are to stop killing people the &quot;winners&quot; of war must also be held accountable for their crimes, or at least acknowledge them. </p>

<p>His appearance on Piers Morgan&#39;s show was absolutely epic, and woke a lot of people up out of their slumber.  The fact that he brought up building 7 and Operation Gladio on national TV is absolutely a good thing.  </p>

<p>I was also really interested in learning more about Urban Moving systems, how Kathrine Smiths death is thrown in there, was there any update on her suspicious death? And I heard about Sergei and Denko getting arrested, did they work for Urban Moving? </p>

<p>Much appreciated, and so many more questions :) </p>

<p>Can you give any hints as to what your new film will uncover? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does this guy really think the holocaust didn&#39;t happen? No matter how on point he is with other topics, if true this paints him as a fruitcake imo. Not anything different from the ignorant masses of super trolls on 4chan, but with a bigger audience than most I&#39;m sure. I&#39;ve heard the arguments out there for the holo denial, but it&#39;s not going to change the people I&#39;ve met that went through it and have family that did. I am looking forward to this shitstorm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;ll certainly be worth a shot. I&#39;ve read the threads with all the &#39;evidence&#39; of it being a hoax so I&#39;d be surprised if he had anything new to bring to the table besides that shallow tripe that&#39;s easily squashed by some critical thinking. But thinking  critically isn&#39;t really something I&#39;ve witnessed others with shared opinions liking to practice. It shits all over too many of their emotionally rewarding points and it&#39;s too easy these days to get a hive of folks to agree blindly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even someone that cares too much about the topic at all, but given there&#39;s so much actual conspiracy going on that&#39;s relevant and actively harming us, it makes him look like a giant red herring to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for answering.  I agree with a lot of what you said actually, except for </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And when he is on BBC or CNN he doesn&#39;t miss a chance to act like a lunatic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>His appearance on Piers Morgan&#39;s show was absolutely epic, and woke a lot of people up out of their slumber.  The fact that he brought up building 7 and Operation Gladio on national TV is absolutely a good thing.  </p>

<p>The fact that you look at that as a negative thing, and are actually siding with Piers Morgan&#39;s side on this, says quite a lot about you my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can see how he would form his own counter-intelligence agency of sorts through a media network which attracted like minded thinkers. It&#39;s a common practice in the last 20-30 years stemming from think tanks and research institutes; now amplified by the rise of internet communications.</p>
