        That 9/11 reference at the end...How 5 days after reforms are passed, it happens and those reforms and the documents are wiped...Scary link to make!
       </p>
       <p>
        Yea thats what grabbed my attention the most and surprised i had to scroll this far down to see a mention of that. Its just incredibly coincidental that once there were actual talks of reforming mass surveillance and that ECHELON was unconstitutional, something like 9/11 happens within a week. Post 9/11 the government has escalated the surveillance for years up until only recently they are toning it down. But i would bet that the government is already making another surveillance agency but give it a different name instead of the NSA.

        My dad worked for Mitre in the 1950's &amp; 1960's. He worked on a number of classified projects while he was there, and he's since talked briefly about a few of them. He's mentioned that he once saw a series of photos taken from a spy plane flying over the US. In a nutshell, the photos started with a part of New England, then drilled down over a series of photos to a golf course. In the last photo he could read the name on a golf ball on the green of one of the holes. If that was the state of spy photography 50+ years ago I shudder to imagine what they're capable of these days. The high resolution video capabilities of drones &amp; spy satellites could easily read over your shoulder as you're walking down the street reading a newspaper...

        Does anyone else remember J Edgar Hoover? How he used the FBI to essentially hold something over every single president he served "under"? Now imagine that kind if intelligence times a fucking thousand. Who really controls this? I don't think it is the office of the president.

        The people at the core of the secret state are dirty, dirty, dirty. We're losing control of our respective goverments. We may already have lost it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wait, since when did we have it? The nineteenth century?
       </p>
       <p>
        We probably lost it around November 22, 1963.

       So basically, the U.S. has been run by HYDRA(CIA/NSA) since they assassinated JFK. I'm certain echelon knew of (or planned) 9/11 and chose to do nothing so it'd get more funding indirectly.

       I'd see it more as a faction of people in the finance/government/intelligence areas of the US/UK (main powers), some member states of the EU and Israel who've been colluding for quite a bit more time than the Kennedy assassinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       We had some US members involved in the nazi up rise (Bush financing Hitler, etc).
British ambassadors and agents organized the triple entente that led to WW1 (a world war should never have arisen from a simple political assassination, it never happened before that or after).
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the British also created the Palestinian conflict by promising both the Arabs having helped dismantle the Ottoman Empire and the Israeli Zionists the same land.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that the British Empire had to become something else to stay relevant in a world of industrial revolution and raising standards of living (overall, obviously not too recently), so it found allies where it could and now we have a nice conglomerate of bankers running our economy into the ground in the name of their short term greed, warmongers running our foreign affairs to find ways to distract people at home and steal resources, and over all that crap the intelligence agencies create constant chaos and monitor it all, and have all the dirt on everyone of course.
