<p>I think it&#39;s because the shit they add when processing meats. It&#39;s the nitrates and preservatives that are causing all the cancers. All the foods they just said were cancer causing have extra chemicals added to them by the food industry.</p>

<p>And just like they are adding shit to your drinking water you don&#39;t need the extra preservatives that are being used. I cure and age meats on a daily basis without added crap.</p>

<p>Make your own bacon, sausages, and corned beef and you should be fine.</p>

<p>I fucking love meat, I hunt and stalk and kill, I enjoy the whole process.  That being said factory farms are full of what these days and can be avoided... should be avoided.</p>

<p>Buy a deep freeze and buy a whole cow.  Find a free ranging beef grower and buy a whole cow.  Can&#39;t afford it?  Pool your money with a friend and buy half a cow or a couple friends and buy a quarter of a cow.   It will be cheaper than the off the shelf grocery store beef and you&#39;ll have steaks and roasts from a healthy cow that didn&#39;t live in a pen of filth its whole life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But isn&#39;t it the difference of living for say 85 years with meat verses living say 95 or 100 without meat?  It&#39;s too negligible to be of concern to me personally.  Steak taste good, bacon taste good. I&#39;m not going to give that up for a few more years (years that would most likely be spent miserable in a nursing home BTW). The fact of the matter is we are omnivores, we feed on both plant and animal and have the necessary tools to digest both.  Now granted, we were not meant to eat meat everyday. Maybe only once a every few weeks if our evolutionary ancestors were lucky enough to catch what they were hunting. But we still have the digestive faculties to process meat, so you can&#39;t tell me we weren&#39;t meant to eat it.   </p>
