       If you are referring to the recent WHO report I think it's misleading. They don't really discuss what it is that's in those type of foods that's making them cancerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's because the shit they add when processing meats. It's the nitrates and preservatives that are causing all the cancers. All the foods they just said were cancer causing have extra chemicals added to them by the food industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just like they are adding shit to your drinking water you don't need the extra preservatives that are being used. I cure and age meats on a daily basis without added crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make your own bacon, sausages, and corned beef and you should be fine.

       You most certainly are referring to the WHO report, or else why would you randomly bring this up. You are a person who worries too much. You read something and shit your pants in fear.

       Moderation is the key to everything. You body is able to fight of the cancer causing properties of just about anything in moderation. It's only when you take too much of one thing do you start to have problems.

       hahah. nooope. your genetically a frugivore/herbivore. 
animal industry is the leading cause in global warming/climate change. 
eating meat is fucking up ur body and causes a plethora or dis-ease.
and metaphysically you are intaking soooo much fear and pain death from this set up.

       Try to feed a herbivore some meat, they won't eat it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fucking love meat, I hunt and stalk and kill, I enjoy the whole process.  That being said factory farms are full of what these days and can be avoided... should be avoided.

       Buy a deep freeze and buy a whole cow.  Find a free ranging beef grower and buy a whole cow.  Can't afford it?  Pool your money with a friend and buy half a cow or a couple friends and buy a quarter of a cow.   It will be cheaper than the off the shelf grocery store beef and you'll have steaks and roasts from a healthy cow that didn't live in a pen of filth its whole life.

       Dirty production meat is bad for you. Full of hormones, antibiotics, and who knows what. I grew up on deer, catfish, white bass, dove, and squirrel. It may be healthier for the big city folks to become leaf eaters though.

       But isn't it the difference of living for say 85 years with meat verses living say 95 or 100 without meat?  It's too negligible to be of concern to me personally.  Steak taste good, bacon taste good. I'm not going to give that up for a few more years (years that would most likely be spent miserable in a nursing home BTW). The fact of the matter is we are omnivores, we feed on both plant and animal and have the necessary tools to digest both.  Now granted, we were not meant to eat meat everyday. Maybe only once a every few weeks if our evolutionary ancestors were lucky enough to catch what they were hunting. But we still have the digestive faculties to process meat, so you can't tell me we weren't meant to eat it.

       ok cool but what do we have now?
7 billion people wanting to eat. cutting down rainforest to grow soy beans to feed cows so you can have your mcdonalds whilst you walk around chirpsing girls on tinder! Sick were just like cave men bro. at the end of the day a 3rd of our non ice surface is used for animal produce industry.

      <p>
       biggest contributor to climate change is animal agriculture more than all car emissions. im not having a go at you guys so please  stop getting butthurt youve been brainwashed into defining pigs and cows as food and dogs as companions.

       If we never evolved to eat meat, then we would most certainly not developed these big brains you enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're supposed to eat meat. You're just not supposed to eat it for every meal, and you're not supposed to eat chemical filled meat that is burned to a crisp. Those are carcinogens.
      </p>
      <p>
       We evolved to eat whatever is available. But we weren't supposed to stuff our faces 3 meals a day. Too much off just about anything causes cancer. End of story.

       my bad i got this a little fucked up 20,000 years not 200 our brain size was 1,500 cubic centimeters. 10,000 years ago it 1,350 cubic centimeters. however this does not mean less intelligent it could have been evolutionary due to the amount of energy required to feed such a large organ

       you may be right, because everything we eat has been 'modified', especially with hormones &amp; chemicals (the clones will be next).
      </p>
      <p>
       TBH, i like bacon, don't eat pork/red meat everyday, i'm just saying. IF i could afford it i would eat everything organic. i think more fruits &amp; veggies is best for everyone, but if they're GMO -- will it make a difference?

       You are seriously giving vegans a bad face. Just stop. It may be better if you could actually spell correctly and didn't type like a child, but it's just not working. This right here is why people don't listen to logical arguments made by vegans.
