       Today I was on
       <a href="/r/me_irl">
        /r/me_irl
       </a>
       , a subreddit I quite enjoyed. I saw a post that didn't belong so I decided to report it. I clicked it and saw that one of the options was "General white people nonsense." I was really taken aback by this. I messaged the mods to see what this was about, but then they banned me! I can't believe it. Not only are the blatantly racist, but they just silence people who question it! Can't believe this sort of casual racism is allowed, especially by the mods of a major subreddit. Hopefully more people see this and we can get some sort of explanation, or even better, the mods removed.

       It's ok to discriminate against "White" people - people of diverse European backgrounds, French, German, Anglo, Polish, etc.

      <p>
       I am. The "r-word" (racist) is just as much a racial epithet as the "n-word."
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking a white person "are you racist?" is no different than asking a Jewish person "are you a kike?" Or asking an Asian person "are you a chink?" Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "racist" is clearly and only directed against people of European descent, as it always has been.

       You saying that "Nigger" is just like "white privilege" is absurd to me. You then equating that to me hating white people Is laughably judgmental. Sorry I had to break that down to you.

      <p>
       EDIT: just realised what sub I'm in. Jumping to conclusions is the status quo round here. Yes black people can be racist as fuck. Yes the privilege of being white can exist. It really isn't as simple as you would like it to be.

       So you are laughably suggesting that your constant demonization of White people - people who are ethnically European - is somehow "ok" because you use terms like "White Privilege" is somehow "not racist" ... is somehow "not judgmental?
      </p>
      <p>
       Um, who do you think you are kidding, exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure White people enjoy the "privilege" of your constant racial slurs and racist attacks. Some "privilege" eh?

       I do understand what anti-whites mean by "white privilege." Of course, no one complains about "Japanese privilege" in Japan, and no one complains about "Black privilege" in Zimbabwe, and no one complains about "Chinese privilege" in China.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only in nations populated by white - i.e., European people - that "privilege" becomes a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's simply a racist, bigoted attack on White people; an assumption that White people don't have the same human rights that all other peoples have.

       You haven't explained what it is, so again you make incorrect assumptions.
It doesn't seem you are using the term as it is commonly meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have examples you could link to where it's used in an anti-white way? (not just to the extent that dismissing white people's comments on coloured issues)

       People can see our comments, yes. Yours seems to be the accepted opinion. Oh wait-  nope. You remind me of an end of earther. How you think the world is, is not the case. It's impossible to debate you, you're so out of whack that it's troll-like. I wish you would see that, instead of your snide, defensive, downright obtuse behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, accusing everyone here of hating white people because you think it will open eyes on how people's use of the word Nigger is seen as being racist?!? One has to indulge in a frankly unwelcome amount of mental gymnastics just to understand where You're coming from.  One can't even begin to express a counter-point because your replies are so sardonic and surprisingly off point that to indulge in your bullshit not only feels like debating a trash can, but, to any rational human being, it therfore feels  like a monumental waste of time. No pun intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I've had a few minutes to spare but I shan't be indulging in your poison much longer. I've never met anyone openly like you in real life (for very obvious reasons) so you're something of a peculiarity to me, although you shouldn't be, I've seen plenty of your ilk around the Net. Your replies are somewhat fascinating in a sort of, watching a baboon pee into it's mouth- kind of way. Do carry on.

       I'm well aware of Priam's daughters and this particular daughter's gift of prophecy. Interesting retorts become less so when you attempt to use them as a marker of presumed intellectual superiority.

       You mean like the signaling you do when you talk about "White Privilege?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because "White Privilege" is jargon that means nothing other than "it's cool to hate on white people."

       Yes, accusing White people of being the only people on earth having "privilege" is, in fact, a racist attack.

       It's exactly the same as someone saying something racist about a black person, and everyone acts like that is a savage attack.

       You saying that "Nigger" is just like "white privilege" is absurd to me. You then equating that to me hating white people Is laughably judgmental. Sorry I had to break that down to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: just realised what sub I'm in. Jumping to conclusions is the status quo round here. Yes black people can be racist as fuck. Yes the privilege of being white can exist. It really isn't as simple as you would like it to be.

       didn't make up that definition - "anti-racists" did. The people who complain about "white privilege" did.

       You are so silly and childish you think that calling me names and making absurd psychoanalysis about me is somehow going to hurt my feelings. It really just makes you look silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, answer the question. Did a white guy beat you up in school or something? Is that why you have some weird hang up about white people?
