       You bring up another OP I'd like to make, but there's a rule in place which prevents me from freely speaking about it, due to the 12 rules of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mods have put into place a rule which doesn't allow users to call out blatant shill behavior.

       Ah, here we go. The mod team was scammed by those anti-r/conspiracy trolls that you're now implying don't even exist. Why would you support them? And then you throw in an attack on the entire mod team by calling them "trolls" too?????

       You've outed yourself now and you've been banned several times before. This is obviously a ban evasion account and will be dealt with accordingly. Not for your OP but because you got carried away and revealed who you are.

       The only way anyone gets banned from here is for repeated rules violations... or occasionally for one egregious Rule 1 violation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just for the record, a personal attack that includes the words "this is not an attack" is still a personal attack.

       But removing comments that make personal attacks that have nothing to do with the topic at hand is not "stifling" conversation. In fact the opposite is true. It allows others to actually discuss a topic without having to read through unending back and forth attacks that have nothing to do with, and distract from, said topic.

       This has not been the norm here.  This sub has always been a bastion of free speech, including with you as a mod until very, very recently.

       You are seemingly injecting your personal bias to fit the rules, in a way that has never been done before here previously.  Stop it.

       Well, I'm sorry you feel that way. I do my best to enforce the rules without bias. I approve a ton of stuff that I completely disagree with and I remove a lot of stuff I agree with simply because they break the rules. The way I see it, that's exactly what I'm supposed to do.

       But where has this sudden burst of censorship come from?  I've been around here a long time, you used to allow almost anything (unless it was really blatant), you have come 180 degrees and become totalitarian.  You really have.  I haven't been the only one to notice either.

       Recently I've been online a lot more than I ever have been before. Also, After some previous issues with AMAs, I dedicated myself to making sure the Sibel Edmonds AMA went off without any trolling or distracting comments. That's probably where you first noticed it. She deserves a lot of respect and none of us wanted to have her up and leave in the middle of it due to trolling/distractions. I refreshed constantly to make sure the questions and comments were on topic until after she signed off.

       No. You also included a personal attack and later edited it out. Also note my comment in that thread

       . That's why you were actually banned. I simply removed the first comment of yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was after you had already received a final warning from
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3n22rm/is_reddit_really_full_of_government_shills/cvkmu56">

      <p>
       To say that one post was the reason you were banned is far, far from the whole truth. So no, I'm not going to re-instate that account.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you've now admitted to ban evasion, I really should ban you for it. But I'm going to give you one more chance. We usually only enforce that for people that have been banned more than once (such as the user you're most likely referring to). I'm going to issue you a final warning for this account. That means - always follow our rules. Fair enough?

       The real reason you are upset is that if you were to start your own subreddit, you wouldn't have any subscribers and no one would participate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you join someone else's subreddit and try to co-opt other people's work - in the name of "questioning authority."

       That's because you have a hard time reading. The OP said "we should question authority" - thus making himself an "Authority" telling people what they "should" do.
