       Yep - it's true. You can see it especially when posters talk about the powers that be "dividing us" - when the opposite is true, the state and their corporations want to "unite" everyone. That's what a "New World Order" is all about - a global empire where everyone is "united" into "one people."
      </p>
      <p>
       So they want to "rebel" against this world empire by ... "uniting" everyone into "one people" - exactly what the globalists want.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why Lenin called their type "useful idiots."

       What makes you think TPTB want to unite everyone? It seems to me that "we" are constantly at each other's throats and very far from being "united". Generating hate through various media is what they do. No doubt they want us all to think the same way, eat the same food, take pharmaceutical drugs, buy the same devices, listen to the same crappy music. In general, they want us to be good consumers who get into debt and pay taxes. But the generating of hate is more often than not the tool that makes it all possible. Without it, we might be more difficult to control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and rule is a thing. It's probably been used by TPTB since the dawn of civilization. How else do the few enslave the many?

       This doesn't make any sense. The Corporate Media, the government, the educational institutions - all of them - ALL - are united "against hate" and "against racism" and constantly promote globalism, a world government, global capitalism, global corporations, "diversity," etc.

       Well, look at one of the first major Empires - Alexander the Great's. Did he "divide and rule?" Nope - he "united and ruled" - he even had his soldiers marry the women of the defeated tribe so he could rule over "one world wide race."
      </p>
      <p>
       How often do you see this promoted today? In the corporate media - CONSTANTLY. Anyone who wants to retain their tribe, or their individual cultures, are branded as "racist" and "hate."
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, the OP - too many posters here think they are "rebelling" against "the man" when what they are actually doing is promoting the same ideology for the same reason.

       OK, they why do they use terms like black on black violence and specify races when they aren't white and whites are always "killing Christians"
