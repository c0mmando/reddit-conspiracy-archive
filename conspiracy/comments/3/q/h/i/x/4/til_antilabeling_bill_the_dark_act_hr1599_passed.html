    <div class="md"><p>Why, do you think it&#39;s intentional?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s intentional at all.</p>

<p>Unintentionally, there are lots of general problems relating to monogenetic food sources.  Rootworm is becoming resistant to Bt and has coincidentally developed a taste for lots of other things besides corn.  Crop failure due to seasonal changes that would have been avoided with the use of more diverse cultivars.  Increased use of insecticide (I know Bt is supposed to reduce insecticide use but in practice the reverse is true) causes all sorts of environmental harm in the waterways.  The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Plus you have all these annoying rumors about glyphosate and cancer, Bt and cancer, Bt and autism, increased gluten content and GI inflammatory conditions, and all this crap.  Is any of it true?  We don&#39;t know.  Sure will suck if even a fraction of it turns out to be accurate, though.  Wups.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t have a source to directly suggest that GMOs are dangerous, however, it is important to point out that there are a lot of aspects of genetics that science does not yet understand and this could create unintended consequences.</p>

<p>An analogy is like someone with basic HTML coding knowledge going in and modifying a PHP website, and subsequently fucking everything up (I would know, I&#39;ve made that mistake).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the difference between a GMO and an herbicide is immense, and you saying things like that shows how little you know of the process. It&#39;s just taking genes out of one organism, and putting them in another. Like can you eat corn? Then you can eat this GMO tomato that has a gene from corn to make it more resistant to disease (or whatever) </p>

<p>Besides, there are aspects of genetics that are not yet understood. A former California Institute of Technology president stated, &quot;we are just not smart enough — and won’t be for a very long time — to feel comfortable about the consequences of changing heredity&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Without the glysophate the roundup ready corn wouldn&#39;t work.  I like how you astroturfers try to defend positions by cognitive capture / misrepresentation by omission bias all of your arguments.  The safety of Roundup ready corn is wholly irrelevant in that it totally ignores the glysophate component in the equation.  Just to clarify for those who still don&#39;t get this:</p>

<p>you plant a field of roundup ready corn (it resists glysophate) and you spray this field and it kills all the weeds that don&#39;t have resistance to herbicide glysophate or tradename &#39;roundup&#39;, leaving behind only your gmo corns.</p>

<p>The two products necessarily act in tandem as one.  I&#39;m not saying roundup ready corn is safe either.  I&#39;m just discounting the corn of the argument because were&#39; talking about the roundup itself now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trolling-- You are violating rule 5.  Conspiracy theorists exist <em>because of sources</em>. There are so many now that we are <strong><em>not</em></strong> going to find it acceptable to use this <strong>&quot;where&#39;s your source&quot; trope</strong> anymore because you want to <em>feign intellectual laziness as a disguise for gmo astroturfing</em>.  There is an overwhelming mountain of evidence now that you are very likely <em>Not</em> a gosh damned fool but rather someone who is actively astroturfing here.</p>

<p>As if we are expected to believe that you didn&#39;t read the same stories about how europe has banned gmos because of evidence of harm, that pollinators aren&#39;t dying in record numbers because of problems with agro industry ranging from pesticides to roundup to bt corn as a &#39;perfect storm&#39;.  You hold up some kind of contrarian proof gmos are safe but you &#39;cannot prove a lie&#39; and no miniscule number of monsanto-paid biologists are going to convince me you&#39;re right about anything, no matter how much sciency mumbo jumbo data they throw out there. </p>

<p>Our scientists outnumber yours and have better credentials, so there.  I just pulled an authoritarian card on you.</p>

<p>You can continue to allege there is no harm in GMOs but we&#39;ll fight you till the end of eternity on this one.</p>

<p>&quot;The point of a GMO is that it makes it easier, cheaper, and quicker to grow produce, with a ruinous, pollinator-destroying, human health compromising, ecologically devolving and diversity-destroying product, for the purposes of enriching a miniscule number of bioproduct companies operating worldwide, minimally-regulated and without any forethought, accountability or responsibility as to the social, political and environmental consequences of their purely, financially-motivated pursuit, while also actively opposing the attention, concerns and will of the vast majory of end-users worldwide.</p>

<p>IFTFY.</p>

<p>GMOs are so opposed because they act as a <em>singular, exemplar model of everything that is wrong with unregulated capitalism</em></p>
