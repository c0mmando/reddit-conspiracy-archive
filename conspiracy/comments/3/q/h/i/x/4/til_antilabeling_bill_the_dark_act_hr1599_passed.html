       Wouldn't the government spend more money trying to get GMO laws passed than could, supposedly, be saved by GMOs? What's the point of GMOs anyways, to save money or something? They're really adamant about this and it doesn't add up.

       The point of a GMO is that it makes it easier, cheaper, and quicker to grow produce, with superior product in the end. It makes big agriculture lots of money to use GMO, but theres nothing inherently harmful about a GMO. It's just a case of hardcore lobbying by Monsanto, not a nefarious scheme to harm/control us through GMO, as plenty seem to think.

       It's just coincidental that unifying our food stream through a single, for-profit corporation leads to absolute control (food=power) over us as well as causing lots of unintended harm.

       Why, do you think it's intentional?  I don't think it's intentional at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unintentionally, there are lots of general problems relating to monogenetic food sources.  Rootworm is becoming resistant to Bt and has coincidentally developed a taste for lots of other things besides corn.  Crop failure due to seasonal changes that would have been avoided with the use of more diverse cultivars.  Increased use of insecticide (I know Bt is supposed to reduce insecticide use but in practice the reverse is true) causes all sorts of environmental harm in the waterways.  The list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus you have all these annoying rumors about glyphosate and cancer, Bt and cancer, Bt and autism, increased gluten content and GI inflammatory conditions, and all this crap.  Is any of it true?  We don't know.  Sure will suck if even a fraction of it turns out to be accurate, though.  Wups.

       How can we trust Monsanto to make GMOs when their herbicides are carcinogenic? (In fact, this is considered a human rights violation, since access to safe food and human health is being challenged)

      <p>
       Now I don't have a source to directly suggest that GMOs are dangerous, however, it is important to point out that there are a lot of aspects of genetics that science does not yet understand and this could create unintended consequences.

       Because the difference between a GMO and an herbicide is immense, and you saying things like that shows how little you know of the process. It's just taking genes out of one organism, and putting them in another. Like can you eat corn? Then you can eat this GMO tomato that has a gene from corn to make it more resistant to disease (or whatever)

       Without the glysophate the roundup ready corn wouldn't work.  I like how you astroturfers try to defend positions by cognitive capture / misrepresentation by omission bias all of your arguments.  The safety of Roundup ready corn is wholly irrelevant in that it totally ignores the glysophate component in the equation.  Just to clarify for those who still don't get this:
      </p>
      <p>
       you plant a field of roundup ready corn (it resists glysophate) and you spray this field and it kills all the weeds that don't have resistance to herbicide glysophate or tradename 'roundup', leaving behind only your gmo corns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two products necessarily act in tandem as one.  I'm not saying roundup ready corn is safe either.  I'm just discounting the corn of the argument because were' talking about the roundup itself now.

You hold up some kind of contrarian proof gmos are safe but you 'cannot prove a lie' and no miniscule number of monsanto-paid biologists are going to convince me you're right about anything, no matter how much sciency mumbo jumbo data they throw out there.

       I dont know , Im reading that polls show 90% support for labeling and it still passed the House. but with that level of opposition maybe there is a chance. We need a subreddit and campaign here on reddit quick-like

       You said you didn't hear about it because you were "[in] in congress." Does this mean you are among the Legislative Branch or because you're too busy having sex?

       The point of a GMO is that it makes it easier, cheaper, and quicker to grow produce, with superior product in the end. It makes big agriculture lots of money to use GMO, but theres nothing inherently harmful about a GMO. It's just a case of hardcore lobbying by Monsanto, not a nefarious scheme to harm/control us through GMO, as plenty seem to think.
