<p>It shouldn&#39;t be so impressive that a Senator does his/her current job while lobbying for his/her future job, but it&#39;s so rare that unfortunately that&#39;s the world we live in now.</p>

<p>It would be like if Bernie didn&#39;t show up to a vote about raising the minimum wage. </p>

<p>I was just clarifying for you since you seemed to think <a href="/u/PhilosopherofFreedom">/u/PhilosopherofFreedom</a> was conflating Rand with Ron, when it doesn&#39;t seem like they are because there is a specific reason to expect RAND to show up to such a vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you mean about taking care of personal info, but part of the CISA dealio is companies disclosing information about their clients, including internet providers. That means your name, address, SS#, and Internet use info is all available to the govt. in connection with your IP. So even if the NSA can&#39;t find your name or personal info in connection to your IP, they can use the CISA to connect personal info with your opinions, search history, and statements on the internet that they already can collect in connection to your IP. The CISA is the finally blow, man. There&#39;s no hiding anything anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marx was an atheist Jew. The Bolsheviks were atheist Jews. The greatest murders of the twentieth century were carried out by communists and the leadership in the Soviet was incredibly Jewish.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget that the Jews declared war on Hitler in 1933 because of his monetary policy and the fact he made Jews identify themselves. They were over-represented in powerful positions in media, banking, and the almost communist government of Germany at the time. They are the reason the U.S. went in the war on the allies side, they are a big reason that WW escalated into conflict at all. You&#39;ve hard that all wars are banker&#39;s wars, but who invented modern making and the fractional reserve system? </p>

<p>Good out who the Rothschilds are. And realize they&#39;ve owned the British crown since 1812.</p>

<p>Watch &#39;Marching to Zion&#39; for more information about why Jews and Christians haven&#39;t really gotten along ever. Remember: To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticise.</p>
