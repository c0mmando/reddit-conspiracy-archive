<p>I would guess they were spending time trying to track down his connections to the pedophile network.  It looks like they didn&#39;t get very far into that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting, the difference in treatment: Chick-Fil-A donates money to a traditional marriage campaign, and a nationwide boycott is called for, protests are mounted, firings are called for. Meanwhile, Subway Sandwich&#39;s pitchman was a pedophile and . . . [silence].</p>

<p>Nothing. Nada. Zilch.</p>

<p>As if being a pedophile is less of a crime than believing in traditional marriage.</p>

<p>It&#39;s odd, the priorities that &quot;social justice warriors&quot; seem to have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen &quot;pedophiles are a sexual orientation&quot; in the sense that they cannot change their desires, but I haven&#39;t seen any articles in the media which say that they should be able to practice their desires. So far all of them suggest that they must abstain and get counseling. They say that if a pedophile <em>abstains</em>, he/she shouldn&#39;t be treated as an evil person.</p>

<p>With homosexuals wanting consenting adults society says that they should be able to practice their desires, and that is a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, though it&#39;s been suppressed within the last few decades, the gay rights movement started early on with a lot of connections to pro-pedophilia campaigns. Crusaders from one movement would routinely show up in the other movement as well.</p>

<p>Like Harry Hay, an early &quot;gay rights crusader&quot; (who championed gay marriage when no one else did), but who was also a founding member of the North America Man-Boy Love Association. See his Wikipedia page here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hay">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hay</a></p>

<p>For additional references see this article, entitled:  &quot;Pedophile Alliance: An Uncomfortable Past For the Gay Rights Movement&quot;: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gay-activists-in-germany-silent-on-alliance-with-pedophiles-in-1980s-a-919119.html">http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/gay-activists-in-germany-silent-on-alliance-with-pedophiles-in-1980s-a-919119.html</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: The LGTB community has yet to renounce and excoriate the 1972 &#39;Gay Rights Platform&quot; that included the following demand: &quot;Repeal of all laws governing the age of sexual consent.&quot; David Thorstad, a spokesman for the homosexual rights movement and NAMBLA, clearly states the objectives: &#39;The ultimate goal of the gay liberation movement is the achievement of sexual freedom for all - not just equal rights for &#39;lesbians and gay men, but also freedom of sexual expression for young people and children.&quot; . . . So you&#39;re not crazy or &quot;imagining things&quot;. The modern gay rights movement had to make some changes to itself [to make itself more acceptable to the straight mainstream]. Now that most of its goals have been accomplished, you can see subtle tones peeking through the new coat of paint illustrative of a time-period when its call for &quot;tolerance&quot; extended to more than just homosexuals. With the result that, suddenly, that &quot;slippery slope&quot; that they claimed didn&#39;t exist is on display for all to see: with fresh media campaigns to normalize transsexuality and (little by little) pedophilia. . . . So as I indicated in my previous post: It&#39;s suggestive when &quot;social justice warriors&quot; foam at the mouth regarding people who believe in traditional marriage [and think it&#39;s the worst thing in the world]; but a pedophile like Jared Fogle? Suddenly the silence is deafening. Not a peep from the social justice warriors. Evidently, protecting children falls outside of their definition for &quot;social justice&quot;.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>As the article states the gay rights movement in Germany began to distance itself in the 1980s. I can tell you the same distancing happened in the USA.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t know if any individuals have publicly stated a denouncement of that particular goal of the 1972 &quot;Gay Rights Platform&quot; but I wouldn&#39;t be terribly surprised if someone did. The way things are going (gay rights going mainstream, and pedophilia being opposed <em>even more strongly</em>) that platform is becoming a distant memory.</p>

<p>Because the people haven&#39;t gotten definitive proof that the company knew for certain that Fogle did what he did and covered up for Fogle (yes, I am aware of what the manager said about reporting Fogle - that was reported in the media)</p>

<p>Trust me, people who oppose gay marriage (do not use &quot;believing in traditional marriage&quot; to mean people who oppose gay marriage) are treated more kindly than people outed as pedos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t get this case at all. They were tracking the guy and had audio confessions for 5 years, but like OP said, they didn&#39;t take action until now - all the while who knows how many kids were victimized. Then the guy somehow enters into a plea deal (not sure one was needed with the evidence they had) and will get 2-7 years in jail at most, assuming he doesn&#39;t get released early on good conduct. You&#39;d think they&#39;d make an example out of this guy, or at the very least, give him the same charges they&#39;d give to others that have slept with dozens of underage prostitutes and had possession of child pornography, with kids as young as 6. People have gotten longer sentences for minor drug offenses or statutory rape (where the individuals were no more than 3 years apart). Don&#39;t know why the justice system is failing us, but hopefully someone will take his ass out in prison or out of prison.</p>
