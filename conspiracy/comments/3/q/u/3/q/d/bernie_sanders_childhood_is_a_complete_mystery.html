        All of that was interesting. But I wanted to know not just about what Sanders has done. I wanted to know more about who he has been. So I asked what I thought was an innocuous question about Sanders’ son. How did Sanders juggle aspirations as an eager political activist with his role as a divorced young father?

       To anyone with a little media experience, this is quite revealing.  An editor tasked a reporter with a goal: find dirt on Sanders.  Because they could not find any, they ran a story suggesting doubt: you don't
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       what his past is.  And as a matter of course, the article goes on to rather succinctly describe Sanders' past, omitting no great section of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's emotional and irrational rhetoric designed to influence the usually poorly informed undecided voter; at one point the author is able to weasel the word "Yankee" in to describe an aspect of a town in which Sanders once lived.  If anyone wanted to do some actual investigative journalism, they would go to the city halls of places where Sanders has lived and perform a search through public records for information that could be used to build a picture of his life--oh, it seems the author did exactly that while disingenuously suggesting that the picture is somehow incomplete.  I would suspect that, like many
       <em>
        New Yorker
       </em>
       "assassination" pieces, this article is extremely liberal with paraphrasal and utilizing quotes out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, no weak punches are pulled at every beleagured aspect of Sander's life: he has a child with a woman who was not his wife; they insult his early writing, his carpentry (of all things), and the way he lived with little money; all the while Bush does cocaine and dodges the deployment, Rodham is disenfranchising rape victims and becoming buddy buddy with powered elite and eventually commits massive real estate fraud, and Trump is haemorrhaging money bouncing around his own failed real estate ventures that displace local populations.  This piece is extremely contrived with blatant and misdirected malicious intent.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Independent politician Bernie Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in New York. He grew up in Brooklyn as the youngest of two sons of a Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father worked as a paint salesman. As part of a struggling working-class family, Sanders recognized early on America's economic disparity. As he told the Guardian newspaper, "I saw unfairness. That was the major inspiration in my politics," he said. Sanders also counts American socialist leader Eugene V. Debs as an important influence.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sanders attended Brooklyn's James Madison high school and then went on to Brooklyn College. After a year there, he switched to the University of Chicago. Sanders became involved in the civil rights movement during his time at university and served as an organizer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. After finishing college in 1964, Sanders lived on a kibbutz in Israel before settling in Vermont. He worked a number of jobs, including filmmaker and freelance writer, while his interest in politics grew.

       Check his wiki page out! Lol it goes "Bernie Sanders was born in new york city. His political career started when he...." There is no information about his childhood. I dont trust politico but ehen they put something in quotes that any question about a mans role as a father and his coming into power is 'out of bounds' then that seems a little off to me.

       And you think this guy is different how exactly? How is Sanders going to hold to his campaign promises when Obama couldn't even hold to one? He didn't even fix the healthcare issue. He made the situation exponentially worse.

       Sanders is much different than Obama, in many ways.  What he's done in the past, and what he continues to do and speak about today, speaks volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Obama didn't stick to his promises, I guess we'll just have to distrust every single person that will run for president then, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason Sanders is running Democrat is because there would be no viable way for him to run as an Independent because of the dominance of our two-party, two-sided system.

       Remove the two party system first. As of right now democracy is a farce in the US. Someone from a "fringe" party isn't given the same opportunities as someone from the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forcing legitimate candidates to run under a specific banner to be elected ensures that the higher powers dictate how this country is run.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an important enough issue that it should be addressed before the current elections. People cannot expect the current regime to level the playing field. Other party candidates interested in legitimate elections won't be heard due to the current system and have no chance at being elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you revoke power from the two party system? I don't know. I'd assume it would take someone more politically savvy than I am.

       The fact is almost every American, especially after the example of Obama, will cheerfully vote for plastic dog poop (not that Trump is) over any socialist, knowing that even if the plastic dog poop can't help anything, unlike socialists, it also won't do any more harm.

       It's a oft-noted distinction between American and Canadian politics. Traditionally, the act of dredging through the personal affairs of politicians hasn't done as well up here. Mind you, it happens, but it's not as popularly received and isn't something that is likely to tank a campaign.

       Though the fact that you guys haven't removed Rob Ford is a real travesty.  Regardless of personal morality it seems pretty clear that he uses city funds for personal ventures and is not adequately performing mayoral duties due to chronic intoxication and Bacchanalia.
