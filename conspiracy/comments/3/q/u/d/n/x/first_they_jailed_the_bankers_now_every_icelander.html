    <div class="md"><p>First, Iceland jailed its crooked bankers for their direct involvement in the financial crisis of 2008. Now, every Icelander will receive a payout for the sale of one of its three largest banks, Íslandsbanki.</p>

<p>If Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson has his way — and he likely will — Icelanders will be paid kr 30,000 after the government takes over ownership of the bank. Íslandsbanki would be second of the three largest banks under State proprietorship.</p>

<p>“I am saying that the government take [sic] some decided portion, 5%, and simply hand it over to the people of this country,” <a href="http://grapevine.is/news/2015/10/24/every-icelander-to-receive-30000-isk-from-bank-sale/">he stated.</a></p>

<p>Because Icelanders took control of their government, they effectively own the banks. Benediktsson believes this will bring foreign capital into the country and ultimately fuel the economy — which, incidentally, <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2015/car031315a.htm">remains</a> the only European nation to <a href="http://theantimedia.org/iceland-recovering-fastest-in-europe-after-jailing-bankers/">recover fully</a> from the 2008 crisis. </p>

<p>Iceland even managed to <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2015/10/09/imf-says-iceland-has-repaid-its-remaining-debt">pay its outstanding debt</a> to the IMF in full — in advance of the due date.</p>

<p>Guðlaugur Þór Þórðarson, Budget Committee vice chairperson, explained the move would facilitate the lifting of capital controls, though he wasn’t convinced State ownership would be the ideal solution. Former Finance Minister Steingrímur J. Sigfússon sided with Þórðarson, telling a radio show, “we shouldn’t lose the banks to the hands of fools” and that Iceland would benefit from a shift in focus to separate “commercial banking from investment banking.”</p>

<p>Plans haven’t yet been firmly set for when the takeover and subsequent payments to every person in the country will occur, but Iceland’s revolutionary approach to dealing with the international financial meltdown of 2008 certainly deserves every bit of the attention it’s garnered.</p>

<p>Iceland recently jailed its <a href="http://theantimedia.org/icelands-bankers-face-74-years-in-prison-while-us-banks-profit-after-your-bailout/">26th banker</a> — with 74 years of prison time amongst them — for causing the financial chaos. Meanwhile, U.S. banking criminals were rewarded for their fraud and market manipulation with an enormous bailout at the taxpayer’s expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...Okay so wait a minute.  I&#39;ve kept hearing/reading about how Iceland has done this or that to its bankers, but somebody please explain to me how Iceland has, somehow, <em>not</em> been absolutely besieged by some kind of  blitzkrieg world war or sudden calamity of sorts at the hands of the international banksters.  I mean it&#39;s not like the bankers in Iceland <em>aren&#39;t</em> related and connected to the world wide web of banking deceit that has the entire planet in a shit stranglehold...so how is it that <em>this</em> country jailed its bankers, instituted a government currency, and is paying its citizens out <em>without</em> any repercussion from said international banking cartel?</p>

<p>I&#39;m, to be sure, awesomely happy about this, and REALLY hope it sets a precedent for literally <em>all other</em> nations to follow (though I&#39;m beyond not holding my breath on anything like that happening), but...again, how is it that the international banking cartel is <em>not</em> coming down with all guns (financial and otherwise) firing at this one country for &quot;daring&quot; to challenge the banking cartel global hegemony?</p>

<p>Because Iceland is a small country and relatively unimportant on the global stage. If germany or france or italy did something like this then it would be a problem for them.</p>

<p>Well that’s the whole point, however.  It’s setting a <em>massive</em> example for all the rest of the world to follow, and if other countries get wind of the precedent Iceland seems to be setting, the citizens of those other bigger countries could follow suit.</p>

<p>THEN the globalist bankers&#39;ll have <em>real</em> problems.</p>

<p>How much press coverage on CNN have you seen about the icelandic bankers being jailed, or about this? </p>

<p>Answer: Zero, or close to it.</p>

<p>But it seems to me that they’re at least being given the <em>opportunity</em> to be noticed by the world and for others to pay attention to them and possibly be influenced by them and follow suit.  That would seem to be a very risky thing on the bankster’s part.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That’s not a bad point…but it seems that this story might be getting just a little bit of notice in the alternative media as well.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>None.  Correct.  Just like you said.</p>

<p>Seems like a bit of a tricky game TPTB banksters are playing though to just do <em>nothing</em> about this particular situation, hope the plebs don’t notice, and hope it just goes away.</p>

<p>I mean…I think people might be <em>starting</em> to notice - definitely not a large percentage, but I think it’s not an entirely insignificant portion of the population that is noticing what’s happening over there.</p>

<p>Correct, but it seems the people from Iceland have decided to step up and care at least somewhat.  That can have the possibility of setting off a serious precedent for others countries.</p>

<p>…if so many of us didn’t have our heads still so stuck in the matrix, that is… :/</p>

<p>Oh I certainly don’t disagree with that.  I think the Iceland thing is an <em>effect</em> of people starting to wake up and not any sort of cause necessarily.</p>

<p>A few examples bankers are probably worrying about more than Iceland are: Asian infrastructure bank replacing roles of IMF and SWIFT, downfall of the Petrodollar, more bank and VIP paedophile ring scandals, Bitcoin, people not believing mass media anymore, Russia intervening in Syria, first free energy machines coming to market (Orbo, Gaia), etc.</p>

<p>Certainly.  Yes.  Me too.  I understand this.  However, there are <em>some</em> sources and avenues out there still.  Not many, but they exist.</p>

<p>This entire world is practically shackled up - again, I understand this.  However, we can definitely fight back <em>internally</em> by making sure that our OWN minds work hard to become and <em>remain</em> open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know all those discounted mortgage instruments and distressed properties that pass through the crooked banks and their cronies?   The ones that selected investors/cronies get to buy for pennies on the dollar?     In a &quot;free market&quot; why wouldn&#39;t there be a completely transparent way for every single citizen to have a fair shot at purchasing those?    For example,    I might owe $80k on my mortgage,   but it might be sold in the secondary market for $30 to a &quot;vulture investor&quot; whom I would then still owe $80k to.    Why not give me or my uncle a shot at buying it for $30k?</p>

<p>People could say this impossible for securitized mortgage portfolios,  but that is just a red tape gimmick that is used to protect one class and exploit another.   When the needs of a crony are whispered in the ears of the regulators,   they can part oceans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kind of like the voters get a bulk &quot;discount&quot; to the value of the citizens vote at the ballot box :)    Compare the access they get to the access a handful of corporations get.</p>

<p>When it comes to parts of the economy that the taxpayer is expected to bail out,   bulk discounts and other benefits that might work in the private sector,   like fleet discounts,   do not apply.     There are places in the three branches of  the republic were we used to be citizen first,   consumers second.    Think about the folks who lend the government money,  too,  the bondholders.     Do they get a bulk discount?    Maybe the biggest lenders actually are getting a premium,   at least effectively,   through lower commissions.    That will tend to rig the game more and more.   In a rigged game,   it is not a government for the people,  but for the elites and the corporations they own.</p>

For fucks sake dont buy into the bullshit about Iceland beeing somekind of a shining beacon in regards to how we´ve dealt with our bankers and politicians in the wake of the  collapse of our economy.And for crying out loud dont beleive a fucking word coming from that lying piece of shit Bjarni or any of his comrades from the so called &quot;independance party&quot;... We are just as clueless and fucked as the rest of you. Nothing has changed over here, the same fuckers that got us into the mess in the first place got voted back into power 4 years after everything went to hell, they went straight back to their old ways of giving their buddies and families our national resources on a silver platter. Every time this fucking undeserved meme about iceland´s supposed awesome handling of the whole fucking crisis gets circulated on the internet is a stab in the heart for those of us who live here and see the truth first hand.
the shit going on here is just as bad if not worse then whatever you guys have got going on in your own back yard.  </p>
