        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">19</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-10-30 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ParanoidFactoid.html">ParanoidFactoid</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Recent news that China intents to spend billions to build a <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20151029-china-start-work-super-super-collider-2020-report">new particle collider facility</a> at twice the size and with much greater energy density of the Large Hadron Collider, might leave some scratching their heads. The LHC <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/forbes-finding-higgs-boson-cost-1325-billion-721503">cost an estimated $13.25B US</a> to build and run during the first experimental phase, across a twenty year development cycle. </p>

<p>And China, as noted previously, plans their own super-collider entirely financed by the government internally, not a cheap task. Debate about the LHC&#39;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2009/sep/22/particlephysics-cern">excessive cost</a> has been ongoing for years, and building that was an international collaboration. China will build this on their own. And now the LHC is slated to restart that collider with a new set of experiments at much higher energy densities, along with a new round of funding. There&#39;s even been talk of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/02/physicists-start-thinking-beyond-the-lhc-consider-reviving-the-ssc/">restarting the old US based Superconducting Super Collider</a> project abandoned in the 1990s. </p>

<p>Why would governments spend such huge sums just to explore some minor academic question about physics? Whether this or that particle is generated at expected energies, thus confirming or challenging a standard model of physics that&#39;s held mostly true for nearly fifty years. It’s not like these results have application in the real world. They’re more suited to resolving academic questions posed by university professors scribbling on lecture hall chalkboards. Right?</p>

<p>Unless the possibility for a military purpose exists. Then the money spigot would be turned on high with cash flowing out at best speed. </p>

<p>One of the core missions of the LHC is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/05/cern-restarts-large-hadron-collider-with-mission-to-make-scientific-history">production of anti-matter</a>. This is presented as a mere pure science research project. Contrary to fiction, such as Dan Brown&#39;s , <em>Angels and Demons,</em> where in his story magnetic bottles containing anti-matter were stolen from CERN&#39;s LHC and hidden throughout the Vatican for a terrorism campaign, the amount of anti-matter real facilities are able to produce is minuscule. So it&#39;s unlikely development of a pure anti-matter weapon is possible in the near future. Production of stable anti-matter is on the order of hundreds to thousands of atoms per run. Magnetic storage remains difficult and expensive with larger volumes. And the energy cost associated with production - you can&#39;t get something for nothing - is excessive. </p>

<p>But that doesn&#39;t mean anti-matter production at such facilities isn&#39;t weaponizable. For small amounts of anti-matter could be used as a catalyst in shaped charges for generating the confined heat and pressures necessary to induce deuterium-tritium fusion. Just like in a thermonuclear bomb. This is called a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_fusion_weapon">Pure Fusion Weapon</a>&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some researchers have examined the use of antimatter as an alternative fusion trigger, mainly in the context of antimatter-catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion.[2] Such a system, in a weapons context, would have many of the desired properties of a pure fusion weapon. However, the technical barriers to producing and containing the required quantities of antimatter appear formidable, well beyond present capabilities. Induced gamma emission is another approach that is currently being researched. Very high energy-density chemicals such as the mythical red mercury, various ballotechnics and others have also been suggested as a means of triggering a pure fusion weapon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there&#39;s reason governments might want to develop anti-matter generation facilities for a weapons program. And that might be as a means to develop a new generation of fusion bombs. So-called &quot;4th Generation&quot; nuclear weapon, where the energy density and pressures required for fusion is obtained not by a fission bomb - as has been done since the 1950s - but instead by a shaped anti-matter annihilation charge.  And there’s some evidence that theoretical advances in the 1970s and 1980s paved the way for <a href="http://cui.unige.ch/isi/sscr/phys/antim-BPP.html">justifying the building</a>: of these huge and expensive particle accelerators:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For such a military use to be realistic, a technology capable of producing enough antiprotons for at least one antimatter trigger per day is needed. This corresponds to a minimum production rate of 10<sup>13</sup> antiprotons per second, six orders of magnitude higher than that at CERN today (107 antiprotons per second). But, in theory, there exist numerous ways to increase this rate [9]. What we were unaware of, was that since the summer of 1983, the RAND Corporation had been carrying out a study for the U.S. Air Force, &quot;examining the possibilities for exploiting the high energy release from matter-antimatter annihilation&quot; [10]. Similar concerns had equally sprouted-up in the Soviet Union [11]. The RAND study was completed in 1984. The version published in 1985 constitutes a serious evaluation of the development possibilities of such an undertaking, in view of military applications.</p>

<p>According to this document, a definitive evaluation of the possibility to produce and manipulate 10<sup>13</sup> antiprotons per second, and the construction of transportable antiproton reservoirs, should be realized within the next five to seven years; many important technological problems being able to be studied with ordinary particles instead of antiprotons. This same report mentions four main categories of applications: &#39;propulsion&#39; (fuel for ultra-fast anti-missile rockets), &#39;power generators&#39; (light and ultra-compact for military platforms in orbit), &#39;directed energy weapons&#39; (antihydrogen beams or pumped lasers relying on very short duration energy release) and &#39;&quot;classified additional special weapons roles&quot;&#39; (various bombs triggered by antimatter). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is the case, it might well explain world governments&#39; increasing willingness to spend big money for facilities on what would seem to benefit only a tiny physics community. For the payoff wouldn&#39;t be mere publications and academic accolades. But the realization of entirely new nuclear weapons designs. </p>

<p>Such a weapon might have many advantages over traditional nuclear weapons. For one, they wouldn&#39;t contaminate an area with significant long term radiation. Yet on detonation, neutron flux would be lethal for anyone within a few hundred meters much like neutron bomb designs today. For another, they could be made quite small, both in explosive yield and in physical size. Imagine a hand grenade sized nuclear bomb with the explosive capacity of 10 tons of TNT. </p>

<p>That&#39;s in comparison to the Hiroshima fission weapon that exploded with 16,000 tons of TNT equivalent that was so large it had to be carried as a single payload on a huge B29 bomber. And though modern day nuclear weapons are much smaller, some even having been reduced to the size of a large mortar round (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Crockett_%28nuclear_device%29">Davy Crockett</a>, and archive film of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiM-RzPHyGs">Davy Crockett nuclear test</a> and the Soviets apparently made a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuclear_device">suitcase style nukes</a>), these devices are heavy and unwieldy for an individual soldier to field into combat. A pure fusion device could be much smaller. Handheld even. With the explosive capacity to destroy a large building or bridge.  </p>

<p>See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5VNnmAoIYI">informative Youtube video</a> on the subject: </p>

<p>Such a weapon could finally make nuclear war <em>feasible.</em> Crossing that Rubicon of acceptance where nuclear war is no longer a deterrent based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">Mutually Assured Destruction</a> but an accepted element of deployable weapons on the battlefield. An escalation in the controllable use of force that could tip the global power balance between nations.</p>

<p>edit: fixed a dangling sentence. Fixed a link. Fixed a number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting post. Clearly a lot more thought <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=CERN+OR+%22Large+Hadron+Collider%22+OR+LHC&amp;amp;sort=new&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;t=all">than normal</a> has gone into this.</p>

<p>However, the whole thing is based on one key misunderstanding that I can&#39;t help but address:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the core missions of the LHC is production of anti-matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true in a way, but not the way that you go on to describe. The whole deal with the LHC and antimatter is what I happen to work on: studying the difference in the decays of heavy quarks versus antiquarks. At LHCb, in particular, we&#39;re interested in certain particles that have between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_meson">twice</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsilon_meson">ten times</a> the mass of a proton and decay a few millimetres from the collision point.</p>

<p>Collisions in the LHC are much too energetic for the purpose of trapping anti-hydrogen. Copious numbers of antiprotons (along with a myriad of other types of hadron) are indeed produced, but they have far too much kinetic energy to be trapped, and they&#39;re flying all in random directions.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: trapping atoms is quite literally cooling them to temperatures close to absolute zero, whereas collisions in the LHC can be trillions of degrees.</p>

<p>Antimatter trapping is done with machines like the <a href="http://home.cern/about/accelerators/low-energy-antiproton-ring">Low Energy Antiproton Ring</a> and the <a href="http://home.cern/about/accelerators/antiproton-decelerator">Antiproton Decelerator</a>.</p>

<p>The AD web page explains it very nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The starting point is a beam of protons from the Proton Synchrotron (PS), which is fired into a block of metal. The energy from the collisions is enough to create a new proton-antiproton pair about once in every million collisions. The antiprotons produced travel at almost the speed of light and have too much energy to be useful for making antiatoms. They also have a range of energies and move randomly in all directions. The job of the AD is to tame these unruly particles into a useful low-energy beam.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> producing and trapping stable antimatter can&#39;t be done with super-colliders like the LHC or the CEPC/SppC that China plan to build. Instead, it&#39;s done with much smaller, cheaper and lower-energy accelerators/decelerators.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very good retort. I note that the facilities you mention are all <em>part</em> of the LHC set of facilities, and further that which facilities are in use at LHC as part of anti-matter generation and trapping gets down to a more detailed question of how and not why. Still, your challenge that building huge rings for very high energetic collisions is unnecessary toward large scale anti-matter collection is interesting. For it doesn&#39;t negate the question of whether governments have such &quot;pure fusion&quot; programs, merely questions the methods of how such a program might be enacted. </p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What physicists are doing is trying ro find the next breakthrough, a new paradigm. Of course they are going to want their own collider. I highly doubt humans make anything of it; it seems like the popular thing at the moment. Theyve pretty much investigated, studied, and theorized for the forces on Earth and Space. Now the final frontier is the the study of the infinitesimal particles lf matter.  I personally believe nothing will come of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In math there was a time when elliptic curves were thought to be useless nevertheless pure mathematicians continued to study about it just because they wanted to. Years later, this branch of math has been the basis for encryption, passwords and such.  Pure science may initially look useless for practical apps but these usually(with exceptions) pave the way for groundbreaking Applications in the future. This is how innovations generally develop, through excruciatingly minute steps, experiment after experiment, paper after paper until someone, somewhere doing research (by accident, inspiration or otherwise) through sheer painstakingly hard work connects some dots and poof! a breakthrough! It&#39;s a risky exercise as one can never be sure if it would take months, years, or centuries of research will produce something, but once the studies have been recorded it could be reproduced, reused and reexamined by future researchers. The potential for learning and discovery has generally only one limitation, the willingness to pursue it. This is the reason governments have an advantage over private organizations, as long as they are willing to pursue without regards for immediate profits it continue on generation after generation. </p>

1) its about 3/4 speculation.  it goes from the chins have plans to make al big ass collider to OMG THEYRE MAKIN A DAMN BOMB!!!! with no real inbetween or evidence to back up the claim</p>

<p>2) even if they DO develop a big ass collider, they will have to have scientists from other countries use it because china is not big on the STEM fields, just the means of production.  sure they can put together a collider, but they cant operate it or extrapolate meaningful data from it. </p>

<p>from that point onward,  it goes on to say that MAYBE they are using it to make weaponizable anti-matter, which last time i checked it may be possible but its the realm of science fiction.  this whole article seems to me to be fear mongering.  but as to why they would want to sell fear, im not sure.  maybe its just for more clicks on their website.</p>

<p>What we were unaware of, was that since the summer of 1983, the RAND Corporation had been carrying out a study for the U.S. Air Force, &quot;examining the possibilities for exploiting the high energy release from matter-antimatter annihilation&quot; [10]. Similar concerns had equally sprouted-up in the Soviet Union [11]. The RAND study was completed in 1984. The version published in 1985 constitutes a serious evaluation of the development possibilities of such an undertaking, in view of military applications.</p>

<p>Not an anti-matter bomb. An anti-matter trigger for a fusion bomb. You don&#39;t need much anti-matter to trigger a small implosion for fusion. I think you misunderstand the point of this essay. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple. China has to win every race, every medal. They are the new Nazis, if you haven&#39;t noticed, goose stepping their way to global domination. (Those are the words of the Philippines leader). Whether or not the new accelerator leads to new applications/weapons, nonetheless the Chinese will suffer from high anxiety and &quot;national humiliation&quot; if the world has something that they don&#39;t. Welcome to racial supremacy redux.</p>

<p>Oh, and Xi Jinping&#39;s leadership is in question, due to the stock market crash, and economic downturn. So, big announcements like the particle accelerator, and 2-child policy, could just be throwing out political lifeboats to keep his leadership afloat.</p>

<p>&quot;China has been running the world&#39;s largest and most successful eugenics program for more than thirty years, driving China&#39;s ever-faster rise as the global superpower. I worry that this poses some existential threat to Western civilization&quot;.

<p>China ticks every box of racial supremacy, but the West is blinded by the lure of cheap goods, and a huge market for their exports. Madness.</p>

With that huge of a gene pool and population they can mass produce potential army of geniuses at a rate of 5-15 IQ points per generation.

    <div class="md"><p>I remember that period in China&#39;s history when they built the largest fleet ever and planned to sail to foreign lands but then they changed their minds, burned the fleet and never embarked on another expedition like that again. Historians say that this reflected the Chinese psyche of isolationism, the Middle Kingdom preferring to mind its own place in the center of the world and letting the barbarians on their own. No desire to civilize or expand to the rest of the world. Could their elite&#39;s mentality have changed? With China it&#39;s difficult to tell, just like it&#39;s hard to evaluate a chinaman&#39;s intentions because of the fact that his eyes are so narrow one will have difficulty reading him, so is China&#39;s foreign policy. </p>
