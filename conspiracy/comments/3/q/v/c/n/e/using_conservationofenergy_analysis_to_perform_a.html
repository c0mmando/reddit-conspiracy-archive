        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Gravity</strong></p>

<p>Mankind has learned that the force of gravity comes from an acceleration of known constant magnitude, depending only upon mass and separation - gravity has always had the same, predictable, effect.</p>

<p>So while an object of greater mass will exert more force upon anything which is supporting it against gravity&#39;s pull (ie, it&#39;s heavier), it does not experience any greater acceleration when gravity&#39;s pull is not opposed (ie, when it&#39;s falling). Earth&#39;s gravity can only accelerate objects downward at one known, constant, maximum rate (1 g). Heavier objects are not accelerated any quicker than are lighter objects, as Galileo demonstrated centuries ago.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Basic Physics</strong></p>

<p>Earth&#39;s gravity will produce a downward acceleration of 32 feet per second per second.</p>

<p>What that means is that an object</p>

<ul>
<li><p>after falling one second, will be falling at 32 ft/sec.</p></li>
<li><p>After the 2nd second, it will be falling at 64 ft/sec.</p></li>
<li><p>After the 3rd second, it will be falling at 96 ft/sec.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>This can easily be explained via numbers and arithmetic</p>

<pre><code>Velocity = Gravity x Time
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>Distance = 1/2 x Gravity x Time(squared)
</code></pre>

<p>So if we want to know how far the object has free-fallen after 3 seconds:</p>

<pre><code>Distance = 1/2 x 32 x 9 = 144 feet
</code></pre>

<p>So after 3 seconds, in Earth&#39;s gravity, an object will have fallen 144 feet and will be falling at 96 ft/sec.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Kinetic Energy and Potential Energy</strong></p>

<p>In the case of a free-falling body, the two kinds of energy we are concerned with are kinetic energy and potential energy. </p>

<p>As an object falls, it gives up potential energy for kinetic energy, the equation for potential energy is...</p>

<pre><code>Potential Energy = Mass x Gravity x Height
</code></pre>

<p>The equation for kinetic energy is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Kinetic Energy = 1/2 x Mass x Velocity(squared)
</code></pre>

<p>So let&#39;s just say, for the sake of simplicity, that our falling object has a mass of 1. (an object&#39;s mass will affect its energy, and its momentum, but not its rate of free-fall.)</p>

<p>The potential energy given up by falling 3 seconds </p>

<pre><code>   (144 ft) is 1 x 32 x 144 = 4608
</code></pre>

<p>The kinetic energy gained after falling 3 secs is </p>

<pre><code>   1/2 x 1 x 96(squared) = 1/2 x 9216 = 4608
</code></pre>

<p>So, all of the available potential energy was converted to kinetic energy. Energy was, in fact, conserved, based upon the sound principle of conservation of energy.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Air resistance</strong></p>

<p>The free-fall equations perfectly predict the behavior of falling bodies which encounter zero resistance, as in a vacuum. </p>

<p>Only when there is zero resistance can any falling object&#39;s potential energy be completely converted into kinetic energy. Anything which interferes with any falling object&#39;s downward progress will cause its acceleration to be reduced from the maximum gravitational acceleration of 32 feet per second per second, as some of gravity&#39;s potential energy is consumed doing work overcoming resistance.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why you may have heard the term &quot;terminal velocity&quot;. The free-fall equations predict that a falling object&#39;s velocity will continue to increase, without limit. <strong>But in air, once a falling object reaches a certain speed, its propensity to fall will be matched by air&#39;s resistance to the fall.</strong> At that point the object will continue to fall, but its speed will no longer increase over time.</p>

<p>There is a maximum possible rate at which objects fall, and if any of gravity&#39;s potential energy is consumed doing anything other than accelerate the object downward, even just having to push air out of the way, there will be less energy available to accelerate the object downward, and so that object&#39;s downward acceleration will be diminished.</p>

<p>And if an object&#39;s downward acceleration is diminished, it will be going slower along the way, and thus it will take longer to fall a given distance.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Free-falling from WTC heights</strong></p>

<p>The towers were 1350 and 1360 feet tall. So  using basic free-fall equations, lets see how long it should take an object to free-fall from the towers&#39; former height.</p>

<pre><code>Distance = 1/2 x Gravity x Time(squared)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>2 x Distance = Gravity x Time(squared)

Time(squared) = (2 x Distance) / Gravity

Time(squared) = 2710 / 32 = 84.7

Time = 9.2
</code></pre>

<p>A basic mathematical equation tells us that it will take 9.2 seconds to free-fall to the ground from the towers&#39; former height.</p>

<p>Using a simpler equation, V = GT, we can see that in order to reach the ground in 9.2 seconds, the free-falling object&#39;s velocity must be about 295 ft/sec, which is just over 200 mph.</p>

<p><strong>But that can only occur in a vacuum.</strong></p>

<p>Since the WTC were in Earth&#39;s atmosphere, you might be able to imagine how much air resistance that represents.  One simply can not believe that any of the WTC towers reached these speeds.  <a href="http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211.web.stuff/Kuhns/terminal_velocity.htm">For example, the commonly-accepted terminal velocity of a free-falling human is around 120 mph. The terminal velocity of a free-falling cat is around 60 mph.</a> </p>

<p>Therefore, air resistance alone will make it take longer than 10 seconds for gravity to pull an object to the ground from the towers&#39; former height.</p>

<p>On page 305 of the 9/11 Commission Report, we are told that the South Tower <em>&quot;collapsed&quot;</em> in 10 seconds, the exact quote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>At 9:58:59, the South Tower collapsed in ten seconds. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This simply can not be, that&#39;s close to the free-fall time in a vacuum, and an exceptionally rapid free-fall time through air even if the &quot;collapse&quot; time was twice as much.</p>

<p>The &quot;collapse&quot; proceeded &quot;through&quot; the lower stories of the tower. Those undamaged floors below the impact zone would have offered resistance that is thousands of times greater than air. </p>

<p>Air can&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>Can anyone possibly imagine the supposedly-undamaged lower floors getting out of the way of the upper floors as effortlessly as air would? Can anyone possibly imagine the lower stories slowing any kind of fall of the upper floors less than would, say, a parachute? (And what energy source could have reduced the height of [most of] the columns, top-down, at the same rate?)</p>

<p>What is certain, beyond any shadow of a doubt, is that <strong>the towers could not have collapsed gravitationally, through intact lower stories, as rapidly as was observed on 9/11.</strong></p>

<p>Not even close!</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>In order for the tower to have &quot;collapsed&quot; gravitationally,  in the observed duration, one or more of the following  conditions must have been met:</p>

<ul>
<li>The undamaged stories below the impact zone offered zero resistance to the collapse</li>
<li>The glass and concrete spontaneously disintegrated without any expenditure of energy</li>
<li>On 9/11, gravity was much stronger than gravity</li>
<li>On 9/11, energy was not conserved </li>
</ul>

<p>However, none of these physics-violating conditions can be accounted for by the official government conspiracy theory of 9/11, nor by any of the subsequent analyses designed to prop up the official theory of 9/11.</p>

<p><strong>The governments explanation for the WTC &quot;collapses&quot; fails the most basic conservation-of-energy reality check. Therefore the governments jet fueled office fires hypothesis is impossible, and thus absurd.</strong></p>

<p>It is utterly impossible for a &quot;gravitational collapse&quot; to proceed so destructively through a path of such great resistance in anywhere near free-fall times, the only logical explanation is controlled demolition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Terminal velocity has nothing to do with it.   The mass to surface area ratio of a building is many orders of magnitude greater than that of a person, which is going to yield a terminal velocity at least several times the speed of sound, in other words, not a factor.</p>

<p>The more important detail you are missing here is that according to the official fairy tale, the lower floors only started falling when the upper floors hit them - the entire building didn&#39;t start its free fall at the instant the top portion started falling (lets call this t0).   Going by this, at say t=3s, the lower half of the building should still have velocity 0, and when it gets hit by upper floors and joins them in their fall, conservation of momentum tells us the upper part needs to slow down.   Simple conservation of momentum, with the slowdowns as each floor gets added in the pancake theory, gives a minimum collapse time &gt; 30s, ignoring air resistance, and ignoring any structural integrity the lower portion of the building had which would have transferred some of that momentum into the Earth.</p>

<p>You missed the point, free-fall equations predict that a falling object&#39;s velocity will continue to increase, without limit. But in air, once a falling object reaches a certain speed, its propensity to fall will be matched by air&#39;s resistance to the fall. At that point the object will continue to fall, but its speed will no longer increase over time.</p>

<p>Thus any resistance at all will cause the object to fall less rapidly than it would have without that resistance, this directly proves that WTC1,2&amp;7 violate physicals laws of science.</p>

<p>Weight is not the same as mass. Mass is a measure of how much stuff is in an object. Weight is a force acting on that stuff</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is going to yield a terminal velocity at least several times the speed of sound</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously not at sea level in earth&#39;s atmosphere when the building&#39;s offered resistance that is thousands of times greater than air, that is the point.</p>

<p>Anyway, the WTC was clearly slower than free fall. Otherwise, how would some of the ejected debris fall more quickly than the collapse front?</p>

<p>The density of concrete is about 19 times the density of a human.  That makes a tremendous difference to terminal velocity, rendering it almost a moot point for the distances considered at WTC.</p>

<p>Vt = square_root( 2mg / rho * A Cd )</p>

<p>A is the area of the falling object, as presented to the air. m is the mass of the object. If density increases, m increases while A does not. Therefore Vt increases if density increases.</p>

<p>Objects do not fall with equal acceleration in air. In a vacuum a bowling ball and a feather fall at the same speed. In air, a bowling ball falls much faster than a feather&#39;s terminal velocity</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TIL.  Thanks for that info.  Rocks are 19x, so I figured concrete was more similar to rocks than water.  I should remember that concrete is mostly water.  Thanks for the comment.</p>

<p>That said, the terminal velocity of concrete is obviously not comparable to the terminal velocity of flesh.</p>

<p>The terminal velocity of both will be the exact same if they both have the same air resistance, ** heavier objects DO NOT fall faster** Galileo demonstrated this centuries ago, this is very basic science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s wrong.  Are you able to read the equation for terminal velocity, or do you even math at all?</p>

<p>Which falls faster: a bowling ball, or a balloon the same size and shape?</p>

<p>You can keep using caps and asterisks.  It&#39;s funny because you are completely ** WRONG **. (!)  Density determines terminal velocity, because terminal velocity is determined by the force that a falling object can exert to part the air.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get all patronizing.  You are wrong.  If you could read the equation I posted, you would know it.  So you are wrong and apparently not qualified to be commenting.</p>
