<p>Are YOU saying that a 100 plus story building could supposedly collapse on firefighters IN the building and when the dust settles there&#39;s blue sky above them? And you think Dr. Wood is the disinfo agent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So then how could the whole place not be red hot? Why wasn&#39;t the building glowing like a sparkler when it came down?</p>

<p>Do you know what thermite is made of? It is made of powdered iron and powdered aluminum mixed together.. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s going to happen when you disintegrate a building made of iron and aluminum as the WTC towers were? You are going to have the same elements of thermite. THIS is why the people who did this USE the thermite cover story to hide the fact they disintegrated the towers...</p>

<p>IF thermite was used to take the towers down how does that explain firefighters having blue sky above them after 100 story buildings were destroyed? They were INSIDE the building when it went down... how does thermite explain that? How do you explain pictures of paper all over the WTC site that isn&#39;t burning if the towers were brought down by thermite?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re attempting to get at around the paper flying around.  They didn&#39;t melt the towers with thermite.  It was used to sever all key steel supports, with conventional explosives used to demolish the reinforced concrete.  Hence, all of the dust.</p>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t explain where all the debris went and how a group of firefighters could see blue sky above them when the towers disappeared above them..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t explain how you would set it all off and ensure it worked... you are naive if you think this could be orchestrated in a building that was operating... and we aren&#39;t talking about buildings that were partially destroyed.. they were completely disintegrated.. all that stuff you are talking about IS the cover story.. they likely concocted to get people like you going down the wrong trail.</p>

<p>And it STILL doesn&#39;t explain how a building could disappear over firefighters IN the building when it was supposedly destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So why didn&#39;t we see all that molten metal all over when the tower was coming down? Why was paper all over the scene after the towers went down that didn&#39;t burn? This is common sense...</p>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t explain how firefighters saw blue sky when they were INSIDE one of the towers when it supposedly fell on top of them.</p>

<p>Also, you claim the thermite cut the steel.. others claim explosives were used. Thermite is simply a flammable material. You could make  an explosive like any other flammable with it. I am not saying they did but that seems to be the argument others have made. But there&#39;s no evidence fo that AND even if that did happen it still doesn&#39;t explain away all the other issues that have no conventional explanation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This just keeps getting more and more laughable with each sad excuse.  Molten metal on the facade and in the basements of the complex is now &quot;debunked&quot; by Ms. Disinfo Woods?  That she honestly tried claiming it couldnt have been thermite, only because the &quot;<em>firefighters were walking in all the water that was on the WTC site.. if it is as hot as the people you trust so much claim then they should have bene cooked..</em>&quot; Can you say L..O..L..  Could this be any more of an idiotic &quot;debunking?&quot;  This is the same stupid whore who came out of nowhere just as the tides of &quot;inside job&quot; were reaching all levels of society and taking hold in the mainstream?  Exactly like the other controlled opposition agents I noted in my earlier response?  You&#39;re unfortunately not making a very compelling argument.  Provide one indisputable proof that shows any of what I&#39;ve posted as being debunked by this pathetic shill.  I welcome your independently verifiable information.  I just doubt you&#39;ll be able to provide anything of substance.</p>

<p>In the mean time, by all means, keep posting your trash.  I really hope you don&#39;t delete this thread after seeing it completely crash and burn here.  People who infiltrate our sub with shitposts and disinformation (like UFOs, racism, Alex Jones, reptilian shape shifters...) frequently do after always finding a less than warm welcome for their lies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s wonderful to witness so many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members very rapidly see that Judy Woods and her idiotic theories are highly implausible.  And that she is very likely little more than controlled opposition, spreading fantasy world bullshit disinfo only to muddy the waters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree.  If it really is true, why don&#39;t you post 2 links to where you&#39;ve already &quot;<em>explained it to [me] twice</em>.&quot; You&#39;re behaving very conspiratard infiltration like here.  Your actions do fit the bill perfectly, as you are apparently physically unable to cite any of your opinions with supporting evidence.  Simple enough.  You&#39;ve had to edit and re-edit almost every single response.  Though still with no evidence in any of them.  You just talk and talk and talk, blabbing away while offering little to no substance.  </p>

<p>I have to wonder why that is.  Is it that you have no supporting evidence, and are avoiding my very direct challenges of you because you know that you&#39;re posting entirely unsupportable disinfo to our sub?</p>

<p>With each response, you keep digging your own grave further.  This lopsided exchange just keeps getting better.  Perhaps you don&#39;t have the intellect to handle honest debates like this, and you&#39;re just in way over your head.  Your next response will confirm or refute this educated assumption entirely.</p>

<p>It&#39;s absolutely no surprise that a person like you supports the known disinfo of the whore shill Judy Woods.

    <div class="md"><p>If you watch that video I showed you Dr. Judy Wood shows how the Earth magnetic field was fluctuating very weirdly the entire time the buildings were coming down. It was fluctuating the entire time building 7 was fuming and then when building 7 went down the magnetometer readings went back to normal.</p>

<p>This was all planned out.. it was no accident. If you think they would leave something like this up to chance and would botch building 7 coming down you are deluding yourself. These people leave nothing to chance. This event was planned out long ahead of time and they weren&#39;t going to use conventional methods that could be traced like conventional explosives... too unreliable and too easy to get caught. The signs of it would have been much more obvious and the buildings would not have been destroyed so completely.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this.. why hasn&#39;t the media reported this more? Either story.. not the thermite and not Dr. Wood&#39;s evidence.. Dr Woods evidence has been shown the least in the mainstream. These people have total control of all of the media. That should show you how much power they have. They have control of the scientific community. If they have control of the scientific community and what you are saying is right then why wouldn&#39;t they have Dr. Wood&#39;s info be the big story among the scientific community? They don&#39;t because it&#39;s the truth...</p>

<p>Oh yes.. let&#39;s not forget the fact that Dr Woods assistant and ex professor were murdered....  in the same fashion Eugene malleove was who was showing the cover up at MIT of cold fusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. If they had all the buildings collapse at once it would have been too obvious. And again you ignore the magnetometer readings. The claims of false reports could even be disinformation.</p>

<p>If DR. Judy Wood is disinfo then you should be able to refute her evidence. No one has. No one has presented evidence remotely close to hers. Controlled opposition doesn&#39;t present EVIDENCE like DR. Wood does.. they present theories and unsupported attacks on real evidence like hers.. &quot;hear say&quot; like &quot;false reports&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not buying the magnetometer readings.  I haven&#39;t seen an ounce of independent verification of this.  If there were, who is to say it wasn&#39;t HAARP or a similar smoke screenn used to disable communication and recording devices. The reason i bring up HAARP is that its effects look very similar to the readings Judy Woods is trying to claim were indications of energy weapon use.  It&#39;s just not believable, and is far too convenient.  The timing of her arrival.  The story itself.  Her refusal to even speculate who <em>could</em> have pulled off the attack with her pet energy weapons.  The mainatream coverage she received (this is a huge indicator).  All of this taken together paints a clear picture of her.  It isn&#39;t pretty.</p>

<p>The fact that multiple controlled MIC news stations misreported the collapse.  I doubt fire was ever the plan for Bldg 7.  Never before has a steel building collapsed due to fire.  Taking out Bldg 7 that much later in the day on purposw makes absolutely no sense.  They expose themselves to the exact same scrutiny and doubt by doing this.</p>

<p>The moon landings were clearly staged propaganda. When more and more people around the world were waking up to this, the whole &quot;there&#39;s alien structures on the moon&quot; disinfo was pushed out.  It was really just the 3M front projection screen.  Deflection from he truth.</p>

<p>The transnational banking class was the brunt of many a conspiracy theory.  Many incredibly damaging to their plans, and adversely affecting them.  David Icke blew up on the scene claiming the elite were really aliens.  Deflection from the truth.</p>

<p>As 9/11 being a false flag has grown immensely as time has gone on.  Judy Woods was dropped into he scene to push her ridiculous fiction of directed energy weapons.  Deflection from the truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m noticing a very distinct patterns here.  Are you?</p>

<p>There we go, folks. AE911Truth is a &quot;limited hangout&quot; because they are really covering up the Space Beams (Judith Wood) and Mini-Nukes (Dmitri Khosolov)</p>

<p>You see, the government wants you to believe that the WTC was blown up in a controlled demolition, as the evidence shows - even the thermetic material found in the dust.</p>

<p>But the government is trying to keep the Space Beams and Mini-Nukes a secret (even though there&#39;s no evidence of either of those things.)</p>

<p>Really, though, they are both &quot;limited hangouts&quot; because what really happened is that Bigfoot knocked down the towers.</p>

<p>Sure, why not!</p>

<p><strong>The Dimitri Khalezov &quot;WTC was nuked&quot; hoax</strong></p>

<p>For years, various disinformation agents have been attempting to sabotage the 9/11 truth movement with claims that &quot;mini-nukes&quot; or &quot;nuclear devices&quot; were used to demolish the World Trade Center. The fact that the Twin Towers and WTC7 (Building 7) were destroyed in a series of controlled demolitions is not in doubt; more than 1,400 architectural and engineering professionals have called for a new, truly independent investigation and cited evidence of controlled demolitions at all three collapsed WTC steel-framed high-rises. A plethora of evidence for controlled demolitions includes numerous reports of molten steel and molten metal found in the debris pile - some of which was analyzed and found to be abundant in iron -  iron-rich spherules indicating a previously molten state that were found in the WTC dust (including a sample collected ten minutes after collapse of the North Tower, eliminating the possibility of contamination from the clean up), an orange-yellow flow of molten material from the South Tower caught on video in the minutes preceding collapse indicative of an iron-rich melt and totally at odds with the &quot;office fires&quot; scenario, heavily sulfidated steel and partly evaporated steel members from WTC7 that were fireproofed with Monokote MK-5 which (according to NIST-sponsored tests on thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity at Anter Laboratories) outperforms the Cafco Blaze-Shield types DC/F and II used in the Towers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not distracting. I&#39;m pointing out that incendiary devices cannot do what happened on that day nor can conventional demo charges.</p>

<p>Thermite, would be used to cut, not &quot;soften&quot;. Also, as I said, conventional demo charges could not turn a building into dust.</p>

<p>And they have billboards, in NY, which are shitty. It&#39;s controlled OP. You really think the advertisers who own the real estate in NY would allow actual facts of 9/11 go up?

<p>I do not support either of the people you mentioned. I find each theory interesting, but not as a belief. I can use my own eyes and see what happened that day was not done by thermite/nano-thermite and demo charges. This was something different.</p>

<p>You defend that group as if you have a stake in the group. I thought questioning all was our ideal?... Guess not when it comes to AE911 Truth....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Becuase AE911 truth is controlled opposition. Controlled by Steven E Jones if not others. Steven E Jones also shut down the cold fusion discovery. Eugene Malleove who was a journalist at MIT discovered a cover-up of positive cold fusion test results and tried to bring this to the people. He was murdered. Dr. Judy Wood&#39;s assistant and ex-professor were murdered because they were trying to bring this info to the masses.</p>

<p>The point is it doesn&#39;t matter if we know how the towers were destroyed... the evidence proves it was done a certain way. If you go through Dr. Wood&#39;s info you find that it had the same characteristics of the Hutchison effect. Hutchison created this effect by creating a static field and then interacting other electromagnetic fields together. We don&#39;t know how they would implement this technology.. but it could have been in any number of different energy generating devices... the issue is how they got them to interact so precisely. But they chose a method that they knew we wouldn&#39;t understand because how else would they get away with this?</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have a serious &quot;questions.&quot; You don&#39;t know the first thing about building demolition, you have no idea how thermite or explosives would have worked at the site, you haven&#39;t examined the evidence, and you have already made a number of false assertions about AE911Truth - all the while siding with Space Beams Judith Woods and Mini-Nuke Dmitri Khosolov in attacking 911 truth as ... a &quot;limited hangout&quot; - a really, really stupid idea that makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>All of these &quot;issues&quot; have been hashed out for OVER FIVE YEARS. At this point, you are just engaging in FUD. Just like the Judith Wood and Dmitri Khosolov trolls. You aren&#39;t &quot;questioning&quot; shit.</p>

<p>Sad, really.</p>

<p>If there were conventional explosives we should have seen debris being ejected from the building on video.</p>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t explain where all the debris went and how a group of firefighters could see blue sky above them when the towers disappeared above them..</p>

<p>Watch this video...</p>

YOU are the one posting links to the disinformation agents.. all that &quot;evidence&quot; you point to has been debunked irrefutably by Dr. Wood.
You use those few sparks falling from to towers to claim they were brought down by thermite? The entire TOWER should have looked like that...
Also.. if the buildings were turning into powdered steel and powered aluminum... then guess what? That would account for traces of what appears to look like thermite...
Also, Wood shows how firefighters were walking in all the water that was on the WTC site.. if it is as hot as the people you trust so much claim then they should have bene cooked.. you are using the governments fake evidence - satellite imagery to make your case... how blind can you be?!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This just keeps getting more and more laughable with each sad excuse.  Molten metal on the facade and in the basements of the complex is now &quot;debunked&quot; by Ms. Disinfo Woods?  That she honestly tried claiming it couldnt have been thermite, only because the &quot;<em>firefighters were walking in all the water that was on the WTC site.. if it is as hot as the people you trust so much claim then they should have bene cooked..</em>&quot; Can you say L..O..L..  Could this be any more of an idiotic &quot;debunking?&quot;  This is the same stupid whore who came out of nowhere just as the tides of &quot;inside job&quot; were reaching all levels of society and taking hold in the mainstream?  Exactly like the other controlled opposition agents I noted in my earlier response?  You&#39;re unfortunately not making a very compelling argument.  Provide one indisputable proof that shows any of what I&#39;ve posted as being debunked by this pathetic shill.  I welcome your independently verifiable information.  I just doubt you&#39;ll be able to provide anything of substance.</p>

<p>In the mean time, by all means, keep posting your trash.  I really hope you don&#39;t delete this thread after seeing it completely crash and burn here.  People who infiltrate our sub with shitposts and disinformation (like UFOs, racism, Alex Jones, reptilian shape shifters...) frequently do after always finding a less than warm welcome for their lies.</p>

<p>It&#39;s wonderful to witness so many <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> members very rapidly see that Judy Woods and her idiotic theories are highly implausible.  And that she is very likely little more than controlled opposition, spreading fantasy world bullshit disinfo only to muddy the waters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your evidence for your conspiracy is provided by the conspirators themselves.. are you F&#39;ing braindead? What more freaking argument do you need? </p>

<p>Who do you think provides the satellite data claiming the rubble was hot? And THAT is what your argument is based on...</p>

<p>And you don&#39;t think the water would be hot if it was molten lava underneath the pile... you need more explanation than that? God help us..</p>
