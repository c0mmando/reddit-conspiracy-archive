       That's already been done.  The bitch is transparent.  It's not surprising that she shuts down whenever someone mentions the all important "who" with her.  She gets froggy every single time.  Doing her employers well.

       Exotic space weapons?  Not needed.  This is one of the classic CIA disinfo plots.  Create a story so unbelievable, it begins to discredit the actual story.  Much like MLK standing next to the people who shot Kennedy.  Ridiculous horseshit.

       No.  I'm saying that thermite and conventional explosives were used to fell the 3 towers.  The planes were just a plot device.

       So then how could the whole place not be red hot? Why wasn't the building glowing like a sparkler when it came down?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what thermite is made of? It is made of powdered iron and powdered aluminum mixed together..
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's going to happen when you disintegrate a building made of iron and aluminum as the WTC towers were? You are going to have the same elements of thermite. THIS is why the people who did this USE the thermite cover story to hide the fact they disintegrated the towers...
      </p>
      <p>
       IF thermite was used to take the towers down how does that explain firefighters having blue sky above them after 100 story buildings were destroyed? They were INSIDE the building when it went down... how does thermite explain that? How do you explain pictures of paper all over the WTC site that isn't burning if the towers were brought down by thermite?

       Thermite.  The same explanation for the cuts in the key support columns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what you're attempting to get at around the paper flying around.  They didn't melt the towers with thermite.  It was used to sever all key steel supports, with conventional explosives used to demolish the reinforced concrete.  Hence, all of the dust.

       So how would you orchestrate cutting the key points for 2 entire 100 story buildings? Also Building 7... and all the other buildings destroyed at the scene...
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were conventional explosives we should have seen debris being ejected from the building on video.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also doesn't explain where all the debris went and how a group of firefighters could see blue sky above them when the towers disappeared above them..

       That doesn't explain how you would set it all off and ensure it worked... you are naive if you think this could be orchestrated in a building that was operating... and we aren't talking about buildings that were partially destroyed.. they were completely disintegrated.. all that stuff you are talking about IS the cover story.. they likely concocted to get people like you going down the wrong trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it STILL doesn't explain how a building could disappear over firefighters IN the building when it was supposedly destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also.. if it was thermite detonating then there should have been loud explosions all over and seismic data showing the buildings hit the ground.

       I'm surprised you don't understand this.  Thermite burns extremely hot, melting steel.  It doesn't explode, using shock damage to demolish.  Here is what thermite looks like cutting a steel beam, as many believe happened with the world trade

       So why didn't we see all that molten metal all over when the tower was coming down? Why was paper all over the scene after the towers went down that didn't burn? This is common sense...
      </p>
      <p>
       This also doesn't explain how firefighters saw blue sky when they were INSIDE one of the towers when it supposedly fell on top of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you claim the thermite cut the steel.. others claim explosives were used. Thermite is simply a flammable material. You could make  an explosive like any other flammable with it. I am not saying they did but that seems to be the argument others have made. But there's no evidence fo that AND even if that did happen it still doesn't explain away all the other issues that have no conventional explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you explain vehicles being completely fried half a mile away from the scene?

       You use those few sparks falling from to towers to claim they were brought down by thermite? The entire TOWER should have looked like that...

       This just keeps getting more and more laughable with each sad excuse.  Molten metal on the facade and in the basements of the complex is now "debunked" by Ms. Disinfo Woods?  That she honestly tried claiming it couldnt have been thermite, only because the "

       " Can you say L..O..L..  Could this be any more of an idiotic "debunking?"  This is the same stupid whore who came out of nowhere just as the tides of "inside job" were reaching all levels of society and taking hold in the mainstream?  Exactly like the other controlled opposition agents I noted in my earlier response?  You're unfortunately not making a very compelling argument.  Provide one indisputable proof that shows any of what I've posted as being debunked by this pathetic shill.  I welcome your independently verifiable information.  I just doubt you'll be able to provide anything of substance.

       In the mean time, by all means, keep posting your trash.  I really hope you don't delete this thread after seeing it completely crash and burn here.

       Really?  And what evidence is that?  Judy disinfo Woods refuses to address who the "conspirators" are.  How exactly do you know who they are then?  You're actively debunking your own disinfo agent with this.  Not very smart of you.  But, since most of this post has been nothing but idiotic, why would I ever expect you to be smart about it?

Your actions do fit the bill perfectly, as you are apparently physically unable to cite any of your opinions with supporting evidence.  Simple enough.  You've had to edit and re-edit almost every single response.  Though still with no evidence in any of them.  You just talk and talk and talk, blabbing away while offering little to no substance.

Perhaps you don't have the intellect to handle honest debates like this, and you're just in way over your head.  Your next response will confirm or refute this educated assumption entirely.

       It didn't work.  That's why Building 7 popped so much later.  It was fully rigged annd they couldn't let that be discovered.  The plan, much like most of their staged events, was heavily error prone.  Why were talking about this bullshit still today.

       If you watch that video I showed you Dr. Judy Wood shows how the Earth magnetic field was fluctuating very weirdly the entire time the buildings were coming down. It was fluctuating the entire time building 7 was fuming and then when building 7 went down the magnetometer readings went back to normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was all planned out.. it was no accident. If you think they would leave something like this up to chance and would botch building 7 coming down you are deluding yourself. These people leave nothing to chance. This event was planned out long ahead of time and they weren't going to use conventional methods that could be traced like conventional explosives... too unreliable and too easy to get caught. The signs of it would have been much more obvious and the buildings would not have been destroyed so completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself this.. why hasn't the media reported this more? Either story.. not the thermite and not Dr. Wood's evidence.. Dr Woods evidence has been shown the least in the mainstream. These people have total control of all of the media. That should show you how much power they have. They have control of the scientific community. If they have control of the scientific community and what you are saying is right then why wouldn't they have Dr. Wood's info be the big story among the scientific community? They don't because it's the truth...
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yes.. let's not forget the fact that Dr Woods assistant and ex professor were murdered....  in the same fashion Eugene malleove was who was showing the cover up at MIT of cold fusion.

       The evidence says otherwise.  They clearly left Bldg 7 to chance.  The early false reports of collapse show the script had been modified at least once.  Possibly more than once, as they corrected the issue and pushed the button again.

       No. If they had all the buildings collapse at once it would have been too obvious. And again you ignore the magnetometer readings. The claims of false reports could even be disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If DR. Judy Wood is disinfo then you should be able to refute her evidence. No one has. No one has presented evidence remotely close to hers. Controlled opposition doesn't present EVIDENCE like DR. Wood does.. they present theories and unsupported attacks on real evidence like hers.. "hear say" like "false reports"

       I'm not buying the magnetometer readings.  I haven't seen an ounce of independent verification of this.  If there were, who is to say it wasn't HAARP or a similar smoke screenn used to disable communication and recording devices. The reason i bring up HAARP is that its effects look very similar to the readings Judy Woods is trying to claim were indications of energy weapon use.  It's just not believable, and is far too convenient.  The timing of her arrival.  The story itself.  Her refusal to even speculate who
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       have pulled off the attack with her pet energy weapons.  The mainatream coverage she received (this is a huge indicator).  All of this taken together paints a clear picture of her.  It isn't pretty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that multiple controlled MIC news stations misreported the collapse.  I doubt fire was ever the plan for Bldg 7.  Never before has a steel building collapsed due to fire.  Taking out Bldg 7 that much later in the day on purposw makes absolutely no sense.  They expose themselves to the exact same scrutiny and doubt by doing this.

       The moon landings were clearly staged propaganda. When more and more people around the world were waking up to this, the whole "there's alien structures on the moon" disinfo was pushed out.  It was really just the 3M front projection screen.  Deflection from he truth.

       How do you explain the hurricane that was tied to this event? That hurricane just so happened to ensure it was a clear day for the 9-11 event. Imagine if the weather was shitty... then how would their little show have played out? How do you explain the firefighters that had daylight above them?

       She clams up when pointedly asked questions that could damage who she is covering for with her disinfo.  The same was seen with Icke.  Again with Percy.  They all have great stories, until you pick them apart.  Get close to the truth, and like majic they now don't know how to act.

       You just don't get it.. she clams up because she doesn't have any conclusive evidence as to who did it.. if she made some baseless claim then her critics would rip her apart. What does analyzing the EVIDENCE have to do with finding the suspects anyway? that doesn't change the evidence.. the problem is people like you and many others are not capable of analyzing the evidence because of how dumbed down society is with their understanding of science.

       Also, AE911Truth has never said ONLY thermetic material was used. Instead, AE911Truth points out that they FOUND thermetic material in the dust. That thermetic material is consistent with the molten pools of steel that lasted for a month afterwards.

       You'll notice that Judith Wood and her Space Beams and her cohort Khosolov's "mini-nukes" are literally just science fiction without a shred of evidence behind them - literally zero physical evidence whatsoever.

       Neither Wood nor Khosolov have EVER done any testing on material from the site.

       Sorry, I was unaware a phantom skyscraper the size of the WTC fell from the sky on that day, onto the real WTC skyscraper. That would be needed in order for your video/source to work. Newton's law and all. Rocky, make it a saki and green tea.

       Your video is an airplane colliding with a stationary wall. Which is proof, the airplanes could not penetrate a building as they say they did.

       This what a lot of people don't seem to understand. Passenger aircraft are aluminum tubes with a shoddy frame in regards to impacts to the stern. Birds can take them out when they are travelling at takeoff and landing speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       An aluminum tube travelling at 350 knots is going to inflict the same damage to a steel frame as one traveling at 500 knots. Take an aluminum can and put it on the ground. Stomp on it with your foot. Is your foot still whole? Hmm. Interesting.

What? Are you implying that the speed of an object does not influence its destructive force?

       You said gravity. Which would require the bottom half to be weakened some how under the plane hit. Explain that. If it wasn't, gravity would've stopped the smaller top portion from collapsing the larger bottom portion. Physics Rocky..... I'm waiting...

       The idea that AE911Truth is a "limited hangout" is so mind-bogglingly stupid I have a hard time believing anyone actually believes that.

       Richard Gage has said he thinks that explosives and incendiaries were used, and Jones and Harrit found thermetic material in the dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       What "limited hangout?" The "limited hangout" theory means that AE911Truth is hiding the evidence of ... "space beams" and "mini-nukes."

       That doesn't make a bit of sense - it's a stupid argument. Dumb, beyond dumb.

       You keep saying that. You are propagating the non-sense. I never said any of the either. What's your agenda? You link anyone question AE911 Truth with people who believe in "space beams" and "mini nukes". That is your MO, why? Why can't people just question the official story and AE911? Your either daft or have an agenda.

       Whatever - no one except internet trolls takes Judith Wood and Dmitrik Khosolov seriously. Certainly, everyone of note in the 9/11 truth movement has distanced themselves from those two nuts.

       There we go, folks. AE911Truth is a "limited hangout" because they are really covering up the Space Beams (Judith Wood) and Mini-Nukes (Dmitri Khosolov)

      <p>
       You see, the government wants you to believe that the WTC was blown up in a controlled demolition, as the evidence shows - even the thermetic material found in the dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the government is trying to keep the Space Beams and Mini-Nukes a secret (even though there's no evidence of either of those things.)

       Really, though, they are both "limited hangouts" because what really happened is that Bigfoot knocked down the towers.

         The Dimitri Khalezov "WTC was nuked" hoax
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        For years, various disinformation agents have been attempting to sabotage the 9/11 truth movement with claims that "mini-nukes" or "nuclear devices" were used to demolish the World Trade Center. The fact that the Twin Towers and WTC7 (Building 7) were destroyed in a series of controlled demolitions is not in doubt; more than 1,400 architectural and engineering professionals have called for a new, truly independent investigation and cited evidence of controlled demolitions at all three collapsed WTC steel-framed high-rises. A plethora of evidence for controlled demolitions includes numerous reports of molten steel and molten metal found in the debris pile - some of which was analyzed and found to be abundant in iron -  iron-rich spherules indicating a previously molten state that were found in the WTC dust (including a sample collected ten minutes after collapse of the North Tower, eliminating the possibility of contamination from the clean up), an orange-yellow flow of molten material from the South Tower caught on video in the minutes preceding collapse indicative of an iron-rich melt and totally at odds with the "office fires" scenario, heavily sulfidated steel and partly evaporated steel members from WTC7 that were fireproofed with Monokote MK-5 which (according to NIST-sponsored tests on thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity at Anter Laboratories) outperforms the Cafco Blaze-Shield types DC/F and II used in the Towers.

       I'm not against a indie investigation. Holy fuck! That was not just a controlled demo, some other tech was used. It wasn't a normal demo. Look at demo clips on youtube. They are different than WTC. I'm not saying it was a fucking nuke or a space beam, I'm questioning all angles. Fucking Christ, is this

       Jets are built quite strong - Strong enough to withstand extreme aeronautical maneuvers.

      <p>
       Despite this strength, they can be pulverised when faced with enough force.

       So imagine the forces involved when 2 of the worlds biggest buildings collapse.

       Do you know that the outer steel shell of the WTC buildings was thicker than tank armor?

      <p>
       And tank thick steel doesn't disappear when buildings  collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, firefighters walked out of where one tower supposedly collapsed on them.. they were unharmed and not buried under rubble.. so you claim there was enough force to destroy the building itself but firefighter could walk out unharmed.. That shouldn't even happen in a 10 story building let alone 100 plus stories..

         You didn't watch the video I showed you if you claim a airplane would destroy a tank. On 9-11 the steel disappeared... watch Dr. Wood's video presentation she shows that the towers were barely taller than an ambulance that was on the street out front of the towers before they went bye bye. If they didn't disappear where did they go?

       I'm not saying Judith Woods is right or not (I do not think it was "space beams"). I'm not a supporter. I'm merely stating, incendiary devices cannot pulverize a building. AE911 Truth relies on thermite/nano-thermite. All fine and dandy, but it wasn't what actually destroyed the buildings (imo). Those buildings were turned to dust. What it was, I have no idea. I find it curious how AE911 Truth is becoming main stream these days....

       AE911truth has never ruled out the use of explosives, and they do not "rely" on thermite. They DISCOVERED thermite.

       Do you even understand the difference?

       I thought the whole point was that thermite was used to soften the steel beams, then explosives were used to start the demolition.

       How utterly pathetic, this attempt to cast aspersions on a group of people who have actually been doing the work. What is really suspicious?

       You realize how much would've had to been used? Also, normal demo charges cannot turn buildings into dust.

       I'm not distracting. I'm pointing out that incendiary devices cannot do what happened on that day nor can conventional demo charges.

        I thought the whole point was that thermite was used to soften the steel beams, then explosives were used to start the demolition.

      <p>
       Thermite, would be used to cut, not "soften". Also, as I said, conventional demo charges could not turn a building into dust.

       And they have billboards, in NY, which are shitty. It's controlled OP. You really think the advertisers who own the real estate in NY would allow actual facts of 9/11 go up? You also talk about Zionists, well NY is a hot bed and many of the ad companies are run by them. Think about it for a second.

       I do not support either of the people you mentioned. I find each theory interesting, but not as a belief. I can use my own eyes and see what happened that day was not done by thermite/nano-thermite and demo charges. This was something different.

       You don't have a serious "questions." You don't know the first thing about building demolition, you have no idea how thermite or explosives would have worked at the site, you haven't examined the evidence, and you have already made a number of false assertions about AE911Truth - all the while siding with Space Beams Judith Woods and Mini-Nuke Dmitri Khosolov in attacking 911 truth as ... a "limited hangout" - a really, really stupid idea that makes no sense whatsoever.

       You are in denial... Also, what about how fast the towers supposedly collapsed... that is another irrefutable piece of evidence... there is no way a structure that heavily built could fall that fast without even slowing down in the slightest.

       Out of pure curiosity, because this is something I take very seriously, if it wasn't an incendiary, and it wasn't a nuclear explosion, and it wasn't some sort of sci-fi futuristic weapon, what does Judy Woods, and fans of hers theorize brought down those towers? What do you believe? I don't pretend to know much, but to me AE911 Truth seemed like a beacon of truth in a the murky studies of conspiracy, why are we shitting on them now?

       Becuase AE911 truth is controlled opposition. Controlled by Steven E Jones if not others. Steven E Jones also shut down the cold fusion discovery. Eugene Malleove who was a journalist at MIT discovered a cover-up of positive cold fusion test results and tried to bring this to the people. He was murdered. Dr. Judy Wood's assistant and ex-professor were murdered because they were trying to bring this info to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is it doesn't matter if we know how the towers were destroyed... the evidence proves it was done a certain way. If you go through Dr. Wood's info you find that it had the same characteristics of the Hutchison effect. Hutchison created this effect by creating a static field and then interacting other electromagnetic fields together. We don't know how they would implement this technology.. but it could have been in any number of different energy generating devices... the issue is how they got them to interact so precisely. But they chose a method that they knew we wouldn't understand because how else would they get away with this?

       All the dust is accountable for by the concrete floors, gypsum drywall and asbestos insulation that would break up due to massive forces exerted in the collapsing structure.

       No. It would be like a tank consisting of steel, concrete, drywall, asbestos, glass, and every other material, being blown to shit, and the components that could turn to dust due to massive forces exerted upon them doing just that, and obscuring much of the debris and components that are not easily destroyed.

       No.. because it's clear that the parts falling come from the outer shell of the buildings. Which is only steel. Yet you can see these steel pieces ejecting dust at a rate that is completely absurd. If you can't even acknowledge that something is horribly wrong with your mind.

       So the seismic data doesn't check out? How so? How about the buildings "falling" as fast if not faster than free fall speed? Or engines melted but the rest of the car not? Or firefighters having blue sky appear above them.... IMPOSSIBLE

       You can put a bunch of BS up and claim it's a refutation, but that doesn't make it so... WHERE is evidence refuting Wood's work? He doesn't provide any.. just hand waves... this SUPPORTS her work rather than refutes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person proves they don't know what they are talking about because Hutchison's work has been replicated by him with many witnesses. This is documented in Nick cook's book the Hunt for Zero Point.
      </p>
      <p>
       This person claims "toasted cars" were moved from the site.. Wood's has pictures of the cars before the event and after in the same place.. so once again this person is simply talking out of their ass. ANYONE can make up excuses with ZERO evidence to back it up...
      </p>
      <p>
       This person also discredits themselves by saying Judy Wood doesn't know what could cause these effects.. THAT DOESN'T REMOVE the evidence... the evidence is there no matter anyone's beliefs in how it would be done.. that is completely backwards logic...

       You don't have a serious "questions." You don't know the first thing about building demolition, you have no idea how thermite or explosives would have worked at the site, you haven't examined the evidence, and you have already made a number of false assertions about AE911Truth - all the while siding with Space Beams Judith Woods and Mini-Nuke Dmitri Khosolov in attacking 911 truth as ... a "limited hangout" - a really, really stupid idea that makes no sense whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of these "issues" have been hashed out for OVER FIVE YEARS. At this point, you are just engaging in FUD. Just like the Judith Wood and Dmitri Khosolov trolls. You aren't "questioning" shit.

       So how would you orchestrate cutting the key points for 2 entire 100 story buildings? Also Building 7... and all the other buildings destroyed at the scene...
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were conventional explosives we should have seen debris being ejected from the building on video.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also doesn't explain where all the debris went and how a group of firefighters could see blue sky above them when the towers disappeared above them..

YOU are the one posting links to the disinformation agents.. all that "evidence" you point to has been debunked irrefutably by Dr. Wood.
You use those few sparks falling from to towers to claim they were brought down by thermite? The entire TOWER should have looked like that...
Also.. if the buildings were turning into powdered steel and powered aluminum... then guess what? That would account for traces of what appears to look like thermite...
Also, Wood shows how firefighters were walking in all the water that was on the WTC site.. if it is as hot as the people you trust so much claim then they should have bene cooked.. you are using the governments fake evidence - satellite imagery to make your case... how blind can you be?!

       This just keeps getting more and more laughable with each sad excuse.  Molten metal on the facade and in the basements of the complex is now "debunked" by Ms. Disinfo Woods?  That she honestly tried claiming it couldnt have been thermite, only because the "

       " Can you say L..O..L..  Could this be any more of an idiotic "debunking?"  This is the same stupid whore who came out of nowhere just as the tides of "inside job" were reaching all levels of society and taking hold in the mainstream?  Exactly like the other controlled opposition agents I noted in my earlier response?  You're unfortunately not making a very compelling argument.  Provide one indisputable proof that shows any of what I've posted as being debunked by this pathetic shill.  I welcome your independently verifiable information.  I just doubt you'll be able to provide anything of substance.

      <p>
       In the mean time, by all means, keep posting your trash.  I really hope you don't delete this thread after seeing it completely crash and burn here.  People who infiltrate our sub with shitposts and disinformation (like UFOs, racism, Alex Jones, reptilian shape shifters...) frequently do after always finding a less than warm welcome for their lies.
