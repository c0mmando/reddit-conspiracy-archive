        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the first I am hearing about these spy balloons. What are they, why do we have them and do we have more? Are these being used at all? </p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2014/12/17/billion-dollar-surveillance-blimp-launch-maryland/">This article posted by someone else in this sub was interesting. From last december</a></p>

<p>I did notice <a href="http://www.intellicast.com/National/Wind/Current.aspx">the wind direction was NW</a>, <del>and where the blimp landed was exactly in line with where the wind would have took it. This supports the idea that it was let loose and drifted. This might mean that it isn&#39;t capable of flying on it&#39;s own, like a drone would be. How would something like this get loose in the first place?</del></p>

<p>Edit: The more I look at where it actually landed, It went straight north or almost NNE. Anyhow I&#39;m pretty convinced this is capable of drone flight, at least maybe that&#39;s what they we&#39;re attempting to test when things went wrong.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if there is <em>too</em> much of a conspiracy here besides the mass domestic surveillance, but it could be done as a distraction or to condition us to their surveillance. Or maybe if we&#39;re lucky, we will find out that the Russian&#39;s were somehow involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a good domestic spying down range blimp story.</p>

<p>So we&#39;re in Afghanistan half way through the tour and they bring one of these big blimps to the main FOB we&#39;re working out of. They tell us about how it works and all this great shit they plan on doing with it. Not even a week goes by and we&#39;re just pulling in doing our post mission chores and one of the NCOs the joes all love and adore gets called up to the company TOC. Shit you not he got caught pissing in the motor pool pre mission by the camera on the blimp. The irony of this is our motor pool area, if that&#39;s what the army wants to call it, was divided in half by a river of septic tank overflow from the neighboring ranger compound that was flowing into a dump on the other side. It was literally a piss and shit river. So every morning we&#39;d gear up for mission dealing with the smells of sewage and burning trash and they treated that as if it was normal. So yeah, he got caught and reprimanded for pissing in the piss river by the blimp. Fast forward probably 4 months and the blimp at this point is worthless. Never did shit for us, don&#39;t even know why it&#39;s there except to make us feel paranoid as fuck that some civilian is watching us anytime we&#39;re out walking around. OK, so at this point typical army snafu we&#39;re having absolutely absurd problems getting our replacement unit out to relieve us at our FOB. We&#39;re due to go home any day and nobody is showing up to take all our equipment, ect. They eventually start trickling in by small waves as we start clearing out. We have to run these stupid left seat right seat with these guys, fittingly referred to as the rip. OK, so here&#39;s the fucked up part. Last mission in Afghanistan, going a few kms up the road and back just to show these new dudes around, same cool ass NCO&#39;s truck gets hit with a huge IED and kills him and 3 kids out of basic that literally just got there from the other unit. Out of 200 dudes, only around 30 of us were even still there. Everyone else was already on Kandahar getting ready to leave. The point of this wall of text is that the stupid blimp was suppose to be watching the culverts making sure dudes weren&#39;t putting IEDs in the roads, but they were to busy with zooming in on dicks in the motor pool.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have known about &#39;em awhile, but mostly because I&#39;ve seen &#39;em and been like, what the what and had to do a little research. </p>

<p>So, according to <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/air-space/isr/2015/10/28/jlens-spy-blimp-is-on-the-loose/74745622/">Defense News</a>, it&#39;s used to &quot;track cruise missiles, aircraft, boats and vehicles from Boston to Norfolk, Virginia, and feed targeting information to missile defense systems.&quot; (Which was actually news to me, because I&#39;d read that they were for incoming missile detection only.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/missile-defense-jlens/">LA Times had a good investigative article</a> just last month about what a boondoggle the entire project is. Apparently they sort of work in Afghanistan because there&#39;s no way for insurgents to know whether they&#39;re working or not. I guess they are thinking it&#39;ll work the same way on Baltimoreans? Dunno.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use them everywhere in Afghanistan. </p>

<p>They were used for tracking personnel and vehicles in a 360 around COPs. Even smaller bases were getting them back in 2010. </p>

<p>They have sophisticated cameras equipped with FLIR as well as zoom down to what patch you are wearing. </p>

<p>Off topic, but all i could think on that tour was &quot;man, I would be fucking pissed if someone drove through my field and had to go through check points. Had blimps watching me and shit.&quot; </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s happening here and all these &quot;seatbelt&quot; check points and speed traps. Fucking no knock night raids. Even that got outlawed for a while IIRC. Stingrays catching everything. Cops killing more motherfuckers than soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sounds like a war. It&#39;s happening everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like the MSM is twisting it to sound like the blimps are only used to protect us from outside attacks, when they are most likely being used to spy on Americans. This shows the difference between the war in Afghanistan and the war on American civilians - the Afghani knew they were getting fucked, we&#39;re still, for the most part, oblivious.</p>
