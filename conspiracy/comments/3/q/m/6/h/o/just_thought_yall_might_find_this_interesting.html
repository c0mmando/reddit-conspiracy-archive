       So, ever wonder how nuclear casks are transported when power plants finally get around to getting rid of the things? Well this recently came across on the top photographs of the past 24 hours on a site I go to regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.railpictures.net/viewphoto.php?id=551999&amp;nseq=8">
        http://www.railpictures.net/viewphoto.php?id=551999&amp;nseq=8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What you see here is the typical movement called a "cask" train.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since it may take explaining to understand it, I'll do what I can. (I'm a railfan in my spare time.)
      </p>
      <p>
       First off, Casks are HEAVY.  More than you'd expect.  Each cask itself is made of specially welded steel lined with lead. Depending on the cask design (the brits have larger ones) there's about a foot of lead inside the cask, forming a barrier.  Inside that is another steel container in which the nuclear material is kept, with concrete poured in around it.  Hence the weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, to the train itself.  The first car is a "spacer" car.  It's actually a depressed center flat car, and really only there as a safety precaution.  While the cask itself would survive an accident without so much as a dent...the locomotive wouldn't.  So by putting a spacer car there, you have some measure of protection in the event something DOES go bad.  No squashed locomotives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next car is the Cask itself.  Note that it has 4 trucks (bogies) and 8 axles under it.  Remember that weight I talked about? Well this is one way they deal with it.  The car still weighs easily as much as two of those locomotives put together, but that helps considerably.   The next car is just a spacer car.  It's there to ensure you don't have too much weight in one place for when the train crosses bridges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind that while the US does have many steel and concrete bridges, there are still a large number of wooden trestles on major main lines.  So, railroads try to space things out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You actually see spacer cars turning up on some short lines.  For example, for many years the Southern railroad serviced an old short line that been scooped up in a round of purchases.  When originally operated, the line was relegated to using an older switching locomotive. However, that locomotive broke down, forcing Southern to find other options.  They settled on taking an old out of service boxcar, running MU (Multiple Unit) cables through it, and placing it between the head end power on a train.  So the trains ran in an engine-boxcar-engine-train arrangement.  All to distribute the weight out.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you see those odd coal hopper cars between the cask cars, and of course the flat car at the rear with the caboose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The caboose for the men with guns who will...
      </p>
      <p>
       Kidding.  Seriously, the caboose there is for a valid reason, though.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a "pushing platform" for the most part.  The main problem railroads have, when dealing with cask movements, is very rarely do the power plants actually have a way for the locomotive to run around the train prior to loading.  So, it has to either back into the siding, or in most cases, back out.  FRA rules actually require shoving platforms (old cabooses) to be on such trains.  It gives the crew a place to ride, while providing added security so they don't accidentally back into something.  Another train being the usual something.
      </p>
      <p>
       While in transit, the caboose on these trains also houses a number of GPS tracking systems, which augment the ones in the locomotive itself, so the railroad (and yes, the Dept of Energy) can keep a track on where the train is going, and if problems arise.  Lastly, the crew is complemented by a handful of men whose entire job is to watch the casks. Not for fear of theft (good luck sticking one of THOSE in your pocket) but for clearance issues that may arise. (height issues, not width)
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case, I thought you would find this interesting to say the least. The photo itself was taken Sept 2 of 2015, and isn't that uncommon.  I myself have photographed a couple in the past, including one that had somehow managed to get wedged under a low concrete over pass that brought the train to a rather sudden stop.

       These casks are empty. You can tell because they have no spacer cars, and are in the middle of a mixed freight train.
      </p>

       How the brits do it.  Their casks do not weigh as much as the US type (the US type being between 50 and 150 tons), so they can be shipped without spacer cars.

       Another Brit movement.  Normally, when the British use two locomotive, they "top and tail" the train.  Meaning they place a locomotive at either end.

       Heaviest flask type the British have.  100 to 200 tons in weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think one of the things about these movements that I find most interesting, is the fact that they're very safe.  In fact, it's probably the safest method to move spent fuel around.  The casks themselves are designed to be almost impossible to break into, being able to sustain massive damage without cracking or leaking. To put this to the test, the British actually went so far as to crash a full train into an empty cask, just to see what would happen.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case, this may set some fears aside. I remember seeing someone mention (not sure if it was here or not) that it would be easy to derail one of these cask trains in a city and create an impromptu dirty bomb.  Given all the safeguards that go into them, and what I've shown above, I'd have to say these things are like the black boxes of aircraft.
