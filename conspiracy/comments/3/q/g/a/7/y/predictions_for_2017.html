<p>Huh? What does that have to do with the fact that it looks like you&#39;re an avid fiction writer when you&#39;re /user/TigersOfDetroit, you then delete /user/TigersOfDetroit to <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_XRTjJBpw5gJ:https://www.reddit.com/user/TigersOfDetroit+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us">remove evidence of you being a fiction writer</a>, then you post this story to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> under a different username?</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t believe you saw any of this during lucid dreams, but from your conscious imagination. All evidence points to you being an attention-seeking troll.</p>

<p>The only thing interesting here is what your inspiration may have been for trolling <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Why not just come clean and admit these are just some predictions you have, rather than making it an elaborate, fictional lucid dream story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enter John Titor Joke Here.</p>

<p>But in all seriousness, there is some valid hypothesis about time travel through lucid dreaming floating around in some of the more seedier parts of the internet.  I don&#39;t doubt your experience, simply because I have no reason not to.  But this reads like numerous other people who have come out over the last decade claiming the same things.  </p>

<p>For example, the Alien Races book alleges that in 2017 we will see the beginning, and in 2022 we will see the beginning of the end unless we all change.</p>

<p>Michael Jackson said before he died we had 10 years to change or we will lose everything.  He died in 2009 so 2017 would be within that 10 years.</p>

<p>The talk of weather, nuclear war, intervention with russia and china was all laid out for us by John Titor, though he claimed a civil war would start in America sometime around 2015.</p>

<p>Perhaps you just tapped into the collective consciousness that has been around for a while now, and downloaded it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, next time you lucid dream, see if you can find the source of the dream/dreamer, where is it all coming from, keep going deeper.</p>

<p>I lost the ability to lucid dream, but when I was in my teens, i learned how to go to sleep while lucid dreaming, and enter a dream within the dream, and started question where its all coming from and started entering into Oneness that would remain upon waking up. Boy do I got some stories to tell</p>

<p>Practice, write down every dream when you wake up, tell your subconscious every night before going to sleep that its going to happen, remember so trigger like a red ball or woman in a red dress, as your trigger to make you conscious, Google &quot;dream yoga techniques&quot; and get practicing. My 1st one came about within 3 weeks and then 2-3 months after that it was every night</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a difference between astral projecting, and lucid dreaming.</p>

<p>If you dreams were in color you were in the astral which generally occurs in the moments before you enter REM sleep.  Which would explain why you couldn&#39;t control it.</p>

<p>If it was lucid, it would be in black and white and lucid generally occurs in the moments after you enter REM sleep but you have trained yourself to stay coherent enough to allow your mind to wander.</p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert, but I dabble.  Got really good at it too.</p>

Plus a hurricane can not be affected by human action.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually relieved at your prediction ... compared to this other one:</p>

<p>The election of 2016 is thrown into the House of Representatives in an &quot;Election of 1824&quot; scenario because no candidate receives the minimum threshold of 270 electoral votes.  Although the House of Representatives is Republican-controlled, the GOP vote is split between third-party ticket Trump/Cruz &amp; &quot;establishment&quot; ticket Carson/Bush.  Democratic ticket Bernie/Hillary &quot;wins&quot; with the most votes of the three, but it is disputed because a narrow plurality of the country voted Republican: in effect, a reversal of Bush vs. Gore, because the popular vote is narrowly Republican, but the Supreme Court declares Bernie/Hillary the winner.</p>

<p>But on 11/9, a few days after the election, a worldwide international terror attack (the &quot;International 9/11&quot;) strikes with simultaneous downings of commercial airliners (using the &quot;400 Benghazi surface-to-air missiles&quot;) in 12 international cities, plus a nuclear &quot;dirty bomb&quot; attack on LAX that contaminates a thirty-mile zone (&quot;TMZ&quot;).  There is a mystery air-bombing of the &quot;Twin Towers&quot; (twin temples) on Temple Mount in Jerusalem, allegedly &quot;ushering in the Antichrist&quot; according to Christian eschatology.  Trump, Cruz &amp; Carson are killed in the attacks, along with many celebrities and public figures &amp; politicians.  &quot;Bush kept us safe!&quot; Cheney declares on FOX News.  &quot;The Obama Era has come home to roost!&quot;</p>

<p>The 11/9 attacks <em>continue for 9 days</em> including <em>terror attacks in all 50 states</em> with bioweapons including Anthrax &amp; Bubonic Plague.  When the attacks first strike, Obama has a fatal heart attack on the golf course &amp; Biden is sworn-in as president.  Arrangements are quickly made to insert Hillary as VP (as Ford was made Nixon&#39;s VP without an election), and within days, Biden steps down to let Hillary take over as president ala Gerald Ford.</p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> subreddit is locked-down allegedly due to &quot;accurate predictions of dates, places and times of attack&quot; but, in reality, posts about an &quot;Oliver North Iranian arms network developed as the real operational objective of Iran-Contra&quot; are the target, and vanish as the subreddit is quickly reopened and &quot;gamed&quot; with JTRIG armies of reactionary dissent claiming Obama&#39;s Koran has been found &amp; demanding &quot;a U.S. military coup to intervene against Democrats.&quot;</p>

<p>The California attacks create a &quot;Hollywood coup&quot; and &quot;reversal of political allegiances&quot; as &quot;liberals&quot; and &quot;former liberals&quot; declare they are &quot;coming out of the closet as Republicans&quot; despite glaring suspicions from Cheney&#39;s &quot;predictions&quot; of the attacks.  Economic chaos from the shutdown of the commercial air industry results in trucking industry shutdowns of major freeways &amp; a new &quot;Bonus Army&quot; descending on the Washington D.C. mall by early December.</p>

<p>The FBI immediately claims ISIS is responsible for the attacks as they begin on 11/9, but it is quickly claimed that Iran is the state-sponsor of the attacks, and several Iranian hardliners step forward to claim responsibility.  Republicans accuse Hillary of staging a coup, and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan orders simultaneous hearings for impeachment against Hillary AND the initiation of a new HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee) to investigate ISIS sleeper cells in U.S. cities.</p>

<p>Rumors of Bernie stepping down as president before he is even sworn-in end when Sanders dies of a heart attack, dividing the Democratic party further as Sanders supporters accuse Hillary of pressuring Sanders, if not literally ordering the assassination.  Hillary appears to have very little, if any, support as she is sworn-in as President on January 20, 2017, and on April 4, 2017, in the middle of a GOP walkout of Congress, during an &quot;emergency session&quot; being held by Hillary, &quot;two disgruntled USAF infiltrator Lone Gunmen&quot; crash their plane into the Capitol Dome (which is currently being renovated by the same company that &quot;renovated&quot; the exact 6 floors, and ONLY those 6 floors, of WTC-1 that were struck: Turner Construction), killing all national-level Democrats:  a military coup in disguise as the Pentagon declares a state of emergency, and Cheney&#39;s COG (Continuity of Government operations) go into effect; Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is sworn-in as &quot;Emergency President&quot; by John Roberts at midnight on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  </p>

<p>The Operation Falcon roundups &amp; domestic assassinations begin, the Pentagon/intelligence community purges begin, the HUAC-2 showtrials of &quot;Al Qaeda/ISIS conspirators within the government&quot; begin, the appointment of an &quot;emergency handpicked Congress&quot; begins, the shutdown of Twitter, the roundups of &quot;dissidents&quot; in sports stadiums across the U.S., the new checkpoints established to enter and leave major cities, the &quot;temporary&quot; injunctions against &quot;free press spreading Al Qaeda/ISIS code words&quot; by &quot;moles within the media&quot;, sweep through the U.S. in April &amp; May of 2017.</p>

<p>There is a New Madrid fault earthquake, and a California earthquake, and a strange global event involving a burst of radiation from a distant celestial collision which is interpreted by many in the world as a religious sign.  Amidst the U.S. military coup &amp; several government coups among Western nations (a simultaneous &quot;decapitation of Leftist heads-of-state&quot;), there are mass-executions of protesters &amp; mass-conversions of religious believers following the celestial sign.</p>

<p>The D.C. Mall &quot;Bonus Army&quot; encampment becomes a July 2015 Tianenmen Square-style massacre of protesters on the National Mall, and the U.S. military begins emergency operations against Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador &amp; Bolivia.  WW3 begins over Syria in October, wiping out billions of lives but mostly in the U.S., Russia &amp; China and eventually throughout the Northern Hemisphere by contamination.  But within days of the &quot;overnight war&quot; there is a CME (Coronal Mass Ejection) from the sun eliminating all life in the Southern Hemisphere and temporarily destroying parts of the upper atmosphere; radiation contaminates all food stocks worldwide including in bunkers.  Electromagnetic effects render electronics, including batteries, inoperable.  The immediate melting of Antarctica destabilizes the axis and orbit of the Earth, raises sea-levels, and creates tsunamis.  The additional sea-level rise affects undersea tectonic plates which collapses several, and entire nations disappear into the sea, including Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Finland; California is gone into the sea.  This is followed by a 9-year nuclear winter and worldwide famine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After your experience, would you recommend lucid dreaming to others?  </p>

<p>You believe you have seen the future, do you think it is the only possible future or could it change?  Obviously there are paradoxical problems here if you could personally take some action to prevent something that you saw from occurring.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;d be amazed at how once the fire starts, you notice that there was tinder everywhere the whole time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, panic spreads quickly as soon as certain things are threatened.  Runs on grocery stores that occur during relatively minor emergencies can be extrapolated into what would occur if the supply chain did not resume operation in a couple of days.  If people&#39;s source of food, water or fuel becomes uncertain society can change very quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, mainly because it stripped me of my ego in the beginning. Your subconscious can be very frightening and enlightening as well.</p>

<p>Most of my dreams have been FAR in the future and I usually meet with the same 3 or 4 individuals. Now that I&#39;ve been experiencing years instead of decades or centuries all of this is coming together. It&#39;s something I may be working on turning into a novel with the help of some people I&#39;ve met on WP.</p>

<p>From what I understand this is the outcome, I haven&#39;t had any inconsistencies yet. What amazes me the most is the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s. The color purple is very important, fracking ruins the planet &quot;for the greater good&quot; and becomes as common as the military units on every corner. I don&#39;t want to go to far into it yet but what we learn  in this period changes technology and spirituality. This new front becomes the common man&#39;s firearm to resist widespread control, so much that it becomes a stalemate for decades, possibly into 2100.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys... the other night I had a precognitive dream. They really do happen.</p>

<p>I dreamt that I was in my house, and I saw that my sister had gone to SkyTop orchard (about 50 miles away) and gotten some apples. A crate of them was sitting on the counter. </p>

<p>It was an extremely vivid dream. Very memorable.</p>

<p>About ten days later, I eating something in the kitchen, and I noticed a plastic bag of apples on the counter that said &quot;SkyTop Orchards.&quot; I had a WTF moment and asked my mom when my sister got the apples. She said &quot;two days ago.&quot; She got these apples <em>after</em> I had the dream. There&#39;s no chance that I heard her say she would go to skytop before I had this dream. I hardly ever talk to my sister, and I always wear earplugs around the house. It really was a precognitive dream.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also met a man who has had a very detailed precognitive dream as well. These things happen. I&#39;m sure of it. I&#39;ll definitely save this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the parameters of what you are predicting, I cannot imagine that any other candidate would act differently as president. The stage has already been set within the escalation in Syria. Once Iran gets involved, and if they use nukes or are set up to use nukes (e.g., someone nukes and blames Iran via propaganda/lies), you&#39;re going to have escalation. The stage is already set. Unless you&#39;ve got a white dove in the white house, you&#39;re not going to have any other outcome from that chess move. And given the candidates we&#39;ve got (Trump vs. Clinton most likely), there are no white doves in the running. Except instead of saying, &quot;we came, we saw, he died,&quot; Hillary would say, &quot;we came, we nuked, you die.&quot; </p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your experiences. Given what&#39;s happening in Syria, I feel like we&#39;re already on the brink of WW3, just that no one is ready to call it that. Thanks, Obama.</p>

The current intervention situation is no doubt made worse by military intervention however, especially now that Russia is involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is total bullshit and I&#39;m calling you out on it. I have been lucid dreaming since I was a child which is what initially got me interested in dreams. I have conducted thousands of sleep studies professionally since early 2003 after finishing my degree in sleep study. &quot;Time dialation&quot; is not possible in the context you are putting it. For anyone who has studied even the basics of dreams and how your brain functions while dreaming would know that this is a complete and out right lie. You could have dreamt of &quot;the future&quot; but as I stated earlier time dialation is not possible for long term periods. If your brain was even capable of keeping you in a dream for &quot;years&quot; as you percieved them in the &quot;dream world&quot; (which it&#39;s not) it would have caused permanent brain damage and your perception of time and reality would be skewed. People who aren&#39;t educated about dreams may fall for this but those of us who are know that you&#39;re just calling attention to yourself and pretending you have some sort of precognitve ability. I have met literally hundreds of people like you who claim to be able to stay in dreams for longer than possible and claim to have future predictions that always turn out false. You are tricking these people into believing you with open-ended statements and using &quot;general-speak&quot; which means most of these outcomes could technically be possible based on what we already know about the world. You are not psychic, you do not have precognitive abilities and you are blatantly lying to yourself and everyone on this subreddit. When your &quot;predictions&quot; turn out false and you have hopefully matured a bit more I hope that you are able to come to terms with who you actually are instead of parading around like a false psychic.</p>

<p>Note: a dead giveaway is that you said you didn&#39;t want to &quot;spoil&quot; the new Starwars movie for us. I doubt you would be able to give a detailed summary of the movie and tell us about scenes that only someone who would have seen the movie would remember. Plus the fact that you contradict yourself multiple times in your own post (which has been archived), which you will undoubtedly edit to make it seem more believable after seeing comments like this.</p>

<p>Everyone who lives in Wales... Or England... Or Scotland...</p>

<p>It&#39;s &quot;The Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;, so no, Ireland aren&#39;t part of Britain, though they are part of the British Isles - the two are different things. Wales, England, and Scotland are &quot;British&quot;, and the Irish are just Irish.</p>

All i&#39;m saying is that you can&#39;t say &quot;impossibile&quot; before 2017. Before that, there is just &quot;quite highly improbable&quot;. Only past is certain.. it&#39;s just probability theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the long post and effort at predicting the future. I find most of your predictions pretty normal guesses from recent past events however. That makes their value as a &#39;prediction&#39; much less. Generally, in my experience, people faking it try to piece together current information and predict highly likely outcomes. People who really see the future state something completely unknown that nobody thinks is even possible. I could go through your predictions one by one but I&#39;ve already wasted enough time on this. Coming from a Reddit account 1 month old makes it pretty meaningless to me personally. </p>
