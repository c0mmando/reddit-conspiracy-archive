<p>Looks like it was deleted because the link goes to a petition and those aren&#39;t allowed according to the <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> sidebar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was deleted from a subreddit.. It wasn&#39;t deleted from the entire internet that we can access in America..

    <div class="md"><p>Same with America (and the rest of the world). A few media companies control pretty much all you see on a day to day basis. There is still alternate media, but those are termed as &quot;conspiracies&quot; and the system is designed to reject those opinions and people who tout them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They might be called &quot;conspiracy sites&quot; but they are still allowed to exist and anybody in America can read them.  I can write a blog about America being a piece of shit and the government being corrupt and I won&#39;t get arrested and the blog won&#39;t be shut down.  You&#39;re being recklessly hyperbolic to say that America is as bad as China or North Korea.  You are diminishing the actual struggle for free speech and press that takes place in those countries.  Being labeled a conspiracy theorist for talking shit about our government is a lot better than being hauled off to prison or being executed for crimes against the state.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;s better in some aspects. But worse in others. Western culture is over sexualized, consumeristic and self righteous. They engage in torture, fight illegal wars where it is none of their business. As far as I know, China does not do that. The American propaganda machine has done far more damage than the others combined, but at this point I feel they are all working with each other. You scratch my back, I&#39;ll scratch yours. Let&#39;s not fight against each other instead stand united in exposing these douchebags for what they are. Peace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you would think petitions would be a r/politics thing that is allowed since we live a <em>ahem</em> free nation and can make changes to fit our needs (I know its not like this but, would it be nice?).
