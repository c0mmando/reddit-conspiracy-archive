        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_veteran_suicide">In 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers committed suicide, conversely 176 soldiers were killed in combat. In other words, more soldiers committed suicide compared to being killed in action.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.stripes.com/military-suicides-remain-constant-despite-pentagon-efforts-1.371505">Military suicides remain constant despite Pentagon efforts</a></p>

<p>This subject is being kept as quiet as possible and this truly needs to be a major awareness within the US. It could have the power to stop this War on Terror madness and bring the troops home and offer the mental health support they dearly need.</p>

<p>To me, it is obvious as to why these numbers are so high... Deep down inside every single soldier who has pulled the trigger and killed another human being or experienced some kind of a traumatic experience of people dying around them... is not going to be OK. If they make it home, they realize there is no support and see that it was all for a lie... they are not going to be OK.</p>

<p>We need to fully realize the mental destruction that is going on within the US Military personnel.</p>

<p>There has to be a way to stop the War on Terror using the power of the people. They just need to know the right facts and demand changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the point of your comment? To deride and attack someone linking a helpful resource in a thread dealing with a tough subject? Perhaps it&#39;s to help those who might stumble across this and click it due to feeling some thoughts of suicide themselves, and then bam. A helpful resource. </p>
