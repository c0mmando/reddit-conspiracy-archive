       I just want everyone here to be aware that dinosaurs are real and they are living in Argentina.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus points to those of you that know Angus meat is dinosaur meat.  Also be sure not to eat it, that stuff is destined for markets like China and Asia.  It is horrendously bad for humans to eat dinosaur meat.

       Why when stories about Dinosaurs living in massive jungle areas like Argentina have circulated for centuries?
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that we know from Paleontology that Argentina had plenty of them in the past.
       <a href="http://www.welcomeargentina.com/paleontologia/hallazgos_i.html">
        Argentina
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know that while the meteor that ultimately killed off the dinosaurs did an impressive job, its estimated it only killed off around 70% of the species at the time. Since Dinosaurs evolved into birds wouldnt that dictate that dinosaurs survived for some extended period of time in order to complete that evolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whose to say what other evolutionary tricks mother nature pulled with those things. Asexual reproduction, immortal jellyfish and creatures putting themselves into stasis are just some scientific examples of how it could happen.

       According to Jack Horner, professor of palaeontology at Montana State University, the answer is an unequivocal yes.

       Santa is largely a creation of Coca Cola, while St Nick is an actual person known for generosity and miracles. Interestingly some of the early art for Santa painted him closer to one of his elves, he got fatter and older later on until we come to the Santa  we know today. It's actually interesting how he evolved.

       Unicorns are a bit iffy, but only if you mean the big white horses with a horn. Other cultures have pictured them as deer, goats or in China something resembling a dinosaur/dragon. The deer has been proven. So in that sense a unicorn is as real as a gorilla, giant squid or giraffe which were also thought myths by know it all assholes
      </p>
      <p>
       Demons are another iffy thing if you are being very literal, however when you consider that certain deformities and conditions can present demon like qualities then it becomes a bit easier to understand. Best guess personally if some human cousin that largely survived on savagery  and relied on rape for procreation.

       Here's one: On a flat Earth, up for you is the same up for me. We both have the same night sky regardless of what country we're in.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a round earth, depending on the hemisphere, up for you may be down for me, so we should have a different nights sky.

      <p>
       People in different hemispheres have different star maps, therefore, Earth is round.

       Ok, but you do realize you can't arrive at that conclusion with the information you have. Star maps are different depending on where you are on this vast earth, doesn't make it round. I could just as easily say star maps are different depending on where you are therefore the earth is a triangle. But the topic is too vast to get into it with someone who is closed minded. So stay that way, it makes no difference to me.

       is right.  The star maps do indeed make it clear that the world is not round.  Think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the surface of a flat disc only 1 hemisphere of stars would ever be visible because the plane of the Earth would block our view of the 180 degrees of stars beneath our feet.  However, on any night I can call a friend in South America and he can confirm that he sees an almost entirely different set of stars.  The stars that I see towards the Southern Horizon will be the same ones he sees towards the Northern Horizon.  In total, we will have view to greater than 180 degrees of stars and, from the Flat Earth, only 180 degrees of them could ever be visible.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is trivially easy to demonstrate the impossibility of the Flat Earth.

       Sorry, but that still doesn't prove the earth is round, any more than if I see the sun at point x in the sky from Montreal, and call my mom in Vancouver and it's at point y. If you look at the sky and see a storm and call your friend in south America and the sky is sunny does it prove the earth is round? It does prove perhaps that the earth is extremely large, and that you can't see the same things in differ spots, but it doesn't prove it's round.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to be an ass, but the fact that you can't see the same thing from the same place is an interesting fact, but doesn't prove the earth is round. 
I'm also certain you've never called a friend and asked him such a question, and if you did you'd have your self a very difficult thing to conclude over the phone. Also, your entire answer rests on the assumption the earth is round and automatically rejects any other possibilities.

       No, my assumption rests on simple geometry.  If everyone is on the same surface of a Flat Disc then that has profound implications for what we could see.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that the stars form a 360 degree sphere around the Earth.  Thousands of years of observation make this clear.  Everyone knows this.  No one disputes this.  Look at any star map.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have spent more than 5 minutes studying astronomy then you already know this. But, from the Surface of a Flat Disc only 180 degrees could ever be visible at any time.  Why?  Because we are all on the same side of the disc, so unless the Earth is see-through then the stars below our feet will be obscured for all observers.  But, on any given night we can see far more than 180 degrees of stars from the surface of the Earth.  That is proof positive right there.  I know you are wedded to your loony theory, but sorry man, you need to give it up.  It is easily disproven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the existence of 2 celestial poles is another nail in the Flat Earth coffin.  Since we are all on the same side of a Flat Disc there can only be 1 celestial pole.  That celestial pole would be visible to every person on the disc.  Instead, we see 2 celestial poles and each is only visible to people in one hemisphere.  A Flat Earth cannot have two celestial poles.  This Earth has two celestial poles.  The Earth is not flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the experiment I shared via pdf also disproves the flat Earth, unless you guys have your own magical trigonometry.

       Technically Dino's are all over the world today in the form of birds. Science just needs to awaken the genetic code from bird eggs and activate dormant genes to grow an ancient dinosaur.

       Umm you realize that alligators and crocodiles are "living" dinosaurs, right ? They have not changed (they are smaller in size now for 40-50 million years now) for maybe what 200 million years... same can be said for most lizards like komodo dragons for example which are about around for 50 millions.
