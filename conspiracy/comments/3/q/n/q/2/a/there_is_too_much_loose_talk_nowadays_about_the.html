       LABOR AND CAPITAL
      </p>
      <p>
       VIEWS ENTERTAINED BY ROTHSCHILD ON THE SUBJECT
      </p>
      <p>
       The Baron Does Not Believe a Crisis Is At Hand and Thinks the Laboring Man Is Content With Things As They Are
      </p>
      <p>
       Paris, Sept. 14. SPECIAL CABLE - FIGARO published today a special interview with Baron Alphonso Rothschild on the so-called social and economic crisis of the present. Baron Rothschild preluded his remarks with the declaration that there was neither a social nor an economic crisis, as alarmists in all countries were pretending.
      </p>
      <p>
       There had been monetary crises, resulting in unfortunate failures, as for instance, the collapse of the Barings, but the general situation in Europe had remained unchanged by them. The business world at present was far from being in a bad condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I do not believe the so-called Labor Movement", Baron Rothschild continued, "I am confident that the workingmen generally speaking are satisfied with their condition, and have neither cause nor desire to complain. They are, I am convinced, indifferent to Socialism. To be sure, some agitators make plenty of noise, but that amounts to nothing. They do not influence the honest and reasonable workmen. In considering the so-called labor movement it is necessary however to distinguish good bad workmen. Only the idle, good-for-nothing desire the eight-hour day. Serious men, fathers of families, work as long as they think necessary for their own and for their children's needs. There is too much loose talk nowadays about the danger of so much capital in the hands of a few men. This is all rubbish. Some men are richer; others are poorer; tomorrow this is all changed by vicissitudes which nobody can control. It is money which circulates, that fructifies, and money circulates with the same risk to all. It is money which one lends in confidence for so-called good things which do not always turn out to be good. All that applies to the great as well as to the small venturer. Frighten and threaten capital and it vanishes. Capital is like water. Grasp it violently, and it slips through your fingers; treat it gently, dig a canal in which to lead it, and it runs wherever you will."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Capital is a country's fortune. It represents the energy, intelligence, thrift and labor of the people. Capital is labor. Apart from unhappy exceptions which seem to be unavoidable, each shares in the capital according to his intelligence, energy and work accomplished. If a workman is dissatisfied with his share, he may strike. It is unjust to compare a man with capital and intelligence, organization faculties, invention and knowledge with any gross, brutal workman who applies to his work only the unintelligent work of his hands."
      </p>
      <p>
       In conclusion, Baron Rothschild said that the war on capital was brutal and baneful, and that anti-Semitism was brutal and irrational.

       Such brutal irony that a word of that meaning could be mentioned in such context by what is such a stupid person. If these are real quotes, then it is apparent that these are the sensibilities of a man who has spent
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       of time rationalizing his evil and destructive lifestyle.

      <p>
       That's what pisses me off about the so called secret societies and illuminated, many of them are chicken headed idiots who force each other into dresses and beat each other yet want to give the illusion of being wise or knowledgeable. This writing from Rothschild just sounds like some serious r iamverysmart material right there.

       More like it was commentary from someone used to being up in the pinnacles of power and wealth, knew no other way of being, personally, and then pronounced what he saw as how things were and ought to be.

       It reads like an enslaver trying to convince his slaves that they aren't actually slaves, and that they should look over there at their fellow slaves (who aren't actually slaves) instead of at him and the other enslavers (who aren't actually enslavers), and anyway it isn't anyone's fault because "money" and "this is how things are".

       Like what 1 man caused the 1892 "crisis"? Like earlier in 1800's when Vanderbuilt shut down the bridge to new york city, crashing the economy? Or when Rockefeller stopped shipping his products by rail (when like 80 or more percent of all the cargo was his) again crashing the economy? Sorry but that is just wrong.

       The great depression was basicallyorchestrated by the relativly new federal reserve. The roaring 20s = FED was lending to everyone. Then they stopped lending, farmers etc couldn't pay their loans, and when they were forced to liquidate, the fatcats bought it up for a song.
