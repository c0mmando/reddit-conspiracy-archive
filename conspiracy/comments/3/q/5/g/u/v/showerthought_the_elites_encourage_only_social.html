    <div class="md"><p>I think you are onto something.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s weaponizing activism and turning it against the crowd in order to insulate the establishment from any kind of real critique.  I believe any critique of government is met with &#39;soft opposition&#39;--the rabbling of opinions until the information overload becomes either repellant, boring or akin to &#39;analysis paralysis&#39; whose only solution is <em>learned helplessness</em> or &#39;keep calm and carry on&#39;.  </p>

<p>For example, both the Tea party and Occupy movements failed by having too many competing tropes and no &#39;unified voice or concern&#39;, likely by embedded agents.  I believe this type of subversion is part of what adam curtis calls <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/12/31/bbcs_adam_curtis_on_the_contradictory_vaudeville_of_post-modern_politics.html">&#39;non linear warfare&#39;</a> in an ongoing culture war whose purpose is to create competing controversies to confound and <em><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/confabulate">confabulate</a></em>, <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/black-sheep-lyrics-metric.html">shape shift and trick the past</a>, which itself leads to apathy and &#39;oh dear ism&#39;.  </p>

<p>The 9/11 truth movement is succumbing to this as well, as we speak.  This is why everyone needs to get behind the most damning and irrefutable evidence (thermite) and amplify it unflappably until social pressure forces a real dialogue.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, but I strongly disagree with this sentiment. </p>

<p>I&#39;m open-minded to thermite but I&#39;m open-minded to other possibilities as well.</p>

<p>Two things I know for sure.</p>

<ol>
<li>We don&#39;t know all the details.</li>
<li>We do know what we were told is a lie.</li>
</ol>

<h1>2 Is what we need to unite on. Positive claims demand burden of proof. Evidence that refutes their claims is what matters more than evidence that supports alternative theories.</h1>

<p>For example, WTC 7 defying the laws of physics. </p>

<p>THAT is the sort of thing that proves they are lying. The onus is not on you to prove that they used thermite until you assert that they did. Once you accept burden of proof, you&#39;ve really just regressed in the debate.</p>

<p>GIVE NO HEADWAY.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a very astute observation.</p>

<p>That is why they relentlessly play &quot;identity politics&quot; instead of talking about <em>ideas.</em> Humans, like basically every social animal, have a base instinct to value our tribe over others. If they can stoke this instinct, and link it to personal politics, then we will fight each other forever over meaningless bullshit.</p>

<p>Look at &quot;Democrats&quot; and &quot;Republicans.&quot; People say, &quot;I AM a Democrat,&quot; and not, &quot;I <em>vote</em> Democrat.&quot; The latter statement requires a &quot;because,&quot; where you then have to talk about ideas and policies. But the former doesn&#39;t; they&#39;re saying, &quot;I&#39;m a member of this tribe,&quot; with an implied, &quot;Fuck the other tribes.&quot;</p>

<p>In a nutshell: the elites are using tribalism as a tool to divide and conquer.</p>

<p>LOL - as you can see, exactly what I said.</p>

<p>The reality is the &quot;wealthy&quot; want all people &quot;united&quot; into one big consumer &quot;proletariat.&quot;</p>

<p>Racial consciousness, family clans, social organizations - those all get in the way of corporate rule.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s why the corporations promote &quot;anti-racism&quot; feminism, individualism, &quot;non-conformity&quot; (which is actually conformity) etc.</p>

<p>Feminism and gay marriage doesn&#39;t help the average person and they sure don&#39;t threaten the power of the state or the corporations.</p>

<p>Social Justice Warriors are an important part of the System. The fact that left-wingers think they are &quot;fighting the man&quot; - when in fact they are fighting to prop up the &quot;man&quot; - is what makes them <em>useful</em> idiots, as opposed to just idiots.</p>

They ALWAYS work to keep us divided... feminism vs men rights activists, blacks vs whites, americans vs illegal immigrants, gun rights activists vs gun control advocates, republican vs democrat, liberal vs conservative... NEVER would they advocate for citizens vs elites/government because we outnumber them by probably about 1,000,000 to 1.

<p>LOL - the Koch brothers have NOTHING to do with #BlackLivesMatter.</p>

<p>It&#39;s George Soros, the liberal, left wing Democrat, that is funding #BlackLivesMatter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. The elites encourage &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;center&quot; types of social movements on the left, because the left has been the only successful opposition to the will of the elites.</p>

<p>We live in a civilization that is ruled by the tyranny of the &quot;center&quot;. This is successful because capitalism is a tool of complicity as much as it is a tool of exploitation and tyranny.</p>

<p>To contemplate and to act on radical, leftist ideas is to first admit to the blood on your own hands living in the American empire. </p>

<p>The government is made up of people who believe in certain things (worldview) and they spend time and energy promoting that worldview as correct or even righteous. And they convince the vast majority that things as they are the best that they can be.</p>

<p>The elites aren&#39;t stupid, they do their best to ensure the people are. And most people in the West are ok with it because they don&#39;t want to actually acknowledge their responsibility for all the misery they cause in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s as if they have a <em>US Department of Social Retardation</em>  (ie: Ministry of Truth), wherein they--as value opponents--proactively create centrist movements in order to lead them, giving activist participants some propaganda activism-bait (call this activismbation), such that they can rabble about various issues.  This all serves, of course, to to waste participants&#39; time.  Each failed movement moves the timeline along, while egregiousness persists in secret, but otherwise resets the timer on people&#39;s willingness to participate, eventually causing--through observing the status quo maintaning end result of their activity--learned helplessness.</p>

<p>Btw there are no liberals any more.  I think the boundaries have dissolved and now people just have bags of competing values.  Am I still a liberal if I think everyone should carry a gun concealed but also believe in universal health care and higher minimum wage and that drugs should be all decriminalized?  That would make me a right wing gun nut drug libertarian socialist.  What part of that makes sense?</p>

<p>Liberals are not opposed to your gun rights. That is a canard used by the establishment to create this very same confusion we&#39;re talkign about.  Everyone supports background checks.  Liberals just don&#39;t have guns because they are smart enough to read statistics saying guns in the house end up killing owner, or johnny not burglars.  How the owner?  Because if a burgler enters your home, owner finds out posthumously it was the police.</p>

These movements as a whole call for the end of capitalism, state violence, etc. But the revolutionary ideas are often stomped out, with the powers to be co-opting tiny things like gay marriage. Gay marriage is straight and cis people trying to get queer folks to assimilate into thier nuclear family schema. So I see what you are saying but dont overlook how absolutely oppressive it is for women, and queer people, and people of color to boot.
