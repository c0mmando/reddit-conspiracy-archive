          Molybdenum spherule in the USGS data set
         </a>
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Two of the authors pursued a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) action with the USGS to obtain any additional SEM/XEDS data from them which had not been previously published. The new data demonstrated, significantly, that the USGS team had observed and studied a molybdenum-rich spherule which was not mentioned in the earlier reports. A micrograph image shows a bright pill-shaped spherule labeled “20MOSPH-1.TIF” (below). The brightness of the object suggests that backscattered electron imaging was used in acquiring the image (the report notes that this technique was used in the study), and that indeed a heavier metal such as Mo is present in the oblong spherule. (We see similar shapes; see SEM image below right and Fig. 1.)
       </p>
       <p>
        In the same data set obtained via FOIA action, an XEDS spectrum labeled “Molysph.TIF” and two nearly identical XEDS curves (with additional elemental identifications) labeled “Molly spectrum 25 kV” accompany what we deduce applies to the Mo spherule, given the designations. One of the spectra extends to approximately 19 keV (the electron beam energy was no doubt 25 kV), and shows a clear Mo line at 17.3 keV. This removes ambiguity regarding the peak at ~2.3 keV, which could otherwise be S or Pb or Bi (for example). The XEDS plots for this spherule labeled “Moly sph” show significant concentrations of aluminum, oxygen and calcium in addition to the dominant molybdenum peak and deserve further investigation. (For example, the Mo/Al peak height ratio is Mo:Al :: 5:1.)
       </p>
       <p>
        We discern that considerable study was performed on this Mo-rich spherule, given the number of images and XEDS plots for it, yet these data were not previously released in the public USGS reports.[2] We emphasize these data because of the extremely high melting temperature of molybdenum, and the observation of this molybdenum-rich spherule. Molybdenum is a refractory metal known for its extremely high melting point [9]. Mo melts at 2,623 °C (4,753 °F) [10], although addition of other elements may lower the melting point. No explanation of the high temperature needed to form the observed Mo-rich spherule is given in the USGS material (either published or obtained by FOIA action).

       I do believe the Twins had some molybdenum insulation, but forming any number of these droplets would require an exotic chemical reaction on a few pockets of fires. It mostly depends on how prevalent they are in the dust, it may be suspicious if you find tons of these droplets in dust samples from any vantage point from ground zero.

       I think the USGS only catalogued 1 or 2 random droplets. There are probably more in the dust waiting to be reported.

        So, the existence of the molybdenum spherule is evidence of a previously molten state, as with the iron and aluminosilicates also mentioned in the paper. At around 2,610 to 2,623 ºC (4,753 ºF), molybdenum has one of the highest melting points of all pure elements, although the addition of other elements would lower it. Molybdenum is used to improve the strength of steels at high temperatures, and was included in some of the pressure vessel steels A 302, A 533, A542, and A514-65. (See page 17 or "43 of 86" from NIST NCSTAR 1-3A, their report on structural steel specifications.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Molybdenum was also specified in some of the Japanese steel such as WEL-TEN 80, and is a possible extra in JIS G3114-73. Japanese steel was used to fabricate the perimeter columns and spandrels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yawata Iron and Steel Co. supplied most of the steel to PC&amp;F for the perimeter columns and spandrels. In general, the exterior (or web) and side (or flange) plates of each column and the spandrels were fabricated from Japanese steel, and the interior web plate was fabricated from domestic steel. Source (same link as previous, see page 22 or "48 of 86")
       </p>
       <p>
        In the WTC2 fire zone of floors 77-83, some 11.5% of the perimeter column steel was rated at 100 ksi yield strength. [See NIST Appendix E, June 04, Table E-4.] Yawata Iron and Steel Co. (now Nippon Steel) shipped 46,000 metric tons of WEL-TEN 60, 60R, 62, 70 and 80 to PC&amp;F (Pacific Car and Foundry). The WEL-TEN 80 is rated at 100 ksi, so the source of the molten molybdenum may well have been 100 ksi perimeter columns.
       </p>
       <p>
        An office compartment fire could not have melted any steel members, much less molybdenum.
       </p>
       <p>
        ...installed iron(III) oxide-based thermate in the hollow perimeter columns so as to simulate a top-down collapse induced by "impact and fire damage", the thermate's ability to generate temperatures of 2,500 ºC (4,532 ºF) would have been capable of melting some molybdenum alloyed with iron and other elements.

       Dr. Judy Wood's website is filled with nonsense. She looks at the collapse of a building, sees all of the dust and rubble produced and leaps to the conclusion that it must have been a directed energy weapon. It's basically the most ridiculous of all of the 9/11 conspiracy theories.
