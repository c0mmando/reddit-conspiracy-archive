<p>THIS.<br/>
My research over the past few years is tying the whole thing together.  My findings show that the Illuminati are, in fact, in the process of orchestrating a third phase to their diabolical plan in which they will pin blame for the attack on Al Gore.  In this way they can discredit his findings of Global Warming, which is in actuality a Illuminati/Free Mason/Rotary Club strategy aimed at population control and profiteering of the air conditioning industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wait and see for yourself.  Remember the rigged recount during Bush/Gore race for President?  Do you think that was just a coincidence?  What a more perfect patsy for the 9-11 attack than Al Gore?  I mean, it&#39;s now quite obvious to all true intellectuals that 9-11 was totally an inside job amiright?  Well, you think the guys who came up with that plan are stupid?  They knew it would all be discovered as a conspiracy before it was carried out.</p>

<p>Now, in the third phase, they can use that &quot;discovery&quot; by pinning it on one of their adversaries, Al Gore.  Thus, clearing the way for Global Warming and the ability to manipulate food and fuel prices.  </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a lot to take in.  But let me leave you with a couple questions to ask yourself:</p>

<p>1)  Who benefits from Global Warming?</p>

<p>2)  Who has a very public adversarial relationship with the NEOCONs?</p>

<p>3)  Why is Israel investing so heavily in desalination plants and air conditioning companies?</p>

<p>4)  Why was John Edwards set up by the news media and the timing was so perfect?</p>

<p>5)  Why did al jazeera buy Al Gore&#39;s Current TV network?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you see videos of the OKC explosion?  Does not seeing it happen mean that a missile hit the building or does it mean that they are covering up the fact that there were other people involved and possible secondary explosions as well?  Just because you don&#39;t get to watch the video of a plane hitting the Pentagon doesn&#39;t mean you get to make up what happened.  Literally hundreds of eye witnesses saw a plane flying at low altitude at the Pentagon.. If you think a plane didn&#39;t hit the Pentagon where did this plane go?  It just disappeared?  That is more likely than the idea that it actually did hit the Pentagon as was planned?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love if they released the video.  Here&#39;s how it would go though... If the video showed a plane hitting the Pentagon everyone who dogmatically believes that a missile hit the Pentagon would say &quot;that was a fake video&quot; and nothing would change.  Look at the Boston Bombing... Surveillance footage was released of Tsarnaev dropping off a book bag and the book bag blowing up and everyone who thinks it was a hoax with all crisis actors and nobody actually being hurt said &quot;ehh.. that was fake..&quot;</p>

<p>I have no idea. Maybe that wasn&#39;t the script? How do you even know? Let&#39;s figure out where the plane went first - shall we? Because the lawn is still intact above and not even covered up in the those pics.</p>

<p>Sounds like you have your own narrative set up anyway. So why bother discussing it?</p>

<p>Sure. We can question whether or not it was 19 Saudis with boxcutters. Right?</p>

<p>Can we question why the name <em>Osama Bin Laden</em> was mentioned less than an hour after the towers fell? Or how <em>two different planes were shown on live television hitting the WTC depending on what network you watced</em>? Or how there was barely any remains in Shanksville? </p>

<p>But we <em>must</em> maintain that abplane hit the Pentagon. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t just cherry pick the photos you look at to conform to your idea that there was no plane... actually think thru your idea... The biggest conspiracy about the 9-11 truth movement is all of these horse shit theories that are used to discredit people by making any questioning of the events of 9-11 seem ridiculous.  People asking smart questions get lumped into the people saying &quot;there were no planes!&quot; and immediately smart people get turned off to the whole thing.</p>

<p>Notice the pieces of plane debris... this was planted there after the missile hit?  Nobody saw the missile and nobody noticed people planting plane debris?</p>

<p>As soon as you shoe me the plane debris in the photos I linked above - I would argue that <em>you</em> are cherry picking pictures. How does debris <strong>appear out of nowhere</strong> when the initial pictures (linked above) don&#39;t show anything?</p>

<p>I&#39;m certainly willing to play this game with you. But we both need to <em>reset</em> things. We are both here for a reason. I know mine. I&#39;m sure you know yours. And I am fairly certain that they align in most things. And that&#39;s OK. All I ask is for you to <em>consider</em> the idea without rejecting it completely based on emotion. There is no way in the span of a few hours (this conversation) you read and watched what I have over the past few years to come to this conclusion. That is not to say I&#39;m tryin to establish a superiority complex or anything - I&#39;m just saying there&#39;s no way you have. And that&#39;s OK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can guarantee questions too and I&#39;d also almost guarantee that I&#39;ve seen everything you&#39;ve seen as far as conspiracy videos and articles about 9-11 go.  I can not bring myself to invent a theory that simply doesn&#39;t make sense based on the witnesses and the wreckage.  We believe that witnesses at ground zero in New York heard explosions and those witnesses shouldn&#39;t be ignored.. we both believe them on that.. Why not believe the witnesses in DC who saw a plane heading into the Pentagon?  If you are saying that it wasn&#39;t the passenger jet then it is pretty important to know where that jet and the people on it are.. It is also very important to know why they swapped this plane out.. </p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t a spontaneous event where 19 hijackers took over a few planes and crashed them into buildings and they had no outside help or funding... I agree with that 100%.  However I don&#39;t see any evidence or reasoning that would make sense to bring me into the space where I believe a plane got swapped for a missile or a drone.. Why would they do this and how did they do this and why do the witness reports conflict with this?  I need to know answers to those questions before I fall for this. </p>

My research over the past few years is tying the whole thing together.  My findings show that the Illuminati are, in fact, in the process of orchestrating a third phase to their diabolical plan in which they will pin blame for the attack on Al Gore.  In this way they can discredit his findings of Global Warming, which is in actuality a Illuminati/Free Mason/Rotary Club strategy aimed at population control and profiteering of the air conditioning industry.</p>
