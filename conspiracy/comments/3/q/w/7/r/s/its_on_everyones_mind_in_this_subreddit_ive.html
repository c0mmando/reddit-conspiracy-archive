       I agree for the most part, I might be a little more optimistic as I think the percentage of awake people is growing at an exponential rate maybe 20% ?  It seems about half know we are being deceived (ala 9/11, Sandy Hook) but half still think the government has our best interest at heart.

       I personally am part of the local activist community and go to plenty of rallies,  marches,  and protests. Obviously that won't solve the problem,  but it's a good way to build a network of people that see what's going on. I keep actual money (don't want to go too far into this online).  I speak to practically everyone about the stuff that is going on.

       I try not to be depressed or crazy. I ease my way into it. It's typically easy to start within their preconceived political views and expand outward. I almost always end up having conversations with people who are interested and begin asking questions.

       Good Question. Long answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) FEAR ~40%
      </p>
      <p>
       It's my opinion that this category makes up the largest group of people. After fifteen years of enslavement, deception, fraud, tyranny &amp; incompetence a good portion of Americans are awake or partially awake. Many admit (sometimes only secretly) that there are serious problems in America. Many of the first to awaken have been under constant preparation for war, survival, false flag or martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though a lot of people are becoming awakened, there aren't enough taking drastic measures to change things because of FEAR.
      </p>
      <p>
       FEAR OF WHAT?
      </p>
      <p>
       TALKING / PLANNING with others due to the belief that all communications are being surveilled and stored. Or fear of being labelled a conspiracy nut or ridiculed - ala the group think phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       JOB LOSS / SURVIVAL should they need to drive to D.C. for months of protest that would result in job loss and ultimately the ability to feed, clothe, and protect their family.
      </p>
      <p>
       TAKING ACTION whether it be protest, revolution, guerrila warfare, financial warfare, info war, sabotage, rebellion, living off the grid or going John Galt.
      </p>
      <p>
       GETTING KILLED, IMPRISONED or disappeared by a drone. Also with posse comitatus protection revoked under NDAA being imprisoned indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) NAIVE / CLUELESS ~30%
      </p>
      <p>
       A certain percentage of people are clueless and cannot accept the reality that their government is not what they thought it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some are incapable of believing that our government has lied to them, killed them, deceived them, stole from them and are generally evil people.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good portion of these people still clueless will probably always be clueless until they find themselves being led into an incinerator much like it was in Nazi Germany.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) INTERNET ADDICTED  ~25%
      </p>
      <p>
       This group might be bigger as I find myself self-justifying that I'm not in this group - but as time goes on I begin to realize that this is very possible - just as possible as our government comitting false flag attacks on their own citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       No revolution has occured due to internet activism and it's my opinion that internet activism, while helpful and worthwhile, will never be enough to force serious change to an already tyrannical government. If you don't believe me watch the movie on Netflix about Ukraine and you'll see an inspiring and brave citizenry numbering thousands possibly millions that was brutalized, beaten, shot &amp; disappeared over a period of over 90 days - and they thought they finally won but it appears they were duped again. Evil is evil - and evil only knows brutality and force.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) EVIL ~3%
These are the people running the government, or working for the evil NSA, CIA, Police, IRS, granted there are some class-act people in these agencies but generally speaking they are psychopathic - and this is a proven fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion:
      </p>
      <p>
       If my math is right there is still a couple percent remaining. That group of people is fully awake and have already begun taking real action against the tyrannical government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The types of action taken probably cover a wide spectrum but the goal is the same, to degrade the enemy in preparation for all-out-attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. CHOKE Enemy Financially 
This might consist of something as simple as John Galt'ers refusing to work (for a paycheck) therby severely cutting off the ability of enemy to support the cost of war. This is probably one of the more powerful things people are doing - and a lot of people are doing this as our percent of working age persons actually working has dropped to historic lows of around 60%.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. CONFUSE Enemy by Planning, Preparing &amp; Psy-Ops
There are plenty of persons who have joined or started militas, purchased weapons, took weapons training, stockpiled food/water, set up early warning perimeters with multi-level warning. Many of the people doing this have been in the military and they know what force-multipliers are and can use them, and train others, such as how to defend a home with booby traps, or leading the enemy down a narrow path like hallway or other obstackes creating a death channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing weapons, training, leaking false information, concealing information even when there is nothing to hide causes confusion and ultimately fear - which is good if it's your enemy that has it.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. BLIND &amp; DEAFEN Enemy
Some are likely taking a more subtle approach, and working to degrade the eyes and ears of the enemy. Such actions might include sneaking out at night in small groups of people that systematically blind a camera with lasers while kill-teams take out the camera with small caliber weapon, cross-bow, blow-gun, rail-gun, bb-guns, spray paint or sling-shot. Few are probably performing sabotage operations that hurt enemy infrastructure, operations or supply lines. And some teaching force multipliers - like night warfare with thermal imaging, sniper training, thermal imaging avoidance techniques and body armor.
      </p>
      <p>
       D. CONFUSE &amp; SURVEIL Enemy
Some are becoming spies, working deep undercover for government, corporate regimes, intelligence agencies, local police, or volunteering to assist with democrat campaigns. Many doing this have purchased ham-radio's, scanners and other communication methods to gather info.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHEN did it get so bad? My guess is never - it probably happened so slowly that there is no clear delineation between good and bad much like boiling frogs to death analogy. But if forced to pick a timeframe my guess would be in the early 1900's when the Federal Reserve came into the picture. Or in the late 60's early 70's when the dollar was taken off the gold standard allowing unlimited printing of fiat currency. 9/11 was certainly a huge event - a modern day Pearl Harbor and one could argue that it was this event that seriously altered history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the negative domino effect 9/11 has had on history - it should be IMPERATIVE for Americans to DEMAND the truth about 9/11 including declassification of the 28 pages of intelligence relating to Saudi Arabian and Israeli involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF Americans DEMANDED the truth and prosecution of the real 9/11 perps and war-criminals of the many US wars it would have an enormous and domino-like positive effect on the future. In my mind demanding this is the single most powerful thing Americans can do right now because we must be near the tipping point as far as public support for the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: I mentioned the spy state, and surveillance and wanted to say something. I worked for government (via Dyncorp) as I am a computer programmer. i worked on military transport software - and the software was some of the worst software I have witnessed in my career. It is a wonder we can move equipment at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with that in mind think about the Snowden revelations. I am on the fence about whether Snowden is real OR a CIA operative. Why would Snowden be a CIA operative? Well, put yourself in the government's position - what would you do if you felt threatened by the citizenry? You'd likely want to put some fear into them and the Snowden revelations did just that, and no real legislation came about protecting our privacy. If you are in the camp believing that the government likely cannot spy as efficiently and effectively as they'd like us to believe, than you probably know the question i'm gong to ask.

       If you can't really spy on the citizenry very well due to a poorly designed spy machine than what is the next best thing? The answer is to make them THINK that no matter where they hide that you can hear them. Psy-Ops 101.

       I get it. Can you be a little bit more creative than this though? I get that this is our meme. Cool. But it's so underwhelmingly tired and easy. Can you be a little bit more creative? Can you play their game? Can you think of a way to make this so clearly commonly held model of the world a media message? Maybe a joke within a viral humor clip that frames it in a positive light? Trey Parker and Matt Stone and Stephen Colbert do it all the time. What can you do to actually do what you can to wrest back control over your future? I have assessed the prospects and I can see the public sentiment leaning in such a way that just about anything that co-opts an already popular medium of expression and embeds it with a morsel of this new future vision in which assholes don't rule us -- it will gain a following and bring you more success than whatever narrowly carved role you're probably devoting your waking time to now. What can you do?

       Maybe I'm being a dick. Maybe also someone will bite, engage with me, and maybe 10 people will read it then go out and murmur to their friends when drunk that huh, maybe the writing of history is right at our fingertips with our unfettered access to the most interconnected communication network that has ever existed in human history.

       This does raise a crucial point though - SATIRE is hugely powerful. I propose that it is so powerful because it digs below our conditioning. True humor can truly raise dialogue about issues one couldn't otherwise broach in non-crass company.
