       Have you ever noticed how you're allowed to have opinions about anything, as long as it's not something important? You can argue about which Lord of the Rings movie is the best, or what sports team should win and why, and everyone plays along and has fun.  But the second you start to talk about anything of actual real importance, people suddenly clam up and shy away. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we've been conditioned that we need to have a certain emotional tone at all times when conversing with other humans. Notice how it is
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       okay in our society for you to be openly angry about something? Even if you are 100% correct and
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be angry? Calmness is seen as paired with rationality, which ignores that passion can be rational sometimes. In our society, passion is discouraged unless you are profiting someone else. So you are allowed to have passion for your consumerism and for your job. But never for how bad the Fed is, or how we should end all these illegal wars the US keeps starting for profit. You mention those, and 95% of people will instantly be looking to change the subject out of discomfort. If you are overly passionate about these things, it pushes people away very fast. So the only good approach is to be "light" about it, and just mention it in passing or as part of a joke and then move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You must always pretend to be calm, even if you are not and have no reason to be, or else you are seen as a "looney" who is "off his rocker" and "needs to calm down" and "could be a threat" so on and so forth. People love to think they're better and more logical than someone who is being emotional, especially if American government/corporate propaganda backs them up on their talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       So to maintain this required facade of non-anger, people avoid reading and conversing about topics that make them angry, so they better fit in to society. Work gives them enough stress. They want to have friends and succeed in this human world and so on, so they play by society's rules. So they slowly close their mind off to anything controversial to their in-group. They deaden themselves to the ugly realities of the world, day after day. They see everyone around them doing it too, they see the consequences play out for people who got angry for a bit and said something they "shouldn't have". They decide it's the right choice, that being dead inside is what you're "supposed to do" and don't even consider alternatives, especially because those alternatives are very uncomfortable. Once you get to about 30 or 40, you're basically locked in to this mindset forever unless a big life event happens to change your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why so many Americans are just quiet about all the terrible terrible shit that is happening. They are just keeping their heads down, trying to succeed. Not only financially, but socially too, which demands this calmness, which demands generally avoiding angry topics and not thinking too deeply about them (or else you might get worked up, someone might see/hear you, and that might hurt your social standing or your income).
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of it all, the genuinely important topics are so over-laden with emotion by the media to make conversing about them very difficult. For example, the Zionist ownership of the US government is pretty important. But even the word "zionist" is so emotionally charged, people guffaw at the mere mention of the word even though they don't know what it means. These conspiracy forums are filled with hyperbolic garbage like flat earth and cern wormhole portals which they pay to upvote to the top, to discredit the sub and make everyone here look insane. That way people are afraid to come back here after seeing how it looks, and their minds remain closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The discourse about truly important topics is so polarized (intentionally or not) that it's nearly impossible to talk to your fellow human beings about it in a regular conversation. It only comes out at 3am after a lot of drinks, because we are all terrified of looking bad in each other's eyes, even though we mostly agree with each other! We're scared that everyone is like the media tells us they are, dangerous and judgmental, so we each silently bear this burden of truth in our own minds. Few have the courage to overcome this fear and speak out in real life (or even online) and even fewer can do it in a way that conforms to the social norms of "calmness". George Carlin did it with
       <em>
        humor
       </em>
       , and that's why he is worshiped. The emotional packaging of ideas means a lot in our society, maybe more than the ideas themselves. Having our priories so backwards, placing our emotions first and the truth of reality second, is what is leading to the downfall of our nation. People are literally out of touch with reality, and no one ever "touches" them to bring them back in because generally speaking we're all so scared and offended of each other that we can't connect in a real emotional way anymore. We're each in our own bubbles of denial. So we create our own little echo chambers and cross our fingers that things will work out, which was basically the American mantra starting in the 1970s once our political process started being taken over by corporations. That "eyes wide shut" mentality worked for a few decades, but time is running out for being in denial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer, expressed at its fullest. Emotions are much easier to manipulate than ideas and thoughts. Companies figured this out in the 50s and 60s and advertisements became about manipulating emotions instead of giving you facts about the product. We as Americans need to increase our IQ, but more importantly we need to increase our EQ and stop falling for the constant emotional manipulation coming from the media. And not only do we need to do it, we need to help others do it. It's time we awaken to our control structures, as a society, and be openly conversational about what is happening instead of hiding in the shadows because we're afraid. Only by learning how the control structures work can we learn to overcome them. And only by overcoming the programmed fear can we begin conversations about these things. This attitude needs to become part of our culture before we can really fix anything else. It's the foundation upon which everything else rests. I can't imagine anything more important than this.
      </p>
      <p>
       My worry is that everyone has their head so far in the sand that the only thing that will change the path we're on is a catastrophe that suddenly brings reality in to the limelight. If people
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       tried spreading the word as much as possible we might be able to wake up before the next catastrophe, but seeing as reality got hung to cheers at the end of the last South Park episode and how accurate that feels, I don't know how much hope I really have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, just being honest with one person about one thing can start a wildfire effect that could end up waking up tons of people. Why not try? You scared?

       People are drowning in propaganda and don't even notice. How would you notice, after all? Does a fish notice it's swimming in water? Probably not, since it never experiences anything else it has nothing to compare it to.

       Marijuana mimics Anandamide in the brain. Anandamide is a chemical that is released, which CAUSES dopamine to be released. An example of this cascade is right after orgasm - that happy feeling is anandamide-mediated natural dopamine release.
      </p>
      <p>
       THC mimics anandamide, and causes dopamine release in the same way. It causes "positive" effects, on demand, with nearly zero immediate negative repurcussions, and minimal ongoing negative repurcussions. This makes it ideal for controlling negative emotions. Anandamide (and THC) are literally emotional painkillers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having this power in the hands of the people diminishes the power of those who would seek to actively deny you your natural dopamine rushes while at the same time being able to grant you a "forced" dopamine rush (only available from them - at a cost).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why it has been so restricted despite being a mostly harmless naturally occuring substance - it diminishes the ability of the elite to control the populace by cornering the market on their emotional pain.

       Public demand. It's a lie that most people are begining to see through, especially in the west. In other places people still shudder at the sound of weed. I'm from India, even though it used to be part of our culture, programming by the government after 1966 has clubbed ganja with "drugs" and is highly frowned upon. Alcohol though, they sell it to even kids.

       Also - Please realize that the only reason India did this (especially given the time frame) is due to an international treaty negotiated (by the USA) shortly after Nixon initiated the "War on Drugs" in the USA.

       Japan is a great example, they sold mushrooms in vending machines up until 2006 even. But the US pressure is relentless. Combined with the lessons learned from the opium wars, I can understand why Asian countries have such strong and broad drug bans. Still is not the best way to address the problem though, as decriminalization of all drugs in portugal 15 years ago dropped addiction rates in half. Turns out people are much less afraid to seek help for their addictions if they're not afraid of getting arrested. Imagine that.

       We know this, it's shown by data, yet the US and other countries continue on the way they do. It is because the current arrangement is working for those in power, is the only reasonable answer.

       100% agree. That's also explains why beginners report to feel paranoia or anxiety. Once you get comfortable with your "high" mind, you start thinking differently, not just according to the patterns that we have been programmed.

       We need to take a massive stand against the corruption and lies that are rampant in politics. It shouldnt be about finding a politician who can work within a corrupt system, but one who can work from the outside to fix it. We need immediate reforms in the media,

       . We need to eliminate the concentration of power, which as become so skewed that the entire culture of the USA had been warped. We need to spread education, provide universal healthcare, social security, human rights awareness. We need to close the income inequality gap. We need people to believe this system can work for all of us, and not just the few elitists. We need to lead in the advancement of climate technologies, and stop giving tax breaks to those who would poison this earth. We need a push for accountability, and for those reslonsible to face the consequences. We need to be less worried about being PC, and more worried about the fact that the richest country in the world still has children starving on its streets.

       Crucify me- i believe that Bernie Sanders is the one chance we have to turn this around, before weve gone past the point of no return. Hes saying it exactly how it is, calling out the people who have let it get this far (them, and us) and trying to unite us in a common purpose. He is transparent and credible. Hes been on our side since the beginning, which is evident in his track record. He is what became of the occupy movement- it isnt going away, the people just needed better representation. The direction hes trying to lead us in is the inevitable direction that we will have to take, and if he doesnt succeed, the next to try will encourage anarchy, reasoning that we continue to fuck up and that we no longer depend on our democracy to be democratic. Maybe im crazy, maybe everyone feels this way during election season, but I dont, usually... and this time, I do. Obama was the lesser of two evils, as its been over the past few elections. Bernie isnt the average politician, hes the exception- he has true vision, and i want to see America great again.
      </p>
      <p>
       We arent alone. Many feel this way, but as OP said, keep their mouths shut to not offend, or upset the agreed upon blindness. One at a time, were actively fighting to change, and we truly can. We just need more discussion- more people on our side, more awareness.

       You need to place blame where it is due. I truly believe that Obama would have done significantly more had he not been completely obstructed by congress at every pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       A congress that only exists in its current biased state due to gerrymandering. Fix that and we should be on our way to a nordic-style government - one that actually
       <em>
        SERVES
       </em>
       its people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I'm not saying he would have done everything right. Lots of broken "privacy issue" promises with Obama, amongst a few other things. I am somewhat disappointed by his Presidency. But the things I'm dissappointed about are mostly the things he
       <em>
        DID
       </em>
       rather than what he
       <em>
        DIDN'T DO
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie is the closest thing to an honest politician that we have seen in our lifetime. Elizabeth Warren would be a close second - though she's obviously not running for President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary is for sale to the military-industrial complex, though would likely use some of that political capital to make some things better for the little guy. The entire republican field is on-their-knees-under-the-desk of the military industrial complex, and would likely make as many efforts as possible to deploy as many expensive weapons as possible to maximize profits for their "meat popsicles".

       Yeah, voting for president is kind of rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, at this point. It's probably still worth voting to try and prevent Bush or Clinton from winning, but a new president isn't going to save us. Far from it. The system is rigged way beyond what one person can fix, even the president. That said, it is good to at least

       I think what it'll take is when people no longer have the things they had achieved through being apart of the system, like housing and air conditioning, gas in their cars, food in their fridge, etc.

      <p>
       People will realize what's going on when the rug is swept from under their feet, they'll contemplate as they stand up once again, finally understanding what has been going on all around them with their once blind and dumb senses.

       Great post.

      <blockquote>

        Notice how it is never okay in our society for you to be openly angry about something?

       I believe Government and media are using manufactured events to slowly inculcate "passivity" and "acceptance" in the populace. If you consider recent government hoaxes like Sandy Hook and the Charleston shooting, the "surviving relatives" were all on television within a day. The Sandy Hook parents were laughing and joking, not a care in the world. The completely unemotional adult children of a Charleston shooting victim had "forgiven" the shooter within a day. When the police caught the "perp", they took him to Macdonalds for lunch. This makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all these fake events, the relatives are extremely calm and passive. They express no shock, or disbelief, or confusion, or anger, or sadness or any desire for answers as to what happened, or desire for retribution. In other words, no normal human reactions which you might expect to see in the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is possible that TPTB are trying to condition the populace to deal with "very bad things" in our not-so-distant future, with a message: "See, this is how you behave when your loved-ones are suddenly and inexplicably killed. Do not ask questions. Do not fight back. Forgive and move on."

       Have you you also noticed how feminized men are becoming? Take a look at the average male college student these days...they care more about emotion and being sensitive than they do about stuff that actually matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government and academia have neutered younger males...the exact group that would be expected to stand up to them in the next 10 years when they become even more tyrannical.

       Surely estrogenic chemicals - which mimic estrogen in the body and cause a nearly permanent endocrine imbalance - and are in goddamn near EVERYTHING in modern society - have a much larger effect than the government or academia on the development of young males.

       That has a major role in it too. 
It doesn't help that young men are being taught to be ashamed of their gender simply because off the things men have done in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is sort of related but a few days ago, my manager at work, an African American, was telling me in a not so serious way that, since I'm from Kentucky I owe him and his people money and land because of slavery. 
He was quite surprised to know that Kentucky was sided with the union during those days.

       More on point, I think they want to destroy masculinity as much as possible because of aggression towards the state of society and thus our cultural abyss.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are less likely to have any dissonance if they aren't aggressive and are passive.

       OP hit on something big.  It's a status quo preserving, culturally sedative affectation that we've bought into.  It's a form of mind control, the psychopathy/empathylessness of the social-cultural abandonment of our emotions to the new religion of scientism.

       Emotional suppression is a scientific system of control designed to pacify people into conformity to make them more accepting of exploitation, oppression and brutality.

       And no where is this phenomena more evidenced than in the fact that the US is the most overworked, underpaid, incarcerated, psychiatrically unhealthy and medicated population in the developed world.

       I'd also would like to add the disconnection from our true roots. we view ourselves as above and beyond what this planet has to offer and we have no respect for the natural world, or keeping this planet clean and healthy, that includes everything living on it. our mentality is to exploit everything we possible can for self profit. not every society was like this. animals are dying off in record rates and no one gives a shit about that as well, that reality also scares the shit out of people.

       Beautiful analysis on our collective emotional state as a society, and how we have been unwittingly manipulated towards seeking the middle as to not fall off 'the edge'. It's a perversion of morality, and I just can't overstate what a wonderful job you've done summing up many of the concerns I have. Clearly we all value truth, and we all despise bullshit ; George Carlin is idolized for his ability to use language to cut through bullshit like a hot knife through butter. However, we are not all blessed with Carlin's talents to use the perverse hijacked state of language against itself. Knowing we can't communicate effectively, we resort to anger and outrage. I find myself upset that people cannot see these truths that are written so simply before us, and because of impatience, and a poor communications ability, instead of being able to convey my beliefs in a rational manner, I become enraged. It is a practice in futility to engage in the absurd. It's hard not to become disillusioned by the absurd, but if we can somehow use George Carlin as a mentor, we can see that by some sort of literary ju jitsu, he uses the state of things as a mirror to illuminate the truth, and for that I will always honor that man. I am lucky I got to see him once before he passed.

       This is mostly driven by Religion, which is fundamentally a belief in a fantasy world - a fantasy world that has the net effect of imparting positive emotions to or alleviating negative emotions of the believer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists just proved recently that the "chills" you get when being emotionally moved (by fantastic music, or "the spirit", for example) is actually a rush of dopamine in the pleasure centers of the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mammalian brain (necessarily) craves dopamine rushes. This is literally the only fundamental way we are able experience pleasure (of every kind - good food, good music, good company, etc..). And we only crave more intensely when things are bad (economy, death of a loved one, etc..). Since we necessarily crave this "rush", it makes it an incredibly powerful means of controlling humans. And if the controller is able to cause/create/invent economic or other distress in the controlled (which has the effect of reducing "natural" dopamine rushes), the magnitude of the control is increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which just reinforces the fact that we are all dope fiends. Religious folks are no better than heroin addicts in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who we should be concerned with is the individuals who are propagating and disseminating reproducible methods of causing these dopamine rushes on demand, while at the same time preventing/reducing natural dopamine rushes. They are the ones in control.

       Science is also a religion. You have to believe in "scientific establishment". Very few experiments are reproducible on your own or with little funding.

       I'd honestly much rather global nuclear war to take place than for society to move in the direction of 1984 or Brave New World. That kind of society scares the shit out of me. A post-apocalyptic nuclear wasteland would be terrible, don't get me wrong, but at least it would be every man for himself and there wouldn't be a corrupt government with a sinister agenda ruling over us while the people around you are sedated with religion, entertainment, and other distractions. At least in that world, there would be no secrets, lies, or deceit, it would just be survival and reestablishment. But of course the best case scenario would be revolution and awakening. I just can't really see that realistically happening unless the government does something blatantly obvious that people perceive as a need for instant change.

       Well - since
       <em>
        A KID
       </em>
       produced/replicated Nuclear Fusion in his garage (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Wilson">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Wilson
       </a>
       ), coupled with the fact that I understand the physics behind both Fission and Fusion, and the fact that Nuclear Weapons have actually been detonated many times (with a preponderance of documented evidence), I'm going to assume that they do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Exaggerated? Maybe. 
Non-Existent? No fucking way. That's a bridge too far.

       This is why I've given up on Facebook. Put all comments about how I shouldn't have been there to begin with. I was on there for personal reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've given up being on there. I've realized that friends who post pictures, emotions, or any other type post is looking for self verification. I realize that. It's asking people to think their photo is amazing of the dinner they're about to eat. Maybe they're angry that some twist to some tv show they watch angered them. It's all self satisfaction that they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that, the media/blog sites I followed would post stuff to just get people wound up about the dumbest stuff. Two women arrested in Hawaii this week because they were displaying too much PDA and the cop didn't like it. Ok, thanks  I agree that's wrong, but the types of comments people put with the article are all angry or supportive. It's just constant fighting over opinions. It never leads to any resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I've given up Facebook and just stick to alternative ways of getting self satisfaction without having to advertise to the world. I'm also using other ways of getting my news. It's been bugging me for a while but it's true. Our society is always asking us to engage each other over opinions and it just makes us more angry and feel crappy.

       Me too -- I have an account but my net sum of time spent on facebook  is probably on a couple of hours in my whole life. I've accepted friend invitations and had a few conversations, but I have a huge fear of it. I like being unable to be reached. It's something I value very much in my life -- I'm sure some of you would refer to me as a shut in. I don't know what I call it, but I have no desire to use facebook. All of the other moral transgressions of personal privacy on Facebook's behalf is just icing on the cake for me, I'm just not a social person really. For some reason I like reddit though. Maybe it's because it's anonymous.

       Here's what it all boils down to, people do not have their own opinions. On any issue that matters, the media manufactures an opinion and divides the issue into black or white, you're either on the black team or the white team. When confronted about their manufactured opinion, they don't even really know why they have it so they react violently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number one goal of 90% of people is fitting in. Not being ostracized. The nail that sticks out gets hammered. So you have billions of people trying to go with the flow, and doing whatever they can to be accepted. The quickest way to get accepted is to join the majority, and parrot it's talking points.

       Emotion and anger is only acceptable for sports really. It's depressing seeing 20,000 or 80,000 people going absolutely bonkers about an event that means literally nothing - while their country is being destroyed around them.

       Bread and circuses. That's all it is, keep the people pacified till they're completely looted, and the country has burned to the ground.

       The part about being calm all of the time ties into what I've been thinking about proper flow and feedback in our interaction with the world. Flow is what I call when interaction (for example human interaction) is optimal, where it becomes a dance, the ideal give and take. Feedback is what must occur to achieve this flow where all parties involved in the interaction give feedback regarding their part in it. This occurs subtly and directly through body language, tone of voice, word choice and direct speech. Being agreeable at all times throws a monkey wrench into the situation because proper feedback is disrupted (because you're scared to show displeasure) thereby destroying the interaction, the flow.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what happens when we come home after a busy day to complain about all the shitty people we encountered, these shitty people that we likely smiled through our teeth at while hiding our irritation. This causes bottled-up emotions which leads to feeling like the world is against you, feeling like everyone can walk all over you and you are powerless to stop them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realized that to be truly calm and in control, we have to get angry when it calls for being angry. Simply ignoring the unsavory dynamics of life won't make them go away in mind and memory because I still remember those times I stayed quiet when I was being mistreated or misrepresented. I will often fantasize about reacting differently and this just depresses me more because I can't live in the present. But those times when I reacted properly, I got angry and I showed my displeasure to the world, they don't bother me and in fact I feel they are achievements in my ability to control the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we definitely have to interact properly with the world and that doesn't mean always being happily stoic, because that is simply the pragmatic safe route for those who are overcome by fear. Like in the movie Network, say "I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!"

       True. I'm Indian. It does apply here to an extent. We are definitely more political though. But find it very difficult to organise overselves into anything meaningful.

       I've learned that if you use satire and humor when discussing these things, people won't realize at first the implications of what you're suggesting. 
Here's an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Israel is the greatest country on earth, they've never violated any human rights since Great Britain gave them the Palestinian's land in 1948."
      </p>
      <p>
       Reading that for face value, it's obviously a lie, but if you use a what I said above it goes right over the conditioning. 
We've been taught to have cognitive dissonance in the context of truth, but if you speak truth in a sarcastic way like that, it will usually work.
      </p>

       Great post by the way.

       and the propagandists are very successful at implanting psychological links between real peoples losses and the fake losses say at Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       so it becomes verboten to question fake victims on TV news. it suggests that real peoples real dead relatives are fake too...

       Yeah man you're totally right, it's only Americans who do this. The hundreds of millions of devout Muslims in their nations who blindly follow their emotions and cut peoples heads off? They prioritize reality over emotions. The millions of Ukranians who want to be part of Russia and cause thousands of deaths and destabilize their country? They totally put reality before emotions. The millions of Germans who willingly allow dangerous refugees into their country at their own cost? They put reality before emotions am I right? What about the Chinese who want total war and genocide of the Japanese people? They definitely put reality before emotions.

       I'm really glad you've been able to identify this problem which is specific to Americans.

       No, they're closest to the propaganda that you see and feel the American programming the strongest. It happens everywhere you just don't see it because you're only able to see what our governments / media show.

       I understand. I don't blame Americans .... i think any unwitting person would fall prey to the propaganda... you know in the end, most people just want to "live their lives" and see everything in relation to the other person, have weak wills and fail to grasp the big picture and lack the imagination to want and demand better.

       Yes 99 percent of people are in denial of the reality around them.  It's easier this way for them. It's too painful to face the truth.
       <br/>
       As for me I had enough.  I no longer have any friends. I rarely interact with people unless out of necessity.
       <br/>
       I got tired of staring into the empty eyes. Tired of all the fake bullshit. The phony facades of personality.
Try to bring up meaningful importsnt issues and people block you off. Persist and try to wake them up and they think your crazy. Your own family thinks your crazy. It's a lonely path.
