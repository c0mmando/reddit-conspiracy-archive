    <div class="md"><p>I think &#39;refusing to look at the overwhelming evidence&#39; is a rather uncharitable view of skeptics, in the same vein that tin-foil nutter is of you...</p>

<p>Regarding evidence, though, it must be said that it&#39;s all too common for conspiracy theorists to summarize their claimed evidence in hour-long youtube videos full of stock footage and dramatic music, which makes it very hard to take seriously &amp; to analyze. If that were changed to more manageable formats, I imagine you would get considerably more straightforward replies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Youtube is hardly the only platform available, nor is video the only means by which one can convey information. Yeah, there&#39;s plenty of entertainment videos on there, including from skeptics - but when you need concrete scientific material, you hit the books, or detailed and cited websites and magazines.</p>

<p>If the conspiracy videos actually linked to websites which had their claims and citations in writing (and links) that would be a huge step up. Most of the more organized conspiracy theorists would presumably have the script already, so it wouldn&#39;t be a big deal to grab some free service and host it there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take a stab at this. I imagine you would classify me as a hardcore skeptic, as I do not believe most theories proposed here.</p>

<p>Hanlon&#39;s razor is an adage I often keep in mind when dealing with conspiracy theories, or even most news stories. It goes something like &#39;Do not attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.&#39; I think a lot of conspiracy theories fall victim to this, transforming into an anti-authoritarian tract that fuels more extensive, and overly complicated, &#39;true evil&#39; narratives. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear from the start - I don&#39;t believe governments are infallible - far from it. I think they fuck up quite often, but I believe that&#39;s because they&#39;re made of people, who often abuse the letter of the law at the expense of the spirit because they are human beings, who can be assholes. However, I don&#39;t believe that governments go around being arbitrarily evil because of vague groups of weird spiritual people at the top, or because of the ever-maligned Jews, or because of space aliens. I think that the system itself, as it is composed of many normal people, does a fine job of explaining the eccentricities. People are flawed - that doesn&#39;t go away if you add a lot of them together.</p>

<p>9/11 is probably the most notable conspiracy theory around here, and has been for a while - my view on that, leaving aside what others might think, is that the government fucked up and didn&#39;t take their intel seriously enough, allowing the attack to happen under their watch - a disgrace. Then, in an attempt to save face, officials used that as a excuse upon which to hang their plans to invade Iraq. I think adding propositions like faking the attack itself with thermite or energy weapons gives the government entirely too much credit, especially considering the less than stellar middle-eastern results. That&#39;s where it&#39;ll stay, until I see convincing data which contradicts such a rather barebones explanation which relies more on common human failings like incompetence or sloth rather than widespread murderous malice &amp; deceit. </p>

<p>Of course, I have my criticisms of surveillance culture, and I can probably reach some semblance of a consensus on that with you (although I think malicious intent has less to do with it than some of you might) but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;re talking about in the OP. If you wish to hear my view on certain specific theories, I can certainly oblige. Hope that helps you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oof, it&#39;s a few hours long Youtube video. I think I just made a prophecy by posting about those in another response to you just a minute or two ago! I hope you won&#39;t mind if I save the link and try to get to it later - it&#39;s a bit of a big one, and it&#39;s only <em>Part 1!</em></p>

<p>Re: why I&#39;m here: I mostly respond to space-related conspiracies, as they&#39;re a bit of a pet interest of mine, and I pitch in on GMOs occasionally because I&#39;ve done a bit of work with those. I don&#39;t really contribute much, but I am interested in conspiracy culture (or however you&#39;d describe it) and am working on a novel which has as its premise that a variety of space related conspiracy theories are completely true - most of them drawn from the Ancient Aliens crowd.</p>

<p>One of the main characters is a conspiracy theorist, so you could call it research! Although tbh it&#39;s more accurate to say that&#39;s the case because I hang around here rather than the other way around. Chicken or Egg? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow... you think that crap on Youtube is legit debunking? That is why we are in the situation we are in.. all you have to do is make some claim with nothing backing it up and people assume it&#39;s legit as long as it takes a skeptic stance... THAT is the definition of a skeptard...</p>

<p>So if you claim that video debunks Dr. Judy Wood&#39;s Evidence then please summarize it here for me... </p>

<p>Here is a page showing Wood&#39;s account of that incident..</p>
