Education makes you think one way only, the way governments want you to think. We are all stupid for not fighting it, we all live in fake world. Illuminati rule the world and devil is the head of illuminati. God exists and does not give a shit about most of us. He only loves some people. That is why there are 3 gods actually. The One God who cares only about the chosen ones. Jesus who is pure good from the One God, and Satan who is pure evil from the One God. Jesus offers us heaven not God, Satan gives us hell. We aren&#39;t given the time to think ourselves and media brainwashes us. They all work for the devil. I know people will think I&#39;m crazy but the truth here hurts. We all don&#39;t want to believe that so we live our cursed lives in lies. Down with the Satan and the governments, the banks and the media. Also all people who are in the army or police,   i&#39;m sorry but you are retarded. You are being used against the good and innocent men. Its all good until the evil comes for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly what i think, but differently interpreted. From my aspect God is a perfect energy/force, a being that possesses every part of us and this world. Unfortunately being perfect is being balanced in evil and good and understanding it. Evil couldn&#39;t made itself, God made it as he made us. At the begging of Bible when Adam and Eve eat the apple, apple is a symbol of reason. The part that makes us human and different from other beings. Also reason means to able to know what is good and what is evil. That is why the apple cursed us, it actually opened our eyes and we realized that God made us lesser than himself, we will never be perfect as he is. Then he didn&#39;t want us to search for perfection so he made us feel ashamed of our bodies. At the begging Adam and Eve were naked and were normal with it but when they ate the apple they realized that something is wrong. That is why i think God loves his chosen ones. Some people are good looking and perfect, whole other are envy of them and live their whole life in the shadow of their perfection. Also some people are born sick or with a disorder and i don&#39;t believe that anyone completely good would allow that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suggest you to ask around some more about the things you claimed. It seems like you made bits and pieces up and mixed those bits up with how the holy books tell you how things happened. You are making things up to justify them for yourself to feel content instead of asking around and doing research to why things are the way they are.<br/>
I have some of these questions too about like why it seems like God isn&#39;t helping us much at all and why he is allowing a lot of the evil things in the world to happen. But to try and give an explanation for that with a made up &#39;there are 3 gods&#39; is so wrong that it&#39;s comparable to fanfiction. You&#39;re making up fantasy in your head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s wrong with being born with a disorder? If you look at nature, you will find so many &quot;bad&quot; things happen. Our human mind has a very limited understanding of good and bad. Death, deformity just because it induces painful feeling in us, doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;bad&quot;. It is just natural.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s easy to speak of disorder as a lesser issue when you don&#39;t have one. Inequality among us human beings is the biggest evil that exists in this world, that means both Mental and Physical health also Physical beauty/ugliness and so many other inequalities that really matter. Society is made of people so when someone says that society is excluding &quot;weird&quot;, &quot;anxious&quot; and ugly people that actually means every person judges people by their flaws. Unfortunately some have these flaws, it&#39;s their lives that suck the most. I am an example of society product. My parents and my brother used to beat me when i was young and now i have some physical disorders like bent/crooked nose and scarred forehead. Also i some other breathing difficulties and heart disease. And it&#39;s not my fault. And i can&#39;t even imagine whats it like for those people who had this problems since their birth or those kids who had some horrible diseases like cancer or birth defects.</p>

These people know nothing but what they learned and were taught.  You would be exactly the same as them if the Internet has not been developed and become such a huge tool for sharing truth and ideas.</p>

<p>You will be closer to the truth when you realise religion is the biggest and most successful scam in history.  The illuminati use satanic shit to scare off the God lovers, but they know the truth. It&#39;s all about mass conditioning and 1 person being in charge. Be it Pope, rabbi, cleric, president or captain.  Few in control of many</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are referring to theistic modern religions ( new testament ).</p>

<p>There have been thousands before. Many helped people in rough times. It&#39;s not a matter of truth or lie, it&#39;s a matter of usefulness.</p>

<p>Today we have the culture, time and safety to judge this matter coldly and give it a bad look, but it used to be fundamental for the well-being of society, lie or not.</p>

<p>to dismiss religion as a whole as a &quot;scam&quot; is ignoring history and reality. Just understand that it was born for a specific utility ( social cohesion first, and later management and control ) and not to &quot;tell the truth&quot;. </p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s outdated ( in its theistic version atleast, buddhism-sort of will never be because they speak volumes of fundamental truths, altough veiled ) but to dismiss it as a &quot;scam&quot; is like saying &quot;hey look those ancient scammers, they thought the earth was flat! bad people!&quot; </p>

<p>What i can easily concede is that all the christian propaganda and rethoric for the last 2k years has been quite retarded, sadly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they had a decision to make and i believe that stupidity is a decision, they chose that path. I don&#39;t want to insult anyone, but using force against somebody you don&#39;t know, and following orders that can&#39;t be questioned is a pretty unmoral and primitive thing to do. That is what the police and army do. Also religion has truth in its root, but a long time has passed and the story of Jesus and other prophets have been rewritten and retold in the meantime. I still believe in my theory, i can&#39;t prove this to anyone neither can anyone prove else to me. I have been researching this a long time and this is currently the most logical explanation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>God is the ancient totem, the keeper of the tribe.</p>

<p>There is no god outside the tribe.</p>

<p>AKA, the tribe is its ( secret ) own god. But we lost the tribal ( communal ) spirit a long time ago so we are left with impending destructive forces. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t take nothing religions say literally or you will end up as retarded as your everyday police officer. Dig through and discover the real meanings and they will serve you good.</p>

<p>Until the communal power is restored and our self-interest goes again beyond ourselves, things will only get worse. Individualism will sooner or later explode because it is not a sustainable option on this scale. Then a lot of people will die and those who survive will understand the value of communality. </p>

<p>I say this with conviction because degeneracy always ends bad, no matter how much time it requires. The only other route is a mass-U turn, but the more we go on, the more it&#39;s unlikely to happen before the system collapse upon itself.</p>

<p>I want to say it again: God is the communal spirit of the tribe. Satan is individualism. </p>

<p>And about Jesus, it was just a great guy that didn&#39;t want people to take religion literally but to discover the spirit behind it. A philosopher. No surprise they killed him and used his teachings to make another round of religious propaganda ( which he was fighting ). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you have a good point, but i think we just need to remove evil in its root. Individualism is not a bad thing if it is done without using someone else to reach your goals. It is those people who didn&#39;t use individualism to get to the top but lies and greed that we need to rebel against. It is they who own us and imprison our minds with their propaganda. If we manage to free ourselves of their money and power than we can understand life better and maybe find our purpose. I just don&#39;t understand how can we tolerate this torturing. Earth can be heaven and hell but right now we made it hell, and the more we corrupt our society the harder it will become to fight for our freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Individualism is not a bad thing in itself, it&#39;s when it falls out of balance with communality ( crosses morality edge ) that it becomes &quot;evil&quot; ( destructive to society ).</p>

<p>And what you are referring to as &quot;individualism&quot; is a biased definition because it is simply the egocentric viewpoint we all have. Morality is in the means we act on it; the liar and the self-made honest man can be both individualistic, only one has morals and one not.</p>

<p>The root of this evil is unchecked ego, it encompass mankind. You may think the problem are those nasty bankers or zionists or whatever, the truth is with the actual culture even if those guys were taken out they would be replaced in a generation. When men aren&#39;t taught things like they are they likely go sociopathic after a while and join the &quot;dark side&quot; because they find not any communality in the system ( i know because after i got fucked over one time too much, i stopped caring about anyone else and went almost totally individualistic, and i see this pattern a lot )</p>

<p>Either the system reboots on a local scale ( restore communality ) or the same will happen after a big collapse. No biggie, after all, mankind will only waste another generation like many before. I&#39;d be happier if it wasn&#39;t us, but hey, unlucky. I just hope someone finds the way to teach the good lesson after and prevent this from happening again, if it&#39;s going to be.</p>

We were being thought in school that we must follow every order that they tell  us because that is for the good of community and that there needs to be order and discipline. But we forget that chaos is brought by the same &quot;order&quot; and &quot;laws&quot; that they are teaching us. It is they that cause it and when someone goes &quot;mad&quot; they are rejected from the same society that are slaves to themselves, but just won&#39;t understand that. People are scared to think differently because they weren&#39;t thought how to think for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it not? The governments/banks conspire against the people and brainwash them so they can live under the protection of the devil.
The media is giving us false information because they work for the governments. This theory blends in with all other illuminati and free mason conspiracy theories. Also Bush did 9/11, ISIS is USA-made. When Muslim extremists fight for their god they actually fight for Satan. You die for Satan, not for God. Every government in the world has evil in it and a lot of blood on their hands. Basically almost everything the media say is false. </p>
