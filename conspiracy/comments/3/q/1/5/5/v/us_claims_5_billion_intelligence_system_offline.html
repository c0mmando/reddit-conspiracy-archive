It&#39;s obvious that they knew all along what they were doing.
 I mean, how many times has the US changed their story on this incident? </p>

<p>What is alarming is that it doesn&#39;t matter. The official record become the default reference for any public engagement and they blunder on doing whatever they want. There is an alarming disconnect between the .gov agencies and the reasonable behaviour that normal people expect from those who represent their interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right. It doesn&#39;t matter in the sense that it causes no significant change in awareness or consideration. </p>

<p>Consciousness has been conditioned to act is if it&#39;s business as usual no matter what happens. </p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that when governments have the ability to overwrite facts with false information, the general public doesn&#39;t bat an eye and continues upon the daily grind of survival and apathy. </p>

<p>It has gotten to the point insomuch that this trend of utter disconnection to reality is not going anywhere.
 If anything, the general state of humans will be reduced into an unaware husk of primitive lower mind behaviors and attitude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Government is always bringing up the rear in terms of organisational progress.. and the lowest common denominator often rules organisational thoughts.</p>

<p>and then, it&#39;s important to understand why this bad attitude from them does happen. It&#39;s not always deliberate, many in .gov are well intentioned but I wonder much of the nonsense follows from perception of necessity.. and likely a confusion about that which resist the good intentions must be resisted, where properly some of that criticism will be trying to help move them forward. That&#39;s why anyone who looks to the constitution or challenges .gov gets put on a list of troublemakers. Government is run for the most part by dull conservative minds who will think in black and white, them and us; &quot;you&#39;re either with us or against us&quot; - but again, we&#39;re not wrong wanting and expecting better from them.</p>

<p>Interesting then to wonder on the events that really do provoke change of attitude in Governmental organisations.. often only when they&#39;ve overreached and fked up so badly they cannot deny it.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we had cameras in the area but they were out for repair or turned away from where they had normally been pointed for years that day when the victim was shot. So nothing to see here folks, move along.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amateur comedian, but somehow that is how you need to present things today. Otherwise people get lost in facts, because most people are conditioned to never be able to see a full picture. You can go into personal problems and how it was sabotaged, etc, etc. But the short version is what I said, either do your job or face to consequences, I mean, you are killing people and we have rules for such things, with already set punishments.</p>

<p>TLDR: Just punish the woman responsible!</p>
