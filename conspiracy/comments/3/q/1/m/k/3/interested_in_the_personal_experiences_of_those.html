        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was under the age of 10 on that day, and while I remember plenty from the day, I certainly wasn&#39;t able to critically analyze the events and the reporting of the events like I can as a young adult. 
I&#39;m curious to what your thoughts and emotions were that day, throughout the day. I will tell you that I do not for a second buy the official government explanation at all, and haven&#39;t since I began looking into that day critically all those years ago. I won&#39;t say specifically what I believe, though I do have a very detailed and outlined theory of my own. 
Whether you are in complete agreement with the official narrative or you&#39;re a &quot;no-planer&quot; or someone who believes In a controlled demolition hypothesis, I just am interested in your experiences as a an adult that day. Any responses would really be appreciated.</p>

<p>Also, I apologize for this unorganized post, as usual I am on mobile.
Again, thanks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was horrific to watch. I saw the second plane hit live on television. You have to understand, there was literally nothing else on tv, radio, <em>anywhere</em> besides those fucking planes hitting the towers over and over, accompanied by the most virulent, violent, patriotic propaganda I&#39;ve ever heard. If you didn&#39;t go through it you&#39;ll never understand. There is nothing even remotely analogous currently. It&#39;s like the whole nation turned into bloodthirsty zombies. They didn&#39;t give a fuck who actually did it or why, they just wanted to &quot;bomb them a-rabs back to the stone ages. Bomb them all.&quot; I heard that phrase over and over. The only people who questioned the narratives were the far left, and many people felt terrified to speak out against the propaganda. NO ONE but other leftists wanted to hear anything even remotely questioning the narrative, questioning the march to war, the necessity of the Patriot Act, etc. It totally derailed a large and growing anti-capitalist/anti-globalization movement that you&#39;ve probably never heard of now. There were massive, disruptive protests all over the US/globe almost monthly, there was a protest of the IMF/World bank that was supposed to happen Sept 29th-30th that hundreds of thousands of people were mobilizing to shut down. My friend was in DC on Sept. 11th doing groundwork for the protests. She saw tanks being driven through the streets of DC, the entire town shut down. Regardless of the &quot;truth&quot; of who/what/how 9/11, they got exactly what they wanted. Nearly omniscient surveillance. Gutted the bill of rights. Demoralized/fragmented the american left. Regime change in Iraq. Endless, profitable war. Pliant consumer zombies who will trade anything for &quot;security.&quot; Before Sept. 11, people had hope that things could change, that things would have to change. That was all destroyed when those towers came down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t witness the planes hit or the towers come down, but I saw the area by 10:30, watching the smoke fill the whole downtown area.</p>

<p>Cell phones didn&#39;t work, internet would barely connect to anything, and there was really no information about what was going on. Until about noon or later that day, we had gotten unconfirmed reports that Pittsburgh was being firebombed (I assume that it was a game of telephone style mix with the PA crash), that there were suicide bombings going around the area (NYC), that California was being bombed.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t to claim that these incorrect reports were the result of any sort of intentional propaganda effort, but that the day itself was just surreal in a way that isn&#39;t really captured in today&#39;s sense of it. On that day it wasn&#39;t the 9/11 attacks, it was some weird, horrific tear in reality.</p>

<p>We assumed that 40-50,000 people were dead. I believed that three family members and a few friends were dead due to them working in the towers. Was correct about the friends.</p>

<p>The thing about the rumors is that while they still sound silly now, go back to 8:00 a.m. that day, before any of the crashes; does the official story of two hijacked planes knocking down the twin towers, a plane hitting the pentagon, and one crashing in PA sound realistic in any way? </p>

<p>Suicide bombers rampaging throughout the city, or additional attacks in Pittsburgh and California don&#39;t seem so crazy in that context. Things were fucked, to the point where the death toll adjustments in the following hours and days were actually to us, the only positive news coming out of it. </p>

<p>We thought there&#39;d be so many survivors, but of course that doesn&#39;t make sense in retrospect. I remembering hearing the story of the woman(?) who rode a huge chunk of concrete down the collapsing tower and survived. It was actually reported. It just felt...off. But everything had just gone crazy, what&#39;s one more story?</p>

<p>40-50,000 dead, then maybe only around 20,000, 15,000, then finally settled on 6-7000. While I don&#39;t remember the timeline exactly, that was the official number for a surprisingly long time before being cut in half. 3000 dead is an awful tragedy, but it&#39;s always a number I remember in contrast to 50,000.</p>

<p>As far as how my own experiences that day impacted my view on this and other official narratives, it changed it forever. Small things that don&#39;t add up, both in the official and conspiracy worlds. While I didn&#39;t see the planes, the countless stories I&#39;ve heard from people I know well leave no doubt in my mind. In that sense, anyone pushing the &#39;no planes&#39; theory is, in my eyes, either deeply misguided or deeply intentionally manipulative. Little things like that.</p>

<p>But what I remember the most that day beyond the attack and its direct consequences, was watching FoxNews run a clip of Palestinians celebrating in the streets watching the 9/11 attacks. I was very aware of politics in the school sense. I read newspapers and history books and took an active interest.</p>

<p>So when I found out that was some old, unrelated clip, and the network had run it saying it was earlier today (or the day after, whatever it was), I wondered who it was that made the decision to push that as an agenda. What does making people angry at Palestinians have to do with the tens of thousands of people I think are burning underground just a few miles away?</p>

<p>Please know that I don&#39;t mean this as a focus on Israel/Palestine, or who caused the 9/11 attacks, or a particular propagandist, whether a country or organization.</p>

<p>It was the first loose thread I really saw in my life, and once you pull, you look at almost everything that goes on around you through a different, critical lens. I&#39;ve spent years studying and analyzing propaganda and control, both professionally and as a personal interest. </p>

<p>Step one, as I learned it, is recognizing that if you only look for the frayed end to pull on, you&#39;re missing the big picture. Being able to find a loose string isn&#39;t the point - it&#39;s recognizing that the string is just an aspect of the sweater, itself a neat, comfortable, artificial creation.</p>

<p>Loose strings are mistakes in the created narrative. While valuable, don&#39;t rely on them. Thinking critically and recognizing the existence of created narrative is the most important thing we can do for building a better future. We don&#39;t even have to agree on what that future is - we just need to be able to have that debate on authentic terms. </p>

<p>9/11 destroyed my naivety in two ways. One in the sense of safety. An attack like this was unthinkable for <em>us.</em> The other side of it was not my fear of the &#39;other,&#39; but the start of my distrust of the &#39;us&#39; side of the equation. They were desperately trying to fill the space created with the loss of naivety with a new narrative. But the narrative was so clearly warped.</p>

<p>Whether you believe 9/11 was an inside job or not should not be dispositive of whether or not you consider yourself a conspiracy theorist. History is a story of corruption infinitely more than it is a story of cooperation. That&#39;s conspiracy. </p>

<p>&quot;History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It was suspicious as soon as the news that we didn&#39;t guard our war HQ was reported.  </p>

<p>Even without multiple planes hijacked simultaneously and two already crashed into two buildings, we would be guarding the Pentagon.  It&#39;s an impossibility that we wouldn&#39;t be guarding it. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>That was my experience also. The lockstep narrative of ALL of the news networks that day was also a red flag. I lost friends from the get-go on 9/11/01 by saying that we were being fed bullshit. I&#39;ve since regained some of those friends who are now more inclined to question the official story.</p>

<p>Besides the Pentagon hit, the magic passport story was the clincher for me. I heard about it a day or two after 9/11. Also, the non-stop repetition of &quot;We found a Koran in a car at Logan!&quot; was obvious propaganda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was pretty obvious that the events were being used to whip everyone up into a patriotic frenzy, terrorists were going to blamed for the whole thing, and that there was going to be a war.  It was not obvious that there were any shenanigans of a conspiratorial nature going on, nor was there any indication that the official story was anything but the truth.  In those days, the news (which came from the TV almost exclusively) was believable for the most part, so we just watched the coverage and believed what they told us.  In retrospect that seems naive, but at the time that&#39;s just how it was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t approach excessively critically at the time, but a few thoughts I had back then:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Marriott building falling seemed weird to me.</p></li>
<li><p>I never questioned the Pentagon, for whatever reason, at the time. Although I can&#39;t think if I know anyone who did witness it.</p></li>
<li><p>First thought on Flight 93 (and yes, I was sitting there at work, reloading the flight status page at that point) was that it had been shot down. I still believe that. And I can&#39;t say for sure, but I feel that if I had to make that decision, I might have made it, too. That field was unfortunately probably one of the best places to put it down, seemed like a railroad bridge scenario to me. :( </p></li>
<li><p>The Iraq thing was bullshit from the beginning. They blamed Al Qaeda straight on and I paid a lot of attention to what Bush said at that time - he never came out and said that Iraq was involved, people just assumed it. It was really stealthy and fucked up and I railed on about that a lot. But I did foolishly believe the plan was to go help in Iraq and stabilize it, making it an even better ally than Israel or Saudi Arabia (although what they did to Hussein, embarrassed me as an American. I thought we were more honorable than that). It sucked being so wrong about this one.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It was a odd time. Afterwards, no planes in the air for awhile. Except fighter jets every once in awhile in the middle of the night. Family members stranded across the country. Friends in New York like zombies going from hospital to hospital looking for friends and family members and friends and family members of friends who weren&#39;t up to the task.</p>

<p>People on every corner holding candles and waving flags. The dancing Israelis. Why were most of the terrorists Saudi nationals and why were they educated in flight schools across the US? Why did Condi write a paper with just this scenario proposed? Not that I thought our government was behind it, but the massive push for interagency communication right after pointed a little bit to the possibility that SOMEONE in our government knew about it and didn&#39;t communicate it. I get that, but the fucking Patriot Act. So many of us knew how dangerous it would be to our freedom and privacy and how, once a law is enacted, it would be renewed and even if you like the guys you have now (I spent a lot of time explaining this to people). It&#39;s a weapon, and in the future, it&#39;ll be wielded by someone you don&#39;t like. Someone who may want to hurt you. And hey, you don&#39;t really know the current weapon holder all that well, do you? </p>

<p>The TV announcers were the worst, just really disrespectful to the dead in their attempts to get the gruesome story. I watched a lot of TV and read a lot of Internet, but I did throw things at the TV a lot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was getting ready to go to a community college class and my girlfriend was watching the tv when I got out of the shower. The first plane had already hit the first tower, and as I laced up my left shoe I saw the second plane hit the second tower. This is when I exclaimed &quot;holy shit&quot; and explained to my girlfriend that the second plane should have been engaged or shot down if it had veered from its flight path in these circumstances. At this point I decided that school was not a big deal to miss, so I sat there watching the tv and taking in the news coverage. I&#39;m uncertain as to the order of events as they played out on TV, but I remember seeing the site of the plane that &quot;crashed&quot; in Pennsylvania or wherever (live on a chopper camera feed) and thinking to myself, &quot;that&#39;s not a crater from a crash, that&#39;s a debris field from something shot out of the air.&quot; The other thing that REALLY stuck out in my mind was the pentagon. I remember thinking &quot;holy shit, that&#39;s EXACTLY like the hole they blew in the side of slobodan milosovek&#39;s (spelling?) compound with a missile. That&#39;s all that I remember for the most part besides the people jumping out of buildings and all the terrible gore porn unleashed on America that day. Interestingly enough, my philosophy teacher and I had been discussing the reichstaag fire in regards to using &quot;terror attacks&quot; to mobilize countries in enacting fascist agendas just the day before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A friend phoned me. &#39;The WTC&#39; is on fire!!&#39;  Then as my then-SO got a hysterical call from her parents, we saw the second plane live. Apart from a gasp, we said nothing for a few minutes, hearing the newspeople babble and repeat, repeat, repeat the same phrases over and over. </p>

<p>But there&#39;s the thing: from that moment on, I just couldn&#39;t, deep down, <em>believe</em> this was real. At first it struck me as an action movie. And later as the actual human cost of this became evident and the victims became real flesh and bone, the lingering doubt on the official narrative, from day one. Just can&#39;t shake that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t an adult at the time. Junior year of high school. Was in the library when the first plane hit and heard some people whispering about it, but didn&#39;t think much of it. Went to US History where the teacher put the news on shortly after the second plane hit. We watched them burn then fall. I remember a kid behind me joking about it while we sat there horrified. I was deeply depressed for days and it took weeks for anything to regain a sense of normalcy.</p>

<p>I watched the world change very rapidly. The Columbine shooting had already intruded sharply into our sense of safety. Now the nation reacted with fear, aguish and hate. We passed useless laws and re-organized the security system to regain the illusion of control. We went to war, and even though I&#39;m a very peaceful, unpatriotic person, even I wanted to join and protect my country. For the length of the Bush administration the news would be filled with the dead, new restrictions of free speech, warnings of terrorist threats, and exposes on waste and corruption.</p>

<p>At the time I didn&#39;t think anyone would make a conspiracy theory out of it. It wasn&#39;t until college that I was shown Zeitgeist &amp; Loose Change. I thought 9/11 was questionable, but I was bothered by the shoddy standards of thought and evidence and the unquestioning acceptance of my conspiracy minded friend. I&#39;ve looked into it more since then and rejected the demolition hypothesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure</p>

<p>The demolition hypothesis begins with the rejection of several assertions:</p>

<p>-educated Arabs could conspire to hijack 4 airplanes, successfully pilot them and crash them into their intended targets</p>

<p>-the CIA &amp; FBI could fail to identify these potential terrorists and foil their plot</p>

<p>-the world&#39;s mightiest military could fail to intercept any of the planes and allow one of them to crash into their headquarters</p>

<p>-the Twin Towers could collapse without the use of explosives</p>

<p>-high speed airliner crashes could leave very little identifiable debris</p>

<p>This incredulity is then combined with several positive assertions:</p>

<p>-the US has the technology and resources to carry out such an operation, therefore it did</p>

<p>-various parties within the US and abroad have vested interests in carrying out the attacks and upon blaming them on the supposed perpetrators, therefore they did</p>

<p>-the WTC building collapses resemble controlled demolitions, therefore they were</p>

<p>Every one of the points above can and has been argued both ways. I&#39;ve watched lots of footage of the WTC crashes and collapses, of WTC 7, looked at images of the aftermath of flights 77 and 93, read theories and explanations, and in each case found the official explanation to be the most cohesive and plausible.</p>

<p>For too many 9/11 was our first introduction into the rising tide of Muslim extremism and Al Qaeda, even though 3 separate bombings had already rocked US Embassies and the Cole. It was the first attack on US soil since Pearl Harbor (besides incredibly minor actions during WW II), and was a brutal awakening. </p>

<p>That savages from a distant land could walk onto four airplanes, armed only with knives, and crash into 3 buildings, killing thousands, starting 2 wars of conquest and riches beggars belief. If you phrase it in a manner designed to make the scenario seem implausible. Which is exactly what conspiracists do again and again.</p>

<p>When combined with Cui Bono, conspiracists turn into armchair detectives, creating elaborate and internally contradictory narratives based entirely around any detail they believe doesn&#39;t fit the official narrative but which does confirm their own personal biases. Evidence in favor of the official narrative (e.g. externally visible bowing of WTC 1 &amp; 2&#39;s vertical columns) is ignored, while they simultaneously accuse the official narrative of ignoring their own smoking guns. Villians are fingered, usually some combination of the Bushes, Bankers, Saudis, Zionists, CIA, etc. </p>

<p>The official explanation, while not 100% satisfactory or complete, are imo sufficient to explain the events of that day and leading up to it. And despite the criticisms of NIST and the 9/11 Commission, I am far more skeptical of the conspiracy community&#39;s commitment to truth and facts.</p>

<p>And you are right: </p>

<p>The demolition hypothesis begins with the rejection of the assertion that the Twin Towers could collapse without the use of explosives or vast amounts of another type of additional energy that does not belong into an office building, and it is combined with the positive assertion the WTC building collapses resemble controlled demolitions, therefore it should not be dismissed with a <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc</em> fallacy &#39;à la &quot;planes crashed into the buildings an hour before, that is what alone must have caused their collapses&quot;. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not true at all. The twins collapses don&#39;t resemble any controlled demolition ever recorded. </p>

<p>Top down collapse with soundless lightless sequential cutting of all external supports. Nope, that dog don&#39;t hunt. </p>

<p>Watch the interview with Danny Jowenko that truthers love to parade around. When watching the collapse of the Twins, he says it is categorically <em>impossible</em> that it was a controlled demolition. </p>

<p>How can you be sure about that, you&#39;ve neither seen <em>nor</em> heard a building come down top-bottom. <em>Think</em> for a minute.

    <div class="md"><p>See? Wrong answer. They&#39;re both vertebrates, have lungs, lay eggs.... </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry though, it was a trick question. You would have been wrong either way, because penguins have feathers and beaks and reptiles have scales and no beaks. </p>

<p>A penguin is still an animal, even if it is not a reptile. And when you see a platypus, you still classify it as an animal, even if - on first sight - you&#39;re not sure whether it&#39;s a mammal, a reptile or a bird, having fur, a duck bill, laying eggs and shit. You don&#39;t classify it as fungus just because it resembles none of the other animals you&#39;ve known so far. </p>

<p>WTC1&amp;2 resembled demolitions by virtue of levelling the greatest part of the mass within a few seconds, even if they went top-to-bottom instead of bottom-up like conventional controlled demolitions à la WTC7. A top-down &quot;collapse&quot; a natural failure mode does not make.</p>

<p>I hope that answers your question how &quot;the WTC building collapses resemble controlled demolitions&quot; without &quot;resembling any controlled demolition at all.&quot;</p>

<p>Would that be all or do you want to learn more about the taxonomy of building collapses?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has been said already, but it was incredible how it was live shots and replays of NYC on every cable channel until early evening. The lust for revenge at any cost was also completely insane. It didn&#39;t matter if we weren&#39;t exactly sure who was responsible, it was time to turn the middle east into glass. I&#39;m surprised there weren&#39;t interment camps set up for American Muslims similar to Japanese camps during WW2.<br/>
There was a lot of bad information spread, I had a pager with CNN news service at the time. I was getting text updates throughout the morning about car bombs exploding in DC. Whatever made it to the newsroom was being reported.<br/>
It was something I don&#39;t ever want to see on live TV again. The confusion, and almost light hearted way the first crash was reported as a horrible aviation mistake... Then the shock when the second plane hit. It was unbelievable.<br/>
The last thing I will never forget...air travel was still restricted across the country come nightfall. It was an absolutely clear night where I lived, at any given time you could see multiple aircraft in the sky (I grew up due north from a major airport) but there was nothing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I moved to to NYC in Aug 2001 with my fiancé. We went to the Statue of Liberty and all that jazz in between job hunting and unpacking. When we returned from Liberty Island we looked up at the Twin Towers and asked each other if we had enough energy to hit the observatory deck. I said, &quot;Nah. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re going anywhere..&quot; </p>

<p>9/11 was her second day on the job. She called me to say that the TV news in the elevator reported that a plane crashed into the World Trade Center. I couldn&#39;t believe what she was trying to tell me. &quot;There is a TV in your elevator?&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, she worked in Midtown. I had to walk against a stream of people pushing uptown to get away. I kept seeing people stumbling toward me covered in dust. At one point a police car drove across my path, and I remember seeing two kids in the back seat. They had tears on their cheeks, and they stared out through holes in the dust they wiped off the windows from the inside.</p>

<p>Around Christmas that year we got around to developing the film from our Statue of Liberty trip. (Yes, that&#39;s how pictures used to work.) While we looked at a photo of my (now) wife with the downtown skyline and Towers behind her, we noticed the date on the picture: 8/11/01. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;m 31 so I guess I qualify. I was in a class at community college and some people on campus kinda knew something happened so we turned on the TV for a few minutes between the first and 2nd plane, expressed our shock and went on with class. They cancelled the afternoon classes. It just felt kinda weird. Some people were calling family who were in DC or NY and trying to relay information. </p>

<p>I&#39;d already had an encounter a year before that showed me most cops/institutional administrators/authority figures/spokespersons/etc are seat-of-their-pants retards so I was of course suspicious of what the TV said. I guess I believed terrorists did it at the time, but I didn&#39;t blame them. There&#39;s a lot of reasons for someone to hate this country enough to do that. I didn&#39;t really feel much grief for those who died or lost someone, because tragedies happen every day and, again, it&#39;s no surprise why people hate america. </p>

<p>One aside, some people did pick up on the weird timing of the third building being reported. It got hushed up pretty quick. </p>

<p>As soon as they started saying we had to go in and get revenge(which was pretty much the same day as the towers fell), I got a sour feeling. They were way too quick to go to war over it, and also to pass the patriot act. Nobody had time to read and discuss the bill before it was passed, it was fucking disgusting. That was probably one of the first things that really &quot;woke me up&quot;, too. </p>

<p>I guess the whole thing bothered me for a while, but I was too young to have much context for it. I just put the issue aside and kept a vague disgust/resentment on simmer for a few years but didn&#39;t actively investigate why the handling of 9/11 bothered me. Got laid, got stoned, got a decent job, you know, so I didn&#39;t care as much for a little bit.</p>

<p>Then I voted for Obama the first time and watched him get the peace prize for literally being as bad as bush was in terms of foreign policy and realized something was seriously fucky, deeply in the entire government, not just in one administration. I also had a few insights into corporate culture and the culture of work in this country, and 2008 happened and then I reeaaallly started reading about why this stuff was happening. From there I went vegetarian, changed my opinions on what it means to be a productive member of society, started doing lots of psychedelics and getting into metaphysics, and uh...now I&#39;m basically shouting stoned and drunk off my suburban balcony wearing an upside down american flag as a wizard cape yelling about The Moon and The Tower before they lock me up. Metaphorically speaking of course. </p>

<p>Sorry if anything doesn&#39;t make sense. Gotta run to work. Thanks for asking. How are you?</p>
