        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>so now it&#39;s supposed to be okay for a student to be attacked by a cop, in school? since when? abuse is never &quot;okay&quot;, anywhere.</p>

<p>Richland County, SC — As we reported earlier this week, a viral video shows a cop slam a female student into the ground while she was peacefully sitting at a desk. Now, we have learned that the student who filmed the attack was actually arrested.</p>

<p>18-year-old Niya Kenny told WLTX that she filmed the incident because she was horrified by what she witnessed. Kenny likely knew that without video evidence the police officer responsible for the attack would not be held accountable.</p>

<p>“I was screaming ‘What the f? what the f is this really happening?’ I was praying out loud for the girl. I just couldn’t believe this was happening. I was just crying, and he said, ‘since you have so much to say you are coming too.’ I just put my hands behind my back,” she said.</p>

<p>“A man used that much force on a little girl, a big man, like 300 pounds of full muscle. I was like no way, no way, you can’t do that to no little girl,” she added.</p>

<p>The incident reportedly began when the student who was attacked was caught using her cellphone in class. The teacher asked her to leave and she refused, then an officer was called and she refused to leave again. Officer Ben Fields then decided that a student disobeying him was reason enough to attack her in the manner that he did.</p>

<p>Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott defended the officer, saying that he only “bears some responsibility” in the incident, and blamed the student for daring to disobey a cop.</p>

<p>“If she had not disrupted the school and disrupted that class, we would not be standing here today. So it started with her and it ended with my officer. What I’m going to deal with is what my deputy did,” Lott said.</p>

<p>Deputy Ben Fields has since been suspended without pay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone remember when things like civil disobedience were respected. Some people would argue that it&#39;s not just our right but our obligation as a society to stand up against injustice.</p>

<p>And in most situations you&#39;re not required to obey an unlawful order from a cop, but these days you&#39;re risking a lot if you do. We&#39;re basically forced to take the ride and fight it later in court but even if you win the cop is not affected in any way so he keeps doing it. You can beat the charge but not the ride and lots of cops see that as a victory for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I will make sure to let my friend, who works as a school counselor, specifically to help kids with emotional/disciplinary problems, that she is wasting her time talking to the kids all day, hoping to make a developmental breakthrough (she has positively affected a number of children) and she needs to be body slamming them instead.</p>

<p>Edit to add:  </p>

<p>if I was I student in that situation, the act of the cop would be more disturbing to me than the girl using her phone in class.  </p>

<p>And I suppose the deputy was also correct in arresting the girl that filmed the body slam?  Cuz she had her phone out, and the authoritarian rule of law had been violated?   So that makes it ok to violate her body.  I guess as long as you are just doing your job then it&#39;s all ok, right?</p>

<p>to which you responded with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They actually do have all day to deal with this girl. It is their job and what they are being paid to do, deal with children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but my point remains correct. It is not the teacher&#39;s job to babysit students, it is their job to teach the students. To teach the students properly the teachers must be able to enforce their own set of rules that will best provide the optimum environment for learning. It is the principal&#39;s job to trust his teachers and enforce their rules. When both the teacher and principal are met with resistance it is the officer&#39;s job to intervene. This isn&#39;t new. We had cops at my highschool 15 years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if I was I student in that situation, the act of the cop would be more disturbing to me than the girl using her phone in class.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re back tracking now. A student uses her phone and nothing happens. Next time, two students use their phones and nothing happens. Before the end of the week everyone is ignoring the teacher (not learning) and doing what they want. You say the cop is more disturbing than a girl using her phone. You seem to be forgetting that the cop is there because of the girl. The girl is ultimately the cause of everything in the video. She is the fault. Cause and effect. </p>

An example would be the cop that pulled his gun on a man for video taping him and then tried to say he saw a bulge in his pocket. This though, it&#39;s pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>This class is 1 hour long, and according to multiple students, she just pulled out her phone to check a text message. Considering she just went into foster care, it might have been important.

<p>To answer your question, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s only more rebellious after this happened. The cop undoubtedly used too much force and deserved to be punished accordingly, but he was still warranted in getting physical to begin with.

You can say that it shouldn&#39;t be this way and cops should be more respectful, but regardless they are doing their communities a huge service, and on the very off chance that you encounter an officer at some point, you take the fucking time and effort to be respectful and obey their orders.

    <div class="md"><p>It has nothing to do with &#39;excuses&#39;, it&#39;s fucking factual science.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if someone as retarded as you is aware of what science is or how it works, but that&#39;s a whole other issue entirely. Regardless, you may or may not be aware humans have electro-chemical organs called brains. And that these very sensitive and complex organs are responsible for decision making, thinking, perceiving and interpretting the world around us (I know I must be blowing your mind at this point but hang in there). Our brains don&#39;t always work perfectly rational under certain conditions, and those include &quot;being in a bad mood,&quot; &quot;being intoxicated,&quot; &quot;delirious from lack of sleep,&quot; &quot;not being able to control your dog,&quot; &quot;grieving&quot; (or being an idiot like you). And this means that people aren&#39;t always going to immediately react or behave exactly like you want or expect them to.</p>

<p>When you are experiencing extreme states of mind or behavior that are beyond your control or in a situation that is not routine, it should be the officer&#39;s responsibility to consider that those possibilities will affect a person&#39;s behavior and responses and to respond like human beings not violent thugs. </p>

<p>To break this down more concisely so you understand it, extreme states of mind affect one&#39;s ability to think clearly and behave rationally. To deny that is anti-science. </p>

<p>Just the presence of police is enough to raise stress and affect judgement and thinking.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people are not always perfectly in control of their mental state, especially during a stressful situation involving the police. Don&#39;t act like you always make perfect judgements and behave perfectly rational, and never have experienced extreme states that have affected your ability to think clearly, because you&#39;d be an idiot and a liar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simple fact that you really think &quot;being an idiot like me&quot; is a valid excuse to disobey a police officer&#39;s orders tells me that your logic is extremely flawed. It doesn&#39;t matter what goes through your head, or what state of mind you&#39;re in, the only thing that <em>ever matters</em> in life is <em>what you actually do</em>. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re an autistic deaf man who just lost his mother, if you murder a person you&#39;re still a fucking murderer. That is what a fact is, since you seem to be confused about that. Following your logic, it&#39;s totally okay to punch a police officer in the face just because you&#39;re angry and &quot;not thinking clearly,&quot; and that&#39;s just not the case. You still hit a police officer, that&#39;s simply what happened. I&#39;m not disagreeing with the idea that police deal with people who aren&#39;t thinking clearly more often than not, but that is absolutely no excuse to act like a child and do irrational things. Unless your life is clearly hanging in the balance and the officer doesn&#39;t have the legal right to be threatening your life, you are 100% responsible for your actions. That&#39;s how life works.</p>

<p>PS. Really solid arguing tactics, I almost believed that I was a babbling idiot who doesn&#39;t know the meaning of science (even though I&#39;m studying science), you almost had me there! I wish I had your parents so I could have the same upbringing as you, and could learn how to argue like a little school girl that is afraid of the fact that someone disagrees with them. Bravo, I look forward to the next disagreement you have with someone, maybe next time you&#39;ll call them a doo-doo head and pull their hair.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re just people. Good ones and bad ones. I don&#39;t understand why so many people don&#39;t believe that a police officer can do something wrong. Adults, anyway. I had a friend in college whose entire world view was wrecked when friends told her all the things you need to do to make sure police don&#39;t plant drugs in your car during a search (because it had happened to them). She just thought that being a police officer meant you were a good person by default. It was weird. She did eventually &quot;get it&quot; after a few cautionary tales.</p>

<p>In counterpoint, I saw one of those terrible viral videos this morning, an officer in SW DC who de-escalated a situation, breaking up a fight between teen girls and ended it with a dance off. Like, that&#39;s hilarious and awesome, community policing. Kids in the neighborhood actually chimed in on the thread and were like, &quot;She&#39;s awesome, I now don&#39;t think all police are out to get me.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Public school isn&#39;t &quot;direction&quot;, it&#39;s the complete opposite and lack thereof, it&#39;s the warehousing of children while trying to remove their innate humanity from them, and it&#39;s the reason why children of today are so horribly formed mentally, emotionally, and intellectually - and grown men paid by the state attacking young girls in the school with impunity is one example of why it&#39;s institutionalized abuse. That grown man attacking children is the active arm of the abuse, the passive side happens all day every day through their crucial developmental period between age 5 and 18.</p>

<p>People are &quot;directed&quot; into sick, unhealthy ways of thinking, acting, being, and living life - the ones who faithfully trust this &quot;direction&quot; by these &quot;authority figures&quot;(who have no idea what they&#39;re doing and are just working for money to buy their cheetos and new TVs) are fucked for life - they waste the first 40 or 50 years of their lives on nothing, on trying to achieve pointless goals like &quot;buying a new truck&quot;, and then have a mid-life crisis until they give up and just try to enjoy their last years on the Earth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our entire civilization is led/lied into multiple needless wars every generation where the billionaires whose kids <em>don&#39;t ever</em> set foot in public schools make billions more and sign the checks in blood of servicemen who were recruited <em>as kids</em> by military men who went through the same indoctrination/training and are now stationed in high school libraries and cafeterias.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>rules and authority figures</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hitler was an authority figure too, so were all of his police and military men, they all had lots of rules they wanted you and your children to follow as well.</p>

<p>arbitrary authority means nothing at all except force, and that&#39;s the only authority that the adults involved in the school system have - they are demonstrably involved in institutionalized abuse of innocent kids - but since everyone goes through the same process, people tend not to see it and just want everyone else to make them comfortable by conforming to the same wrongs that they have been subjected to.</p>

<p>If these kids sense something is wrong (which many invariably do, which is why we have such a high rate of mental illness, suicide, &quot;cutting&quot;, deviancy, drug abuse, psych. medication, etc) - the adults try to drug them or physically harm them until they shut up and do as they&#39;re told. That&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s just continuing through the use of force and coercion. It&#39;s a cycle of abuse that will continue until enough people <em>grow a conscience</em> or realize it&#39;s unacceptable - just like EVERY OTHER INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM OF ABUSE that has afflicted humanity, from the holocaust to the brutal period of catholicism to the kings of europe to etc.</p>

<p>as a community and society in America we NEED to do better for ourselves and our kids/young people - we can&#39;t just be simpleminded assholes thinking &quot;she should listen to adults&quot; when the adults are abusing the kids.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>School&#39;s presented the facts that everyone&#39;s ignoring.  First this all started because she refused to put her phone away in class. This isnt a fucking sit in at a diner that wouldnt serve blacks. Teacher tells her to leave.  Asst Principal told her to leave.  School cop was called. After she again refused to leave, he even tells her Im going to have to forcibly remove you.</p>

<p>And now everyone&#39;s fucking surprised at the outcome. </p>

<p>What do you do with a student who disobeys everyone? You force-ably remove them. Plus she apparently hit the police officer in the beginning of the altercation.</p>

<p>So the real question in my opinion is, how did blacks somehow get above the law? Because they honestly are treated like that now. They have the ability to disobey police and if anything negative comes about it, they can end that police officers career. </p>

<p>This isnt a case of racism or police brutality, this is a case of a black student not having any respect for her superiors, and thinking she&#39;s above the law. And everyone is letting her win, because they think he was too rough on her. Fuck her. </p>

We have 29 others whose parents think the same damn thing.</p>

<p>Learning content is tailored to get kids interested and that&#39;s the #1 thing we go for when we teach. Yet you forget that we&#39;re teaching other human beings who have a free will of their own and in many cases choose not to work at all.</p>

<p>You&#39;re completely ignorant to the fact that in every single class I&#39;ve taught, I&#39;ve had at least one student who would tell me to my face that they would not do work. What am I to do? Tell me. Please. If you know the answer, you have the holy grail. You&#39;ll make millions. You haven&#39;t been there. You don&#39;t know.

<p>All teachers are Orcs from Mordor. Fuck em.</p>

<p>Edit: you do realize that student handbooks/district rules set the standard for consequences? Teachers have nothing to do with it. I couldn&#39;t get a student expelled for a cell phone violation if I wanted to. Student would have to make a bomb threat or physically assault a teacher. And then there would be court hearings to support/deny the expulsion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind the whole story of what happened here. The teacher asked her multiple times to put the phone away. </p>

<p>Teacher asked for administration to help. The student still didnt listen.</p>

<p>An officer came in and asked her to leave the classroom, still didnt listen.</p>

<p>What makes you think any of the following would work?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Embarassed the student in front of others. &quot;I&#39;m not going to say another word until this girl puts her phone away.&quot; &quot;The entire class will all be given a quiz if you can&#39;t convince her to put her phone away in 10 seconds... 9... 8...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She doesnt appear to care about what her peers think. She was disrupting the class by not following the original order, Put the phone away. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Confiscated the phone. Go up and rip it out of her hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She tried to hit the officer that was going to remove her from class. What do you think she would do if you tried to pull the phone from her, much less even get close enough to rip it out of her hands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Failed the student for lack of class participation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, what makes you think she cares if she is playing with her phone during class time? Yeah, she could already know the material, but its still distracting to other students. Though I did see laptops, maybe she was getting texts and it was set to vibrate and it was distracting. OR the kids pulled their laptops out while the teacher was waiting for administration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Written the student a demerit. Or the whole class demerits if they didn&#39;t make her out the phone away</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, why would she care?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Called for detention starting immediately after class</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If she wasnt going to leave the class to begin with, what stops her from sticking around for detention?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suspended the student
Moved to have the student expelled</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats why administration was contacted. The problem escalated above the teachers responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with almost everything you said. However, the blame doesn&#39;t fall on the teacher. She would never have called that officer in there if she thought there was a chance the officer would toss her around like that. It was a bluff. Yes, a very stupid bluff. But it&#39;s the same bluff parents make when they tell a little kid that a police officer will take them to jail if they don&#39;t eat their vegetables. It&#39;s a stupid bluff and it teaches kids not to trust police officers. But the mother also doesn&#39;t expect the officer to then walk into her dining room and toss her infant around for not eating it&#39;s vegetables. </p>

<p>I&#39;m high. Does his make sense?</p>

<p>Ninja edit:</p>

<p>To elaborate a little more. Several of your suggestions for alternatives could backfire as well. Forcibly take the kids phone can result in something ridiculous (but arguably equally as likely as getting body slammed by a cop over a phone) like now you posses child porn or your have a big PR issue because a crazy parent went to the news cause you took a kids phone while her brother was having surgery, or any other equally absurd but still not impossible scenario. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off don&#39;t believe that you can learn how to teach by taking a course. All you&#39;re doing is furthering the way you were taught rather than attempting to teach in a way that&#39;s most beneficial to each student.</p>

<p>Teaching is more than just going over required course work and mandating students listen to your every word and whim. Teaching is an act of communication not indoctrination. </p>

<p>Never at one point should a teacher feel as if they are a pushover, if you cannot actively engage a student you shouldn&#39;t be teaching. A teacher is an authority figure despite how you may feel. and if you can&#39;t deal with the task at hand then why be there? Now don&#39;t take this as a demand for students to listen but at a certain point you should demand to do your job which is, to teach. </p>

<p>When teachers bring up the argument, &quot;The students don&#39;t listen&quot; or &quot;The students don&#39;t work hard&quot; all that sounds like is a teacher whining about student&#39;s making them actually do their job rather than it being the babysitting they wanted it to be. </p>

<p>Parent&#39;s don&#39;t believe teachers are out to get their students, that&#39;s extremely... narrow minded (no intent of insult) but you have 1 job and that&#39;s to teach content that the parent can&#39;t teach. They are obviously instilling a great deal of trust into teachers but if a parent thinks that the person they are trusting to ensure the educational future of their child is adequate then the teacher must have overstepped some type of boundary.</p>

<p>Just look upon yourself to see each student as a job and not just teaching the classroom.  Teaching isn&#39;t easy, the pay sucks ass, but if you really wanted to do your job there wouldn&#39;t be any issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, what are your credentials? What expertise tells you that you&#39;re an expert at education and what goes on in a college education class?</p>

<p>You have no idea what it takes to be a teacher.</p>

<p>Again, what do I say to the student who will not do work? The student who, on the first day of school says to the whole class that she isn&#39;t going to work the whole year. What do I say to that? How do I respond? What&#39;s he correct way? Because a one on one conversation is what I would do. And have done. I&#39;m thinking of one student in particular, who I liked and had a good relationship with most of the time. She knew what she was doing when she got in trouble and when she did something she went and took the consequences. But she was the worst thing for my class. I couldn&#39;t control what she said and I&#39;m not the mean teacher. I don&#39;t like sending students out, but we have our limits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently I&#39;m finishing my undergrad in Computer Engineering.</p>

<p>For my high school I taught computer and network security to 31 students. Now I don&#39;t have teaching credentials but I was allowed to teach after school in the lab. I taught at the most troubled schools in the district and believe me I know what I&#39;m doing I&#39;m really good at it too so don&#39;t go around calling me clueless. You don&#39;t know how hard teaching is until you&#39;re teaching kids how to use a computer and how to properly secure it on the network.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be a teacher to point out bad teaching, it just makes it a whole lot easier.</p>

<p>And for those students....</p>

<p>Again, what do I say to the student who will not do work?</p>

<pre><code> Again if you were adequate in teaching your coursework wouldn&#39;t actually be work. 
</code></pre>

<p>The student who, on the first day of school says to the whole class that she isn&#39;t going to work the whole year.</p>

<pre><code> You&#39;re an adult and you just got intimidated by a child congrats you&#39;re already losing. If I were you play into their banter, there&#39;s nothing stopping you from saying &quot;Watch I bet you will&quot; or get a little mean with it say something like &quot;Wow we have the first dummy of the semester, it usually takes a few days to find the dummies but this one came ripe and early&quot; Remember you&#39;re the one in charge, this is chess not checkers.
</code></pre>

<p>You not sending students out is a problem, you need to be more assertive because if you let one get out of hand you will be that teacher that is ineffective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol no. Right now I am a substitute teacher looking for a job. The last two years I was at one of the bottom five schools in the state. We spent more on security at the school than we did on new learning materials.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never had to call a resource officer, but if you don&#39;t teach, you can&#39;t tell how hard it is to keep a class in check. Just allowing one student to use their cell phone means that all of them feel the need to use theirs. Sorry, but until you have done it, you really don&#39;t know. I have 30 kids looking to me for structure and consistency. I can&#39;t play favorites.</p>

<p>I think my main point though, I substitute at a good district and I see kids with their phones out everyday and I tell them to put it away. They do. Every time. Why couldn&#39;t the girl just do that?</p>

Obviously if teachers literally didn&#39;t get paid then very few people would teach, but the same can be said about any other profession as well. People have a choice when choosing a career and the majority of people who choose to teach don&#39;t do so simply because it provides the necessary amount of income to get by financially.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Absolutely disruptive. If one student is allowed to use their cell phone, all of them will want to. I don&#39;t agree at all with what the police officer did; there are clearly better ways to handle this kind of situation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s said, if a student refused to leave the classroom, I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d do. The girl certainly doesn&#39;t need to be thrown or mishandled, but I&#39;m not sure what she is expecting when they call the police officer. At this point she has to understand that she&#39;s going to leave the classroom, one way or another, whether she likes it or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>School didn&#39;t react incorrectly, the officer did. The following is very standard for teachers and probably very like what the teacher did:</p>

<p>1.) Student knows school policy; covered in first week of school.</p>

<p>2.) Verbal warning to put phone away</p>

<p>3.) Ask for student&#39;s phone. Some places send them to the office, others the teacher keeps them. Most of the time students have to wait til the end of the day, sometimes the next day.</p>

<p>4.) Send student to office for disobeying teacher</p>

<p>5.) Call principal to escort student to the office for discipline; parents or guardians called, detention, suspension, etc.</p>

<p>6.) Call resource officer</p>

<p>I doubt any of the escalation was needless. This girl likely disobeyed on 5 different levels of consequence. In my experience, it&#39;s never even gotten to #5.</p>

<p>Am astounded at the number of people who fight so hard against their own rights and the rights of their children and future generations. I mean, why don&#39;t you folks just show up at the prison and ask to be let in if you think it&#39;s so important that authority figures monitor you constantly and beat you for any minor infraction?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont have any desire to fight against anyones rights. Im normally the first person to stand up for individuual freedoms even in esoteric philosiphical type debates. This girl didnt deserve to be manhandled like that and its fairly obvious the cop completely overreacted. That doesnt change the fact that she had 100 opportunities to leave before this incident happened and it doesnt change the fact that they already escalated through a lot of otger levels before the police were called. At the end of the day she wouldnt leave when she was repeatedly asked to leave. Thats a problem that eventually fell to the polices responsibility. She should have been removed a lot less violently, but she still should have been removed is all im saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She was asked to leave because she was being disruptive. The teacher needs to be in control of the class. However these days the teacher will lose their job for even touching the person, so you need security. He asked her to leave as well and then had to use force. She then fought back and punched him and kicked her legs up to prevent herself from being removed from the classroom.</p>

<p>What the fuck do you think security is going to do at this point? Give up and call it a day? When you are escorting someone off the premises you the authority to remove them and if they attack you it&#39;s assault. Nothing bad would&#39;ve happened to her if she listened in the first place. Similar situations has happened before with another black kid and the security/cop was also black but it wasn&#39;t controversial because the adult wasn&#39;t white.</p>

<p>Please do me a favor and go to a public place that has cops or security and be disruptive. Refuse to leave when they ask you to. Finally post your results here for all to see. I guarantee that your age or color will be irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just realized how interesting it is that most of us completely missed the point of this post in our zeal to talk about it - beyond the use of force, <em>the student that spoke up was arrested.</em></p>

<p>We have to chew on this. That an officer is called into a classroom to deal with a texting student (what a waste) is a problem. That he throws the kid around the room is a much bigger, criminal IMHO, problem. But that a student standing up and saying, &quot;This is wrong!&quot; is arrested for it is even farther beyond the pale.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I was screaming ‘What the f, what the f is this really happening?’ I was praying out loud for the girl,” says Kenny. “I just couldn’t believe this was happening I was just crying <strong>and he said, since you have so much to say, you are coming, too. I just put my hands behind my back.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>She was charged with &quot;Disturbing the School&quot; for protesting a fellow student being thrown around the class like a ragdoll.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the law, I&#39;d have racked up a bunch of these as a teen:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The law says it is unlawful to “interfere with or to disturb in any way or in any place the students or teachers of any school or college in this State,” or to “loiter about such school or college premises,” or “to act in an obnoxious manner thereon,” or “to enter upon any school or college premises or loiter around the premises, except on business, without the permission of the principal or president in charge.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More background:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tony Robinson Jr., another student who recorded the incident, told WLTX-TV, “She really hadn’t done anything wrong. She said that she had took her phone out, but it was only for a quick second.”</p>

<p>Robinson said, “I’ve never seen anything so nasty looking, so sick to the point that you know, other students are turning away, don’t know what to do, and are just scared for their lives. That’s supposed to be somebody that’s going to protect us. Not somebody that we need to be scare off, or afraid.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More background <a href="http://heavy.com/news/2015/10/niya-kenny-assault-at-spring-valley-high-disturbing-school-south-carolina-student-video-arrested-standing-up-speaking-recording-charged-interview-mother/">here</a>. Apparently, the officer has a history of abuse at the school, one former student asserts he slammed a pregnant woman a few years ago!</p>

<p>We need more Niya Kennys, period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read from the kids in the class, they didn&#39;t even know what she did wrong, she was a new kid, lost her parents, and didn&#39;t talk. Sounds like the teacher wanted her to engage with him and she was just quiet and it pissed him off.</p>

<p>Teacher needs to go, too.</p>

<p>This story really depresses me because the facts are all out there (the students and former students of this school have A LOT to say about it) but people just hear what they want to hear.</p>

<p>And the sickest thing are people who justify it because the young girl was black, that&#39;s the most disgusting. If you hear kids talk about it, it wasn&#39;t about race (not from the police officer, that is), they said he&#39;s Officer Slam, and claim he&#39;s slammed kids of all races and sizes. An emo white boy, a pregnant girl. The kids claim the teacher did treat black kids badly, though. One girl said he kicked her out of class every day of the week for doing nothing...</p>

<p>A lot of issues in this story, mostly from bystanders vs. principles. Like, how come there&#39;s a guy nicknamed &quot;Officer Slam&quot; working in a school? Why do teachers call the police for kids who won&#39;t answer questions? Why were the kids all so terrified that only one could speak up? <em>Why was the one student who DID speak up arrested and charged with a crime?</em> Why do people jump and stretch and reach to justify an obvious overreach of power against a 16-year-old girl who just lost her family because they have so much hate and fear inside? Where the fuck are the parents--all parents--at this school and why aren&#39;t they flipping their shit? :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow... Some of the comments in here are unbelievable. First thing, as a former teacher I agree that a student disobeying a teacher&#39;s commands in this manner should not be tolerated. As others have said it undermines the teacher&#39;s authority and makes other students feel emboldened to repeat the same behavior if it is not addressed. </p>

<p>However... This police officer&#39;s actions were horrific and inexcusable. There&#39;s never any situation in which using that level of force on a child is acceptable, short of a student with a firearm. </p>

<p>At least in this specific case, the officer actually lost his job over this offense. Too often that isn&#39;t the case. </p>

<p>Hope she sues the fuck out of the teacher as well as the police.</p>

<p>Edit: The archive link didn&#39;t pull a new copy - kid says the teacher wouldn&#39;t say what she did but it couldn&#39;t have been much because no one in class knew what she did and she was totally quiet the whole time. They need to fire that teacher. He&#39;s a menace. He watched a student get beat down for being too quiet in his class, holy hell.</p>

<p>Also, I find it interesting that people are jumping in here completely fabricating explanations as to how the girl got into trouble...hoping that no one calls them on it - and the school administration&#39;s false narrative (remember, they also falsely claimed the girl wasn&#39;t hurt) the one the public believes.</p>

<p>Not being able to control your own students or in class is the schools problem. Then of course the cop over reacted when being recorded and with dealing with children. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same answer. That girl was falsely arrested by the cop that was fired. Her charges will be dropped if they haven&#39;t already. Your post reads like this is okay and that people are okay with it. People are not okay with it and neither is the Sheriff who fired the cop the next day after seeing the video for the very first time. In this instance, there is no conspiracy.

    <div class="md"><p>This thread is full of apologists, though. And the kids themselves walked out of class today in support of &quot;Officer Slam.&quot; </p>

<p>The charges haven&#39;t been dropped on either of the girls. The teacher is still a teacher there. There are so many different themes in this story that should appeal to our conspiratorial nature:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>School to prison pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>Deprivation of the right to an education for an infraction so minor that even classmates weren&#39;t aware of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Kids being terrified for speaking up and getting charged with crimes <em>for</em> speaking up (so we see why they&#39;re afraid - getting physically attacked themselves and/or getting a record).</p></li>
<li><p>The normalization of police brutality in schools (the police claim to be appalled by this - but if you check the students&#39; comments on Twitter, this officer choke-slamming students for minor infractions has been happening in their school for YEARS and no one seemed to think it a big deal)</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that people jump all over themselves to justify the event because of who the victim and perpetrator are, despite the facts of the case.</p></li>
<li><p>The push for media to make this something people fight over due to race (the kids insist Officer Slam slams everyone and isn&#39;t specifically racist, so it&#39;s doubly interesting that racists are running around excusing the whole thing on the basis of the victim&#39;s race; note that they do say the teacher himself may have issues)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>On a less overarching conspiracy, the fact that the administration put out a bunch of misleading/incorrect information at the very beginning (no injuries, girl was disruptive, etc) is something we should take note of because it&#39;s so commonplace with news items - you see a lot of this re:shootings, riots, etc - they&#39;ll release a bunch of information that&#39;s wrong, everyone takes that as gospel, goes on with their lives. Then, once everyone&#39;s stopped paying attention, the truth comes out, but no one hears it, and the initial (knowingly, I believe) false reports are still the gospel truth as far as the public&#39;s concerned. Hey, like the Miami face eater - it was spice, right? Nope. Two undigested pills of who knows what because they won&#39;t release what it was.</p>

<p>I dunno, I feel like this story has a lot to chew on for the conspiratorially minded. And the point make_mind_free2go makes about whistleblowers/people who stand up for what&#39;s fair/right being arrested for doing the right thing is the biggest we keep forgetting.</p>

<p>Any one of you: what was her point? Doesn&#39;t that factor in? What WAS her point in all this? People get asked to leave all the time.

<p>And now a sub that used to deal with actual conspiracies is going down the SJW rabbit-hole whingeing on about bad cops.</p>

<p>I have no feelings to spare for these kids. They happily ruin any occasion or situation, because people like Reddit and the rest of the web have convinced them they have every right to make some absurd statement, regardless of the usefulness or even if they&#39;re in the right.</p>

<p>That is the difference. That officer should not have been in the class room in the first place.

<p>No. I listed several other methods which happen prior to the final escalation of assaulting a student.  I disagree with the officer&#39;s literal response, but am not writing off &#39;assault&#39; to force compliance. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say it was OK for the officer to do what he did at all. It seems like you&#39;re trying to paint me into a corner by misinterpreting my statements.

And furthermore, what level of respect must be given to the students who are there to behave properly and learn, vs the ones who are not?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So while we&#39;re waiting for the parents to arrive onsite to coddle their precious snowflake, 30 kids in class aren&#39;t learning. And that&#39;s if the parent makes it there in one class, if the student doesn&#39;t leave, that&#39;s more than one class that&#39;s impacted.</p>

<p>Relatedly, 3000 students have now been taught that they can do whatever they want: that they don&#39;t have to listen to teacher&#39;s, administrators nor police&#39;s instructions or demands, so the 30 kids per class not learning happens frequently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your rant is a little hard to follow, but lets go through it anyway.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s skip the asinine snowflake comment. You can still teach while one kid has their phone out, it&#39;s not like you as a teacher need to sit there and do nothing because one kid isn&#39;t listening. If the kid gets up to leave and goes to their next class there is no telling from this limited video how the kid will act. Maybe they will continue using their phone, maybe they won&#39;t, but I assume you are thinking the kid goes to a different room, that might be a point where the principal doesn&#39;t allow the student to go to the next class and they wait in the hall together. If the student stayed then the next class/student who&#39;s chair that is will probably get her to get up.  </p>

<p>3000 students is a pretty big jump, especially since we 1, have no idea of the school size and 2, have no idea how you even jumped to that number, maybe you had a 100 classes a day or 300 people in 10 classes, I know I didn&#39;t. The rest of that part of your rant I don&#39;t quite understand, something about kids not learning frequently cause you were a bad student in school or something. And something related to a cop, which when giving what could be deemed an unlawful order (there&#39;s no legal grounds for her dismissal from class from a law point of view) she doesn&#39;t need to obey. </p>

<p>She was on her phone..asked to stop.. Didn&#39;t.. Teacher asked to leave..didn&#39;t..
Another teacher/admin asked her to leave..didn&#39;t..
So the school resource officer comes and asks..didn&#39;t leave</p>

<p>....she is going to leave the room..since she wanted to protest and try to show her dominance..well we all know what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he student was caught using her phone in class. The teacher reprimanded her and she talked back to him in a way Lott called disrespectful. An assistant principal then entered the room and told the student to come to the office. When she refused, the administrator called Fields and asked him to remove the student from the class. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever she said wasn&#39;t audible to other kids in the class according to the other students, so it didn&#39;t disturb the class. Bringing a cop in disturbed the class, for sure.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still shocked that anyone defends this. If this happened in my school, we would&#39;ve been protesting for days. At this school, in 2015, black and white kids joined together to...walk out in solidarity for Officer Slam. (Hilariously, other kids told those kids that were Officer Slam still there, he&#39;d have slammed them for protesting for him and to get their asses back to class.)</p>

<p>The teacher is now faced with an authoritative decision to make.. Do nothing and give the power over to the students, or have the student removed from class. They tired the nice and polite way to remove the student, but she declined. She could have left when asked many times but refused. </p>

<p>Would it better if the cop told the kids to remove her from the class room and that however they did it the same way and physically removed her? Well now those other students could be in trouble.. It&#39;s all a shit storm.. Funny how this gets more attention then the kid killed in SC does..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We didn&#39;t have police in our schools, so no, I was never asked to leave class by the police and I never witnessed anyone else being asked to, either.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just completely stunned at how fast this country has changed. Police officers called into classrooms to eject kids using cellphones, and so many people working hard to justify how this is just how things are...I mean, what the heck? </p>

<p>Seriously, step back and really look at this situation. It&#39;s crazy. If you&#39;re young, which I&#39;m guessing, just pretend that people just a few years older had the freedom to do things like get up out of class without permission. Or ignore a teacher. Or doodle on paper while a teacher talked. Or refuse to answer a question. Or just be basically insubordinate. Insubordination is not a crime. I had a friend that had detention for an entire year of school, haha. And they kept tacking on to subsequent years! She&#39;s a productive member of society now. Not in <em>jail</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not young people&#39;s fault, though, it&#39;s my generation and the generation above mine&#39;s fault. We&#39;ve completely infantalized younger generations. I keep reading about kids in <em>college</em> trying to raise their hand in class to ask to go to the bathroom because they&#39;re not used to having the free will to be able to just stand up and leave the classroom. I have faith that the younger generations will fight back against this infantilization and prevail to self-sufficiency and questioning authority when it&#39;s clearly wrong, but when I jump into threads like this and see responses like yours and others in this thread, I get really, really worried.</p>

<p>If a parent calmly physically disciplines a child, hello CPS!</p>

<p>But if a police officer throws a child across the room in anger, respect mah authoritah.</p>

<p>It looks like, in this case, the officer was fired, so that&#39;s good. And it&#39;s forcing a discussion of something a lot of us didn&#39;t realize - the heavy police presence in schools and police being called for basic disobedience in schools. So that&#39;s also good.</p>

The desk, with the girl sitting in it, literally flew back off the ground and was slammed down hard, and that was just the beginning.  It was a ridiculous display by the officer.

<p>Power is responsibility.  How is it you can argue any different?  That cop had a TRIPLE resposibility that he FAILED.  He flipped out and used his strength against a young person, in a public school- 1; he abused his privilege as a police officer and a &quot;keeper of the peace&quot; when he ESCALATED the situation with an adolescent for god&#39;s sake- 2; and lastly, and worst, he failed to fulfill his responsibility as a ln adult among, basically, kids- 3.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Her misbehavior did not require someone from law enforcement to address it. This girl did not break any laws. She was using a cell phone (not illegal), the teacher probably got into a shouting match over it (not illegal) and decided that the kid was disrupting class (not illegal). </p>

<p>The real problem started when the school decided to use a police officer to intervene in a school disciplinary matter. These resource officers are not there to enforce the authority of the teachers, they are there to investigate school crimes and provide a safer environment for the students. This cop decided that refusing to leave a classroom and/or follow his non-legal directives was reason enough to manhandle this child. This was obviously the wrong move on his part because he ended up getting fired over it.</p>

<p>This could be part of the school-to-prison pipeline conspiracy that many people espouse. It also speaks to the reality that filming cops (not illegal) or disagreeing with them (not illegal) can get you arrested. Therefore, it is relevant to this sub.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t even try the &quot;publicity stunt&quot; argument as it has no bearing on this event. The clock incident was a completely different kind of situation, and there are many differences. Ahmed was being investigated for an actual crime, and his family had some interesting political aspects. This event involved a black kid getting thrown to the ground by a white cop for being obstinate. She didn&#39;t break any laws, and the media uproar is nothing more than a symptom of the current racial tensions between cops and black people. If this was a white male kid, it would not be a story, and we would not be having this conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In schools, it&#39;s not so much things being &quot;illegal&quot; as against the rules. And most of the things you mention are in fact against the rules in most schools. And they do in fact have policy in place and state law in some states that says they can bring in cops for &quot;disruption&quot; or other specific things. </p>

<p>I am not saying any of this is right/good; I&#39;m saying you may be unaware of the laws and the grey areas in school discipline.</p>

<p>Events like this are bringing more of these policies, and their subjective interpretation, to people&#39;s attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my point though. It&#39;s not in the SRO&#39;s job description or within his legal mandate to enforce the authority of a teacher. It may be that way in some areas, but as far as I know that is not the case at this HS. Even the police chief said the school should have handled it themselves.</p>

<p>Either way, this kid was not causing a disruption. Definitely not a disruption that required the use of force. She had her phone out during class and the teacher went on a power trip and made a big deal out of it in the middle of class. If you watch the video you can clearly see that she was sitting calmly in her desk the entire time until the SRO slammed her and threw her across the room like a ragdoll. Even if she was in a state where the SRO was responsible for removing disruptive students, this was inappropriate use of force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you may be correct; some of us feel that &quot;someone/some group&quot; wants to start a racial war.</p>

<p>many people feel that the US is becoming a police state. evidently before this cop was fired he had other complaints about his abusive behavior. i was surprised that people immediately defended the cop, assuming the girl &quot;deserved&quot; to be thrown to the floor. this child was placed in a foster home, the original story said she lost her mother &amp; grandmother, now her attorney says they are alive, but the girl is in foster care. </p>

<p>she didn&#39;t leave the class when asked, so a cop was called. you should know that many schools have police officers in schools. yes, i&#39;m sure some students can get out of hand, but this is <em>a girl</em> who in my opinion is dealing with some emotional trauma (i&#39;m not a teacher/nurse or in medical but my intuition was right). i feel very bad for her. </p>

<p>i think the media is winning by making people desensitized to violence &amp; there is propaganda saying that police are under attack, which isn&#39;t true. many people have been killed by police in the US for minor offenses or for nothing.</p>

<p>i&#39;m not white; i heard an adult white man say that he is afraid to drive his car now. that proves to me that police behavior is effecting everyone.</p>

<p>if you&#39;ve read some of the responses to this post you&#39;ll see that most didn&#39;t realize that the article is about <em>another</em> student that spoke up against what the cop was doing &amp; she wasn&#39;t violent in any way.</p>

<p>i remind myself this is the 21st century, but it doesn&#39;t feel like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Teacher here. IMHO:</p>

<p>How about a discipline protocol that brings in a counselor before bringing in a police officer?</p>

<p>Kid strangely refusing to cooperate with simple request 
&amp;/or kid refusing to participate = kid having bad day.
(Possibly a really bad day that s/he can&#39;t talk about.)</p>

<p>It took me some years to learn the delicate balance of dealing with this kind of situation productively without escalating nor &quot;losing control.&quot; 
(Usually best to: ignore misbehavior for now if at all possible; follow up later. And often, find out the real problem later and actually help the kid and see better behavior from then on.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not easy and it&#39;s not something one usually learns in teacher prep nor staff development, and it&#39;s the kind of thing administrators give poor guidance about. </p>

<p>(School discipline codes are always handled subjectively, mostly because it&#39;d be impossible to actually consistently prosecute all the technical rule-breaking. EG Lots of teachers give up trying to prevent kids using their phones to listen to music as long as class continues etc. Never mind dress codes.)</p>

<p>The SRO thing (campus officer) is a strange relationship that varies by district and campus, but administration takes the lead or sets the norm. Bad SRO ~= bad administration.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: Teacher in this situation made a bad call, but needed different kind of support.</p>

<p>The girl was sitting quietly at her desk according to kids in her class. They claim they didn&#39;t even know what she did wrong. She was a new kid and never talked.</p>

<p>Apparently, students and ex-students are less surprised that this happened (because they claim to have witnessed similar behavior in the past) than it actually got caught on video. Just awful. That teacher needs his license revoked, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True colors shown. How do you live with yourself with so much nasty-assed racism burning shit through your skin?</p>

<p>Officer Slam (yes, that&#39;s what these kids called him) needs to be off the streets, he&#39;s got a long record: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/army-vet-recalls-rough-encounter-sc-dep-ben-fields-article-1.2412418">http://www.nydailynews.com/army-vet-recalls-rough-encounter-sc-dep-ben-fields-article-1.2412418</a>. And that teacher needs to be gone if this is how he reacts when a kid won&#39;t speak up in his class. </p>

<p>Kids in her class <a href="https://archive.is/4Rxtd">didn&#39;t even know what she did wrong</a> when Officer Slam showed up, so obviously she wasn&#39;t disrupting the class. But I&#39;d say throwing her across the room definitely disrupted the class.</p>

<p>Bet you wouldn&#39;t be sucking authority&#39;s privates so hard if it was your daughter he slammed. This guy was notorious among the kids - they claim he once slammed a pregnant woman. Also, saw multiple students on Twitter claim he isn&#39;t racist, said he&#39;d slam <em>anyone</em>, black, white, middle eastern, hispanic. So yeah, enjoy your racism, you or your kid would&#39;ve gotten slammed by this dude, too.</p>

<p>Not an environment conducive to education.</p>

<p>Some people think that police target blacks.</p>

<p>Some people believe that police target whites and blacks equally but the media only shows it when it happens to blacks.</p>

<p>Some people believe that blacks &quot;deserve&quot; what they get.</p>

<p>Those are 3 separate opinions that would come from people of wildly different beliefs.</p>

<p>I personally believe there is a media narrative to frame police as racist abusers perpetuating &quot;institutional racism&quot; (in a country with Black President, Black Attorney General, Black Mayors, Black House Representatives, etc etc)</p>

<p>The media is controlled by the government to present this narrative.</p>

<p>If anything a white kid would receive no coverage, no race-riots, no protests.</p>

<p>That white kid buying/selling weed finally had the police video released the other day. While I think they probably could have let him escape and just showed up at his house later to arrest him, I ended up basically thinking &quot;well he drove his car towards a cop with his gun out, what did he expect?&quot;  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I still think there are better ways of handling this, instead of escalating infinitely on someone who is being stubborn and saying no to everything.</p>

<p>Society is far too quick to lay the smack down in minor incidents. Why should we encourage overreaction in our children? That was a classroom full of kids, and they thought it was a good idea to show them that violence solves problems.</p>

<p>This could have been a big growing moment for everyone in that room, if they had just brought someone in to talk to the girl.</p>

<p>If someone just throws their hands up and decide to call the police because a student <em>doesn&#39;t want to leave the classroom</em>, then that person is probably too jaded and should stop teaching.</p>

<p>Teaching is more than just instructing on a subject. Teaching is about being a role model and preparing our progeny for the real world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the question to you then is &quot;how long to you let her sit there disrupting class and you do nothing?&quot; an hour, 2 hours, half a day? </p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t quick. Again, she was asked and told to stop and then leave the room by a teacher then the principal who had to be called down, then by the school officer who had to be called down. There was no &quot;quick&quot; about this.</p>

<p>She was talked to, by 3 different adults who she decided to ignore and then strike out at. This was a teaching moment...if you disobey your teacher and principal and then refuse to obey/strike at an officer who orders you to do something in a school or classroom, you will be physically removed and arrested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She pulled her phone out for a few seconds, I think a detention is a just punishment for that. Tell her that every time she pulls her phone out, she&#39;ll get a detention. How hard is that? This kind of discipline system is already in place, why not use it?</p>

<p>Also, the three individuals that talked to her were all authority figures that were ordering her to leave the classroom. And all three failed. Maybe they were doing something wrong? Why did it have to escalate that way in the first place?</p>

<p>I would have told her to see me after class, and then ask her if something was wrong, or if she wanted to talk, or if she wanted to see a counselor during my next class, instead of attending the lesson.</p>

<p>This is a SCHOOL, we&#39;re talking about here. The people there should be trying to HELP kids, not beat them into submission.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you would just let her continue disrupting class, threatening people and cussing? </p>

<p>sorry no, that&#39;s not how you deal with this. and if you&#39;re truly trying to help kids, by your method you&#39;re ignoring all the others in the class that aren&#39;t being disruptive and there to actually learn. You want to help kids? remove the problem child and you deal with them outside of the classroom so that you can HELP ALL THE OTHER KIDS learn.</p>

<p>And she wasn&#39;t beaten into submission you drama queen. </p>

<p>Again, this was going on for 40 minutes and it wasn&#39;t just her using her phone quietly, she was yelling, cussing out others, threatening the teacher etc. She was purposely stopping the entire class and being a little bitch. SHE escalated it, the 3 authority figures are just that, the authority that you teach your children to respect and obey because it IS A SCHOOL. They simply did what was necessary when she escalated things. Remember, she was the one who struck out physically first at the officer. You do that and you&#39;ve assaulted someone. You&#39;re going to be taken down, cuffed and removed. </p>

<p>Just a question. Did you see a different video or are we talking about the same one? (I saw a young woman defending herself against an attacker who was putting his arm around her neck. (please input your twisted logic to justify) And no i no longer see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6j2aYmRCGg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">badges as authority</a>. I have human compassion.  They can wear a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochise_County_Cowboys">red sash</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_signal">throw gang signals / wearing a badge it easier </a>.That way we can see what they really are. Another question. Would you be OK with the principal slamming her to the ground like that? I mean when my child disobeys me i put him in a choke hold and slam him to the ground then drag him to his room............ seriously if that last statement was true what would happen to a father who said that let alone get caught on video doing it? BUT WAIT he had a badge..................</p>

<p>The funniest part about all this is that the news likes to run stories where it&#39;s &quot;not really&quot; anything the cop really did wrong, or at least it&#39;s strongly debatable by both sides (to create more buzz &amp; controversy and run further stories/ exclusive interviews)</p>

<p>meanwhile real abuse by cops rarely makes the news, because everyone would just agree the cop was fucked up and it could lead to people actually agreeing on changing something, but that doesn&#39;t give enough views so it&#39;s left out</p>

<p>i guess the real conspiracy is the stupidity of the average person</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can always talk, and I&#39;m sure the teacher or administration would&#39;ve talked with her had she listened and stepped out of the classroom when asked repeatedly. Instead she chose insubordination and was placed under arrest. When you are being placed under arrest cops have the authority to do so with what means are necessary. As pointed out by others, she flipped her own desk and made it worse then it should&#39;ve been. Should the cop have thrown her after? No probably not but the point here is that if she had just done as asked and respected proper authority, this wouldn&#39;t be an issue.

He could easily have scooted the desk, embarrassingly out of the room, and done more for impact then on her behavior, by embarrassing her, then he ever will be slamming her into the floor. </p>

<p>All slamming her into the floor teaches is that she was right to deny that individual because he was evil and violent, willing to hurt me for defying him, and that I can be hurt for defying. </p>

<p>If she is brave enough to take hurt for defying which she apparently is, that will lead into either criminal or advocate behavior, I pray it is the latter. </p>

<p>Dragging the desk out though, embarrasses her in front of her peers, shows her that the strong can have compassion, and that it isn&#39;t necessarily pain that will be her teacher, but the compassionate hand that corrects. </p>

<p>Especially when dealing with minors for gods sake, I hate to use the catch phrase but &quot;think of the children.&quot;  </p>

<p>Also, I second the call for that teacher to be fired, he stood by and WATCHED a student be assaulted. He never raised a voice of protest, and smiled... He has no place teaching anyone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently that place needs an overhaul, but not because of this situation. He didn&#39;t attack anyone and he certainly didn&#39;t &quot;slam&quot; anything. She was given all the out she needed to take and still refused. It&#39;s not the teacher or cops job to just stand around. The rules say you don&#39;t get to use your phone. You will be kicked out of class and sent to the office. Then she refuses to move....... so she got tossed. Oh well. Why does everyone have to stand around or just repeat that she needs to leave??? She wont until you move her. So she got moved. She could have listened and went to the office. She chose this. A cop didn&#39;t kick in the door and say &quot;It&#39;s time to chew gum and remove random black girls......oh shit.....I&#39;m all out of gum!&quot;</p>

<p>Having spent my years in these schools, some kids need to get tossed. Most kids don&#39;t push something that far, but on rare occasions, 1 will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact of the matter is that this was done because she wanted control. Kids don&#39;t have control over anything. That&#39;s why they strike out and why it takes a million different forms. In this case, she took control from the teacher by completely disregarding the rules and then disregarding the consequences of her breaking those rules. Control is needed in the classroom, or shit breaks down fast. The teacher needs her to leave. You don&#39;t &quot;just ignore it and keep going&quot;. Next week 4 more kids are on their phones and DGAF because if they just refuse, you can&#39;t do shit. You already showed them that you wont do anything. We have had teachers go home bawling because we took control. I have literally been a part of it with teachers I hated because they wouldn&#39;t let me do what I wanted. Being young and from a broken home can make you do shitty things, but it was my way of having some form of control. Kind of like why cutters cut.</p>

<p>So the teacher calls for help. That help also fails. Now the girl is probably looking at a 2 day suspension. They call the school cop. You are correct when stating &quot;it&#39;s not a cops job to &#39;teach them respect&#39; if that were the case kids would be getting beat downs everyday.&quot; It is the cops job to ignore all of that shit and do what needs to be done. The teacher can&#39;t touch her. It wouldn&#39;t be a stretch today if that was considered rape. So the cop has to do cop things. She STILL REFUSES to go about it in the logical and peaceful manner that normal people would. Now he&#39;s gonna take her out of the seat and walk her out. Nope. Now she flips shit and flails around. He no longer has to give a fuck. He gets to answer with the next step that SHE requires which is getting tossed out.</p>

<p>The only thing that got hurt here was her pride and social status in a high school. All of this was done by HER. Cop would have never had a chance to walk in the door if she had even the SLIGHTEST respect for the teacher or classmates and left when told. She chose to make everyone in this situation have to turn shit up to 10. If I decide to do a &quot;peaceful protest&quot; in an area that does not allow me to sit in it, like......the street, they will ask me to move. Then they will tell me to move. Then they will call someone to tell me to move. Then they will come over to me in order to move me. Then I&#39;ll flip shit about being  touched. Then they will toss me out of the street. Am I just supposed to hope the cop is white so I can make it a race thing and everyone forgets what an idiot I am?</p>

<p>Every single video of this gets cut shorter and shorter so it looks like the cop walked in and chose a random student to fuck with. Every description gets more and more racial. the longer this goes on, the worse it will get because you guys LOVE this shit. I watched the original. Cop is fine. The girl needs counseling so they can figure out why she is lashing out at authority. A million says it&#39;s the parents or lack of.</p>

<p>Just accept that I have a different opinion. You will not change it. I have seen the videos. I have been a part of that stuff. I completely understand why it happened to me when it did and I completely understand why it happened to her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand by my point, if the girl had been a different color, the situation wouldn&#39;t even hit media radar. Mainly because a white girl wouldn&#39;t have been thrown around a room like a rag doll, no matter how snotty she got. Ever.
There is no logical reasoning to ever have a cop enter a classroom to eject a student that is sitting in her desk. However asinine the words are coming out if her mouth. No.
All that needed to be done was gently take her by the arm and lead her outside, even if she is hitting the officer, she&#39;s a 16yo girl. He&#39;s more than capable if handling himself in a professional manner, and clearly didn&#39;t and hasn&#39;t for a number of years.
Bottom line, the school fucked up by not vetting him on his past behavior. There is no possible reason for an officer with history of violence to be in a school.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>she refused to stop using cell, then she started cussing out the teacher and yelling.</p>

<p>Teacher asked her repeatedly to then leave classroom and she refused.</p>

<p>Principal then came in and repeatedly asked her to leave, she kept going and refused.</p>

<p>Officer was called in and he repeatedly told her to leave and she refused and as another video shows, she swung and kicked at the officer.</p>

<p>So at that point the officer removed her from the classroom. </p>

<p>The teacher, the principal and many of the students in the room have all stated on record that what he did was appropriate considering her actions and stand by him.</p>

<p>As an ex-cop, he did it right. He went through the steps that officers are trained for and what he did was not &quot;brutality&quot;, he and others asked then told her to stop, then asked and told her to leave, and when she refused and then went to strike the officer, he then went to &quot;hands on&quot; as is standard procedure and removed her. </p>

<p>btw, she&#39;s 17. as we have now seen in another episode just yesterday at another school, a kid bodyslammed a principal breaking up a fight. You can join the military at 18 and fight in wars and kill people so this whole &quot;she was just a little kid&quot; argument is bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a kid. Married a cop, uncle is a detective, and father in law is a cop. They are the ones who convinced me the situation would never happen under their watch. Why? Because they are responsible men. Fathers, husbands, and level headed. They also like their jobs, which is why they don&#39;t act like that meathead did. 
Teaching a lesson maybe what she needed, but not assault.</p>

The point is she didn&#39;t break any laws prior to the cop showing up. Him attacking her and demanding she go with him <em>is</em> optional. She didn&#39;t break any laws prior to his attack. She should face no charges, since he was fired for his actions. It&#39;s not against the law to be a shitty shit head kid. Her parents or guardians are responsible for handling her insubordination against school policy, not police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She&#39;s 16 years old, not 17.</p>

<p>Can you source the claim that she was cussing out the teacher and yelling and other students saying he &quot;did right?&quot; </p>

<p>All accounts I&#39;ve been able to find by students claim she was quiet and pulled out her phone. And that the teacher was mad because she wouldn&#39;t say anything/answer his questions. It&#39;s likely there are multiple stories, would like to get the full one with sources. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify, the person above me is stone cold lying. One of her classmates says <a href="https://archive.is/4Rxtd">they didn&#39;t even know what she was doing wrong before the police came in.</a>. Turns out, she was <em>chewing gum?</em></p>

<p>Hope gets a good college education personally paid for by the officer and the teacher.</p>

They&#39;d just give up and leave her alone? The things police officers have to deal with on a day to day basis, this officer doeesn&#39;t know this girl.

    <div class="md"><p>You know what I wish happened? All the kids stood up with their phones and said, &quot;We&#39;re recording this. What you did was not right.&quot; Like that situation in the bus where everyone stood up and told the police officer going after a homeless woman in the crowded bus with his gun out to put his gun away.</p>

<p>I know no one wants to get involved in anything anymore, but if we all did, it really might help de-escalate some of these events.</p>

<p>What really struck me about this one was the teacher just standing there and the boy with his head down. The one girl who spoke up was arrested - but if everyone stood and calmly spoke up, that&#39;s a lot of damned paperwork that police don&#39;t really like doing. I don&#39;t think people realize that, but it needs to happen if we really want to stop this craziness. There&#39;s power in calm solidarity.</p>

<p>There are progressive steps here: the teacher asks her to leave and she refused so he calls the office who sends the officer who first asks her to leave and she refused.  Then she strikes him.  </p>

<p>So how is that not following what you said happened in your schools? Did the people being &quot;escorted&quot; out fight back?</p>

More importantly, it doesn&#39;t give her the opportunity to react, which ensures the officers safety.

    <div class="md"><p>Teacher here. IMHO:</p>

<p>How about a discipline protocol that brings in a counselor before bringing in a police officer?</p>

<p>Kid strangely refusing to cooperate with simple request 
&amp;/or kid refusing to participate = kid having bad day.
(Possibly a really bad day that s/he can&#39;t talk about.)</p>

<p>It took me some years to learn the delicate balance of dealing with this kind of situation productively without escalating nor &quot;losing control.&quot; 
(Usually best to: ignore misbehavior for now if at all possible; follow up later. And often, find out the real problem later and actually help the kid and see better behavior from then on.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s not easy and it&#39;s not something one usually learns in teacher prep nor staff development, and it&#39;s the kind of thing administrators give poor guidance about. </p>

<p>(School discipline codes are always handled subjectively, mostly because it&#39;d be impossible to actually consistently prosecute all the technical rule-breaking. EG Lots of teachers give up trying to prevent kids using their phones to listen to music as long as class continues etc. Never mind dress codes.)</p>

<p>The SRO thing (campus officer) is a strange relationship that varies by district and campus, but administration takes the lead or sets the norm. Bad SRO ~= bad administration.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: Teacher in this situation made a bad call, but needed different kind of support.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, that&#39;s one route.....technically they DID try and cut it off from the start by making phones a &quot;no-no&quot;. When you decide to get on your phone, you get kicked to the office and they can deal with it. It&#39;s a 10 second process to remove the offending party. This kid decided to do whatever she wanted to do. Eventually the cop got called in after the other crap. She still refused to move. She got tossed. Oh well. </p>

<p>Having spent my years in these schools, some kids need to get tossed. Most kids don&#39;t push something that far, but on rare occasions, 1 will.</p>
