       Honestly, after seeing what radiant heat can do to metal, no. I don't believe any of the 9/11 conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember one of our maint guys had accidentally left a spanner (wrench) in one of the kilns after working on something. That kiln only ran up to 1200 degrees.  In any case, once he removed it, you could break it with little to no effort.  However it hadn't really been directly affected, and at a glance seemed fine (if a bit dulled).  The heat had simply burned the carbon out of it, and in doing so rendered it unable to hold any strength. It hadn't melted though, which was important.

       (the above is a nist document on the mechanical properties of steel)
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever the case, it's worth noting that the shear point of structural steel is .75 tons per square inch. This is the amount of pressure exerted over a specific area required to cause the steel to sheer, or to tear. This is a standard across all types of steel, with cast elements like cast iron having a higher shear tonnage.

       even if it melted those few near the plane strikes that doesnt explain the freefall collapse or how the pits burned for months.

       One of the things about 7 that people often forget, is that the building had the NYPD command center for emergencies in it. One of the floors, I forget which, was taken up by massive diesel fuel tanks which was used to supply power to a generation facility in the building.  The idea being that if power went off in the rest of the city, then the command center would be able to produce its own power.

       I know you may not know or can't say even if you did... but there is a treaty banning WMD's from deployment in orbit/space. In your opinion is that treaty likely being adhered to, or not? Secondly, how much weaponry (non WMD) would you "guess" is in orbit/space, some? a lot? or more-than-enough aka shitloads?

       I think that the WMD thing is being adhered to, in as much as you don't see nuclear missiles hanging around up there; however beyond that, I can't say. Not that I'm not allowed to, but rather that I'm not certain.

       I do know that it's possible to de-orbit something like a GPS sat and drop it pretty much where ever you would want.  While most of it would burn up in orbit, there would still be enough material there to level a small city on impact.  So, it kinda makes me think that what would be the point of sticking a WMD up there, when you have dozens if not more handy sats you could plunk on something?

       A small city.  It's based around the idea of kinetic energy rounds.  Keep in mind, that giant crater out in the desert, the meteor that made it was  about 150 feet across.  The crater it made is one mile across and 500 feet deep.  Your average GPS sat is about 20 feet across.  While it wouldn't create as much a crater, the energy released from such a hit would equal the force from the Hiroshima bomb.

       Entirely possible, and common really.  From a simple technology point of view, Radar itself is actually VERY limited in what it can and can not detect.  Meaning that once you get under a certain altitude (usually in the 2000 foot range) whatever's up there simply won't show up on radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Let me clarify. First I was eating and kinda gave you a short answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, to explain, even though the radar waves go out, in many ways they're like light. Meaning they go in a straight direction.  They don't really angle up, or down that much.  At a certain altitude, like I said, in the 2000 foot range, you start running into situations where background noise becomes a problem.  You might shoot out a beam, only to have it strike a structure, tree, hill, mountain, or cloud.  It comes beaming back and you've suddenly got a ghost return.  Meaning that any aircraft flying below this, while not actually OFF radar as you might expect, is instead lost in the background clutter.  What makes things worse, is in some cases military strikes have been known to use known civ corridors (we saw the side effect of this in the Ukraine), in an effort to fool the radar techs into thinking that they're seeing a commercial flight.

       Are there any conspiracies that you personally think are more likely real given your insider info?

       I think its more that there are some that I suspect are red herrings.  I worked pretty extensively with high temperature kilns (2800 degrees F) that were used to make various ceramics parts.  It didn't take me long to note that these things could not only be used as crematoria, but would render anything inside them to less than ash.  Considering their size, you could reasonably destroy eighty to 100 bodies in a single go.  Based on this I started looking closer at the FEMA concentration camp theories and more and more found that they seemed "too good to be true" in numerous aspects.  Meaning they seemed more to be a red herring than anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some that do intrigue me, which seem viable in relative terms.  One being the fact that some of what we were making relied on technology that even the engineers noted "we don't really know WHY this works."  The R2A aspect of things went through a sudden leap in technology around the start of WW2, going from using natural crystals to complex piezoelectric (ceramic) systems with little to no moving parts.  It just seems strange that such a sudden leap would be made, with no sudden announcement in regards to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This really makes me wonder just where such technology came from.  The fact that now we have sensor systems which have no moving parts, but are able to pick up even the most minute sounds...well it does make you wonder.

       I can't talk about that, but only because of family ties to that whole scenario.  The TLDR of it: One of my third cousins was, at the time of Roswell, the lead civilian in charge of the skunk works at Wright-Patterson.

       There's a split.  You have guys like me who were there just for the paycheck, or because they really had no other options.  Then, on the other side you have people who...how do I put this? They know that there's more going on, and could care less but it would take effort.

       It would make sense for the CIA to be toying around with that.  There's the whole Polybius thing from the early 80's that had their fingerprints all over it.

       I'm not sure myself.  I know for a fact that around that time the CIA were poking around with mind altering drugs and how they might be used to affect soldiers...so it stands to reason that they may have tried something.

       One of the top comments has him basically saying "9/11 wasn't an inside job because of a kiln getting hot" and that he doesn't believe in any conspiracy theories.

       Conspiracy theories are just going against what we're told as truth, how can there be none? That's infinitely more of an absurd statement than there being conspiracies.

       Yes.  Most of the rank and file such as me, know that some of what we're doing isn't what I'd call in the best interests of the nation; but the problem is there isn't a whole hell of a lot we can do about it.  In the past month, no less than six people have left over ethical concerns. Some in regards to a change in policy in regards to hiring, but one just before me from the same area who had a similar issue to mine.

       Wouldn't do us any good.  The press tend to like the companies we work with, and are willing to cover up any major problems.  Case in point, at another site (not mine, nor did I have control over its waste water system) it was discovered that they were leeching heavy metals like mercury into the ground water.  This stuff was turning up in the city water systems, and people were getting severely sick.  Yet, the only thing that was ever reported was the fact that the city in question would be on bottled water for over a YEAR, even though their water system was given a clean bill of health.

       Have you heard of Thomas Drake? No? That's why no one else goes public, goes to the press, or takes legal action.

       If you have heard of him, well, the point remains the same. Nothing will happen, the only people who will get in trouble are the whistleblowers. It's like one man or a small group trying to go up against the mafia by 'going to the media' or 'taking them to court'...the only thing that happens is the mafia destroys them.

       Well, to start off, an Israeli company has discovered a cure for brain cancer which works off of microburst sonar.  The company (owned by the Israeli government) goes by the name "novocure."  The treatment itself is VERY expensive (tens of thousands of dollars per treatment), but it's 99% effective at killing brain cancer.  It's so effective that the FDA waived the typical 10 year test period after two years to push it into full production.

       On the other side of things, several Nato countries are taking orders of new Mk54 torpedoes.  These torpedoes are primarily anti submarine torpedoes, however they can be used for anti surface.  What makes them so unnerving is the Mk54 is able to be programmed with the blade count of a specific ship, and will avoid any escort vessels.  Supposedly, the torpedo can be fired into a port, where it will sink to the bottom and lie in wait up to a month before going for its pre programmed target.

       Here's the thing, I can tell you that the Keshe stuff is just snake oil. However I can also tell you that there is a true clean energy/free energy thing that would work; but no nation wants to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Piezoelectrics are unique ceramics which, when under pressure, they generate electrical current.  The higher the pressure, the higher the current.   If you put a current to them, they vibrate. (granted you can't really see or feel this, but they do it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If a country wanted to create true free, and perfectly clean electricity, then all they would need do is submerge several miles of piezoelectric ceramic cables (or something similar) on the bottom of the ocean.  The pressure alone would create enough energy to run a city.  Granted, you would need a very LARGE area of coverage to do this, but the end result would be electricity which cost nothing to generate, and produced zero pollution, as well as had zero environmental impact.

       So, how large exactly?  I mean if a person had some of these cables, installed them into a large air compressor and pressurized it, how much current would it make?  Like say you have a big 120 gallon air compressor with as much cable as you could fit into it, then you closed it up and put pressure on it....how much are we talking about?  I know, I just asked the exact same question in two ways. so sue me.

       Well, that's a hard question.  It depends on the size of the ceramic involved.  Typically, you're actually talking something that's rather small.  So in the 2 inch diameter range.  Usually smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example of applications in this area is the electric cigarette lighter, where pressing a button causes a spring-loaded hammer to hit a piezoelectric crystal, thereby producing a sufficiently high voltage that electric current flows across a small spark gap, heating and igniting the gas. Most types of gas burners and ranges have a built-in piezo based injection systems.

       I was just curious if this was something that could be adapted to be an in home generator or something.  I'm clueless about this stuff and its applications.  I figured, pressurized cables=get electricity...but on this scale I'm assuming it probably won't make enough to run the compressor itself.

       For example:  Los Angeles covers 500 sq miles (I think).  A 500 sq mile grid, granted would take a long time to construct.  But that grid would provide clean, cheap (let's face it, no one's going to build it if they can't make money off it) electricity for 18 million people.  Can you imagine the environmental impact and cost savings by powering just one city this way?

       Yeah. Even if the system was only used for certain cities, such as large ones like LA, or NYC, then the overall offset to the environment would be considerable. Plus, the worst case scenario for it would be needing to fix a cable or something. No 3 mile island, Fukishima, or Chernobyl.

       My understanding of this type of power generation is that it requires changing mechanical stress and not the constant stress that undersea cables would provide. DARPA dropped it's soldier boots that harvested electricity from simple walking due to discomfort. Well, they publicly dropped it while it may have gone dark.

       I was in college at the time, and I've only heard about it in passing. However it seemed like the whole thing that was being proposed was to use a varying depth type scenario. Meaning that the system would vary its depth by only a few meters over the span of a day to create the electric charge.

       Not a question for me. But, id just like to point out that at this point, Russia and China couldn't deal with a war against NATO/other US allies. Militarily they're outmatched, but more importantly they couldn't keep up economically. They'd fall apart after a while.

       I honestly can't answer the first. I could guess, but that would just be a guess and it wouldn't help.
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer the second, I think rather considerably, but through proxy. I know just recently, ITT was hit with a number of serious sanctions after it was discovered they had been illegally transporting classified materials (it does not specify what these were) out of the country.  This wasn't the first time something similar had happened. Though it's from a communist blog/website, here's a previous incident.

       The second is an article that goes into some detail of the past transgressions.

       Quote the above:

      <p>
       The defense argued that by supplying weapons components to the US, EDO is in breach of the Cluster Munitions Prohibitions Act of 2010, which makes it illegal in UK law to assist the use of cluster munitions anywhere in the world. The act is the UK implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions, an international treaty adopted in Dublin in 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       (note: EDO was Exelis. The name changed sometime in 2010 I think.)

       thanks for trying, it must be pretty disheartening for any "whistleblower" to try to 'come out' with their experience in any way when this is the type of response they get.

       I've been watching
       <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts">
        this page
       </a>
       for a while, the DoD spending reports. Basically every weekday the DoD publishes the public contracts awarded. On most days there are half a billion dollars awarded. Yesterday was a light day around 582 million. It isn't uncommon to see several billion dollars get awarded in a single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of this is maintenance for things that we own like repairs to ships, etc., and nearly all of it could be argued that these are American jobs. But I do get frustrated when I see new weaponry contracts, money being spent to build weapons that (I feel) no one should be making.
      </p>
      <p>
       On most days I'm outraged at the amount of money being spent, especially when major media runs a big campaign that focuses on some big scandal where a much smaller amount is involved. IE: we committed to spending 1.5 Billion dollars today on weapons we shouldn't be buying, but oh hey, this politician just stole $75,000, so pitchforks!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any thoughts in general about DoD spending? I would imagine that this only represents a part of the spending that actually occurs. Would a "black ops" project be listed here too? I would guess not, but I'm curious.

       Black projects, such as the old project for the SR71, are not part of any official budget.  There's a "fund" of sorts that's they use to give money to projects, without actually specifically putting information out about just what those projects were.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my old company email, we'd get this list of various projects that the company had managed to secure. Some of them made a great deal of sense, such as the production of a new type of sonogram equipment that has better definition.  Other times, you were left really wondering what the point was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I'm located there are two sites. One does the Piezoelectrics, while another does carbon fiber parts for aircraft. I remember a few months back how the company announced how proud they were to have secured a contract to make a portion of the F-35's weapons launch system.  The contract was easily a billion dollar contract. Problem was, that launch system really didn't work as intended. While yes, portions of it worked, as a whole the system just couldn't be made to do what it was supposed to; and thus was going to end up costing the government billions more to fix.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's stuff like that that really bothered me.  I could understand pouring all manner of dollars into major weapons systems, if those systems actually worked like they were supposed to. HOWEVER, when you plunk money down like there's no tomorrow on something that you're not 100% sure is going to work in the first place? It just doesn't make sense to me. It never did, and it never will.  Let me see if I can drag up a good example for you.

       Ok, I was there when this one came across our news. It was also one of the ones that seriously bothered me.  It's a weapons deployment module for an unmanned drone. There are some advances to it, not the least of which being a far lighter construction than the standard type. Now on one hand you could argue that this would let the drone fly longer with the same amount of fuel. On the other hand, it seems to me that it would allow the drone to carry more weaponry, since the light weight of the deployment system would offset any added on munitions.

       The ethic violation came over a long term issue. Basically, the supervisor I had would routinely single out employees and tell them that they quote "weren't a good fit" or that they needed to quit. He would also contact them on their personal phones for this same reason.  In my case, he was outright telling me that I was the reason the department looked bad, and was adding on far more job duties than I was supposed to have. I was a waste water tech who helped out with other duties. However he expected me to either work extra hours (for no pay), or he would refuse my PTO even though I had valid hours for it.

       I don't know off hand, but I do remember hearing something about a software issue that was tied to the China hacks.  It was never confirmed, but the general agreement was that the Chinese had somehow corrupted several key computer systems.  Beyond that, I have no actual first hand knowledge.  As I noted, I worked primarily in Waste treatment, as well as some in production.

       That was near us, but no. We had nothing to do with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, waste treatment deals with the water used during production.  Mostly you're talking water that is being used to cool parts during cutting, but also water which was used to clean areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would go on duty at 9pm (though I would arrive earlier).  Once on site, my first task was to take a status of all the systems which I monitored, including temperatures of various production kilns, and the numerous water sensors.  The kilns, though not directly part of my job, were an important part so they relied on operations (my actual job title) to monitor them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I had the status down, knowing that all the systems were working properly, I would take a sample reading from the settling tanks, as well as the holding pond.  This sample was tested for the presence of numerous types of heavy metals, and would go in a log.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every hour, I would repeat the process of taking samples, and testing. I also took time to check water usage, how much we were recycling back into the system, and how much was being discharged from the holding pond into the municipal treatment system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holding pond itself held water that had been treated no less than two times, and was actually potable (drinkable) though it lacked things like chlorine and flouride.

       Interesting.  Can you say anything about what you were producing?  Weapons/vehicles I assume?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you found that there was a high level of heavy metals in the water you sampled what would your next course of action be?  Were you checking to ensure they stayed below a certain level or were you just logging the results?
      </p>
      <p>
       How was it decided how much water was recycled and how much was put through the municipal treatment system?  What was the ideal balance (if there was one)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you saying that the holding pond water remained potable even after it was used to cool the parts during cutting?

       Sonar and sensor systems primarily.
      </p>
      <p>
       We tried to keep the usual concentrations at .005 parts per million.  The standard for municipal systems, as set by the EPA is .1 parts per million.  So higher standards than your average tap water.
      </p>
      <p>
       The water we recycled would go into the cooling and parts cutting, but it was not returned to the holding pond until well after the treatment process.  The pond itself was just a place to hold the excess water after the secondary treatment. By that point it was just a matter of how full the pond was, and how much water we had taken in through regular use.  If for example, it had rained recently, we'd let out a few thousand gallons of water to keep the level from overflowing.  On the other hand, if it was a particularly dry season, we'd hold the water back so it meant we didn't put as much a strain on the municipal system.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really wasn't any one deciding factor for it, though it averaged out to a 1:1 ratio. So, for every one we used, we tried to put one back.  This didn't always happen, of course, but we still tried.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, almost missed the question of what I would do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I found that there was a high level of heavy metals, I would immediately shut the site down. All production, regardless of whether it used water or not, would stop.  Any discharge would also stop, and I would contact the site director, the ESH personnel, and then hazardous waste containment.  From that point on they would deal with it.  There was always a Haz mat team on standby just in case something went wrong.  Only had to call them once, after a line broke and dumped the sludge out into the site itself. Cleanup took a week, with all our water (treated or otherwise) being trucked off to a secure facility for treatment.

       Nah, we used a filtration system.  Primarily a DE system with an emulsifier.  DE being diatomaceous earth.  DE as a filter media, when used with an Alar (company name) vacuum system removes 99.99% of all particulate matter in one treatment.  We treated the water twice, just to be certain.

       What one person does, regardless of who they work for, can often make it special. It's more a question of allowing you to see beyond the usual and into places where you might otherwise not.  Not unlike a person who works in customer service stepping back and talking about the various things they do that the average customer doesn't know about.

       Maybe take it down a notch, everyone is a hero in their own way.  I let a guy merge in front of me today without losing my cool.  Happy cake day, jerk.

       Well, "major" would seem more like "dozens of people in trouble, millions of dollars wasted/stolen, Congress investigating, a General might be retired, etc".

       Downvotes don't bother me.  So OP is butthurt that I'm not impressed by his "one supervisor in trouble" scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some examples of what I would call a "major" scandal:

       That was near us, but no. We had nothing to do with that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, waste treatment deals with the water used during production.  Mostly you're talking water that is being used to cool parts during cutting, but also water which was used to clean areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would go on duty at 9pm (though I would arrive earlier).  Once on site, my first task was to take a status of all the systems which I monitored, including temperatures of various production kilns, and the numerous water sensors.  The kilns, though not directly part of my job, were an important part so they relied on operations (my actual job title) to monitor them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once I had the status down, knowing that all the systems were working properly, I would take a sample reading from the settling tanks, as well as the holding pond.  This sample was tested for the presence of numerous types of heavy metals, and would go in a log.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every hour, I would repeat the process of taking samples, and testing. I also took time to check water usage, how much we were recycling back into the system, and how much was being discharged from the holding pond into the municipal treatment system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The holding pond itself held water that had been treated no less than two times, and was actually potable (drinkable) though it lacked things like chlorine and flouride.
