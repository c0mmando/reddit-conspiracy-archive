       I don't know a single person that is going to vote for Hillary, (almost) everyone is against Donald Trump. Why do you think Bernie is some rogue friend of the working man? Do you really think banks would fund his campaign - just as they are doing for all the others - if it would be anti progressive towards them and there agenda? Even the promises he makes now, will not be kept. "Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it."

       Because of astroturfing and wishfull idiots. Even after making it clear in the debate that his purpose is to protect Shillary, most people still want to believe he somehow stands for the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Ron Paul who rose on the back of the 9/11 truth movement and then stabbed it in the back still has supporters today. Banking on the stupidity of the voters is always  winning formula.

       Protect hillary? Are you seriously that thick? Is blatantly obvious that he said what he did because he wanted to focus on real, actual issues. He's regularly criticized and outright disagrees with Clinton on a myriad of issues. To pretend he is there to support her is utterly laughable.

       No, I don't give a shit about "true Communism," because I don't believe in Communism at all. It's hilarious how you keep trying to tag me with labels you find offensive so you can denigrate me without any evidence that I stand by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even know the difference between socialism and Communism; that's rather pathetic. You don't what a generalization is either, or a straw man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you bothered to do some research, you'd know Bernie is quite critical of the US support of Israel, feeling that it would be more appropriate to spend that money on economic support and the creation of a Palestinian state. He regularly criticizes israel's actions, and has for years. But you wouldn't know that, because you're a racist, hate-filled man-child who sees the world in black and white.

       He doesn't support apartheid at all; now you're just trolling. If you'd spent two seconds looking at his own damn website, you'd see that you're also entirely wrong about the federal reserve. But OK, just keep making shit up, it's really working out for you, isn't it?

       So, Bernie Sander's tepid criticism of the worst of the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine is supposed to show us what? His voting record is CONSISTENT - pro-Israel, no matter what they do. Has he ever supporting cutting off their funding until they stop the genocide? Of course not.

       No, it DID NOT. It showed exactly what I said - Bernie Sanders supports the apartheid regime of Jew bigotry in Zionist-occupied Palestine and he CONSISTENTLY votes to send more money of working class Americans to one of the richest countries, per capita, in the world.

       You keep pretending Sanders has some weird love for Israel and ignoring every single fact that shows you're wrong. Do you have any kind of evidence whatsoever that would suggest it's "his favorite country?" Or are you just going to keep insisting on babbling incessantly about Zionism and Jews when it's at odds with reality? Hell, even the Arab American Institute supports the guy.

       I 100% agree, I meet him when he was here in my town (a pic taken a few minutes later made the front page a month or so ago) and he seemed genuine. After meeting Bush, Gore, mrs. Clinton, and a few other lower names I would like to say Bernie has my vote. I mean all the other options rub me raw but he at least actually talked to me like a normal person instead of shaking hands talking about essential event stuff then rolling out and leaving me with there asshole staff of college rich kids.

       And yes I understand bush and gore are not running but i use them as examples because they still acted the same.

       Can you please provide some evidence that banks are funding his campaign?
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I have supported a Sanders presidential run since 2008 is precisely because he is not funded by banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can substantially indicate that his 2016 campaign has been funded by the financial industry (banks), I will cancel my recurring monthly $35 donation to his campaign immediately.

       Socialism and the promise of free stuff. Many didn't grow up hearing about how tyranny is frequently associated with socialism and communism. School education sucks greatly now. The result in a generation or two who are completely ignorant or even brainwashed about reality. Delusion combined with a promise a free stuff is a powerful drug.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad fact is that socialism is known to scale poorly and empower elitist aristocrats, and using Europe as a comparison, much of Europe is doing about as well as Mississippi. Imagine the idiotic looks people would receive if the left told the truth and boasted they want to make all American states as great as bragged European counterparts - as awesome as Mississippi.

       Bernie doesn't want money from the big banks like Hillary, who is going to do anything to please them once in office, but Bernie wants to achieve something no one has ever done, to fight for the people with only their money.  With all the people's money he has a moral obligation to us.  And if you look at his campaign promises it is only the American people and to call out and sent to jail the people and big business who are not paiding taxes. That money when rightful collected is going to the programs to help us.  Either this happens now or we stay enslave to shit life when we can all live better if we share.

       Yah but that's not fully related just to politics , it's mostly related to the entity / entities that are on the receiving side of the money from Obamacare/government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't researched the matter(how is he gonna pay for that) thoroughly  to give you an exact answer , but to me it's clear this he ain't gonna solve this with just taxing the rich , but with restructuring the entire system to a more efficient one.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have payed attention to the medical scandals lately(5000% drug price hikes etc) you would of known that the medical entities in the US are charging an arm and a leg and then some for their services compared to the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's due to greed and big money interests.

       <p>
        Why do you think Bernie is some rogue friend of the working man?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Look at his record. He's consistently been pro-Union his whole career. He was marching with an anti-Verizon workers' rally earlier today. You don't see presidential candidates do that as a hollow ploy. And you can bet it will carry over to his agenda if elected president. "Lord and Savior" is too strong a phrase, but he's the first viable candidate to authentically give a shit about the poor and middle class in a while, and he's the only candidate to be downright hostile towards the 1% since the robber-barons were a hot button issue. And that is rightly getting a lot of people engaged when they otherwise wouldn't be.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Even the promises he makes now, will not be kept
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He might not accomplish all of his goals if he wins the nomination and the general election (which I think he will, considering his weak competition) because he'll have just as hard a time getting an opposition House and maybe an opposition Senate (50-50 on whether Dems can re-take it) to move on anything on his agenda. But his message resonates with a lot of folks that are normally neglected, and that would give him a ton of leverage from the bully pulpit. Even if Congress makes him a lame-duck in his first two years of office, consistent unpopular obstruction of his policies could flip Congress for the Dems via a midterm wave.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Do you really think banks would fund his campaign?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I'm not worried about the banks not backing him. Wallstreet money can afford a lot of airtime, but his message has been spreading through word of mouth and the Internet in a way we haven't seen since Citizens United and the related cases changed the game. His individual donations are ahead of pace compared to even Obama's record-breaking individual fundraising effort. It's going to be very hard (and ironic) for Wallstreet to smear him via SuperPACs if his message is that SuperPACs are corrupting the political process and Wallstreet's excesses need to be reigned in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last, I don't see why this is in r/conspiracy. Theres not a conspiracy here, nor is there even a theory. If anything, the big sham is that we have a system designed to keep non-establishment candidates like Bernie (and Ron Paul before him) out of serious contention, but he's finding a way to work around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're down on Bernie, Trump, and Hillary who would you support instead?
