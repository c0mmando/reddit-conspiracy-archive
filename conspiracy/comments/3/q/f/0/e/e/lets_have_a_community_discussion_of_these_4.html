       Conspiracy 1 - Internationalist interests have taken over several governments, causing the governments to act against their populaces
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy 2 - Chemtrails are sprayed to control the weather, usually to create rain or combat global warming. The chemicals used might have unintended health consequences. Or worse, they might specifically be drugging entire cities, but that seems very unlikely
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy 3 - ISIS being a US/Israeli creation that is being used to win a proxy war against Russia in Syria. The propaganda for this issue is strong. Who buys the $2M of oil ISIS sells per day? Turkey, who probably then sells it to someone else. But if you read US propaganda, they say Assad is buying it. The Turkey/ISIS relationship is downplayed strongly, and is why Erdogan is so bought and sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy 4 - The constant shilling in our communal conversational spaces, pushing absurd theories such as CERN opening a wormhole and dooming mankind, and giving them hundreds of fake upvotes to make them appear popular. Cern wormholes, "no planes" 9/11 theories, and flat earth are big red flags to me. These are silly narratives that are pushed to the top to make

       look like a lunatic asylum. I see this happening on voat as well, and it's rampant on GLP. It's a way to drown out legitimate discussion, and drive people away. Instead of just shutting it down, which would cause a potential uproar, they just fill it full of semi-plausible garbage and slowly let conversation die as people gradually leave frustrated and don't return.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, of those 4 conspiracies, which do you think is the most important? Which do you think is the most solvable? What would have to happen for the public to become acutely aware of these conspiracies? I am interested to hear the thoughts of the community.

       I think #3 is the most important simply because it is the most "provable" or the most likely to catch on in the main stream. I think it is the hardest to control by TPTB simply because of Putin.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 isn't terribly important because most people that frequent this sub already have an opinion formed about conspiracies in general and these "out there" theories won't really change that view too much, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 almost impossible to really dig up any evidence beyond conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
       1 is a broad conspiracy that kind of would play into shinning light on #3, which also makes #3 important to focus on.

       It's known that weather modification is used regularly, that much is not hard to prove. I wouldn't be surprised if the Barium and Aluminum that are in the sprays they use have negative health effects, would you?

       I think people underestimate the importance of 4, but I'm glad you feel confident to reject the more "out there" theories, I guess that's how most people are so there's no need to "fight" it that much other than to preserve the image of the community so that important things get more views.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think you're right #3 is the most important, but also the hardest to have an impact on along with #1.

       Conspiracy 5 - China is now the new gold medalist of the dark side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most veteran conspiracy theorists are still trapped in the USA boogeyman mindset. But that era has long gone. China is the new architect of global chaos and dark operations. Obama is a moronic pussycat. The world is about to get a lesson from those who wrote The Art Of War. Get ready for the full global kowtow.

       How much control do you think China has, do you think they're orchestrating both sides of the syrian US/Russia proxy war? Do you think they're responsible for the breakdown of the functioning of governments in the west? It seems to me corporations and central banks are more responsible than any government, but I can imagine the Chinese government being in a good position for a coming conflict. I could imagine China coming out of WW3 like the US came out of WW2, the obvious victor both economically and militarily. Especially given the obvious decline of the west over the last few decades. What do you think?

       True, China could fall on its ass. China is shooting itself in the foot, with the world turning against it because of its hacking, stealing islands, and belligerent diplomacy. A smarter China would just continue to "bide its time".
      </p>
      <p>
       If the world comes to its senses, it will sanction China economically until it curbs its aggressive ways. But there are few signs of sanity in the Western world at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the kowtow being decades away, there is speculation that China is already covertly attacking American infrastructure, not just in the cyber realm, but real world assets like roads, fiber cables, and potentially much more chaos under the guise "accidents" (as per their doctrine of "unrestricted warfare").
      </p>
      <p>
       China blames its stock crash on America, specifically a Morgan Stanley downgrade, which China interpreted as an act of economic warfare, and speculation is that China has been retaliating ever since.

       You're right. Nothing has changed since Nixon. China is still a poor, rural, backwards, basket-case. Nothing to worry about. Just like America is still an all-powerful economic giant that cannot possibly be challenged: no debt, no deficit, no printing money. Decades have passed and nothing has changed. Just like Beijing still has clean air and blue skies.

       You added 9/11 and some other shit (Flat earth, etc). Seriously, you are a joke. If you want to talk about CERN, fine. If you are honest, fine. I will discuss. Do not edit your post and act like you didn't. It's in the header, dude.

       I think what's driving it are shills, and some idiots get caught up in the frenzy they create.

       That's an interesting idea about CERN, I'd not considered that. Although if it's true, it'd probably be to research particle weapons, not that cern is actually itself a particle weapon, right?

       It's okay, maybe I should re-write four for clarity purposes.

       CERN is undeniably used for research.

      <p>
       That being said, components of it could conceivably be used to create a particle beam weapon if needed.

         CERN. Who the fuck knows what they are doing. Are they creating a wormhole or anti-matter? I have no fucking idea. If they are and they succeed, will it make a bit of a difference knowing about it?

       flat earth kinda holds weight though.

       also the moon. according to science, everything that orbits an object, spins.

       you mean to tell me the same exact side of the moon has been facing earth, spinning the exact speed to stay that way for millions of years? I call bullshit

       The coincidences start to pile up after a while.  Another interesting one is the relative size and distance we are told for the sun and moon in order to create the perfect eclipse effect.

       We only have one world to observe, so we have nothing to compare it to.  But some of the things in the world around us are bizarre when you really think about them.  Often the generally accepted explanations for these things are incomplete or just plain incorrect.  Most people seem to operate in a normalcy mode though.  No matter how strange something is, it just is the way it is, and that is normal.

       Having an orbital body tidally locking to a planet is a common phenomenon. Besides our moon: both of Mars' moons, the 4 Galilean moons of Jupiter (plus others), a number of Saturn's and Uranus', Triton and Proteus of Neptune, and Pluto and Charon are locked to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which isn't "NASA science". Many of this has been documented by astronomers before NASA's inception. Not to mention all other space agencies agree to this astrophysics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But unless of course you (not you specifically, but anyone) is willing to believe the world is indeed flat, then all of the knowledge we have observed about celestial bodies over decades is incorrect and every space agency is in on it.

       I just find it odd that we know what planets are made of and how much they weigh yet we've never been farther down on earth than 8 miles (yet we know there's a crust/mantle/outer core/inner core and how big they each are)

       Moon faces earth because it broke away from earth. Binary orbit systems often have similar rotation to revolution rates.
