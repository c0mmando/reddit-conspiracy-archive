       It's like this: Companies like Monsanto, who are caught all the time pumping profits over safety, are spending a lot of money countering the flow of information critical to their actions and products.
      </p>
      <p>
       With TPP they can sue a little blogger who is required to hire a designated arbitration firm for $800 per hour. They can outspend you until you fold, take all your money, garnish your wages once they prove what you said hurt their profits. Not, mind you, whether or not one of their products is dangerous or what you said is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore you can't appeal through your courthouse or a lawyer. AND writing your congress or senate won't help.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an Orwellian boot grinding your face, forever.

       Don't think of it as terrifying. The only reason why they're doing this is because they're scared. Whatever you guys are doing on the internet so far is working and they hate it.

       The way my imagination is running away with how this works out is kind of terrifying and dystopian at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im imagining war being led by different stores or corporations. A war against people. People with ideas that dont fit the mold. People retaliate but instead of the police banging on your door or the FBI, CIA, or whatever instead its Target, Wal-Mart, Dollar General. Its whatever corporate wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they want are your ideas. How you can change the world, but how they can rip you off and make money with some cheap product. Something effective but you cant go without. They wnt to know what you know. They want to bombard you with products. They want to take your money in the most thoughtful way, and the most deceptive. Its like that magic trick where the right hand dont know what the left is doing. Sadly its been like that for years already and this thing here is goingbto make it worse.

       Or atvleast thats how I picture anyway. Sorry for the typos.

       Exactly. In fact, anytime someone disagrees with a comment or post, the standard statement that should be adopted is, "Do you have a source?", and if the original post already answers that, don't leave a comment... ugh, I swear, that would remove like 99% of shills on here. And it would simultaneously promote one, big fact fight! And most of the conspiracy theories can be fairly well supported by even mainstream news, like NYT, Washington Post, etc.

       I wouldn't trust any info on this site. The founder moved to Ecuador so he wouldn't be bound by US laws against the "medicine" he sells.

       He doesn't believe in germ theory, thinks chemotherapy is a criminal practice, believes mammograms are a ploy to give women breast cancer, and promotes homeopathic nonsense.

       He's obviously only in it to trick gullible people to buy fake medicine, like every other snake oil salesman.

       I think I'm going to start answering with imgtfy.com - don't know why I didn't think about that before. Sometimes (but not always!) when people ask for sources, they know what you're saying is well-sourced but just want to run you in circles wasting time with links that they'll then just make some bogus excuse not to look at anyway.

       Referring people to imgtfy.com does not replace the need for sources. You might find different sources, and thus not be able to follow the trail of proof that someone found to convince them. I might reconsider if I'm convinced or not, but at least I can find the proof that someone else looked at. If that makes sense.

       No, but there are times when the asker doesn't really want sources, just wants to derail and stall the conversation. Can't tell you how many times I've pulled together a list of good sources only to get ad hominems and insults in response from users who aren't here to engage in good faith discourse. I guess that educates readers, though, too...

        http://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=158012

       by Alexander Light. That one in turn was an article (by Alexander Light) on
       <a href="http://humansarehealthy.com/2011/02/aids-great-medical-con.html">
        http://humansarehealthy.com/2011/02/aids-great-medical-con.html

       , which does not exist anymore, but can be found on wayback-machine:

       However, back to the article in OP, they do quite clearly cite sources for the article to EFF.org and an old article from about a year ago (

        https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/cyber-espionage-and-trade-agreements-ill-fitting-and-dangerous-combination
       </a>
       ), which satisfies my curiosity, as I do quite regularly follow their posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summary you had a point which discredited the site, and point taken.
