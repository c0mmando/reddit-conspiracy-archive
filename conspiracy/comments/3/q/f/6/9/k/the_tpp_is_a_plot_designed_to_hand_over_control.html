    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like this: Companies like Monsanto, who are caught all the time pumping profits over safety, are spending a lot of money countering the flow of information critical to their actions and products. </p>

<p>With TPP they can sue a little blogger who is required to hire a designated arbitration firm for $800 per hour. They can outspend you until you fold, take all your money, garnish your wages once they prove what you said hurt their profits. Not, mind you, whether or not one of their products is dangerous or what you said is true.  </p>

<p>Furthermore you can&#39;t appeal through your courthouse or a lawyer. AND writing your congress or senate won&#39;t help.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an Orwellian boot grinding your face, forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way my imagination is running away with how this works out is kind of terrifying and dystopian at the same time.</p>

<p>Im imagining war being led by different stores or corporations. A war against people. People with ideas that dont fit the mold. People retaliate but instead of the police banging on your door or the FBI, CIA, or whatever instead its Target, Wal-Mart, Dollar General. Its whatever corporate wants. </p>

<p>What they want are your ideas. How you can change the world, but how they can rip you off and make money with some cheap product. Something effective but you cant go without. They wnt to know what you know. They want to bombard you with products. They want to take your money in the most thoughtful way, and the most deceptive. Its like that magic trick where the right hand dont know what the left is doing. Sadly its been like that for years already and this thing here is goingbto make it worse. </p>

<p>Or atvleast thats how I picture anyway. Sorry for the typos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. In fact, anytime someone disagrees with a comment or post, the standard statement that should be adopted is, &quot;Do you have a source?&quot;, and if the original post already answers that, don&#39;t leave a comment... ugh, I swear, that would remove like 99% of shills on here.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t trust any info on this site. The founder moved to Ecuador so he wouldn&#39;t be bound by US laws against the &quot;medicine&quot; he sells.</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t believe in germ theory, thinks chemotherapy is a criminal practice, believes mammograms are a ploy to give women breast cancer, and promotes homeopathic nonsense.</p>

<p>Vaccine zombie, does not seem very serious, but I might lack context.</p>

<p>Guest columnist David Icke&#39;s article is originally not attributed to David Icke at all, but was a post on the <a href="http://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=158012">http://forum.davidicke.com/showthread.php?t=158012</a> by Alexander Light. That one in turn was an article (by Alexander Light) on <a href="http://humansarehealthy.com/2011/02/aids-great-medical-con.html">http://humansarehealthy.com/2011/02/aids-great-medical-con.html</a>, which does not exist anymore, but can be found on wayback-machine: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110522211244/http://humansarehealthy.com/2011/02/aids-great-medical-con.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20110522211244/http://humansarehealthy.com/2011/02/aids-great-medical-con.html</a>.</p>

<p>However, back to the article in OP, they do quite clearly cite sources for the article to EFF.org and an old article from about a year ago (<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/cyber-espionage-and-trade-agreements-ill-fitting-and-dangerous-combination">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/cyber-espionage-and-trade-agreements-ill-fitting-and-dangerous-combination</a>), which satisfies my curiosity, as I do quite regularly follow their posts. </p>

<p>In summary you had a point which discredited the site, and point taken.</p>
