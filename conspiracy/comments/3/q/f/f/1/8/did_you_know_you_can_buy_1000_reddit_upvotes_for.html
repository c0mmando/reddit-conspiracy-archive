       Reddit is Mainstream Media. Votes, and even comments and comment votes, can be bought from PR agencies. If you're a big company, you just hire them to do all the work for you, it's much cheaper than traditional advertising. They call it "native advertising", where they rig comment threads to promote a certain product or narrative. It can also be used by the government and by other groups interested in influencing public discourse in an inexpensive manner. This needs to be common knowledge.

       Absolutely, considering being on the front page would get your youtube video lots of
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       views which can turn into shares on twitter and facebook. Depending on the video, you could possibly even turn a profit.

       I think you'd get half a million views or more by getting on the front page or more. Reddit has over 5 million unique visitors every day. Seems well worth the $1600 or so it would take if to get there, if you were advertising.

       Unless they seed the comment section with fake comments praising the video, and then give those fake comments fake upvotes. And then do that several times to make a whole thread. It's extra effort, but some companies do it to prevent against what you just said

       It really depends on what you're looking for. Reddit's audience is one of the lowest quality on the web. If you happen to be an ad driven content site, for example, Reddit is basically useless (ad block, etc.).

       Yeah you would, if those views will generate clicks for your ads. Certain audiences generate a lot of clicks for ads, thus a lot of revenue. And yes, I do work in digital marketing, and yes we will, under the right circumstances, spend money on views.

       That's interesting. So there are times when you can put in $x and get &gt;$x in return? Wouldn't that generate infinite money? Why does Youtube/advertisers allow that kind of abuse?

       Right, but some questions are so baffling it's hard to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at your statement: put in $x and get &gt;$x in return. Congrats, you understand the most basic principle of business.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get that if you buy views on social media, you're hoping it "goes viral", right? So if I buy advertising on Facebook (or whatever social media network) I am hoping it will jump start an article, webpage, video, whatever, that attracts a lot of traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps I didn't make that explicit, but it should be obvious. Yes, it is possible to invest in articles, and to see them get traction, but it is reasonably hard to do, at least while producing a solid profit that makes it worth your time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing so with reddit would be next to impossible because the traffic is of such low quality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess if you could guarantee gaining traction with every article you could create an infinite loop of money.

       YouTube doesn't rank you based on views, they rank videos based on signals - time of engagement, likes/dislikes, comments. If a video gets 5k views, but each viewer leaves after one second - it is going to hurt your ranking rather than help it.

       1200 for 3000 upvotes and front page status as a native advertisement that can reach a ton of people and appear genuine to the vast majority is well worth it when u compare a couple grand to a tv advertisement during a prime time show

       Yeah, but lazy journalists and aggregator sites rip articles right off the front page of Reddit on a regular (like they used to do and maybe sometimes still do with Fark) - so it's double/triple/quadruple/xxx bang for your buck.

       YouTube has longevity that Reddit doesn't. You get featured on the front page of Reddit and for a day there's hype. You get to the top of YT's search for whatever your video's subject and you're likely to stay there. You'll never get the numbers on Reddit that you'll get on YT. Source:  A large portion of Reddit's content is literally from YT.

       But that still requires people to actively search for your YouTube video which would cut a lot of exposure, however if you get something big enough on reddit it is literally front page of the site.

       That's my point. Reddit will blast you with exposure for a short bit, but YT will hang on for as long as your content is relevant and even beyond that.

       Yep. Though they've been using the pageviews from their crap content and quizzes to actually do some pretty good longer form reporting recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       They get a lot of flak for their content mill approach to pageviews, but it may be that they've found a way to actually fund themselves such that they can report honestly on sacred cow subjects without worrying about sponsors pulling support...because people are ALWAYS gonna click for the garbage and quizzes and selling ads won't be a problem in an environment like that.

       India has a bigger problem with it and refused to help until things started getting real bad, is rape a big problem in the US? Yeah, but it's not racist to point out that our rape statistics are .1% of our population reporting rape while in India it's about to go over 1% (and that's only reported rapes). I'm not saying the West doesn't have a rape problem, but indias problem is tenfold and only recently were there big changes in their justice system.

       you can argue that the statistics cover only the reported cases !!
      </p>
      <p>
       i dont like to fight over it !! but i would like to educate you that India problem is not rape
      </p>
      <p>
       we have poverty, child marriage, illegal drugs, education, pollution, corruption, mafia, cast, minority, bull shit judicial system, politcal parties who doesnt know they dont have a say on how India is booming, LGBT issues, equality, divorce laws, and rape is not as bad or often it sounds 
but I guess you have not been to India or you know how India works or how big is india and how many langauges we speak 
and we have high level of tolerance and like to be in debate which brings good improvement to soceity (thou our politics are screwed up, we as a nation do live and like to bring peace to the world)
      </p>
      <p>
       Media is power hungry and likes to cause sensation every now and then and then carry on with their work !! it is them who formed a illogical image on worlds mind that all INDIA love to rape and hate women and we look women as  sexual object
      </p>
      <p>
       believe me i am not offended by your question!! i have travelled to japan and now in  Europe !! i usally get questions about rape !!
      </p>
      <p>
       I can tell you all men who are cultured and educated and they do respect women and dont involve in stuffs like these.. as you know not all in the country have the same idea about life hence there are some drunk fucks who does stuff like that and our media telecasts them for next 5 days and then tehy usally forgot and then  cover the story of how our PM changed his Facebook picture and media doesnt give a fuck about the rape victims after that !!
      </p>
      <p>
       so most of the media who has links with other country media publishes them and all you read is in newspapers is all Indian guy does after waking up is rape !!!
      </p>
      <p>
       but sorry we dont we are nice warm people !! and we love technologies we love food and we breathe air
      </p>
      <p>
       i am not offended by the remark   !! relax and take some herbs :)

       As far as I can tell the best resources available tell us that roughly 3% of rapists are imprisoned. This is from RAINN, but squares with the US Department of Justice  statistics(because it is based on them). Actually, it may be generous, as the DOJ claims that rape is reported to police less often than RAINN claims (35 and 40 percent, respectively).

1. an airplane
2. my apartment

       You pay a company 400 bucks to get you 500k views, they make 400 bucks, youtube then pays you 500 bucks. You just made 100 bucks net and you will go back to them again spend another 400 bucks to get another 500k views and another 500 bucks, now you have 200 in net profits.

       The reason they pay for 400 bucks to get the 500k views is because they wouldn't get 500k views on their own. If they could get 500k views on their own then yes, it would be best to simply post it. But it is rare and few and far between to have that many natural views on a video that isn't viral or on a highly subscribed channel.

       No, the contradiction falls on the provider of the views. If they just make their own random ass videos and shill them up, they will be making 100% of the profit from monetization, as opposed to 80%.

      <p>
       The problem we had in

        our

       conversation is that I reference "they" as the shills, but you interpreted "they" as the people paying to get their videos viewed. That's my mistake for not clarifying.

       Purchasable youtube views are nothing but an aesthetic really. The views will be counted but won't get the video any real exposure, unlike reddit, where from it's inception to this day there still aren't any attempts to prevent content with fake upvotes reaching the frontpage.

       It makes sense that views are cheaper than upvotes, since viewing doesn't necessarily signify that they enjoyed it. It's also relative, since YouTube is a bigger site than reddit, so lower numbers have less of an impact on visibility. One thousand upvotes is enough to get on the front page of reddit, but 1k views is not nearly enough to matter on YouTube.

       Yes, but Reddit is a very influential platform, and you just need about 5k upvotes to make the frontpage. On youtube you need many millions if the person isn't interested in your subject to show on his feed. It's probably even or even cheaper. Remember the upvotes themselves are useless if not to influence outers.

       More like 40 cents, which is kind of a lot if you think about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, every single one of your votes and comments has a value of around 40 cents. That's pretty cool. That shows how valuable your input to public opinion really is. If you vote on 100 things, that like generating a value of $40 worth of information.

       I think people seriously undervalue the power of their own comments and votes.

       I wrote crawlers for my previous job :) Some sites that don't have 1% of reddit traffic had some safeguards against that kind of thing. I'm sure that if you make a 1000 accounts that upvote from the same IP, you'll get blocked/shadowbanned. That's the bare minimum they have done. After that I don't know how sophisticated they got, but you'd need at least

       Proxies are easy to come by, LUA scripting isn't that difficult, as the legions of 12-year olds out there using it constantly shows, this can be done on the cheap via something similar to Mechanical Turk, or alternatively, a modified Cleverbot, un-necessary if you're only in it to spread misinformation or otherwise manipulate public opinion.

       Dude, it isn't so dumb, considering how many Russian "troll houses" have been doing this exact thing for ages (let alone their counterparts in Israel, the UK and the USA).

       Hell, even spammers do similar things, raking in millions while doing so and clogging up forums, email, and everything else.

       Simply searching for the topic "fake reviews" (of which can fall under what we're talking about), brings up 127,000,000 results in Google, including a 1st page link to an article on Wikihow on how to discern fake reviews and fake reviewers.
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of thing is old hat, what is becoming more difficult is combating people who do this sort of thing, with methods evolving constantly to bypass filtering and other roadblocks.

       the troll houses are a completely different thing. I was referring to the idea for the Mechanical Turk ????  wtf build a robot to click it???,
I don't see how cleverbot is relevant in any way, as it is just a gimmick, and we are only talking about votes here; and finally as I said free proxies are not scalable - they are not reliable &amp; cant handle large traffic. No comment on the 12 year olds.

       Using Mechanical Turk or similar service to cheaply pay for people to post whatever message it is you're trying to send out, is what I was talking about - cost is low, output is high, and you don't need to have expensive staff on hand - essentially removing one of the larger barriers to this sort of thing happening, which is cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the bots, it isn't as far-fetched as you think, as they are even being used to write news articles nowadays. These aren't the dumb bots of old, where they can only post pre-programmed responses or gibberish from a dictionary file - several modern bots have passed the Turing Test. Now, consider bots like this being purposely set up to create posts on social media, review sites, up/down vote on sites like Slashdot or Reddit, etc, and you can see why this can be more of an issue than it first appears to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proxy issue is one that is complicated, with legit proxy machines and services being as you described (there are paid proxy services that do scale well, but they can run up costs very quickly). What happens if some group decides to use malware of some sort to create a zombie army of proxy machines for the use of vote manipulation or posting propaganda on social media instead of penis enlargement spam or DDoS attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       The comment I made about the 12-year olds and scripting was just from my observation how easy such things have become even for non-technical users nowadays - where you have software like Minecraft and the like easily and readily teach those very skills to a large number of people, many of whom don't even know or care that is what they are learning to do. I can only imagine how this kind of thing can be actively used as a training tool, to train low-paid "grunts" to write scripts for just about any purpose (good or otherwise).

       I made a post that got super derailed. Then I made a post calling out these people as likely being shills. Then I got banned for it. Then I had to ask to get unbanned and promise never to call out a shill or make any accusations toward any user on this subreddit ever again, basically. But I got my account back.

       My own opinion is calling people shills is fucking lazy and detrimental to the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cant argue against someone without literally saying "You are wrong because you are paid to be here" then you dont understand your arguments and need to better defend them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be able to simply and without aggression make your points and defend them regardless of what the other commenters are doing. When you start calling people shills you will sound
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ITT: Shills. Sorry I even tried, geez.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is weak and sounds like whining. I dont mean to offend but all these fucking people bitching about shills would be more productive if they learned how to debate properly.

       Calling people shills can also be accurate and true, because there are some people who relentlessly push opinions and don't listen to counter-arguments and vote manipulate threads to make them appear certain ways. There are actual people who work for PR firms to manipulate reddit, and it's not a rare thing either. Of course it is good to be able to defend your point logically, but we should also have the ability to call out people who are obviously not interested in discussion or logic and are only around to derail threads and push narratives. People who likely work for PR firms.

       Definitely, I wouldnt even argue this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of people called a shill vs the amount of people actually paid to push that point is very different.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/10 the person being shutdown with shill accusations is just a dude with a differing opinion than yours. Its poor dialogue to casually throw out that shill word, it means your arguments are weak or you cant explain them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the person you are arguing with is a legit shill you lose nothing by clearly explaining your points. You wont change their minds but for people on the fence looking into that discussion from a 3rd party will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its your responsibility to spread truth without getting frustrated and calling everyone who disagrees with shill.

       They aren't the focus, only the observers. A debate isn't always about changing your opponents mind it's about the viewing public that is witnessing this debate because they choose to.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a topic (whatever it is) that interests them enough to learn more about it. You do then a disservice with shill calling because you can't explain the truth to a person manipulating it or to the mistaken casual observer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm not saying shills aren't real but that nothing beneficial comes from these which hunts and we should focus on spreading truth as priority number 1

       Calling someone a shill in no way adds to a logical defense of your own point. There are plenty of people who will absolutely defend their beliefs, be it 9/11 was a controlled demolition or Monsanto is a great company, regardless of the proof provided. This does not mean that they are being paid to hold this view point.

       Again, a citation would be needed for this. Also, just because there may be PR people using reddit to further an agenda for their company, this in no way proves that everyone who refuses to back down in an argument are paid shills. Calling someone a shill without any proof is where the real issue lies. Almost no-one who frequents this sub would ever be against someone being called out as a shill if proof were included.

       I wouldn't argue that. My only point being that most shills are just people who don't agree, but a few are here to purposely manipulate.

       Calling people a shill is like saying that you give up. You won't change their minds but with proper presentation of your facts and your point you can change the minds of those people seeing your dialogue.

       Some dude is paying $70 for accounts over 3 years old with at least 30k karma. I'd say with the mileage you have on yours it might be closer to $100?

       Same thing happened on Myspace. Accounts with lower account IDs would show up higher on the show all friends list. Companies would buy up the super low numbers for high price do their brand would be at the top of everyone's friend list after they redesigned the user account.

       Reminds me of Troll Farmer from the show Blacklist. Essentially he has hundreds of accounts on social media including Reddit and, with the help of his co-conspirators, creates fake diversions in the news (earthquakes, outbreaks, shootings, etc) to manipulate stock prices, divert police from heists, etc. It was creepy to watch as it could very easily happen.

       Some people have actually been successfully prosecuted for manipulating markets like that, although it has mostly come from going in financial internet forums and making false statements to try to sway large quantities of serious investors.

       Yeah, it's less likely to be picked out by the filter because it is an established account. It also lends credibility if they use it to shill because people can go back through the comment history and see a diverse range of posts for a long time going back. That sort of credibility is worth a lot to a shill which is why they pay so much for good accounts

       I consult for several major ad agencies, and let me tell you, the "viral" stuff usually includes massive amounts of fake views and likes. A big agency owns a whole botnet that they can use to manipulate all social media platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I consult for major labels, there are interns creating hundreds of fake accounts on reddit and other music discussion forums and boards to start discussions. This has been going on since the early days of MySpace, nothing new here.

       Been here 8 years, I've watched the whole site slowly go down in flames. Things used to be so good about 5 years ago.. oh well. Another site will come along eventually and the cycle will start anew. Although I hope the new site has the capability for the community to label shills for easy detection, because that's really what's ruining voat and reddit

       They sell smaller packages too, like 100 upvotes. You could start a subreddit with no one in it, make one post, and give it a hundred upvotes for $40 or something. That'd prove it more cheaply, but it wouldn't be as exciting.

       Yeah true, you might have to trick the ad agency a bit. Maybe you could have them host a picture file and get it to the front page, and then at the last minute change the picture at that URL to a picture of the receipt, after the votes are in and you're on the front page.

       Which would logically be deleted by the mods/admins for vote manipulation.  Even if it was considered fair game, a system like this may have an inside man modding on some of the popular subreddits.  All in all people do not want to believe that they are susceptible to propaganda because it makes us feel less intelligent.  It doesn't bother me that propaganda innovates like this because it is natural.

       There's certainly some inside admins that condone this, that's been clear for a while now. These things come to the surface but aren't dealt with by the admins, which shows their true colors. It's most profitable for them to let the votes be manipulated as much as is believable.

       Yup.

       That's why everyone once in a while you will see a comment thread of a frontpage post that is absolutely bipolar. Like half the comments are extremely one way and the other half in reaction are like "ugh, can you believe all the insane comments in here?". It's because the insane comments are all planted and voted in to position, but then real people's comments leak through. Sometimes they leak through too much and they just give up trying to do damage control, and then you wind up with a thread that completely hates the OP, and you see vote percentages below 90% (after thousands of fake 100% upvotes, mind you) which means people
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       don't want it there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep an eye out and you'll start seeing this battle between PR and real people all the time. Adds a whole new dimension to comment threads.

       This a good guide:

       But basically, I look for people who don't really listen to what you are saying and just keep repeatedly pushing a narrative. People strongly pushing absurd topics to make the subreddit look bad, like flat earth, cern portals, or what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
       It usually the kind of conversation where every step of the way they are trying to undermine you and your point. There's no desire for consensus building or working out logic, it's just a literal script a lot of times that they type from.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you ever happen to call one out, they almost always say "What, so everyone who disagrees with you is a shill?" which is an obvious strawman, but it works often enough that they keep using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, you cannot argue or change these people's minds. They will engage you, but only to make you look bad. And they gang up on you and pat each other on the back and upvote each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly, you can look at their comment history. If you see them pushing tons of ridiculous narratives and lots of negative comments combined with the other things above, that's a pretty close lock. In the end, it's really more about tone than anything else. These people are not interested in anything other than shoving their ideas and talking points (that are often on a bullet point list for them) down everyones throats.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's subtle, but it's often noticeable. Not always, but often.

       I post a bit whenever I see Russian / Chinese news pop up, get random down votes ( nothing huge ) but enough to hide it at times. Typically its when I'm slightly critical of what they post, positive feedback pretty much gets up votes in them. (Post in stuff about Russia because I speak it badly and in Chinese things as I speak to people in China daily).

       I like it. There's probably all sorts of "wars" going on like this over the front page content. I wonder if a PR org has ever taken over the comment thread of another PR org and derailed it. I bet it happens a lot and explains why in general the comments are so angry and combative in a lot of threads.

       You need to buy endorsements? I thought the deal with LinkedIn is people you haven't worked with in years endorse you for things they've never seen you do and can't legitimately vouch for.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least, that's my experience. My endorsed skills are hilarious. I mean, I have them, but most of the people who've endorsed me wouldn't be able to tell whether I was good at them or not...

       Has anyone from r/conspiracy tried to game the system to get attention of this to the front page? For example, creating a clever gif or pic that mocks these websites posted to r/funny or r/gifs so that people who don't know they are bing sold things at least learn about the existence of websites like
       <a href="http://www.redditsecrets.com">
        www.redditsecrets.com

       ?

       That's funny, how do I know that this post was not purchased to promote fiverr and buyredditvotes? I mean $400 dollars is nothing. Just only provide places where to get them, but no actually sources of it being used anywhere, except this post. great job in promoting.

       because you can get half a million views of your picture if it makes the front page, and it takes upvotes to get there. If you're a company who wants to advertise their product, half a million is a lot of views, especially just for spending a mere $1600.

       The #9 trafficked website on American Internet, with a cost to guerrilla advertise that's pretty much 1% the cost of mass media ads (radio, television, Facebook etc)...... If corporations were not advertising here their marketing directors should be fired.

       I thought this was already common knowledge, does anyone posting in this thread seriously think that corporations and politicians wouldnt bother tapping into and actively manipulating this community for personal gain? Do you seriously think they dont buy and influence threads to promote their own brand or ideas? Be wary my friends, of anything thats tied to big money or anything of prominence in society. Its far to easy to fake an entire movement these days. Where do you think the term astro turfing orginates from? Never let shit you see on sites like these ever seriously influence you without multiple independent sources and your own critical thinking to guide you. Against that they have no defense.

       Can anyone with knowledge tell me how this would work? I imagine an agency would need 1000s of accounts, all created and used by one individual IP address, and would need to add the vote at random, non suspicious times to make it look legit. How does it all work, PR gurus, and what of Reddits inbuilt anti cheating measures?

       Ah fair enough, I'm not a teen American but the rest might be true :/
       <br/>
       You lose an account by being an idiot troll, saying the wrong things in a default sub, pissing off power moderators, I'm sure there's more. I've calmed down a bit these days haha.

       You're forgetting the thousand individual accounts with separate IPs. There's no way on earth paying someone 15/hour would get the job done.

       Not really.  You can have multiple accounts running from one IP address.  I've made a few throw-aways.  It's quick and easy, and RES even supports quick-switch between them.  There's a limit before someone might flag you, sure.  But there's also TOR and other IP-spoofing software that, once set up, renders your 1000 different accounts pretty much indistinguishable from a 1000 real users.

       You just said with no effort you could produce 1000 up votes on content. The thread is about a company selling that service for $400 a pop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Company spend multiple millions on ad campaigns that are hardly as effective as a couple front page reddit spots. If you could easily get them to the front page, you'll be rich. Get on it bro, it's so totes easy. Here, I'll give you the instructions:

       This is what ruined DIGG.com , huffpoo and many other left wing and right wing sites started buying their way to the front page with nothing but propaganda and it destroyed the site , but they didn't care it drove page hits to them and when they were finished they just walked away and started using Reddit as their new whore

       This is not what "native advertising" refers to. In native ads, publishers are paid to create and/or run content in support of a brand's goals. Vote manipulation may be real, but unless you are alleging that Reddit is making $$$ off of it, it's not native advertising.

       Ideas filtered through reddit that are absurd and false slowly show up on the rest of the internet a few years later as totally standard. It's amazing.

       a late night post: upvotes on reddit definately has some value, som does youtube views (which is probably easier to monetize - by that i mean calculate into money). to calculate the "real" value of upvotes, just see the average number of upvotes per "reddit gold" purchase, and divide it on the cost of said reddit gold. bam the worth of an upvote. how to purchase an upvote however, thats another story, then you would need to see how many accounts one person (working at a minimum acceptable wage) could: create, comment create a post, comment on it a post, log out per hour (*8). then calculate the number of posts that can be made every hour, then divid it on the amount of money you pay said worker or program - purchase and upgrading to keep eventual account deletion also in concideration and development of innovation included

       I don't know if reddit is selling the service directly, but I sometimes think they turn their back and don't look if the brigading/rigging is done covertly enough. I think it's more just people creating botnets and leasing those out to the highest bidder, and reddit admins kind of look the other way

       It's funny because while they can up vote content, if it's shitty or doesn't belong, it will be flagged countless times and downvoted to hell. We should offer our own services to competitive competition and sell down votes for half the price and donate our earnings to a nonprofit charity that's close to making a ground breaking advancement in medicine. It would kill these upvote selling companies fast!

       That is VERY interesting, believe it or not, i think I have found such an account. At least I found a very peculiar account. It is 5 days old, has 3 or 4 posts (most with negative upvote), but pretty much exactly 900 karma (comment karma) and a really strange username a long string of numbers. I just wanted to start a thread about it, askingn wtf is going on there, when I stumbled across this thread. Here is a screenshot     :

        I wonder how long people will allow themselves to be pushed around. All that fluoride in the drinking water has made everyone so ignorant, gullible and apathetic.
       </p>
       <p>
        People need to realize that no one is going to fight this war for them; And that is what it is going to take. A real, blood and guts, war, right here in the United States. And until that war is fought, and won, we will continue to be herded towards the Apocalypse, like a bunch of dumb cattle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every day more and more of our rights are being taken away, without any fight, which will eventually result in the inability TO fight. So, once we finally realize how bad things are, it will be too late to do anything about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        They will continue to poison us in our food, water and air. They will continue to lie to us about
        <em>
         everything
        </em>
        , including our true history and our relationship with the rest of the universe.  They will continue to deceive us about our own abilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that we feel powerless. This news is going to make you feel one of two ways, either hopeless or enraged. People are becoming less and less enraged.
        <em>
         They
        </em>
        are hoping that trend continues until they can do whatever they want and there is no more opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps then they will stop with the election charades and admit the fact that they have manipulated the system to only allow those of certain bloodlines to achieve any amount of success. The deck has been stacked against us. They have been given information that has been withheld from us. Much of it resides in The Vatican and The Middle East today; Scrolls, tomes, tablets, crystal with information that could free 7.5 billion slaves. That's why it's so important to keep it secret. Knowledge is power, and power is relative.
       </p>
       <p>
        CISA is just one more way that power is being taken away from the masses so it can be maintained by the few. They control everything you see, hear, taste, feel, and think. They bombard you with propaganda and mindless entertainment 24/7. They tell you that every day is better than the one before. They tell you that people are living longer. They tell you lie after lie. They tell you that if anyone tries to tell you the truth, they're the enemy. So, they keep you stupid. Because that's how control works. They take away your right to say anything factual, which is why this post will most likely be censored.
       </p>
       <p>
        They want to control the flow of information. And that is what CISA is about. They want to be able to keep you stupid in order to better enslave you. It's not about the money. They create the money. From nothing. It's not real. They are not as enamored with it as you are.
       </p>
       <p>
        What they want is power. Land and power. But mostly, power. They want you to be their slaves, because just like every "ruler" going back to Sumeria and Babylon, they believe they are Gods. Literally Gods here on Earth; Descendants of Lucifer/Enki/Enlil/Jesus/Yahweh/Allah/Mohammed/
        <strong>
         Is
        </strong>
        is/

         El

        . Placed here on this Earth to rule by divine right.
        <br/>
        You will never be able to "vote" one of your own in. Votes are a lot of theater. That's why it's so important that they are secret, and you should never talk about who you are voting for. Heaven forbid the people should realize that the majority lost again.
       </p>
       <p>
        You're not going to vote your way out of this mess. You're not going to be able to negotiate your way out. They have taken their throne by murder and deceit, and they are not going to give it up while they are still breathing. They have been working on this for hundreds of thousands of years. Literally. They are not going to stop because their servants outvoted them. You can believe that.
       </p>
       <p>
        You have two options. You can watch this planet be destroyed and taken over by a bunch of serpents, or you can stand up and fight. Fight for your life, and fight for your freedom. Your freedom of thought. Your freedom of mind. Because that is where the shackles are attached. The only thing that is keeping you from rising up is the belief that you could win. It's simply your will. They've taken it away from you, but they haven't changed the odds. They are still overwhelmingly in your favor. That is the truth. There are 7.5 billion of you. There barely 300 of them. You need to stop fighting for them, and start fighting for yourselves, together, against them. That is all it takes.
       </p>
       <p>
        All hope is not lost. All you need to do is start eating organic food, and filtering your water with Reverse Osmosis. Turn off the television. Take the batteries out of your phones. You'll see your mood changes. Your entire outlook changes. You won't feel so lazy any more. You will start to see the bullshit for what it is and eventually you'll put an end to it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Soon you will see that you are ALL in violent agreement with one another. The Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, Scientists, Scientologists, Raëlians. You are all right. They are all different ways of explaining the same phenomena. You just need to stop thinking that you are right and everyone else is wrong. You're all right. You're all on the same side. You've all been manipulated to divide amongst yourselves. That is why these things were created. And they were all created by the same people. Religion, Feminism, the Left-Right Paradigm, etc etc etc. They are all very clever ways to get you to turn against each other, rather than the people who are doing you the real harm. Hopefully you realize this soon, stop causing each other harm, and stand up together for your rights.

      <p>
       I submitted this, look at the votes and comments, it immediately got eaten alive by PR management to bury legitimate discussion:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3qf0ee/lets_have_a_community_discussion_of_these_4/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3qf0ee/lets_have_a_community_discussion_of_these_4/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I submitted this to point out the problem, and it was removed because of rule 10:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3qf4yb/shills_on_this_subreddit_kill_posts_that_talk/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3qf4yb/shills_on_this_subreddit_kill_posts_that_talk/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All in the last hour. I dislike how you can't even use the s-word on this subreddit, even when it is obviously true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wanted this to be documented so everyone can see how compromised this subreddit is, and the means by which certain topics are silenced, by drowning them out with garbage posts and votes.

       Ok, but I think the comment flytape made in the deleted thread makes sense:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Because certain people become ultra-OCD-obsessed that every user they talk to who doesn't align with their world views and opinions with a perfect eclipse is the dreaded "shill".
       </p>
       <p>
        Before this rule was enforced the act of "calling out shills" did more damage to the continuity of conversation than any shill could ever hope to do. In fact I suspect the "actual shills" more frequently started witch hunts against shills to disrupt the entire sub, than they actually had to shill for anything.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You are applying the shill label to an awful lot of people just because they don't agree with you.  I can only speak with absolute certainty about myself.  No one pays me to post and I have no intention of deceiving anyone.

       I don't just call people who disagree with me the s-word. I only use it when I legitimately think it is the case. There are actually PR agencies on reddit who have hired people who influence threads, as evidenced by the original post. It should be OK to call these people out for what they are.

       Yes, of course there are PR agencies, as well as government agencies plying their trade anywhere there are groups of people to be influenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       But making the determination about which users are engaging in this behavior requires some discernment.  You appear to be using a shotgun method which is hitting a whole swath of people.  I know for certain this approach has resulted in a false positive because you have applied this label to me (of course I have no way to prove this to you absolutely).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is ok to call people out, but you had better do some investigation so you can present a case.  Simply labeling everyone who makes a comment that doesn't fit your view of a subject a shill only discredits you.

       Sure, you seem much more reasonable and I regret calling you that now. But they often work in groups and it's not the first time I've had this happen. So out of the 6 people I called out, maybe only 5 of them were. Sorry about that.

       On that I disagree...yes...we should be able to discuss the merits of the issues, but often you are dealing with professional who have studied the issue anf the psychology much more than you (they get paid to do it) and have a strategy to derail your argument, even having multiple posters attacking you from different angles...

       There's plenty of evidence, like pushing bullshit theories that are obviously false to dilute the quality of posts and conversations, to drive people away. That's a telltale sign, along with ignoring what people say and being deliberately agitating. It's not just wild guessing, there are plenty of obvious signs.

       I can get attacked on all sides in a thread by anti-semites who can't distinguish Isreal's policies from Jewish people at large, but I don't think they're hired guns by a PR firm. Nor would I have any evidence if I believed that.

       So you were wrong?  This is why shill/troll accusations are against the rules here.  You can not be sure, and people like you have a history of pulling the trigger on calling someone a shill way too fast.  Hence the rule!
      </p>

       We have much more open and honest conversations when we forbid ourselves from taking the easy way out of discussing an idea we don't agree with.  Aka calling the other user a shill and writing them off.

      <p>
       Now please come to terms with this and agree to follow the rules, appeal your ban on magnora7 and agree to stop the shill accusations or I'll be forced to report your accounts for ban evasion.

       , even if it seems overwhelmingly true based on evidence. So I guess I will just avoid using that word and call them "social media PR influencers" or something else less emotional. I've also been banned from worldnews several different times for using the s-word. I think it's just not allowed on reddit because it's too on-the-nose.

       wow!  it's just a simple python script.  only hard part would be creating the accounts, which I guess you could pay one of those indian companies that charge 5cents an hour to do that for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       sounds like easy money.
      </p>
      <p>
       but I guess the bigger question is why?  does it really matter if something has upvotes?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the bigger market is the downvote...  A downvote could control immediate information.  An upvote still has to pass the human bullshit test to get somewhere as bots can only help so much.  Also many redditors will notice patterns.  So I'd gather they should really be charging $800 for down votes.  Then one can control the flow of content.

       Hmm. That might be a business model worth pursuing. Seems easy enough to code. Only trick seems to be registering enough accounts to cycle through. That and it's probably against Reddit's ToS...

       I think the IP spoofing would be the hardest part, each account has to vote with a different IP address for reddit to not detect it, I think. And it's definitely against the ToS

       buying private proxies in bulk isn't that expensive, you can assign an IP for every account and run the bots to vote random stuff for credibility, and even comment by copy-pasting one of the buried comments with a slight change (misspelling some words for example)... you'll still need to pass the captcha while it's possible to pass by code it'll actually be more time effecient to register the 1000 account manually (making the bot fill everything and you cycle through captchas). after all that is done you can let the bots upvote individual posts of your choosing.

       On the subject of getting stuff to the front page, I consider it a goal/hobby, for certain topics populist , for me its about knowing the audience and what time they will be infront of their computers, so for a good worldnews story, with 2000+ upvotes, I would try to upload it at 6am GMT (with a good title of course), knowing that the Brits will read it on the way to work, then this will get it into the 400+ vote zone which will suck in the NYC commuters on the East coast when they wake up, so by the time it gets to LA morning time it will be just under 1800+ votes.
Have you noticed how the Times of Delhi is also popular on reddit? lots of middleclass Indians are using social media and they are using the same english language platforms as us, and soon I am sure that India will could be the big upvote karma farm, however I cant be bothered to recalculate my schedule for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I put stuff on the front page for LOLs with my own brainpower and rationale behind it, however some people would boast of that and put it down on their CV/resume for that dream PR job.

       I know this comment is buried, but it's meant for OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've unsubscribed from
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and more recently
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       and many other related subs a long time ago as they became obviously gamed/controlled.  I don't even go back to check on them anymore.  I'm not going to lie though, with so many opinions and every stupid person having one, it's not particularly easy to tell who (beside the mods) are actively participating in the gaming versus who isn't aware.  Those comments read very similarly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you want to see who buys upvotes and what the potential purchasees look like just to get a handle on the mechanism, I think that the most obvious sub that's in my current array is
       <a href="/r/comics">
        /r/comics
       </a>
       . There are so many comic artists out there - and plenty that are quite popular for good reasons and deserve every upvote that they get.  And plenty who are pretty decent and get almost nothing at all.  So someone having 4000 upvotes isn't unreasonable - see lunar baboon - but rising is often correlated with having previous success at rising rather than individual talent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But an increasing number of the comics that make the front page are super ordinary, while some gems are buried.  While that's always going to happen, and I acknowledge my own perspective being further and further away from the main stream of funny, there appear to be some patterns. Once you have, say 100 upvotes in the first hour, you're already in the tops few of
       <a href="/r/comics">
        /r/comics
       </a>
       and likely heading to the front of
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       .  Once on the front page, people continue to upvote - since people have the hive mind to promote what others already like.  And it would be easier to hide additional manipulated votes at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you want to see what I think is the manipulation mechanism in action, look for a comic with no comments and 100 to 300 upvotes in the first two hours.  That indicates popularity with no participation (which makes this sub different from the political stuff which gets insta-comments).  You'll also want to see comics that are posted right around 8am - which is prime rising time.  These guys know what they're doing to get the highest rise early and stay on the front page all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then look at some of the work that gets 2 to 5 votes, and you'll realize that the quality is often quite similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you can find these upvoters on the above comment, then perhaps you can profile what a 'bought' link looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Optimistic me says that maybe reddit can learn to shut it out.  Pessimistic me says that Reddit can learn to harness the $$ potential for their short term profit and long-term site detriment.

       Unfortunately reddit has made it clear they're not interested in shutting out this type of business, because it is profitable. Reddit is primarily and advertising platform at this point, and that's not going to change. Reddit is going the same was as digg.com, it's just a matter of time now.

       Thank you for this submission.  It's something I think many of us are aware of, but something that has taken us slowly and that many people pretend doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read this yesterday, but the
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/comics/comments/3qjqpy/bro_fight_oc/">
        stupid Bro comic currently #1
       </a>
       is what made me revisit.  The comments are fairly negative on it, too, showing that it clearly isn't full-Reddit opinion.  Of course there are a few 'defenders' of why it's top in comics as well, which I'm sure is convenient.  Yet there it sits, naked for all to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the main issue right now is that there isn't a decent competing platform like Reddit was to Digg, back when Digg tanked.  Voat still sucks in slowness.  Mostly what I do is just get news elsewhere again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've just devolved into the subreddits, reading stories about some sort of specialty or another.  The backbone system is still a good one, but the gaming and the moderation of the big subs has put the writing on the wall.

       Great points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Voat sucks not only in slowness though, but it has decayed very quickly in the same way it took reddit years to decay. This kind of troll-rot has become a popular tactic to destroy social media sites, and unless proper counter-measures are put in place in the news sites, they're going to keep failing, each faster than the last.

       But you're right.  The only thing really holding voat together in any way is reddit hate and calling out current issues.  Of course, I remember how we used to make fun of how terrible digg was too.

       So funny addendum to this story.  I reported the comic for 'Vote Manipulation' not expecting much, after I wrote this out.  Came back a couple hours later and it was gone.

       Yeah, no one is saying you can buy votes from reddit. We are talking about that grey market. I don't think it's very risky because most people don't even know it's happening. One of those open secret sorts of deals.

       How sad. "Guerrilla Marketing" is pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was in College, I was out and about reading on a nice fall day, the "red bull team" approaches me, and gives me a free red bull, only catch--I have to drink it now, where I was--on a bench in the heart of campus, 5 minutes before classes get out and thousands of people will see me studiously reading and enjoying a red bull. As, magically, was most other folks reading outside that day. I accepted, red bull was like $4 a can on campus. But I felt a little sad inside. A few years later, I'm out with some, friends at a bar in Brooklyn, and this woman in her mid to late 20s, comes up to me, and says she is a brand rep for Pabst, and offers to buy all my drinks, if I switch to Pabst Blue ribbon. She didn't offer my friends-which really offended my now wife--but I said fuck it, why not, as I was about $50 into my cups. And that's how Pabst became the "hipster beer." (Although smart money says more Tecate is sold in "cool" BROOKLYN than any other cheap brew). Free beer and liquor make the corporate sponsored parties of the world go round. Fuck, now I could go for some free red bull...lol. But, in all seriousness, I've never started to buy stuff I was asked to advertise, or that is too aggressively advertised to me. As a non-traditional media consumer, I will get stuck watching the same movie trailer or car ad a dozen times a day...the over exposure makes me not want to watch shit (fuck you OJ Simpson mini-series). Dave Chappelle was spot on when he was talking about Coke vs. Pepsi.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do wish Dave Chappelle was making funny videos, I'd up vote them for free.

       Upvoting can backfire. For example I rarely look at the upvoted posts on this subreddit. Because it's often just "sheeple" bait. Another layer of smoke for the masses.

       Without a doubt this sub has seen a pretty dramatic shift to Russian propagandists.  This sub has more critical thinkers in it then just about any other place on Reddit, and I find it very hard to believe that magically, users here are organically loosing their ability to critically examine information, and blindly accept Russian propaganda on its face.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several users here who could post a link that only says Russia is great, America is bad, that will get 150+ upvotes.  That's not organic, and likely the result of paid up votes.

       Yes, yes it is propaganda.  The people of Ukraine stopped rioting when the "neo-Nazi thugs" took power, and in fact the same "neo-Nazi thugs" actually disbanded the police special forces group as one of their first acts of power. How could the United States engineer a take over when there's a 1 million+ young Ukrainians on the street demanding the Russian backed president leave?

       It's still my opinion though, and it is backed up by facts.  Look at the number of RT, Sputnik, and other Russian government controlled "news" outlets that make it to the front page of this sub every day.  Increasingly more and more.  Just pay attention.

       But a majority of Ukranians didn't want that to happen.  Maybe in Crimea, but every Ukrainian I've ever spoken with in real life, wants to be a part of Europe, not Russia.  So this is going against the will of the Ukrainian people, but yet it's ok with you?

       Vic Nuland is a diplomat.  Of course the United States, as any country is going to want to influence who comes to power.  The fact remains the rioting and demonstrations stopped in Kiev, even after this tape was released.  The people of Ukraine are obviously ok with this.

       You're pretty transparent too there bud.  I'm not openly defending Nazis, I'm openly defending the right of the Ukrainian people to determine who they want in power, even if it isn't a Russian backed president which you are defending, which is against the will of the Ukrainian people.

        I believe you are wrong and the fact is more that US media has shown to have less than zero credibility, while Russians (e.g. Putin) at least are telling truths that resonate with the facts and prior actions.

      <p>
       When it comes to US policy, and US actions, yes, I'll give you that they are more willing to call it like it is, but when it comes to actions they are doing, like Ukraine, then no, I don't agree with you.  The Ukrainian revolution was a revolution of young Ukranians revolting against the Russian backed president.  I personally spoke with more then 7 of them this summer, who had all taken jobs in the United States over the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       They all wanted to be a part of Europe.  This was completely organic at the beginning, but yet Russia propagates that these young people were simply pawns for the west.  That's just not the case, and no Russian government "news" outlet ever reported anything like the truth when it came to Ukraine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The news media in Russia is run by the Russian government, for the Russian government, to further the agenda of the Russian government, period.  Look at what Sibel Edmonds said about RT.

      <blockquote>

        However, believe me or not, RT can be as bad as any US mainstream media. It has its own agenda, objectives, spin... I quit accepting invitations to their program about ... a year ago.

       I always thought it was quite weird I got so many downvotes for saying Pyrex Plate shattered and cut me badly when I removed from a Microwave.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's a pretty common occurrence and everyone knows Pyrex isn't what it was anymore, I'm pretty sure the only people motivated to down vote such a comment are Pyrex themselves. It was honestly a real occurrence by the way I needed stitches.

       You joke but unless Pyrex fanboys are a real thing it really looks like the company is actually paying people to shush up these stories.

       There are people getting seriously injured because of this company now and to be honest deaths wouldn't surprise me in the least the stuffs downright dangerous and not fit for purpose.

       Basically they went from a company with a good product to a company that makes completely dangerous junk that

       Apparently, World Kitchen, LLC has been heavily engaging social media for its Pyrex products since at least 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a scientist, I think it's criminal to take a brand that was once synonymous with its composition (a high quality borosilicate glass) and replace it, while maintaining the same branding with a product with very poor thermal resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, I have only had good experiences with my Anchor Hocking glass products, though nearly all US-manufactured glass bakeware, regardless of manufacturer, is tempered soda-lime-glass.

       ....... Great argument... It's fairly well known within people who know a little bit about the Internet. You can buy upvotes and Twitter followers, favorites, retweets. Facebook likes, YouTube views, fake app reviews. The list go on. It might not be common knowledge but is fairly well known and your assumption it is some kind of conspiracy is very naive.

       They sell smaller packages too, like 100 upvotes. You could start a subreddit with no one in it, make one post, and give it a hundred upvotes for $40 or something. That'd prove it more cheaply, but it wouldn't be as exciting.

       I made a post that got super derailed. Then I made a post calling out these people as likely being shills. Then I got banned for it. Then I had to ask to get unbanned and promise never to call out a shill or make any accusations toward any user on this subreddit ever again, basically. But I got my account back.

       Been here 8 years, I've watched the whole site slowly go down in flames. Things used to be so good about 5 years ago.. oh well. Another site will come along eventually and the cycle will start anew. Although I hope the new site has the capability for the community to label shills for easy detection, because that's really what's ruining voat and reddit

       My own opinion is calling people shills is fucking lazy and detrimental to the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cant argue against someone without literally saying "You are wrong because you are paid to be here" then you dont understand your arguments and need to better defend them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be able to simply and without aggression make your points and defend them regardless of what the other commenters are doing. When you start calling people shills you will sound
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ITT: Shills. Sorry I even tried, geez.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is weak and sounds like whining. I dont mean to offend but all these fucking people bitching about shills would be more productive if they learned how to debate properly.

       Same thing happened on Myspace. Accounts with lower account IDs would show up higher on the show all friends list. Companies would buy up the super low numbers for high price do their brand would be at the top of everyone's friend list after they redesigned the user account.

       You pay a company 400 bucks to get you 500k views, they make 400 bucks, youtube then pays you 500 bucks. You just made 100 bucks net and you will go back to them again spend another 400 bucks to get another 500k views and another 500 bucks, now you have 200 in net profits.
