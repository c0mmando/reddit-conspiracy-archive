       The controversial TPP agreement that international companies are trying to force on the USA is just like the agreements that the British forced on the Chinese after the Opium Wars which forced opium addiction on a whole nation.

        A History of the Forced Opium Addiction of China
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        British Prime Minister Palmerston wrote Crown Commissiner Captain Charles Elliot that the treaty didn't go far enough. He said it should have been rejected out of hand because: "After all, our naval power is so strong that we can tell the Emperor what we mean to hold rather than what he would cede. We must demand the admission of opium into China's interior as an article of lawful commerce and increase the indemnity payments and British access to several additional Chinese ports."
       </p>
       <p>
        Thus, China not only had to pay Sassoon the cost of his dumped opium, but reimburse England an unheard sum of 21 million pounds for the cost of the war!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That last clause above is what the TPP says must happen if a country bans a harmful product. The country must pay the company damages!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This gave the Sassoon's monopoly rights to distribute opium in port cities. However, even this was not good enough and Sassoon demanded the right to sell opium throughout the nation. The Manchus resisted and the British Army again attacked in the Second Opium War fought 1858 - 1860. Palmerston declared that all of interior China must be open for uninterrupted opium traffic.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ahh open and "free" trade does its destruction !
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what happens when a nation loses it sovereignty and can't stop foreign imports and control its borders to stop harmful products!
