       My thoughts exactly! We are actually quite powerful if we stand together. We can destroy them and their stupid pyramid structure in a matter of days. They are afraid, that's why they hire so many body guards. I dare one of them to come out in the open and face the masses.

       !! :) they are obvs obsessed with us and what we think. I mean if they wanted to go build their own opulent country they have all the resources they need rt now. they could leave us behind destitute - done. but no -- instead they want to put all their effort into staying and trying to get us to not believe they are still stealing from us - and meanwhile they spend all their time paying attention to us, and studying our response to the latest propaganda -- haha. if that's how they want to spend their super rich lives - well just keep paying attention. suckers.

       I always vote, but I know my vote doesn't really count. But in the grocery store? Absolutely it counts. And I can tell it counts as I see more and more of the foods I want on the shelves, despite the constant flow of cash into PR for Big Ag. I'll buy two or three of something if I think they're in trouble, inventory reports on from local stores actually account for something. If it sells, it'll be on the shelves.

        Egg Lobby/USDA/Unilever attack on Hampton Creek Foods
       </a>
       scandal made me go out and buy like three tubs of Just Mayo. I mean, that's really something, because going to the cash register with three tubs of mayonnaise says something about about a person, and it's what it says is...not good, haha.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I got into a good discussion with the cashier about the federally-funded Egg Lobby and Unilever colluding with the USDA to unfairly push smaller businesses out of the market (plus the death threats!). And now we have another person buying the goofy mayo to spite corruption and collusion by big businesses that refuse to compete in the market fairly.

       Grocery store activism for the socially backwards. And it can of course be extrapolated to other consumer goods and services. We do have power, if we didn't, corporations wouldn't spend billions trying to influence us. And they wouldn't be so desperate as to use some of the tactics they've been using lately...harassment as marketing, oof, it's really backfiring for them.

       Do they care about us as individuals? No. They are about where we spend our money, and how we spend our time.

       Stop caring about what goes on, outside of your own community. Support your neighbors, farmers, and try to live as self sustainable as possible, without disconnecting yourself from society and the grid.

       <p>
        Under modern conditions of political advertising and manipulation, it has become possible to talk of the engineering of consent by an elite of experts and professional politicians. Consent that is thus engineered is difficult to distinguish in any fundamental way from the consent that supports modern totalitarian governments. Were the manipulated voter to become the normal voter, the government he supports could hardly be said to rest on his consent in any traditional sense of that word.
