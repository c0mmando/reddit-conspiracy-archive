        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;Are you intellectually and emotionally prepared to confront a new twist to Israeli claims for identity and a political homeland? If you are, test to what extent you have an open mind. The article, Leaked report: Israel acknowledges Jews in fact Khazars; Secret plan for reverse migration to Ukraine, will present a position that is difficult to imagine. When political necessity confronts hallowed claims, what will a determined Zionist do to sacrifice their fundamental assertion for legitimacy? Ponder the significance and full extent of the implications.</p>

<p>“Israel seems finally to have thrown in the towel. A blue-ribbon team of scholars from leading research institutions and museums has just issued a secret report to the government, acknowledging that European Jews are in fact Khazars. (Whether this would result in yet another proposal to revise the words to “Hatikvah” remains to be seen.) At first sight, this would seem to be the worst possible news, given the Prime Minister’s relentless insistence on the need for Palestinian recognition of Israel as a “Jewish state” and the stagnation of the peace talks. But others have underestimated him at their peril. An aide quipped, when life hands you an etrog, you build a sukkah.</p>

<p>Speaking off the record, he explained, “We first thought that admitting we are really Khazars was one way to get around Abbas’s insistence that no Jew can remain in a Palestinian state. Maybe we were grasping at straws. But when he refused to accept that, it forced us to think about more creative solutions. The Ukrainian invitation for the Jews to return was a godsend.”</p>

<p>Oy vey, woe is me. How such an admission could be seen as anything but a capitulation to the critics of the legitimacy for the state of Israel? Another critical viewpoint by Wayne Madsen in Israel’s Secret Plan for a “Second Israel” in Ukraine, is the perfect summary of the precarious creditability dilemma that such an admission presents.</p>

<p>“Zionists have long argued that the land claimed by Israel was the biblical birthright of the Jewish people who were forced from the land in a so-called diaspora after repeated conquests by various empires. Proof that Ashkenazi Jews, which make up a majority of the Israeli Jewish population, have no historical link to Palestine, would call into question the entire premise of Israel as the historical 5,000-year old homeland of the Jewish people.”</p>

<p>As expected, the mere disclosure of such a secret government report has intensified the Christian-Zionists Problem – Khazar DNA, as written earlier this year. Never fear there is no shortage of arguments that attempts to discredit any proponent of Are Ashkenazi Jews Descended From Khazars?</p>

<p>“But in a new article in the journal Jewish Social Studies, Hebrew University researcher Shaul Stampfer argues there is no evidence from Medieval Jewish, Islamic or Christian texts that such a conversion took place.</p>

<p>“The silence of so many sources about the Khazars’ Judaism is very suspicious,” Stampfer tells Haaretz.”</p>

<p>Ashkenazi&#39;s are indo-European, from Western/Eastern Europe and are the most anti-Semitic people on the face of Earth (convert Jews, frauds, not Semitic).</p>

<p>Once people realize this, the world will be better off. Notice the last fucking 4 letters.....</p>

<p>Here we show that all four major founders, ~40% of Ashkenazi mtDNA variation, have ancestry in prehistoric Europe, rather than the Near East or Caucasus. Furthermore, most of the remaining minor founders share a similar deep European ancestry. Thus the great majority of Ashkenazi maternal lineages were not brought from the Levant, as commonly supposed, nor recruited in the Caucasus, as sometimes suggested, but assimilated within Europe. </p>
