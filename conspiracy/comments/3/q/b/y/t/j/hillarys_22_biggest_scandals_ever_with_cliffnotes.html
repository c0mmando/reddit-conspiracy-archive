       <strong>
        1) Clintons turn IRS into ‘gestapo’
       </strong>
       <br/>
       IRS audits were conducted against individuals and groups who caused problems for the administration. (groups like the Heritage Foundation, the National Rifle Association, Concerned Women of America, Citizens Against Government Waste, National Review, American Spectator, the National Center for Public Policy Research, the American Policy Center, American Cause, Citizens for Honest Government, Progress and Freedom Foundation, David Horowitz’s Center for the Study of Popular Culture and the Western Journalism Center.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2) Covering Bill’s dirty deeds
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Clintons have been accused of hiring private investigators to not only dig up dirt on perceived adversaries – such as Juanita Broaddrick, the woman allegedly raped by Bill, and other abused women such as Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones – but to stalk, scare and threaten them.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3) Looting the White House
       </strong>
       <br/>
       When the Clintons left 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in 2001, they.. came under fire when they reportedly tried to take $190,000 in gifts and furnishings from the presidential mansion. During their time in the White House, the Clintons also reportedly auctioned off and sold taxpayer-financed government goods and services in exchange for political campaign contributions and personal profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        4) Filegate: FBI files on GOP enemies
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Clinton duo was involved in a scandal known as “Filegate” in which they illegally obtaining FBI files on perceived adversaries, most of whom served in previous Republican administrations.
       <br/>
       “In an effort to discredit the women who charged President Clinton with sexual misconduct, personal files and papers were illegally obtained and released. The courts found, under the Privacy Act, that the privacy of Linda Tripp and Kathleen Willey had been violated,” a Judicial Watch report said, citing just a few of more than 900 relevant files. Judicial Watch said Hillary had been linked “directly to the center” of the controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        5) Hillary’s ‘Muslim Brotherhood princess’
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Huma Abedin, who served as Hillary’s longtime deputy chief of staff and has worked with her for nearly 20 years, has known ties to the Muslim Brotherhood – a group bent on “destroying Western civilization from within”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        6) Vince Foster’s 1993 death
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Vince Foster was deputy White House counsel and Hillary’s friend and law partner who had connections to the Travelgate and Whitewater scandals. In 1993, Foster was found dead in a park with a fatal gunshot wound to his mouth.
       <br/>
       Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr concluded Foster’s death was a suicide. However, as WND reported in 2003, one of Starr’s key investigators challenged the official line, insisting the probe’s result was predetermined, only a few plotters were required to engineer the result, the crime scene was altered and that major newspaper editors killed stories by reporters pursuing the truth.
       <br/>
       The night of [Foster's] death, Hillary launched one of the most shameful – and illegal – cover-ups of her entire career. She sent two of her most trusted White House loyalists – Maggie Williams, the First Lady’s chief of staff, and Patsy Thomasson, who was in charge of White House administration – into Foster’s office to retrieve embarrassing and incriminating documents related to Whitewater and Hillary’s other personal affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        7) Emailgate: ‘She should go to prison for this’
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In March 2015, WND reported Hillary kept all her official correspondence as secretary of state, as well as her personal emails, on a private email server located at her home – instead of using the government-mandated process while serving in the high appointed position. Her email system was unsecured for months while she used it for government business.
       <br/>
       The Hill reported Hillary did not encrypt her private email service with a digital certificate for the first three months of her tenure as secretary of state.” That was while she was traveling to China, Egypt, Israel, Japan and South Korea.
       <br/>
       J. Michael Waller – a longtime consultant to government entities ranging from the secretary of defense to the U.S. Senate to the U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory – told WND “This is the national-security equivalent of drunken driving.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        8) Chinagate: Sale of high-tech secrets
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Technology companies allegedly made donations of millions of dollars to various Democratic Party entities, including President Bill Clinton’s 1996 re-election campaign, in return for permission to sell high-tech secrets to China. Bernard Schwartz and his Loral Space &amp; Communication Ltd. later allegedly “helped China to identify the cause of [a rocket failure], thereby advancing China’s missile program and threatening U.S. national security,” according to records.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        9) Travelgate: Always room for friends
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In the Travelgate scandal, the staff of the White House travel office was fired to make way for Clinton cronies, including Bill’s 25-year-old cousin, who was reportedly promised the position of office director.
       <br/>
       Hillary allegedly fired seven employees and gave the positions to her Arkansas friends. According to the Washington Post, there was an effort to award a White House airline contract to a Clinton friend.
       <br/>
       Also, Hillary reportedly had the FBI investigate the former head of the travel office, Billy Dale, who was fired without notice and removed from White House grounds. Dale was charged with embezzlement but found not guilty of the crime in 1995. He was later audited by the IRS.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        10) Whitewater: Jail for friends, but not Clintons
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Whitewater investigation by independent counsel Kenneth Starr began in 1994 with accusations of impropriety against the Clintons and others concerning improper campaign contributions, political and financial favors, and tax benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        11) ‘Landing under sniper fire’ in Bosnia
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In her March 17, 2008, foreign-policy speech on Iraq, then-Sen. Hillary Clinton recalled a trip she made to Tuzla, Bosnia, in 1996.
       <br/>
       “I remember landing under sniper fire,” Hillary said of her visit while she was first lady. “There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.”
       <br/>
       But news footage of her visit revealed her “sniper fire” claim wasn’t just exaggerated. It was completely false. And Hillary had repeated the claim several times, including during her time on the presidential campaign trail in 2007.

       <strong>
        12) Hillary's 'missing' law firm billing records
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In 1994, federal investigators subpoenaed Hillary's billing records from her days as a partner in the Rose Law firm during the Watergate scandal. The White House said it didn't have the 115 pages of files.
       <br/>
       While Hillary claimed she had a minor role in the affair, the Washington Examiner reported that "when the records mysteriously turned up in the White House in 1996, they showed she met repeatedly with key figures in the scandal."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        13) Pardongate: Hillary Senate contributions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Before Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001, he granted numerous controversial pardons – including to convicted tax evader Marc Rich, whose wife made significant contributions to Hillary's 2000 Senate campaign and the Clinton presidential library.
       <br/>
       The Associated Press reported that Rich had.. "crimes that could have earned him more than 300 years in prison." Rich fled to Switzerland in 1983 after his indictment and remained on the FBI's Most Wanted List until President Clinton pardoned him.
       <br/>
       Also, Hillary's brothers, Tony and Hugh Rodham, reportedly received large amounts of money from people who were pardoned by Bill Clinton. Hillary said she and Bill were unaware of the scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        14) Hillary's cash cows and 9,987 percent profit
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In March 1994, it was revealed Hillary – with no previous experience – had made massive profits from cattle futures trading between 1978 and 1979, when Bill Clinton's salary as Arkansas attorney general had been modest. She reportedly made $99,537 in profit on a $1,000 investment (a 9,987 percent profit) in just nine months because of a highly placed connection at Tyson Foods, which was the largest employer in Arkansas and a big Clinton donor.
       <br/>
       The New York Times reported: "During Mr. Clinton's tenure as Governor, Tyson benefited from several state decisions, including favorable environmental rulings, $9 million in state loans, and the placement of company executives on important state boards. … The commodities trades were the most successful investment the Clintons ever made.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        15) Clinton body count: 'You find dead people'
       </strong>
       <br/>
       "The Clinton body count," first published in WND and later circulated by Linda Tripp to Monica Lewinsky, is a collection of names of people associated with Clinton administration scandals who have died mysterious and often violent deaths. Reporter David Bresnahan broke the story of the list during the summer of 1997 while researching his book, "Cover Up: The Art and Science of Political Deception."
       <br/>
       "I started looking into all the various deaths of people that were involved in various Clinton scandals," Bresnahan said. "I started to investigate the entire picture instead of just one focused event. If you look at one scandal, you’ll find one dead guy. When you investigate all Clinton scandals, you find similarities, you find common tactics, you find common actions and you find dead people."
       <br/>
       The list was not just a source of terror among sworn enemies of the administration. It was an even greater terror for those close to Clinton – for those closest, it appeared, died younger and more inexplicably than those on the outside looking in. In his research, Bresnahan came up with more than one list.  "Not only did I find a list of dead people, but I also found that there are over 100 people who have refused to testify. There is also a list of people who have gone to jail. There are 45 people who have gone to jail, some of them White House staff, Cabinet members as well as people from the Justice Department. So many of those (lists) developed when I started to pursue the big picture."
      </p>

       <strong>
        16) Hillary's radical pal, Saul Alinsky
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        17) Hillary laughs about defending child rapist
       </strong>
       <br/>
       In the video she is asked, "As a lawyer, you defended the rapist of a 12-year-old girl, calling the victim 'emotionally unstable' and saying that girls have a tendency to 'exaggerate or romanticize sexual experiences especially when they come from disorganized families.'"
       <br/>
       Clinton said: "When I was a 27-year-old attorney doing legal aid work at the law school where I taught in Fayetteville, Arkansas, I was appointed by the local judge to represent a criminal defendant accused of rape. I asked to be relieved of that responsibility. But I was not and I had a professional duty to represent my client to the best of my ability, which I did.
       <br/>
       However, she did not address the reports of unearthed recordings in which she almost boasts of knowing of her client's guilt and laughing about the case.
  "It was a fascinating case, it was a very interesting case," Clinton said on the tape. "This guy was accused of raping a 12-year-old. Course he claimed that he didn't, and all this stuff. … I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs." She laughed at the statement.
       <br/>
       The Washington Free Beacon report on the recordings also confirmed she was laughing several other times while discussing the case, including "when discussing the crime lab's accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied Taylor to the crime."

        18) Hill ca$hes in: Iranian fundraising
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Hillary received funds from an arm of the Iranian government and hired a convicted Iranian-American multimillionaire with ties to Tehran as her national campaign finance director in 2008. The Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation accepted $30,000 between April 2005 and March 2006 and another contribution of between $25,000 and $50,000 in 2008 from the New York-based Alavi Foundation, which U.S. government prosecutors have identified as an arm of the Iranian government.
       <br/>
       Rachel Ehrenfeld, director of the American Center for Democracy, spelled out the problem with the Clinton Foundation receiving funds from the Alavi Foundation in a Jan. 5, 2009, article published by Forbes.
       <br/>
       "Alavi's contribution [in 2008] to Clinton came just two days after the Treasury Department also designated Alavi's partner, the New York-based Assa Corp., as a terrorist entity, and the New York Southern District's attorney seized and forfeited its assets."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        19) Clinton Foundation: Scandals keep coming
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Clintons appear to have siphoned off tens of millions of dollars annually from funds the Bill, Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation has received from a United Nations-sponsored program that uses levies on airline tickets to help HIV/AIDs victims in the Third World, charges Wall Street analyst and investor Charles Ortel. The Clinton Foundation also reportedly distributed useless drugs to AIDS patients in Third-World countries.
       <br/>
       Although Hillary was appointed to the board of directors of the Clinton Foundation in 2013, after she had resigned as secretary of state, Ortel contends she is complicit in what he has described as systematic financial fraud warranting a criminal investigation.
       <br/>
       After months of tedious investigation, Ortel has concluded the foundation has filed financial and tax forms that were materially misleading, incomplete and in error with the goal of enriching the Clintons and their close associates. Ortel alleges Hillary advanced an “inurement” scheme – enriching oneself through a nonprofit organization – in complicity with her husband by positioning various key associates within the Clinton Foundation structure while she served as U.S. senator from New York and subsequently as secretary of state under President Obama.
       <br/>
       Hillary has said, "I am very proud of the work the Foundation does," but just 9 percent of the Foundation's money went to charity in 2013. Before Hillary completed her first year as President Obama’s secretary of state, Ortel calculates $17 million went missing from Clinton Foundation financial reports.
      </p>
      <h2>
       The New York Post recently reported Hillary's former chief of staff and counselor, Cheryl Mills, "knows where the bodies are buried" in many Clinton scandals, has been at Hillary's side since the 1990s and "has a long track record of hiding Clinton documents." Mills, who has officially been accused of perjury and obstruction of justice, is a key member of the Clinton Foundation board.
      </h2>
      <p>
       Even by the standards of arms deals between the United States and Saudi Arabia, this one was enormous. A consortium of American defense contractors led by Boeing would deliver $29 billion worth of advanced fighter jets to the United States' oil-rich ally in the Middle East.
       <br/>
       The deal appeared to collide with the State Department’s documented concerns about the repressive policies of the Saudi royal family. But now, in late 2011, Hillary Clinton’s State Department was formally clearing the sale, asserting that it was in the national interest.
       <br/>
       In the years before Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia contributed at least $10 million to the Clinton Foundation and Boeing -- the defense contractor that manufactures one of the fighter jets the Saudis-- contributed $900,000
       <br/>
       The Saudi deal was one of dozens of arms sales approved by Hillary Clinton’s State Department that placed weapons in the hands of governments that had also donated money to the Clinton family philanthropic empire, an International Business Times investigation has found.
       <br/>
       Under Clinton's leadership, the State Department approved $165 billion worth of commercial arms sales to 20 nations whose governments have given money to the Clinton Foundation, according to an IBTimes analysis of State Department and foundation data. That figure -- derived from the three full fiscal years of Clinton’s term as Secretary of State (from October 2010 to September 2012) -- represented nearly double the value of American arms sales made to the those countries and approved by the State Department during the same period of President George W. Bush’s second term.
       <br/>
       The Clinton-led State Department also authorized $151 billion of separate Pentagon-brokered deals for 16 of the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation. This resulted in a 143 percent increase in completed sales to those nations over the same time frame during the Bush administration and an 80 percent increase in such sales to all countries over the same time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        20) Benghazi: 4 American lives lost
       </strong>
       <br/>
       On Sept. 11, 2012, while Hillary was secretary of state, Islamic militants attacked a U.S. special mission in Benghazi, Libya, and murdered U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management officer Sean Smith. Two CIA contractors, Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, were also killed.
       <br/>
       In the months leading up to the attack, Hillary's State Department cut security in Libya.  Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., accused Hillary of "dereliction of duty" that led to the deaths of the four Americans.
       <br/>
       "The State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya," Johnson wrote in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. "Although no one can say with certainty, I firmly believe a relatively small contingent of armed military guards would have prevented the attack, and those four lives would not have been lost."

       Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other senior Obama officials were given reports within hours of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack. In those memos, the DOD described details of a plan 10 days in advance “to kill as many Americans as possible.”
  Nonetheless, Hillary falsely blamed it on "rage and violence over an awful Internet video" when she spoke at a ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base on Sept. 14, 2012, as the remains of the four Americans were returned to the U.S.

       To this day, Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., says the State Department has failed to comply with requests for information about Benghazi.

        21) Peter Franklin Paul: Another Hillary friend goes to prison
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Paul, a former business partner of Spider-Man creator Stan Lee who sued Bill for fraud and accused Hillary of hiding nearly $2 million in Senate campaign donations, alleged they sabotaged the media company he formed with Lee to get out of a $17 million agreement made with Bill Clinton to serve as an international promoter for the company after he left the White House. Paul was indicted in June 2001 for manipulating the price of the stock in his company, Stan Lee Media, as it was collapsing. A judge determined Paul didn’t profit from the attempt to save his company, but he accepted a plea bargain and served three years in prison. WND reported in 2012 that Paul charged Attorney General Eric Holder and his Justice Department obstructed justice by reneging on a sentencing agreement.
       <br/>
       “Hillary is carrying out her promise to finally destroy my family to punish me for exposing the corruption that elected her to the Senate,” Paul told WND at the time.

        22) Watergate: Fired for being a 'liar'
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Hillary actually played a role in the Watergate saga, and her actions as a young attorney may have set the tone for her career.
       <br/>
       The 27-year-old Clinton was fired from the staff of the House Judiciary committee investigating the Watergate scandal in 1974. She was fired by her supervisor, lifelong Democrat Jerry Zeifman, who called her a liar and much worse.
       <br/>
       "She was an unethical, dishonest lawyer," he said. "She conspired to violate the Constitution, the rules of the House, the rules of the committee and the rules of confidentiality."
       <br/>
       Zeifman also refused to give Clinton a letter of recommendation, making her one of only three employees he snubbed during his 17-year career.
