<p>Not to mention the following:</p>

<p>More recently, a study from this series was published in which conclusions were drawn based on only 2 control animals. Those control animals underwent brain shrinkage during a critical period of infant growth. In other words, there was something seriously wrong with the control animals and, hence, the entire study. The study (and subsequent discussions by groups such as SafeMinds) spun the brain shrinkage around to claim that the “The vaccinated primates also showed altered maturation of their brains’s [sic] amygdalas.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the guy who sowed the original seeds of doubt for the autism-vaccine link, Andrew Wakefield, had filed patent for supposedly &quot;safer&quot; form of the vaccine that, no surprise, <em>not cause austism.</em></p>

<p>The woman who led the study in the OPs post, Laura Hewitson . . . wait for it. . .has filed a claim against vaccines based on behalf of her child.</p>

<p>This whole thing comes from someone lying in order to sow seeds of doubt about vaccines to make money. . .and the study you are defending right now was made by a woman with a glaring conflict of interest.</p>

<p>What makes more sense, a few people with clear motivation to lie distorting the truth and being called out on it because their faking is obvious. . .or some massive covert campaign by pharmaceutical companies, spanning the entire global, infiltrating independent scientific entities from all parts of the planet, magically being able to create thousands of air-tight studies that have withstood the scrutiny of a zealous group of anti-vaxxers?</p>

<p>Seriously, think about that for a minute. You are the one buying the lies being spread by people who have incentive to do so.</p>

<p>Several studies on vaccine safety are and have been entirely missing.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t good research available for vaccine-related ethylmercury or aluminumin exposure. Why not?</p>

<p>One study could blow this whole thing wide open:</p>

<p>A study conducted by an independent third party (zero CDC, FDA, or pharmaceutical influence) comparing the rates of autism among vaccinated and unvaccinated children with the current vaccine schedule. It can be done. It should be done. It hasn&#39;t been done.</p>

<p>The CDC OPENLY ADMITS that it hasn&#39;t been done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s currently bad science and until they do the above study, the science behind vaccine safety does NOT exist. Anyone who claims otherwise is a liar.</p>

<p>The investigators then assessed social behavior, with testing being carried out by a social tester blinded to the experimental group. The testers were well-trained and experienced; they were also tested for reliability and used standard testing methods:</p>

<p>Infants underwent testing as follows: from birth to 20 d, infants were assessed for the development of neonatal reflexes and perceptual and motor skills; from postnatal day 14 to ∼3.5 mo of age, infants were examined for the development of OCP; from ∼3 to 6 mo of age, animals underwent discrimination learning assessments; from ∼5 to 8 mo of age, animals were assessed for learning set development; and from 30 d to 12 mo of age, animals underwent assessments of behavior before group living. These developmentally appropriate tests are measures of neurodevelopment, learning, cognitive abilities, and social behavior in young macaques (45). At ∼13 mo of age, animals were transferred to juvenile caging where they were group housed (n = 4 males per group) with animals from within their peer group for the duration of the study. All subsequent behavioral data were collected while animals were in their home cage.</p>

<p>Behaviors were defined as passive, exploring, playing, sex, aggression, withdrawal, fear-disturbed, rock-huddle-stop-clasp (strong clasping/grasping of another monkey without play behavior, or self-clasping with arms, legs, hands, or feet, without locomotion and no active inspection of own or other’s body), and stereotypy (repetitive body movements, with or without locomotion, requiring three or more consecutive, repetitive movements). It might be a cliche, but there were no statistically significant differences detected in any of the behaviors measured in any of the experimental groups.</p>

<p>Then, at the conclusion of the experiment, brains from monkeys in the control (N=12), 1990s (N=12), and 2008 groups (N=8) were sectioned for histological and immunohistological examination. The authors examined the brains for neuropathology in parts of the brain previously shown in humans to have changes in autism: the cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala. Try as they might to find differences, Gadad et al failed to find any differences between controls and either of the two vaccinated groups examined. There were no changes in the neurons in these regions. There were no changes in protein levels. Basically, there were no differences from control in the two experimental groups in the volume of the cerebellar hemispheres, the number or density of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. There was no difference in the size of the Purkinje cells. Western blots (a means of detecting proteins with antibodies) failed to find differences in certain Purkinje-cell associated proteins calbindin, GAD-67, and proteins that are markers for different cell types, such as Iba1 (a microglial marker) and GFAP (astrocyte marker). Again, these were all negative. Gadad et al measured these proteins up, down, right, left, and sideways (so to speak), but failed to find any differences.</p>
