        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>An update from Craig, Dave&#39;s brother:</p>

<p>&quot;David was cognizant for most of the day yesterday even with continuous medication and shots of antivan meds that usually put him to sleep for short spells. he seemed to drift only for short periods before coming back. He is so weak and so thin. he maybe weighs 120 to 125 pounds.All of his organs, however, are still functioning normally. He expressed to Mike last night after all of us had left that he wants to do more chemo to try and live longer and that he believes that his cancer is a result of a bio-attack and not from smoking. He also professed a belief of origin different from my own but he is fully aware of what I think was more probable&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, from my understanding Dave was a life-long smoker so there&#39;s no getting around that obviously. However, some have remarked at the strange timing, right as his work was starting to gain some traction.</p>

<p>The whole thing just sucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I wonder is why someone as seemingly &quot;in tune&quot; as him is walking right in step with the medical establishment as far as his treatment goes.  Chemo and radiation <strong>cause cancer</strong>.  In fact, cancer patients who get no treatment at all live longer than cancer patients who get chemo/radiation on average.</p>

<p>Chemo + radiation is a death sentence.  I say this as someone who watched my dad get progressively weaker and sicker from his treatments even as he was &quot;cancer free&quot; and &quot;in remission&quot;.</p>

<p>It really does. In the early years after 9/11, his writing brought clarity, insight, and even humour to a subject that was perplexing to me to say the least. And today, 14 years later, his words still ring true. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was targeted. </p>

<p>I really love this article. First time I read it was probably in 2003. He nails it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome, my friends, to the new and improved police state – the largest, most powerful, and most technologically advanced police state the world has ever seen. With the much-lauded U.S. economy tanking, and unemployment figures hitting their highest levels in years, this will come in very handy for the &#39;powers that be.&#39;</p>

<p>The ugly truth is that all &#39;anti-terrorist&#39; measures are designed not to protect the American people from attack or to protect our &#39;freedoms,&#39; but to protect wealth and power – specifically the unprecedented levels of wealth currently held by corporate America – and to restrict those very freedoms that threaten their hold on that wealth. This American tragedy, in other words, plays directly into the hands of the corporate and military elite of this nation, who have for years been propagandizing for a more belligerent and imperialistic foreign policy and for more repressive legislation here on the homefront. Having been presented with a pretext to enact such measures, it is our leaders – elected or otherwise – who stand to gain the most from yesterday&#39;s bloodshed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how I missed this message from McGowan, dated 14 June, but this sounds pretty fucked up. Of course,  I&#39;d read the news of his cancer through stories linked here and elsewhere, but somehow didn&#39;t catch that he wrote a message on his website.</p>

<p><a href="http://davesweb.cnchost.com/cancer.html">http://davesweb.cnchost.com/cancer.html</a></p>

<p>What&#39;s fucked up is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Just nine weeks ago, on April 14, I presented a lengthy video deconstruction of the 2013 Boston Marathon incident through the Caravan to Midnight radio show/podcast. About a week later (on April 20, of all days), the nearly four-hour video presentation was uploaded to YouTube. Not long after that, someone using the username Phoenix Archangel posted an interesting comment: &quot;John [Wells, the host of the show] always signs off with some of the best advice ever. Speaking of advice: this David McGowan fella really ought to quit smoking. With all the elitist feathers he&#39;s ruffling, he&#39;s likely to come down with a spontaneous case of hitherto undiagnosed stage 4 inoperable Pancreatic cancer.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the link to the presentation, with that comment on top.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgON_5sg4Q&amp;amp;lc=z13kt53rplegzvxap04cdpwzlvqhzvnbc5w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgON_5sg4Q&amp;amp;lc=z13kt53rplegzvxap04cdpwzlvqhzvnbc5w</a></p>

<p>He isn&#39;t dying of the type of cancer Bill Hicks died from, but if I was given that kind of &quot;advice&quot; from someone and then got an incurable cancer just a few weeks after, I&#39;d be a little weirded out.  Sure he smokes, but the timing is too much. </p>
