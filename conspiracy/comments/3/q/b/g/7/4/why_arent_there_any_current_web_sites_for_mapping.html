<p>A bunch of links come up. Now start clicking on them. A lot of them are outdated (the most recent is from like June 2015) or the domains no longer exist. Some have mobile apps you can use to submit reports. When you try to follow the links, they&#39;re gone. </p>

<p>I was sitting on my back porch in Southern California last Saturday night. I saw wave after wave after wave of planes crossing the sky and leaving chemtrails. This was a day after hurricane Patricia made landfall in Mexico. </p>

<p>The chemtrails were spreading turning the sky into a hazy cloud cover and blowing east (towards Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas). I went further up north in California a few years ago --near Vandenberg Air Force base-- and saw a similar pattern being laid out. The onshore flow blows the chemicals over land.</p>

<p>I wondered if there was a web site that you could go to to see the current activity. Across the entire USA I would expect there to be hot spots of activity on certain days. If the wind and humidity are just right, they&#39;ll get out there and criss-cross the skies with chemtrails. </p>

<p>If people could see the current geo-engineering activity and compare it to weather patterns it might wake a lot of them up. Smart phones all have GPS, and cameras, and accelerometers. It should be just a matter of starting a mobile app and taking a picture of the sky. The software should be able to calculate the location, direction, etc. </p>

<p>Even if you had to manually draw &quot;lines&quot; which represent where they are chemtrailing.... it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to input. </p>

<li><p>Why doesn&#39;t a site like this exist?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought the same thing. After I started this thread, 2 shills showed up within MINUTES to start debunking and downvoting. Chemtrails are so obvious. All you have to do is look up in the sky. They&#39;re everywhere. So, why isn&#39;t there a decent website to document and track their activity?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps such a website might get taken for reasons of national security?  That&#39;s about my best guess - I would have definitely thought something like this might exist already as well.  Like you said the EXIF data from cell phone cameras makes it relatively easy to verify, but if you open up a website to any submitters then trolls can game the system.</p>

<p>This is called a confirmation bias. You can use the same argument to prove that it&#39;s ice cream they are leaving behind. I mean, just look up, it&#39;s there! 
There is shitloads of air traffic all over the world these days. They leave trails after them, get over it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was going to say. What&#39;s wrong with <a href="http://www.skywatchmap.org">skywatchmap.org</a>? The data seems to be up to date through August, 2015. </p>

<p>I see no geo-engineering where I&#39;m at today, but if someone here does, take a pic and <a href="http://www.skywatchmap.org/reports/submit">try reporting it</a> to see if the website is fully functional.</p>

<p>If someone builds a really slick, well-designed website with the same functionality as skywatchmap.org, it could really take off. skywatchmap.org themselves might consider a crowdfunding campaign to update its design to make it look more appealing, and perhaps create an app that people could use to easily report with video/pics via smartphone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not bad. But, that&#39;s still 2 months ago. People aren&#39;t using the site very much. Why? My guess is that it&#39;s not very appealing. Maybe hard to use? I kind of expected to see a map of the US with lines on it indicating the direction of the chemtrails. Maybe also have overlays with other information (e.g., wind direction, highs, lows, and radar weather). This way you could start to connect the chemtrail activity with the weather patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that&#39;s true, why do the planes fly in patterns that are not typical of other air traffic in the region? Why don&#39;t those flight patterns show up on air traffic maps? The air traffic is this region is pretty standard. Traffic is routed from East to West for incoming planes. The ones that are leaving chemtrails are traveling North-South. But, when you look at a regional map of air traffic there are NO commercial flights listed as traveling North-South. They also keep flying the same route over and over. They let one chemtrail spread out and start blowing East. Then, they lay down another one. Eventually, you see a repeated pattern of parallel lines that stretch from North to South blowing Eastward (inland). As they spread, it turns into a cloudy haze covering the entire sky moving East.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>They are in an air corridor. Flight paths are strictly controlled. Aircraft on the same vector will fly to one side of the contrail coming off the aircraft in front to avoid turbulence and loss of vision. So you get parallel contrails. Also, the contrails usually have nothing to do with any local airports near you. Aircraft don&#39;t start making contrails until they climb to about 23,000 feet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The contrails you are seeing are at 30 to 40,000 feet altitude. The weather conditions up there have no connection with the conditions down here. It is about -50 degrees up there whether you&#39;re over Arizona or the North Pole. Persistent contrails like you are seeing are a serious problem, and may be contributing to climate change. They spread out to form a layer of cirrus cloud which allows sunlight through but block infra red heat from radiating into space at night. But they are not poisonous, and they are not being made deliberately.</p>
