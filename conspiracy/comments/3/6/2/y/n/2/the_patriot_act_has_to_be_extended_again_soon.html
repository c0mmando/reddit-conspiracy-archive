       I read this today by Gibbons who wrote this back in the 1700s. If this isn't whats happening today then I dont know what to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gibbons listed five basic reasons that the enormous Roman Empire was destroyed:
      </p>
      <p>
       The dramatic increase of divorce undermined the institution of the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       The imposition of higher taxes undermined the economic stability and vitality of the Empire. Taxes were raised to pay for deficit government spending, to pay for food for all in society and to pay for government-sponsored activities of diversion, such as circuses and sports. Interestingly, as the time of the final collapse drew closer, greater emphasis was placed on sports, to divert the attention of the public from the distressing news of massive trouble within the Empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drive for personal pleasure had become very intense, even to the point of obsession. Gibbons noted that, at the very end, sports had become more exciting and brutal.
      </p>
      <p>
       People lost their faith, both religiously and in their government. Paganism gave way to Christianity and the efficient Roman Government gave way to chaos and disintegration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hidden conspirators were working within the government to secretly destroy it. They worked quietly, invisibly and deceitfully; during the entire time they were secretly dismantling the government of the Roman Empire, they publicly proclaimed their unswerving support of it.

       Always interesting to see history repeat itself, as if nobody ever learns from past failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many similarities between West Romes downfall and the current state of the USA, yet there are also many differences. I think the most striking similarities are the turn towards hedonism and decadence and the fostering of a culture of forced enjoyment to distract the masses and the way the roman society was splittered in the end. You see the armies of Rome were more and more loyal to their generals than to the Empire. This already happened in Ceasars time and happened even biggen at the end of the western Roman Empire. In the USA we see a similar development in privatisation of almost everything (including the military) and a state power that weakens itself. 
Differences are that in Rome the development of social mobility was practically vice verse than in the USA.

       It's so easy to see. Everyday there is something in the news that screams sanctions or restrictions of liberty or the continued rise of a global military. I've already been told Monday not to go to school in my city because they are expecting riots regarding a police officer shooting 40 rounds through a windshield and killing 2 people. Meanwhile, with pictures online of the National Guard prepped with riot shields already for the "outcome" of the hearing/trial.

       Good stuff. Similar to this I read an essay a while back called
       <a href="http://www.newworldeconomics.com/archives/2014/092814_files/TheFateofEmpiresbySirJohnGlubb.pdf">
        The Fate of Empires
       </a>
       by John Glubb, and he talks about many of the same issues regarding the multiple stages empires must endure as it morphs from infancy to world power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, he surmises that empires largely have a ~250 year life span and within that time period they undergo five or six distinct eras, with them being:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The Age of Pioneers
       </li>
       <li>
        The Age of Conquests
       </li>
       <li>
        The Age of Commerce
       </li>
       <li>
        The Age of Affluence
       </li>
       <li>
        The Age of Intellect
       </li>
       <li>
        The Age of Decadence.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Each age sowing the seeds to lead perfectly into the next.
      </p>
      <p>
       Characteristics of the age of Decadence include: "Defensiveness, Pessimism, Materialism, Frivolity, An influx of foreigners,
       <strong>
        The Welfare State
       </strong>
       , A weakening of religion" - due to: "Too long a period of wealth and power, Selfishness, Love of money, The loss of a sense of duty."
      </p>
      <p>
       You could argue the merit of a few of those like the weakening of religion, which I would largely view as a positive if it weren't for the fact that so many people currently substitute God for the State. Or a loss of sense of duty, but he may just be being a bit nostalgic for the early days of his life when duty and honor were still trumpeted in society until that old world clashed with the new world realities of WW1.

       I couldn't really speak to that with any sort of authority, but he does mention the perils of a cavalier, almost uncaring attitude of granting citizenship en masse to anyone who wants it. Welfare can come in different forms than just money, and this one in particular would be a devaluation of citizenship to those who had it before standards were lowered.

       I think there's a secret war on within our own government. I think that forces from the original bi-polar world never went away and the battle rages on covertly. There's a definite subversive element operating Stateside, and I'm not talking about the rioters. They, like us, are caught in the middle.

       I'm not one of mindset of a secret war but I do fully believe that there is a systematic selection of individuals that are put in power to shape the needs of those higher up the echelon. If there is any sort of war its against the ideology the founding fathers had set in place and the battle is in the open. Civil Liberties vs The wants and needs of the Few.

       Something you may or may not have left out: The military became so bloated and huge that they started sacking cities to pay pensions. Kind of like how our police fund their pensions by asset forfeiture

       Personally I think it'd be further out.  Like someone else mentioned in this thread, wait for the Patriot act to be repealed, stage an attack and draft a new Super Patriot Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard to answer how likely an attack would be within a month, but I'd say a pretty good chance within the next 6 months.

       Sept-Oct is my hypothesis. These things usually happen in the fall. Have people let their guard down over the summer months, then sucker punch them once the kids are back in school and the new TV season starts -- lots of distractions.

       not likely. We're too deeply in bed with China (partially due to Wal-Mart), and we're far better situated now to wage war against our own citizens. Also, Russia or China would probably destroy us, as our military is overextended, and has recently suffered a purge of staff-level officers that suffered from an overabundance of backbone.

       "deeply in bed with china" and "wage war against our citizens" are not mutually exclusive. Massive money has already gone into china, the masters could just move there. They certainly aren't concerned about some national border.

       Could be Russia. They legitimately scare me though. Putin is nuts, powerful, loved by much of his country, and smart. In my opinion Russia has a corruption level 10 times that of the US. That would only make it all the more believable to the general population.

       And this is just one of the many crazy stories about Putin. Obama may be corrupt, idk. I'm sure he is somehow but there's no blinding proof. Putin is just so flagrant and obvious about everything. Take the guy that was running against him recently for example. He got gunned down in broad daylight. That does not happen in the US. Yeah, you have JFK, but at least it's so confusing as fuck that no one knows for sure what actually happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone has any great documentaries or mash ups that explain the JFK assassination with much validity I would genuinely love to know about it. Seems like it'd be a great watch.

       ISIS and Ebola Bin Laden invading Texas.

      <p>
       Russian funded ISIS anti-government patriot militias with nukes, spreading Ebola in Texas.

       Black ISIS. Race war.

       Honestly, I think the war games are unwinnable. There is no winnable solution. They might just sow chaos. They dont control anything. They are reacting. The CIA/FBI/DEA took over a Mexican drug cartel and turned Mexico into a failed state. Did anyone plan that? No. It just happened organically.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing the merger of organized crime with the intelligence agencies on a formal level and ISIS is already run the government. So we have merger of the government security apparatus, with organized crime, merged with terrorist groups. Then we have the merger of police and military. We have the merger of domestic and foreign operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I think we are seeing is the elimination of the borders of the nation state. The nation state will die and the war will continue. A global war, without borders, without victory conditions. A war where you grab an oil well and sell the oil to hire mercenaries to overthrow governments and secure iron mines, trade routes, oil pipelines, drug smuggling routes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be a global war of destabilization that burns across the globe like a brush-fire, destroying all of civilization. To form a world government, every other competing power group capable of resisting domination must be leveled. The nation state must be destroyed. Anyone not integrating, must be subject to external or internal destabilization.

       I made a pretty relevant prediction that I posted on facebook a few days ago. Got zero attention.

       "So the NSA's actions have been ruled illegal recently.

      <p>
       Somehow, they're going to get shut down. Then a few months to a year later the government will stage another terrorist attack on american soil, and claim that it would not have happened if the NSA hadn't of been shut down. Then, with support of the majority of people, they will bring it right back. You just wait and see."

       I'm not sure where this assumption about how much gear he was carrying came from, but 50LB isn't much for a young male to lug aroud. It's not much weight at all.

       Of course, the dollar value for virtually ever home was listed as 0. This doesn't mean the were "sold" for 0, much less sold at all at that time.

       Lots of assertions without evidence.  For example, linking to a site proving the school  received an upgraded security system does not support the assertion there was no evidence of shooting.  The fact that I own a toothbrush is not evidence that I don't have cavities
Also fema is so ridiculously large of a government agency and their job is basically to run drills all the time.  The chances of them not running a drill at the time of or in the vicinity of a catastrophe seems to be pretty slim to me.

       So many important people are involved that it can't really be brought to light. The actors that were the parents of the killed children (literally they are proven actors/singers/entertainers) even went to the White House to pose with Obama for their push on gun regulation. When Roosevelt was informed about the plan by the bankers to overthrow his government and install an authocracy he ended up doing nothing to punish the conspirators because it would destroy the economy. This can be seen in a similar vein.

       IIRC there was a big mixup/change in what guns were used in the shooting, and there was a picture of an AR-15 being planted or taken from a trunk. Not sure. Can anyone confirm?

       Something weird about the above posts and their skeptical assessments. Almost reminds me of when people bring up chemtrails. The first poster, who have the not-so-strong evidence of a conspiracy involving sandy hook, may have had some holes in his story.. The second guy who poked holes in his theory, was kind of a dick, and didn't really prove much either.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say the best evidence of a conspiracy involving sandy hook school, would be any and almost ALL mainstream news footage. The interviews, the county coroner guy, the weird fake crying school bus guy,  everybody being so fake in such a real situation.  I still haven't made up my mind on sandy hook.. And I've reviewed tons of information and evidence about it..all I know, is something isn't right. There are definitely inconsistencies, and while an operation like this would not leave obvious evidence of a conspiracy for all to see, somewhere along the line things were half assed..
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch all the videos of the fake crying guy.. All of them.. MSM clips , video of him "practicing" In front of his house.. ALL OF THEM. And then watch the fat coroner dude clip.. And  then tell me something isn't wrong with that situation.  When children die en MASSE... People don't fake the funk.. And this time they did..
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the gun regulation agenda  truly did have a huge connection to this event,  though a young kid grabbing his parents guns and killing isn't going to be stopped or solved by any gun legislation..
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange event.. And no, all sandy hook conspiracy imconsistencies are not , and have not been debunked.

       Making evidence out of emotions proves nothing. Emotions and reactions can be all over the place.

       True,it's just all "evidence" can be semi refuted and semi debunked and semi attacked and no one ever proves the other side wrong. Because of this, I do not tell people thwt sandy hook was a hoax, and when people who aren't as deeply into research as I am say it was.a hoax, I refrain from wild irresponsible statements and theories. The only thing about sandy hook, or should I say the main thing, is the fake witnesses and peculiar "players" something is wayy off.

       Don't down vote this guy. He probably has genuinely never heard of the Sandy Hook conspiracy and there are many more like him. If you down vote them rather then show them, you'll just dissuade more people from learning about it.

       Oh, look! You've got a couple of YouTube videos! Case closed! /s
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's just the usual BS about "They're not behaving how I think they should!" - even though, of course, no Hoaxers have ever had their children shot dead by a deranged psychopath. And what's the slightest bit unusual about someone about to speak in public or to the media, rehearsing what they're going to say? IT PROVES NOTHING. I rehearsed a speech before my wedding - guess that "proves" it was a false flag!

       And being corrected by the cameraman when he gets the order of the story wrong? Well I think it is weird, because I have never seen it personally and I have never seen any other examples of it on youtube. Generally news crews are looking for raw, emotional depiction of what happens. Not a scripted story done correctly to the letter.

       No, we're not prepared to break the law and spend our lives in prison. What would this prove? "Crazy conspiracy digs up grave and says there was no body". Nobody will believe it anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you actually looked into any of this at all? Have you looked into the helicopter footage of camouflaged men running away from the school through the woods, being arrested and then mysteriously never seen again? Thought about how this 'deranged psychopath' was so amazingly good with a weapon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone, conspiracy theorist or not, who can look at the official reports and not come away with serious questions have got to be absolutely delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many questions that rather than listing them all I'll steal this list from
       <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2012/12/16/sandy-hook-shooting-discrepancies-not-conspiracies-yet/">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       1.)  According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his older brother’s ID, and it was not stolen. However, older brother Ryan–who officials say is very cooperative–claims not to have even seen his brother since 2010. Where would Adam get this ID?
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest. Why would he want to hide his identity, and why would he wear a bulletproof vest, if he planned to kill himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       3.)  Where did he get the bulletproof vest?  Guns stolen from Mom – vest too?  If so, why did she need one?
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns.  The police stated a rifle (long gun) was found in the trunk of his car.    But now claim that’s the murder weapon?
      </p>
      <p>
       4-b) What did he kill himself with?   Kinda hard to use a .223 long gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       5.) According to the official story, the killing was tightly confined to two classrooms, near the front door and office.  So why were so many children told to close their eyes while leaving the building through other exits where nothing was even close?
      </p>
      <p>
       5-b) Why were the kids in the Gym told to cover their eyes exiting the back of the building?
      </p>
      <p>
       6.) Why were there such persistent reports that Mrs. Lanza was a kindergarten teacher, and that she died at the school, when the new official story is that she was not connected to the school and was killed at home?
      </p>
      <p>
       7.) What happened to the report that Adam Lanza’s girlfriend and another friend were missing in New Jersey?
      </p>
      <p>
       8.) What happened to the woodsman in a black jacket and camo pants who was arrested and handcuffed outside the school?  Seen in overhead helicopter media reporting.  He actually shouted to parents, “It wasn’t me.” Who was he and what was he doing there?
      </p>
      <p>
       9.) The official story is that Nancy Lanza was a gun collector who obeyed the law.  It appears she was diligent in her firearm responsibility.   But since 20-year-olds are not permitted to buy guns or ammo or carry guns in Connecticut, why would she give her “autistic” son easy access to both guns and ammo?
      </p>
      <p>
       [article] Last night it also emerged Nancy was a member  of the Doomsday Preppers movement, which believes people should prepare for end  of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her former sister-in-law Marsha said she had  turned her home ‘into a fortress’. She added: ‘Nancy had a survivalist  philosophy which is why she was stockpiling guns. She had them for  defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘She was stockpiling food. She grew up on a  farm in New Hampshire. She was skilled with guns. We talked about preppers and  preparing for the economy collapsing.’
      </p>
      <p>
       9-b) The baby sitter for Adam (when he was 10) said mom was insistent he never be left alone for a second – even in the bathroom.   But yet mom never secured the weapons?
      </p>
      <p>
       9-c)  How come in such a “small town” we have not heard about Adam Lanza’s primary care physician? Psychiatrist? Psychologist?
      </p>
      <p>
       10) Would real parents of real children aged 6-7 really be satisfied with pictures of their children? Wouldn’t they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?
      </p>
      <p>
       10-a)  Not even one parent, just one, wanted to see their child?
      </p>
      <p>
       11) According to the official story, 28 people died only 1 was wounded. The dead included 20 small, squirmy children — difficult targets even for professionals. How could Adam Lanza achieve such amazingly deadly accuracy, in such a short length of recorded time?
      </p>
      <p>
       12) When Ryan Lanza was falsely identified as the shooter, who deleted his Facebook profile?   How did it reappear when he was in custody?
      </p>
      <p>
       (article) Ryan, 24, who was originally thought to have  been the shooter, was being questioned by police after he was arrested at his  home in Hoboken, New Jersey.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was on a bus on his way home from work  when he was being named as the gunman and posted on Facebook that it wasn’t him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan Lanza had been extremely cooperative and  was not under arrest or in custody by Saturday morning, but investigators were  still searching his computers and phone records. He told law enforcement he had  not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       13) Why did the police say on Friday that they were going to leave the bodies in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited the bodies away in the middle of the night? Perhaps to ensure that the transport, if any, would go unrecorded on photos or video?
      </p>
      <p>
       14.) With a bazillion media there, staked out anyway, how did they pull off the body transport without even a single highpower telephoto lens photo?  You know some media would have staked out the morgue too?
      </p>
      <p>
       15) Did the school have one or more security cameras CCTV?  You would think with a “buzz-in” entry system they would have at least one camera on the door, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       16 ) Why is Adam Lanza reported to be a loner when a teenager said (oxymoronically), “[Lanza and his friends] always gathered alone in a corner in school”?
      </p>
      <p>
       ‘Everyone just assumed he was a smart kid and  that’s why he didn’t like talking to people all the time,’ Peter Lalli, 20, who  graduated with Lanza in 2010, told the New York Daily  News. ‘He hung out with the smart  crowd.’
      </p>
      <p>
       17) Why did police assign an individual state trooper to every grieving family?  Has this ever been done before?  Media concern?
      </p>
      <p>
       18)  Why are Ryan Lanza and his roommates still in custody, and why are the police pretending that it’s for their own benefit?
      </p>
      <p>
       19) Is it a coincidence that Nancy Lanza’s brother is Kingston Police Officer James Champion, who lives next door to the former Lanza home?
      </p>
      <p>
       20)  What “exactly” did Nancy Lanza do for a living?  Retired or not, how come not a single current or former co-worker is in the media talking about her?
      </p>
      <p>
       21)  Why would Nancy Lanza own a Bullet Proof vest?   The media is framing her numerous gun collection as her being a possible “prepper”, where’s the evidence of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       22)  Dad is a VP of GE Global Financial?  And a witness in the LIBOR financial scandal?  That deserves a looksee.
      </p>
      <p>
       23)  When was the last time you saw an M.E. give a presser in a labcoat?

       That's a lame cop out, and you know it. So much for the courage of your convictions.
       <strong>
        Nobody believes you now
       </strong>
       . Sandy Hoaxers are the new shape-shifting lizard believers: the butt of jokes and possessing zero credibility. Surely a misdemeanor charge is worth proving to the world what you assure me to be true? When there's no body in a grave, it's only trespassing! And if only there were devices you could use, to record every detail of the digging and opening of the grave, showing the supposedly empty coffin... Oh, hang on - there are.

       Oh, dear... You might want to do your own research, rather than relying on some list on a blog. I guess it is an improvement on offering YouTube videos. But, for fun, let's take a look at the first few items.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       Nope. For where is this stated in any official report? I've seen it suggested in a handful of early media reports. That is not "the official story", any more than Ryan Lanza was the killer, also suggested in early media reports.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Nope.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Adam Lanza went into the Sandy Hook Elementary School wearing a utility vest, not a bullet proof vest, state police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said Thursday. "It was a fishing type vest, a jacket with a lot of pockets; it was not a bullet-proof vest," Vance said."

       I can't be bothered to go on disproving this dreadful gish gallop of inanities and inconsequential rubbish. I just proved that the first five "issues" on your list are nothing but distortions, false early reports or flat-out mistruths, which fall apart on the most cursory of examination, and turn out to prove absolutely zero.

       There won't be a false flag before it is repealed. It will be repealed and then there will be a false flag. This will make the justification even stronger along with a possible stronger implementation.

       We were doomed long before the Rahmfather showed up. But yeh, many Chicagoans are unhappy he's around. I'm fairly suspicious he stole the election. Just speculation though. And ballots with his name marked being given to black voters. Yeh.

       You know how Hollywood movies send a certain message sometimes? What if all the stuff from those huge budget disaster movies set in choice cities happen within a short period of time approaching very soon?
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be like the end of the world. A big show with dire consequences. Major earthquake in LA, NYC floods, Chicago attacked (fake alien invasion?)... financial markets in chaos, ice storms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and tornados everywhere else in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       A new order to save the day. More drones. More effective surveillance. More robotics; humanoid and otherwise. More renewable energy sources and greater battery power. Global WiFi. Newer versions of destroyed cities will appear in virtually no time. It's gonna happen so fast.

       I would say it's going to be in Texas at the PANTEX nuclear assembly/disassembly  plant going by gathered information on Jade Helm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: on second thought perhaps Texas is just a staging area that provides two benefits: 1.Moves resources away from where they're needed like norad and 9/11. 2. Have military resources deployed and ready to be used from a location with its own power grid.

       I know I'm the underdog in this thought. But my suspicions are on Atlanta. One of the fastest growing cities currently, the movie industry is flocking here in herds. Technology companies are either relocating here or starting up here. A lot of rich and influential people are losing money because of it. Also, lets not forget Kasim Reed attended the Bilderberg in 2014. The only city mayor to be invited.

       I think there's some value in selecting a seemingly "safe" target like Madison or another Midwest city.

       Scaring people being the goal, you would want to attack those that seem the most safe, I think.

       I haven't thought about this sort of thing in ages, but I was at the union earlier today and actually got nervous for this very reason. It's basically the most pleasant place on the planet, it's filled with bright-future type kids and their families (graduation). I don't know I just started getting real sketched out - and then I come on this subreddit to see what everyone had to say about the Tsarnaev thing and the first thing I read is this shit. Of course it means nothing but I keep too much of an open mind sometimes.

       It is the timeframe that many people here are in fact discussing in this thread, and the OP's own comments support that.

      <p>
       But if you want to discuss a larger timeframe, feel free to do so. Within what time frame do you expect a multiple casualty mid-Western attack?

       I don't believe they need much to do what they want these days. They've established the ability to do whatever they want at this point and Americans will bend over and take their patriotism quite easily. The American colon has been loosened pretty well at this point. As long as the government can maintain a certain level of status quo with regards to daily life, Americans are happy to stand by and let their kids volunteer to die and their government to murder foreigners in the name of whatever.

       Better to let your children at least get some decent pay and a college education shooting strangers in a strange land than their other destiny of being eternally poor.  The chance of death is fairly low.

       Soldiering has been the minimum wage job for millenia.  Population boom happens so they get sent to the slaughtering fields to bring everything back in line.  These days warfare is considerably less brutal but it's still a common option for the poor.

       Or you could grab a hold of your nation and make it work at home. I guess it's easier to let the elite handle things and get super rich instead of fixing the economy by throwing them out. If you want to go to war, start at home where it matters the most.

       There is nothing a common person can do to fix the economy.  We're at the stage where machines are replacing people faster than we can invent new bullshit jobs like Specialized Servant #5 or any other number of low paying service jobs.

       We're at the stage where we need a nationwide New Deal where we either hand out 2 months of paid vacation to everyone, 30 hour workweeks, and make college education free. Or we extend Social Security to pay everyone regardless of circumstances, otherwise known as Basic Income.

       Does OP care to explain why there will be a false flag? Why does anyone think they need a big excuse for this? They don't. They don't answer to you or me. These baseless predictions make us all look like idiots and send people on wild goose chases which takes them away from fact and reality. There won't be any event because there is no reason for one.

       Watch NBC nightly news. The ongoing propaganda is "Americans that are radicalized via the internet by ISIS". I feel like they've been beating that drum for a solid two weeks, prior to the train derailment. It's got all the threats combined into a neat surveillance state package. But I don't think they need it for renewing the patriot act. The house voting against the "telephone surveillance", ignores the internet taps they have on place, which covers long distance telephone and everything else.

       Thats the interesting point to me. Everyone seems "happy" they are 'stopping' the telephone wire tapping or whatever, yet no one seems to understand that your telephone is moving the way of the internet. Its like getting excited that they are finally stopping the spying on our 8 tracks and record players. Totally legit.

       After reading some of the comments I feel like we've nailed a long term plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very shortly a vehicle will be stopped by police forces in Texas.  They will find and stop isis folks with a car bomb on route to a major public event going on at the time.  Show the country the great things that the Patriot act does.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after it is repealed we will see a large scale attack,  the majority of people are saying Chicago and there seems to be reasonable worry to see why that is the chosen location.    I feel like the blame will be focused onto Russia and in the process the US will try to use the anti Russia movement to make their claims for ownership of the artic oil fields.

       I agree. I think the narrative will be "Oh no! ISIS is invading from Mexico! We must do everything to stop them, including all these military actions and all these new laws!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It just takes a few more incidents like a Garland, TX and then there appears to be a pattern and then the media can just go wild and convince the public that we need to do something about the ISIS threat coming through the border in Mexico. People will buy it, too, not realizing what an integral role the three-letter agencies play in creating these scenarios for everyone to react to. It's pretty disturbing when you really look in to it.

       It would be more effective to allow an attack to take place. If we heard about terrorists planning to crash planes into the twin towers it would be forgotten within weeks. If instead those terrorists were able to crash a couple planes into the twin towers we would be talking about it for decades.

       Can we look at the bigger picture? Im no expert, i usually just lurk this sub but from what i've gathered through out my "lurkiness"
      </p>
      <p>
       We (you guys) have:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        debt ceiling approaching, again.
       </li>
       <li>
        Attempted gun control laws.
       </li>
       <li>
        The "suspected" Fema camps
       </li>
       <li>
        The "suspected" Fema mass grave container things.
       </li>
       <li>
        increased tension between 'murica and Russia.
       </li>
       <li>
        Nsa wiretapping and surveillance laws.
       </li>
       <li>
        "suspected" (cant remember the real number here) 50~ Isis militants 'hidden' in the states as claimed by Isis.
       </li>
       <li>
        Upcoming change in presidency
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Im most likely missing something here. But lets rule out a few things. America does not want to look weak. An attack from inside the country would mean the NSA/patriot act has failed to do its job. This
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       be a huge hit on that part, which could rule out an attack from inside, NSA doesn't want to look weak, they want you to know you are safe because of it. Otherwise i'd suspect most people would claim that "Why should we have something that doesn't work".
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, a false flag from outside the borders? This is where it comes more interesting, especially when you connect the dots with the FEMA camps and containers.  NSA cant "know" (lol, yeah right) exactly whats happening outside Americas borders, so either the new Act would enforce heavier surveillance from outside threats as well as inside threats.
      </p>
      <p>
       An likely way to do this would be an attack from outside the borders of NSA's "zone of control" (höhö, i did it agian, top kek), where something massive has to happen to make the dramatic FEMA camps/graves a thing, if there's something we all fear, its Biological / nuclear weapons / dirty bomb. Something that brings such extreme damage that PLENTY of people get hurt, maimed, and likely killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something has to happen where the patriotically damage would be the biggest, not just a landmark, but a known city. Somewhere where the political damage would spark even the most neutral person into a frenzy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking to account the rising "threat" from russia against Europe, seeing as America is part of the UN (IIRC), a two prompt attack could be something, say Russia really DID attack Europe, and as we've seen before during WW2, you guys are pretty slow at responding (thanks for all the fridges though! :D ), A likely False flag attack could be the springboard that takes America into the fray, claiming Russian bombers/Ships launched some sort of biological/nuclear weaponry on a tightly populated, know area.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, thats just a theory.

       Clearly they need this for the authorization of war, so they can invade any country IS is in. Namely Syria, where Assad is doing the same thing as Saddam Hussein and they have virtually the same exact solution. It's not that hard. I'll add a few more bread crumbs.

      <p>
       If/when such a false flag occurs, it's a lot harder to deny that it was staged when you can point to a post like this. That's when you can ask questions like "If this is just a coincidence, how come I was able to
       <em>
        predict it

       ?"

       Bull crap. Corporation hires lawyers to deflect responsibility by cooking up "projectile". Why? So that the final settlement for the victims can be reduced. A drug addled sleeping driver with bad history who is insane, a psychopathic killer, or just demented, kept on by the company, makes that company liable. BUT, a projectile, ooh! that can deflect millions in settlements, especially if you can get a Homeland shill to back it up. Hooray for government/corporate partnerships!

       If you've been paying attention (no offense btw), you'll see that the script writers are getting horrible at writing the script.  However, the show goes on because of the story that's already been established.  Anything from here on out will be very transparent and hard to sell, but will be bought anyhow because according to common folk that's just the way it is.

       There will be a terrorist attack, which will, as with every other false flag, start smelling fishy with weird behind-the-scenes cover-ups almost from the get-go, but the general public will be too distracted by the TPTB exploiting it for all its worth, while Internet "skeptics" such as you will attempt to shout down any and all legitimate criticism. That is, of course, giving you the benefit of the doubt, and assuming you aren't a straight-up shill.

       I'm not offended. But at a certain point people need to learn to read between the lines. Do you really think a powerful group such as a corrupt government would leave evidence around for people to have on paper their plans? That's ridiculous to think so.

       Look at the actions of the group and their motives. If you think the powers that shouldn't be aren't and haven't been conspiring against the masses then you have bought into the propaganda of the people that win history and can't see things from a clear perspective.

       To reverse the question, it seems to me equally as ridiculous that something as complex as 9/11 involving multiple simultaneous operations, controlled demolitions, hijacks, etc. could be planned
       <em>
        without
       </em>
       anything ever being committed to paper. I can see what you're saying as being plausible for something like, say, the JFK assassination, which could have been carried out, from beginning to end, by little more than a handful of people. But incidents like faking Sandy Hook, would require a cast of thousands (all of whom must also be utterly watertight for the rest of their lives). That's just not credible to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the powers that be are far more adept at taking advantage of situations and spinning them to suit a particular narrative, e.g. 9/11 being used to launch the invasion of Iraq, who had nothing to do with it. When you can do that, you don't need to stage events.

       It's so easy to see. Everyday there is something in the news that screams sanctions or restrictions of liberty or the continued rise of a global military. I've already been told Monday not to go to school in my city because they are expecting riots regarding a police officer shooting 40 rounds through a windshield and killing 2 people. Meanwhile, with pictures online of the National Guard prepped with riot shields already for the "outcome" of the hearing/trial.
