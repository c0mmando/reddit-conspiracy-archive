    <div class="md"><p>I read this today by Gibbons who wrote this back in the 1700s. If this isn&#39;t whats happening today then I dont know what to believe.</p>

<p>Gibbons listed five basic reasons that the enormous Roman Empire was destroyed:</p>

<p>The dramatic increase of divorce undermined the institution of the family.</p>

<p>The imposition of higher taxes undermined the economic stability and vitality of the Empire. Taxes were raised to pay for deficit government spending, to pay for food for all in society and to pay for government-sponsored activities of diversion, such as circuses and sports. Interestingly, as the time of the final collapse drew closer, greater emphasis was placed on sports, to divert the attention of the public from the distressing news of massive trouble within the Empire.</p>

<p>The drive for personal pleasure had become very intense, even to the point of obsession. Gibbons noted that, at the very end, sports had become more exciting and brutal.</p>

<p>People lost their faith, both religiously and in their government. Paganism gave way to Christianity and the efficient Roman Government gave way to chaos and disintegration.</p>

<p>Hidden conspirators were working within the government to secretly destroy it. They worked quietly, invisibly and deceitfully; during the entire time they were secretly dismantling the government of the Roman Empire, they publicly proclaimed their unswerving support of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always interesting to see history repeat itself, as if nobody ever learns from past failures. </p>

<p>There are many similarities between West Romes downfall and the current state of the USA, yet there are also many differences. I think the most striking similarities are the turn towards hedonism and decadence and the fostering of a culture of forced enjoyment to distract the masses and the way the roman society was splittered in the end. You see the armies of Rome were more and more loyal to their generals than to the Empire. This already happened in Ceasars time and happened even biggen at the end of the western Roman Empire. In the USA we see a similar development in privatisation of almost everything (including the military) and a state power that weakens itself. 
Differences are that in Rome the development of social mobility was practically vice verse than in the USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so easy to see. Everyday there is something in the news that screams sanctions or restrictions of liberty or the continued rise of a global military. I&#39;ve already been told Monday not to go to school in my city because they are expecting riots regarding a police officer shooting 40 rounds through a windshield and killing 2 people. Meanwhile, with pictures online of the National Guard prepped with riot shields already for the &quot;outcome&quot; of the hearing/trial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good stuff. Similar to this I read an essay a while back called <a href="http://www.newworldeconomics.com/archives/2014/092814_files/TheFateofEmpiresbySirJohnGlubb.pdf">The Fate of Empires</a> by John Glubb, and he talks about many of the same issues regarding the multiple stages empires must endure as it morphs from infancy to world power. </p>

<p>Basically, he surmises that empires largely have a ~250 year life span and within that time period they undergo five or six distinct eras, with them being:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Age of Pioneers </li>
<li>The Age of Conquests</li>
<li>The Age of Commerce</li>
<li>The Age of Affluence</li>
<li>The Age of Intellect</li>
<li>The Age of Decadence.<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>Each age sowing the seeds to lead perfectly into the next. </p>

<p>Characteristics of the age of Decadence include: &quot;Defensiveness, Pessimism, Materialism, Frivolity, An influx of foreigners, <strong>The Welfare State</strong>, A weakening of religion&quot; - due to: &quot;Too long a period of wealth and power, Selfishness, Love of money, The loss of a sense of duty.&quot;</p>

<p>You could argue the merit of a few of those like the weakening of religion, which I would largely view as a positive if it weren&#39;t for the fact that so many people currently substitute God for the State. Or a loss of sense of duty, but he may just be being a bit nostalgic for the early days of his life when duty and honor were still trumpeted in society until that old world clashed with the new world realities of WW1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t really speak to that with any sort of authority, but he does mention the perils of a cavalier, almost uncaring attitude of granting citizenship en masse to anyone who wants it. Welfare can come in different forms than just money, and this one in particular would be a devaluation of citizenship to those who had it before standards were lowered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is just one of the many crazy stories about Putin. Obama may be corrupt, idk. I&#39;m sure he is somehow but there&#39;s no blinding proof. Putin is just so flagrant and obvious about everything. Take the guy that was running against him recently for example. He got gunned down in broad daylight. That does not happen in the US. Yeah, you have JFK, but at least it&#39;s so confusing as fuck that no one knows for sure what actually happened. </p>

<p>If anyone has any great documentaries or mash ups that explain the JFK assassination with much validity I would genuinely love to know about it. Seems like it&#39;d be a great watch.</p>

<p>Russian funded ISIS anti-government patriot militias with nukes, spreading Ebola in Texas.</p>

<p>Black ISIS. Race war.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think the war games are unwinnable. There is no winnable solution. They might just sow chaos. They dont control anything. They are reacting. The CIA/FBI/DEA took over a Mexican drug cartel and turned Mexico into a failed state. Did anyone plan that? No. It just happened organically.</p>

<p>We are seeing the merger of organized crime with the intelligence agencies on a formal level and ISIS is already run the government. So we have merger of the government security apparatus, with organized crime, merged with terrorist groups. Then we have the merger of police and military. We have the merger of domestic and foreign operations.</p>

<p>What I think we are seeing is the elimination of the borders of the nation state. The nation state will die and the war will continue. A global war, without borders, without victory conditions. A war where you grab an oil well and sell the oil to hire mercenaries to overthrow governments and secure iron mines, trade routes, oil pipelines, drug smuggling routes.</p>

<p>It will be a global war of destabilization that burns across the globe like a brush-fire, destroying all of civilization. To form a world government, every other competing power group capable of resisting domination must be leveled. The nation state must be destroyed. Anyone not integrating, must be subject to external or internal destabilization.</p>

<p>EMS don&#39;t go anywhere until the scene is considered secure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not a drop of blood. No doors or windows broken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean like this?</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/FWN9f">http://imgur.com/a/FWN9f</a></p>

<p>There was also the trauma-scene cleanup crew they hired who testified to a considerable volume of biological material cleaned up.</p>

<p>But really, I can&#39;t understand why no one would want to publish pictures of all that blood from the murdered children. Shocking....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parents were not allowed to ID their children&#39;s bodies(ID was done through photos).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see anything about not allowing them to; only that they did the identification process through photograph because it&#39;s generally easier than seeing your murdered kid&#39;s shot up corpse just to say &quot;yeah that&#39;s him&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No video of Adam shooting his way into the school even though Sandy Hook Elementary just had the entire security system updated</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t have security cameras everywhere. They had a buzzer/lobby system with a camera (which didn&#39;t record), that&#39;s it. It was installed in 2005.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All crime scene evidence has been completely destroyed. SH Elementary was razed in 2013. Also the Lanza household will be razed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The school and Lanza&#39;s home were destroyed yes.  But I don&#39;t know anything about pieces of evidence being destroyed which would have been catalogued and stored.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sally Cox was in the closet for four hours. A closet in the same room where police set up their command center.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No command center was set up in the nurse&#39;s office.</p>

<p>She hid out there for the time because... Well... You know a shooter  barged into the school and started shooting people. According to her when she peeked out all she saw was more people with guns outside the window. Back in the closet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First it&#39;s Ryan then it’s Adam. Same ID. Note the police also arrested &quot;Ryan&quot; Lanza.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same ID? They didn&#39;t have the same ID. Adam has his <em>brother&#39;s</em> ID. His brother Ryan.</p>

<p>Yeah, questioning family members is SOP. Adam had afterall, killed their mother, and Adam of course had his <em>brother Ryan&#39;s</em> ID.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>140lb kid carrying 40-50 lbs of gear around and shooting like an expert marksman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where this assumption about how much gear he was carrying came from, but 50LB isn&#39;t much for a young male to lug aroud. It&#39;s not much weight at all. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;expert marksman&quot;.  He shot mostly children multiple times at close range. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adam&#39;s Death certificate was entered into the computer as Dec 13th, 2012, a day before the shooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, there&#39;s the actual certificate</p>

<p><a href="http://s30.postimg.org/6vsxa7540/adamdcpng.jpg">http://s30.postimg.org/6vsxa7540/adamdcpng.jpg</a></p>

<p>So if it actually was &quot;entered into the computer&quot; it&#39;s pretty clearly a clerical error. Or was Sally the Secretary in on the whole thing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jill Greenberg&#39;s End Times art gallery depicts naked crying children which look identical to many Sandy Hook victims</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>kids look similar at a young age. get over yourself. </p>

<p>Of course if someone needs further proof, those photos are from SIX YEARS before sandy hook shooting occurred. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anderson Cooper&#39;s green screen footage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is this supposed to be evidence of? Reporters chromakey constantly.</p>

<p>But as far as I know the apparent glitch seen has nothing to do with bad chroma and everything to do with poor image compression.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the police cars parked behind the Fire House around 9:00AM.Also people were seen circling in &amp; out of the firehouse, just wandering in circles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol, you watched that edited youtube video didn&#39;t you of the loop of people walking around... Which is apprently evidence of.... something? I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many homes in Sandy Hook sold for $1 on Christmas of 2009.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lol, I&#39;ve never heard 1 dollar but I&#39;ve certainly read 0. Care to substantiate that claim?</p>

<p>Of course, the dollar value for virtually ever home was listed as 0. This doesn&#39;t mean the were &quot;sold&quot; for 0, much less sold at all at that time.  Properties in all of connecticut that weren&#39;t recently bought show $0 (or they show their recent sale price). I just looked up a bunch of houses on the local tax assessor.</p>

<p>$0.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook accounts set up almost immediately and there was a United Way page setup the same day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s almost like there are a lot of dilligent, affected and compassionate people in the world</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of assertions without evidence.  For example, linking to a site proving the school  received an upgraded security system does not support the assertion there was no evidence of shooting.  The fact that I own a toothbrush is not evidence that I don&#39;t have cavities
Also fema is so ridiculously large of a government agency and their job is basically to run drills all the time.  The chances of them not running a drill at the time of or in the vicinity of a catastrophe seems to be pretty slim to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So much fallacious nonsense here. Have a few of the most obvious pieces of bullshit. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The training &quot;drill&quot; was actually a classroom exercise, with no practical component, which had already been given on <a href="http://www.ct.gov/demhs/ical/calendar.asp?mm=12&amp;amp;yyyy=2012&amp;amp;image1.x=13&amp;amp;image1.y=6&amp;amp;calendar_ID=0&amp;amp;showTop=True">multiple occasions that month</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;No doors or windows broken&quot; - <a href="http://www.cnycentral.com/uploadedImages/wstm/News/Blogs/Sandy%20Hook%20glass%20front%20door.jpg">Factually incorrect</a></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;No video of Adam shooting his way into the school even though Sandy Hook Elementary just had the entire security system updated&quot; It had one camera, at the front, which was so visitors could get buzzed in, and had no recording capability. So what was supposed to record this video? Magic elves?</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Many homes in Sandy Hook sold for $1 on Christmas of 2009.&quot; No, they didn&#39;t. </p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The phony CNN footage of police charging into the school.&quot; You mean three seconds of footage of some unidentified people running across a parking lot. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#39;re so convinced it was fake, go dig up a grave. Let us know how that works out for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So many important people are involved that it can&#39;t really be brought to light. The actors that were the parents of the killed children (literally they are proven actors/singers/entertainers) even went to the White House to pose with Obama for their push on gun regulation. When Roosevelt was informed about the plan by the bankers to overthrow his government and install an authocracy he ended up doing nothing to punish the conspirators because it would destroy the economy. This can be seen in a similar vein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something weird about the above posts and their skeptical assessments. Almost reminds me of when people bring up chemtrails. The first poster, who have the not-so-strong evidence of a conspiracy involving sandy hook, may have had some holes in his story.. The second guy who poked holes in his theory, was kind of a dick, and didn&#39;t really prove much either.</p>

<p>I&#39;d say the best evidence of a conspiracy involving sandy hook school, would be any and almost ALL mainstream news footage. The interviews, the county coroner guy, the weird fake crying school bus guy,  everybody being so fake in such a real situation.  I still haven&#39;t made up my mind on sandy hook.. And I&#39;ve reviewed tons of information and evidence about it..all I know, is something isn&#39;t right. There are definitely inconsistencies, and while an operation like this would not leave obvious evidence of a conspiracy for all to see, somewhere along the line things were half assed..</p>

<p>Watch all the videos of the fake crying guy.. All of them.. MSM clips , video of him &quot;practicing&quot; In front of his house.. ALL OF THEM. And then watch the fat coroner dude clip.. And  then tell me something isn&#39;t wrong with that situation.  When children die en MASSE... People don&#39;t fake the funk.. And this time they did..    </p>

<p>Also the gun regulation agenda  truly did have a huge connection to this event,  though a young kid grabbing his parents guns and killing isn&#39;t going to be stopped or solved by any gun legislation..</p>

<p>Strange event.. And no, all sandy hook conspiracy imconsistencies are not , and have not been debunked. </p>

<p>Theres the forensic analysis from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShgdN8arHCc">Dr Wayne Carver</a>.</p>

<p>Theres the testimony from Robbie Parker, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5nnjq_-MgU">spoke the day after his daughter was killed</a>.</p>

<p>And the eye witness accounts from Gene Rosen, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MyIZuPrfo8">a true professional who practises his lines</a>.</p>

<p>Thousands of pages of writing....you mean like a movie script? How is this proof?</p>

<p>Yes there is a few photos of the inside of the school, which raise more questions than answers, such as why does the place look like its covered in mould and unused.</p>

<p>As someone who grew up in aviation, and is a current pilot, I have seen well over my fair share of death and the associated shock and grief. I have a fairly good idea of how people react and its not at all what I see at Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>And being corrected by the cameraman when he gets the order of the story wrong? Well I think it is weird, because I have never seen it personally and I have never seen any other examples of it on youtube. Generally news crews are looking for raw, emotional depiction of what happens. Not a scripted story done correctly to the letter.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You have not provided any evidence, other than &#39;must trust what the authorities say&#39;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, while none of the Sandy Hoaxers are prepared to put their beliefs into action and dig up graves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, we&#39;re not prepared to break the law and spend our lives in prison. What would this prove? &quot;Crazy conspiracy digs up grave and says there was no body&quot;. Nobody will believe it anyway.</p>

<p>Have you actually looked into any of this at all? Have you looked into the helicopter footage of camouflaged men running away from the school through the woods, being arrested and then mysteriously never seen again? Thought about how this &#39;deranged psychopath&#39; was so amazingly good with a weapon?</p>

<p>Anyone, conspiracy theorist or not, who can look at the official reports and not come away with serious questions have got to be absolutely delusional.</p>

<p>There are so many questions that rather than listing them all I&#39;ll steal this list from <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2012/12/16/sandy-hook-shooting-discrepancies-not-conspiracies-yet/">here</a>.</p>

<p>1.)  According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his older brother’s ID, and it was not stolen. However, older brother Ryan–who officials say is very cooperative–claims not to have even seen his brother since 2010. Where would Adam get this ID?</p>

<p>2.) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest. Why would he want to hide his identity, and why would he wear a bulletproof vest, if he planned to kill himself?</p>

<p>3.)  Where did he get the bulletproof vest?  Guns stolen from Mom – vest too?  If so, why did she need one?</p>

<p>4.) The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns.  The police stated a rifle (long gun) was found in the trunk of his car.    But now claim that’s the murder weapon?</p>

<p>4-b) What did he kill himself with?   Kinda hard to use a .223 long gun.</p>

<p>5.) According to the official story, the killing was tightly confined to two classrooms, near the front door and office.  So why were so many children told to close their eyes while leaving the building through other exits where nothing was even close?</p>

<p>5-b) Why were the kids in the Gym told to cover their eyes exiting the back of the building?</p>

<p>6.) Why were there such persistent reports that Mrs. Lanza was a kindergarten teacher, and that she died at the school, when the new official story is that she was not connected to the school and was killed at home?</p>

<p>7.) What happened to the report that Adam Lanza’s girlfriend and another friend were missing in New Jersey?</p>

<p>8.) What happened to the woodsman in a black jacket and camo pants who was arrested and handcuffed outside the school?  Seen in overhead helicopter media reporting.  He actually shouted to parents, “It wasn’t me.” Who was he and what was he doing there?</p>

<p>9.) The official story is that Nancy Lanza was a gun collector who obeyed the law.  It appears she was diligent in her firearm responsibility.   But since 20-year-olds are not permitted to buy guns or ammo or carry guns in Connecticut, why would she give her “autistic” son easy access to both guns and ammo?</p>

<p>[article] Last night it also emerged Nancy was a member  of the Doomsday Preppers movement, which believes people should prepare for end  of the world.</p>

<p>Her former sister-in-law Marsha said she had  turned her home ‘into a fortress’. She added: ‘Nancy had a survivalist  philosophy which is why she was stockpiling guns. She had them for  defense.</p>

<p>‘She was stockpiling food. She grew up on a  farm in New Hampshire. She was skilled with guns. We talked about preppers and  preparing for the economy collapsing.’</p>

<p>9-b) The baby sitter for Adam (when he was 10) said mom was insistent he never be left alone for a second – even in the bathroom.   But yet mom never secured the weapons?</p>

<p>9-c)  How come in such a “small town” we have not heard about Adam Lanza’s primary care physician? Psychiatrist? Psychologist?</p>

<p>10) Would real parents of real children aged 6-7 really be satisfied with pictures of their children? Wouldn’t they demand to see their children one last time firsthand?</p>

<p>10-a)  Not even one parent, just one, wanted to see their child?</p>

<p>11) According to the official story, 28 people died only 1 was wounded. The dead included 20 small, squirmy children — difficult targets even for professionals. How could Adam Lanza achieve such amazingly deadly accuracy, in such a short length of recorded time?</p>

<p>12) When Ryan Lanza was falsely identified as the shooter, who deleted his Facebook profile?   How did it reappear when he was in custody?</p>

<p>(article) Ryan, 24, who was originally thought to have  been the shooter, was being questioned by police after he was arrested at his  home in Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>

<p>He was on a bus on his way home from work  when he was being named as the gunman and posted on Facebook that it wasn’t him.</p>

<p>Ryan Lanza had been extremely cooperative and  was not under arrest or in custody by Saturday morning, but investigators were  still searching his computers and phone records. He told law enforcement he had  not been in touch with his brother since about 2010.</p>

<p>13) Why did the police say on Friday that they were going to leave the bodies in the school until Sunday, then Saturday morning announce that they had spirited the bodies away in the middle of the night? Perhaps to ensure that the transport, if any, would go unrecorded on photos or video?</p>

<p>14.) With a bazillion media there, staked out anyway, how did they pull off the body transport without even a single highpower telephoto lens photo?  You know some media would have staked out the morgue too?</p>

<p>15) Did the school have one or more security cameras CCTV?  You would think with a “buzz-in” entry system they would have at least one camera on the door, no?</p>

<p>16 ) Why is Adam Lanza reported to be a loner when a teenager said (oxymoronically), “[Lanza and his friends] always gathered alone in a corner in school”?</p>

<p>‘Everyone just assumed he was a smart kid and  that’s why he didn’t like talking to people all the time,’ Peter Lalli, 20, who  graduated with Lanza in 2010, told the New York Daily  News. ‘He hung out with the smart  crowd.’</p>

<p>17) Why did police assign an individual state trooper to every grieving family?  Has this ever been done before?  Media concern?</p>

<p>18)  Why are Ryan Lanza and his roommates still in custody, and why are the police pretending that it’s for their own benefit?</p>

<p>19) Is it a coincidence that Nancy Lanza’s brother is Kingston Police Officer James Champion, who lives next door to the former Lanza home?</p>

<p>20)  What “exactly” did Nancy Lanza do for a living?  Retired or not, how come not a single current or former co-worker is in the media talking about her?</p>

<p>21)  Why would Nancy Lanza own a Bullet Proof vest?   The media is framing her numerous gun collection as her being a possible “prepper”, where’s the evidence of that?</p>

<p>22)  Dad is a VP of GE Global Financial?  And a witness in the LIBOR financial scandal?  That deserves a looksee.</p>

<p>23)  When was the last time you saw an M.E. give a presser in a labcoat?</p>

<p>As someone who grew up near a road, and is a current driver, I have seen well over my fair share of death and the associated shock and grief. That should give you an idea of how weakly idiotic you sound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a fairly good idea of how people react and its not at all what I see at Sandy Hook.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because, of course, being a pilot gives you a 100% accurate insight into how every single person will react when confronted with an unthinkable tragedy. And if they don&#39;t, of course, this proves they must be crisis actors!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we&#39;re not prepared to break the law and spend our lives in prison. What would this prove? &quot;Crazy conspiracy digs up grave and says there was no body&quot;. Nobody will believe it anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a lame cop out, and you know it. So much for the courage of your convictions.  <strong>Nobody believes you now</strong>. Sandy Hoaxers are the new shape-shifting lizard believers: the butt of jokes and possessing zero credibility. Surely a misdemeanor charge is worth proving to the world what you assure me to be true? When there&#39;s no body in a grave, it&#39;s only trespassing! And if only there were devices you could use, to record every detail of the digging and opening of the grave, showing the supposedly empty coffin... Oh, hang on - there are. Any other flimsy excuses you care to offer?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are so many questions that rather than listing them all I&#39;ll steal this list from here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, dear... You might want to do your own research, rather than relying on some list on a blog. I guess it is an improvement on offering YouTube videos. But, for fun, let&#39;s take a look at the first few items.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1.)  According to the official story, Adam Lanza was found with his older brother’s ID, and it was not stolen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. For where is this stated in any official report? I&#39;ve seen it suggested in a handful of early media reports. That is not &quot;the official story&quot;, any more than Ryan Lanza was the killer, also suggested in early media reports.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.) According to the official story, Adam Lanza was wearing a black outfit with a mask and bulletproof vest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20121227/newtown-shooter-adam-lanza-was-not-wearing-body-armor-during-massacre-5">Nope.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Adam Lanza went into the Sandy Hook Elementary School wearing a utility vest, not a bullet proof vest, state police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said Thursday. &quot;It was a fishing type vest, a jacket with a lot of pockets; it was not a bullet-proof vest,&quot; Vance said.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3.) Where did he get the bulletproof vest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. See above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4.) The medical examiner asserts that all wounds were caused by a rifle or other long weapon, and police/FBI say that the school was littered with .223 (rifle) casings. But Adam Lanza was found dead in the school with only handguns. The police stated a rifle (long gun) was found in the trunk of his car. But now claim that’s the murder weapon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/187052598/Official-Sandy-Hook-Report">Nope</a> - see page 6.</p>

<p>&quot;The following weapons were recovered in the course of this investigation: (1) a Bushmaster Model XM15-E2S semi-automatic rifle, found in the same classroom as the shooter’s body. <strong>All of the 5.56 mm shell casings from the school that were tested were found to have been fired from this rifle</strong>. (2) a Glock 20, 10 mm semi-automatic pistol found near the shooter’s body and determined to have been <strong>the source of the self-inflicted gunshot wound by which he took his own life</strong>. (3) a Sig Sauer P226, 9 mm semi-automatic pistol found on the shooter’s person. There is no evidence this weapon had been fired. (4) a Izhmash Saiga-12, 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun found in the shooter’s car in the parking lot outside the school.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>4-b) What did he kill himself with? Kinda hard to use a .223 long gun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. As stated, it was the Glock 20.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t be bothered to go on disproving this dreadful gish gallop of inanities and inconsequential rubbish. I just proved that the first five &quot;issues&quot; on your list are nothing but distortions, false early reports or flat-out mistruths, which fall apart on the most cursory of examination, and turn out to prove absolutely zero.</p>

<p>2/10: much more effort required before anyone with half a brain will consider this as other than total nonsense.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ll give you one last chance. Pick the <strong>one best piece of evidence</strong> for Sandy Hook being a hoax, and let&#39;s talk about that in depth. C&#39;mon, bring your best shot!</p>

<p>It&#39;d be like the end of the world. A big show with dire consequences. Major earthquake in LA, NYC floods, Chicago attacked (fake alien invasion?)... financial markets in chaos, ice storms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and tornados everywhere else in the US.</p>

<p>A new order to save the day. More drones. More effective surveillance. More robotics; humanoid and otherwise. More renewable energy sources and greater battery power. Global WiFi. Newer versions of destroyed cities will appear in virtually no time. It&#39;s gonna happen so fast.</p>

<p>What a time to be alive.</p>

<p>Very shortly a vehicle will be stopped by police forces in Texas.  They will find and stop isis folks with a car bomb on route to a major public event going on at the time.  Show the country the great things that the Patriot act does. </p>

<p>Shortly after it is repealed we will see a large scale attack,  the majority of people are saying Chicago and there seems to be reasonable worry to see why that is the chosen location.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I think the narrative will be &quot;Oh no! ISIS is invading from Mexico! We must do everything to stop them, including all these military actions and all these new laws!&quot;</p>

<p>It just takes a few more incidents like a Garland, TX and then there appears to be a pattern and then the media can just go wild and convince the public that we need to do something about the ISIS threat coming through the border in Mexico. People will buy it, too, not realizing what an integral role the three-letter agencies play in creating these scenarios for everyone to react to. It&#39;s pretty disturbing when you really look in to it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we look at the bigger picture? Im no expert, i usually just lurk this sub but from what i&#39;ve gathered through out my &quot;lurkiness&quot;</p>

<p>We (you guys) have:</p>

<ul>
<li>debt ceiling approaching, again.</li>
<li>Attempted gun control laws.</li>
<li>The &quot;suspected&quot; Fema camps</li>
<li>The &quot;suspected&quot; Fema mass grave container things.</li>
<li>increased tension between &#39;murica and Russia.</li>
<li>Nsa wiretapping and surveillance laws.</li>
<li>&quot;suspected&quot; (cant remember the real number here) 50~ Isis militants &#39;hidden&#39; in the states as claimed by Isis.</li>
<li>Upcoming change in presidency </li>
</ul>

<p>Im most likely missing something here. But lets rule out a few things. America does not want to look weak. An attack from inside the country would mean the NSA/patriot act has failed to do its job. This <em>would</em> be a huge hit on that part, which could rule out an attack from inside, NSA doesn&#39;t want to look weak, they want you to know you are safe because of it. Otherwise i&#39;d suspect most people would claim that &quot;Why should we have something that doesn&#39;t work&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, a false flag from outside the borders? This is where it comes more interesting, especially when you connect the dots with the FEMA camps and containers.  NSA cant &quot;know&quot; (lol, yeah right) exactly whats happening outside Americas borders, so either the new Act would enforce heavier surveillance from outside threats as well as inside threats.</p>

<p>An likely way to do this would be an attack from outside the borders of NSA&#39;s &quot;zone of control&quot; (höhö, i did it agian, top kek), where something massive has to happen to make the dramatic FEMA camps/graves a thing, if there&#39;s something we all fear, its Biological / nuclear weapons / dirty bomb. Something that brings such extreme damage that PLENTY of people get hurt, maimed, and likely killed.</p>

<p>Something has to happen where the patriotically damage would be the biggest, not just a landmark, but a known city. Somewhere where the political damage would spark even the most neutral person into a frenzy.</p>

<p>Taking to account the rising &quot;threat&quot; from russia against Europe, seeing as America is part of the UN (IIRC), a two prompt attack could be something, say Russia really DID attack Europe, and as we&#39;ve seen before during WW2, you guys are pretty slow at responding (thanks for all the fridges though! :D ), A likely False flag attack could be the springboard that takes America into the fray, claiming Russian bombers/Ships launched some sort of biological/nuclear weaponry on a tightly populated, know area.</p>

<p>But hey, thats just a theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, yes, the miraculous ability to fake terrorist attacks that are absolutely convincing to everyone - except for Internet warriors poring over YouTube videos, to whom it&#39;s all such obvious fakery.</p>

<p>Except, of course, there is absolutely no need for TPTB to fabricate terrorist attacks. There are millions of people ready and willing to carry out the real thing. </p>

<p>Oh, c&#39;mon aren&#39;t you going at least TRY and support your claims before going into the <em>ad hominem</em> attacks? We need a Godwin&#39;s Law of Conspiracy Theorists: &quot;As an online discussion in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> grows longer, the probability of somebody expressing doubt being labeled a shill approaches 1&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not offended. But at a certain point people need to learn to read between the lines. Do you really think a powerful group such as a corrupt government would leave evidence around for people to have on paper their plans? That&#39;s ridiculous to think so. </p>

<p>Look at the actions of the group and their motives. If you think the powers that shouldn&#39;t be aren&#39;t and haven&#39;t been conspiring against the masses then you have bought into the propaganda of the people that win history and can&#39;t see things from a clear perspective. </p>

<p>To reverse the question, it seems to me equally as ridiculous that something as complex as 9/11 involving multiple simultaneous operations, controlled demolitions, hijacks, etc. could be planned <em>without</em> anything ever being committed to paper. I can see what you&#39;re saying as being plausible for something like, say, the JFK assassination, which could have been carried out, from beginning to end, by little more than a handful of people. But incidents like faking Sandy Hook, would require a cast of thousands (all of whom must also be utterly watertight for the rest of their lives). That&#39;s just not credible to me. </p>

<p>I think the powers that be are far more adept at taking advantage of situations and spinning them to suit a particular narrative, e.g. 9/11 being used to launch the invasion of Iraq, who had nothing to do with it. When you can do that, you don&#39;t need to stage events. </p>
