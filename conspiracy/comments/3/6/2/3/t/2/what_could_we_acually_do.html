What are the acuall steps we as individuals or as a whole can do?
It feels like the amount of people still living in &quot;The matrix&quot; wont wake up untill they put them in work/concentration-camps and shackles their feet.

    <div class="md"><p>Enough people have to understand what is going on, a critical mass.  Occupy wall street almost did it, but the message was corrupted by the main stream media.  Most people have no idea what it was actually about.  They think it was just some poor people complaining because they were jealous of rich people who worked hard.    </p>

<p>Talk to people you know.  Start with an issue that you know the person might be concerned about.  Do you have a friend who is concerned about Monsanto, glyphosate, GMOs?  That&#39;s a starting point.  Discuss this issue with them, then try to open them up to more topics.    </p>

<p>Ask them what they think happened on 9/11.  Ask them if they recall the reason the US went into Iraq in 2003 (WMD), then show them the clip of Bush laughing about that lie at a dinner for donors.  Show them evidence of corruption in sectors like pharmaceuticals and food products.  Explain to them the history of central banking (show them examples of leaders who tried to opt out and what happened to them).  Show them how lobbyists and politicians do their business.      </p>

<p>Of course you have to be careful when doing this.  You need to have a feeling for how much a person can take.  Don&#39;t be that nut no one wants to talk to.  Most people aren&#39;t ready to hear some things right away.   Ease them into it, try to get them curious.</p>

<p>If they are willing to read a book, show them this:  <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf">http://www.whale.to/b/bernays.pdf</a><br/>
It is &#39;Propaganda&#39; by Bernays, written 100 years ago.  It is an instruction manual on how to control the thoughts and opinions of a society.    </p>

<p>There are lies that you don&#39;t know about, that I don&#39;t know about.  There is so much hidden from us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are really good ideas. It&#39;s easy to be overwhelmed with everything that&#39;s flying around lately, and to yank the first person you see and try to explain it all makes you look like that tin foil hat-wearing nut we are portrayed as in the media.
Keep it cool and ease them in with things they care about. great advise! </p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/ChangeThroughTruth">/u/ChangeThroughTruth</a> has it completely correct.  The way we achieve a better world is by informing everybody so that they inform everybody, so that everybody knows the truth about the world and what needs to be improved.  The objective is to create a world where the leaders actually care for the good of their people, and that can only come from change.</p>

<p>This is the exact epiphany that I had last night.  The world is so cruel and nobody cares, so much so that I seriously consider trying to find ways to force change onto the world.  But the powers that be have prevented any form of freedom fighting from seeming justified to people, and so the only way to achieve change is by improving the people first.  Make it a responsibility to be informed.  Only then can we begin to improve the world.</p>

<p>Not only will you be healthier and feel better but it will be harder for someone to take advantage of you in many situations.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some videos of cops trying to detain guys who are clearly stronger or better trained in self defense and the look on the cops faces is pretty preiceless. Of course this may escalate things but in the case where you need to protect yourself immediately you have a hell of a lot better chance if you&#39;re fit than if you&#39;d been sedentary the last decade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop having kids, stop going to work, stop buying stuff, stop paying taxes, stop $ moving through your life, stop submitting yourself to ads, break shit, seek within, grow your own food, focus on living locally, get good with your neighbors and local politics, withdraw from the greater global system as much as possible etc etc. The answers aren&#39;t hidden, they are just scary and challenging. They aren&#39;t prepackaged in single serving size and conveniently priced for you and arranged tastefully on a shelf--you have to hew them from enormous slabs within your own mind, and then you have to carry them home, and polish them tirelessly. </p>

<p>Obviously most of us are not free or curious enough to do most of these things. If most of us did most of these things, things would already be different. Do we do it? Probably not until it&#39;s mostly too late, unless something surprising happens. The elite only have the power we think they do, unfortunately there are plenty of people happy to deed away their individual human agency.</p>

<p>Talking about what we can do collectively is relatively useless at this point imo because two people will rarely agree about what the real problem is and what to do about it. This is fine, because pretty much everything needs to be done. So what we have to do right now is keep our heads, wrap the bandana to keep out the dust and smoke and find the most appealing exit sign. Other people will be moving towards that same exit regardless of which one you pick, and then we can talk about collective action. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be scared for humans. We will eventually go extinct no matter what because nothing lasts forever anyway. It probably won&#39;t happen very soon even if we come close. No empire or dynasty or corporation lasts forever either. By all means, fight them if they are unjust and you&#39;re inspired to. But sometimes some things are just impossible to change. What is always available to you is YOU and your thoughts and emotions, so get right with your inner using whichever modalities you trust. If your inner spirit is not louder than the world then you will need infinite compassion. If you earnestly ask what there is to be done and make space for an answer I think it is impossible not to receive one, even if it is incomprehensible at times. I hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paul Stamets was contracted by the government to develop methods to counteract bio-terrorism. His specialty is mushrooms. </p>

<p>I watched a movie on chemtrails, and samples showed high levels of aluminum and other elements. The mycelium that produce mushrooms are able to filter out the contaminants in soil. In the desert, mycelium coats salt so that it doesn&#39;t interfere with plant growth. They filter water, break down materials into usable nutrients, produce enzymes for specific use and should be incorporated wherever possible. </p>

<p>Permaculure methods, specifically food forests, hugelkultur and water storage will become increasingly economical. </p>

<p>3D printing is moving along. There are several methods to maximize potential local resources. The more we can get out of stuff that can&#39;t be easily bottlenecked, that can be replicated worldwide and be shared freely, the more true freedom will abound. </p>

<p>When we make it possible for communities to be self reliant and producing a product for the larger market, the sooner we will stop paying for structures that find profit in servicing needs. </p>

<p>We need to restructure our tools to service the community. Make use of material that is widely available or able to be localized, 3d print our tools and then anyone anywhere will be able to satisfy their basic needs at a higher standard than we already can with ever diminishing efforts. </p>

<p>People are freed to pursue their creative and innovative desires and enhance their position, but the base standard would never put someone in a position of need. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>99% vs. 1%?</p>

<p>I think you are scared of something you shouldn&#39;t be.  We just need enough people to wake up to get fed up to the point of sustained, and organized dissent.</p>

<p>There is no way &quot;TPTB&quot; can survive even just 5% of the population in organized, continuous dissent.  After just 5% of the population starts open rebellion then &quot;a bandwagon effect&quot; takes place and the majority of the population will join in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Citizen Loyalty, Mass Protest and Authoritarian Survival</strong></p>

<p>Citizen loyalty to a dictatorship, as it is clear i
n Kuran’s (1991) seminal 
study, often results from &quot;preference falsification
&quot;: citizens are loyal to the 
dictatorship out of fear, and because they realize 
that in isolation each 
individual is powerless to bring its collapse. In p
ublic they signal their loyalty, 
but in private each citizen has a &quot;true preference&quot;
 that might range from 
detesting the regime, to feeling apathetic, to stro
ngly endorsing it.<br/>
This theory uncovers a great vulnerability of dicta
torships to mass 
protest. It shows that public sentiment can turn ag
ainst apparently 
unshakable dictatorships with amazing velocity, as 
small oppositions cascade 
into overwhelming majorities. The mechanism is give
n by a tipping 
phenomenon in which the participation in acts of pu
blic protests by a small 
group can cascade, triggering a bandwagon of dissen
t. </p>

<p>The C.I.A. uses this very &quot;Bandwagon Effect&quot; to destabilize governments, dictators, and other oligarchies around the world.  There is no reason it won&#39;t work for American Citizens vs. a Zionist-Jew owned, Israel First, corrupted Federal Government as well.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a lame-ass, lazy, uneducated excuse.</p>

<p>I can and do eat healthy for a whole lot less than eating unhealthy. The difference is, I have to cook the food for myself. No TV dinners. No McDonald&#39;s. Just real ingredients mixed up together to provide proper nutrition, seasoned with herbs and spices for great taste, too.</p>

<p>Save money, eat better, live longer. Cook at home. Hell, grow your own food to cook, as others on this thread have suggested, and it&#39;s even cheaper and more healthy!</p>

<p>As to stress reduction... well, I would imagine hookers can be pricey. But exercise can be basically free. You don&#39;t need anything besides your own body and space to do more than enough exercises to keep you fit.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s putting down the cancer sticks. That&#39;s tougher because once you&#39;re addicted it seems to require the willpower of an ox or medical assistance to get off them. But in the end, most smokers would be saving not only their lungs but also the equivalent of a car payment or more per month if they could just stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I buy organic whenever it&#39;s available. It&#39;s more expensive than the non-organic, but not by enough that I notice a difference, and certainly not so much as to make it remotely comparable to eating prepared / packaged or restaurant food.</p>

<p>One of the easiest ways to reduce your food budget is to reduce meat consumption. $4-6 per pound of beef is a painful premium to pay for nutrition that could be obtained much less expensively from other sources.</p>

<p>Farmers markets, if there are any near you, are also good places to shop. Fresher food, less overhead.</p>

<p>And still, even if you&#39;re not eating organic, but you&#39;re eating food you cook yourself instead of prepared or (most) restaurant foods, you&#39;re eating more healthy than most, aren&#39;t you?</p>

<p>You certainly make more than your average individual&#39;s salary then, because the huge majority of consumers notice a difference if they eat organic year round compared to conventional. </p>

<p>I realize this is just a small sampling, but the example posted here shows a significant difference in many products:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might have a point on what it would take for me to notice.</p>

<p>I probably have a bit different mindset than many. I try to live below my means.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t scrimp on what I put into my body because that seems to be one of, if not the biggest, driver of my health. But by the same token, I spend in very limited fashion on many other things others might spend more on - things like computer gaming, movies, booze, clothing, car, house, etc.</p>

<p>Those are good links, thanks. A few of the items look like the organics are less expensive, but most are considerably more.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to post some facts and/or logic in rebuttal. Please do.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could explain how:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s impossible for people to cook for themselves and make intelligent choices when shopping for food</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s impossible for people to get a decent amount of exercise using only space and their own bodies</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s super easy for people to quit smoking</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Or did  you mean the hookers being pricey crack? On that topic, I will absolutely admit ignorance.</p>

<p>Therein lies the trick. You have to train your mind to ignore the outside influences and do what&#39;s right for you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard, especially with the flood of information and indoctrination and especially advertising we&#39;re all subjected to daily, from infancy. But it&#39;s necessary to break that wall down in order to live a happy life.</p>

<p>It is a refusal, to the maximum extent possible (legal? practical?), to allow anyone or anything else to have influence over your actions and decisions, and therefore control over your happiness.</p>

For every woman who will make herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven.’” This quote is in striking contrast to the New Testament where Jesus affirmed the value of women, and the fact that Paul taught that we are all one in Christ.</p>

<p>Matthew 24:3 “And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? <strong>And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?”</strong> </p>

<p>Mark 13:32 <strong>But of that day and that hour knoweth no man</strong>, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</p>

<p>Although I absolutely believe that someday Jesus Christ will return to Earth and destroy it, and save those who have been saved by the blood of Him, I absolutely don&#39;t believe that any human, clergy member, or government knows when this will happen.  TPTB are brainwashing the imminent return of Christ as a mind control technique to get Christians to acquiesce to, and accept this tyranny and not fight back.  It&#39;s been an extremely effective technique, and has taken the fight right out of a large number of Evangelical Christians.</p>

<p>My own mother is a victim of this brainwashing mind control pysop.  She knows exactly what is going on, and refuses to speak out against it, because she thinks Jesus is going to come and save her before the shit really hits the fan.  She believes the Rapture is going to take place before the suffering which will follow, so she is not willing to vest any time or energy into stopping it, she actually wants it to happen, so she can go to Heaven.</p>

<p>I am very secure in my Faith, and know in my heart that whenever Christ returns, or whenever and wherever He decides to take me, He will.  I have absolutely no fear of dying, that decision is out of my hands and in God&#39;s hands, but that certainly doesn&#39;t mean I want it to happen.</p>

Tell your Mom to read all of Matthew 24... there is clearly no rapture before the tribulation. (verse 9 and 15 especially shows that Christians will still be around).</p>

<p>Luke 12:54-56 says - &quot;Jesus also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you say at once, ‘A shower is coming.’ And so it happens. And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be scorching heat,’ and it happens. You hypocrites!

    <div class="md"><p>The best way to make change is to not participate in anything related to industry. You cut the flow of money you will force change. </p>

<p>Think about all the farmers markets that accept food stamps that put that money back into their local community. What if you could get them to guarantee that if you bought food local they would offer 10% credit on your next purchase if you paid with food stamps.</p>

<p>What if you paid to repair broken appliances and other electronics. Or kept your car for longer. Only bought fuel once a week. Got entire unions of workers that demanded mass transport instead of cars to get to work </p>

<p>These are things that would change the world we know. Its something that takes time and effort that no one will do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to realize, the great collapse will happen regardless of what we do at this point. Even if the NWO agenda wasn&#39;t real, the economic situation is too far advanced to rectify short of ending the fed/central banks and completely overhauling the banking system. Which won&#39;t happen due to the corptocracy that we live in.</p>

<p>Things are going to breakdown and collapse in major metropolitan centers regardless, and the effects will be felt around the world.</p>

<p>Your best bet other than waking people up is move to a more rural place, grow your own food, stockpile supplies, etc.</p>

<p>I disagree with you.  I think that technology is so advanced, they can absolutely artificially prolong any bubble from bursting for as long as they wanted to.  If any economic collapse happens, it&#39;s not going to a crash which happens naturally, it&#39;s going to be a false flag operation to further their NWO agenda.</p>

<p>They can only kick the can down the road so long because declining labor force participation and declining real incomes is not something you can cover up by changing numbers around on a computer screen. Eventually people get so poor they demand a change, and that is when the false flags are most likely going to happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Declining real incomes is serious, but not enough to for a complete breakdown in the entire structure.</p>

<p>Declining labor force participation is certainly an issue, however this also is not enough if you take into account the mechanization and automation which we are seeing increasingly more and more.  </p>

<p>These two things can be covered up pretty easily, especially when it&#39;s the government who is the one that&#39;s releasing the reports giving the numbers for both of these reports.  They can just continue lying which they have been, and most people probably won&#39;t think twice.</p>

<p>Any event which were to happen economically will be completely rigged and pre-planned IMO.  The entire game is rigged, but that transcends both the upside as well as the down.</p>

<p>Of course it is. If you make 10 dollars an hour and a loaf of bread is 10 dollars, that&#39;s going to break down society...</p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s great for the top 5% who own stocks, but for your average person that&#39;s not going to mean shit.</p>

<p>The best way to go about this is taking a page from zionists propaganda. By applying hasbara techniques to awaken people to the realities of a dystopia we can convince others to take up the pen and paper as a moderm sword and shield.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="/u/ChangeThroughTruth">/u/ChangeThroughTruth</a> has it completely correct.  The way we achieve a better world is by informing everybody so that they inform everybody, so that everybody knows the truth about the world and what needs to be improved.  The objective is to create a world where the leaders actually care for the good of their people, and that can only come from change.</p>

<p>This is the exact epiphany that I had last night.  The world is so cruel and nobody cares, so much so that I seriously consider trying to find ways to force change onto the world.  But the powers that be have prevented any form of freedom fighting from seeming justified to people, and so the only way to achieve change is by improving the people first.  Make it a responsibility to be informed.  Only then can we begin to improve the world.</p>
