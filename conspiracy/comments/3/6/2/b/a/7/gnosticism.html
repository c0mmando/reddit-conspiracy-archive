<p>This is incorrect. Its writings are considered some of the earliest Christian teachings. Also, arguably its teachings can be traced back to before Christ.</p>

<p>How would you say that it continues to influence modern Rome derived Christianity now?</p>

<p>One can argue the direct opposite, considering that Gnostic teachings predate Christianity and some of its earliest writings are Gnostic.</p>

<p>No. It&#39;s a scientific method that was used to determine it was some of the earliest writings as opposed to just stating an opinion. Orphism, etc, has nothing to do with the original statement.</p>

<p>This would have been more along the lines of shaping some of the new Christian dogma to fit their existing religious convictions, rather than changing their beliefs to fit what the early Christians were teaching. Which, assuming I&#39;m correct (haven&#39;t studied Gnosticism in a while), could potentially explain OP&#39;s confusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosticism is an imprecise term, and the answer determines how you define that term.</p>

<p>Orphism predated Christianity and Gnosticism.  Jews who believed in a Judaism/Orphism syncrete are nowadays called the &quot;Hellenized Jews.&quot;  After Christianity, Orphism continued to exist and some of the cults (Orphism is, by definition, a cult due to its secrecy) absorbed the new Christian teachings.  Others created competing beliefs that were responses to Christianity.  Today, all of these cults are called &quot;Gnostic.&quot;  What they have in common are origins in Orphism, and continued teachings of Orphism.</p>

<p>You can find small traces of Orphism even in the Bible.  Simon the Cyrenean is an obscure example of such.  The presence of a Cyrenean at the crucifixion march is significant. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>This is again incorrect. Gnosticism is one of, if not, the earliest religion known. The Vedic Religion is a core Gnostic philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What they have in common are origins in Orphism, and continued teachings of Orphism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gnosticism traces his teachings from Ancient Egypt. Orphism also traces his beliefs from Ancient Egypt. The esoteric knowledge found in Greece traces his origins from Ancient Egypt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gnosticism is primarily defined in a Christian context.[4][5] In the past, some scholars thought that gnosticism predated Christianity and included pre-Christian religious beliefs and spiritual practices argued to be common to early Christianity, Neoplatonism, Hellenistic Judaism, Greco-Roman mystery religions, and Zoroastrianism (especially Zurvanism). The discussion of gnosticism changed radically with the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library and led to a revision of older assumptions. To date, no pre-Christian gnostic texts have been found,[6] and gnosticism as a unique and recognizable belief system is considered to be a second century (or later) development.[7]

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Its message is antithetical to Christ&#39;s, and by A.D. 60-66, disciples were writing against its teachings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is incorrect. Its writings are considered some of the earliest Christian teachings. Also, arguably its teachings can be traced back to before Christ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A.D. 60-66, disciples were writing against its teachings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which writings were these?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It continues to influence modern Rome-derived Christianity, and, in that sense, it is nearly the original perversion of Christianity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How would you say that it continues to influence modern Rome derived Christianity now?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is nearly the original perversion of Christianity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One can argue the direct opposite, considering that Gnostic teachings predate Christianity and some of its earliest writings are Gnostic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also: wrong sub, mostly.</p>

<p>Mostly.</p>

<p>I would rather believe science versus opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree that this is true, and submit this is all the evidence you should need to realize that Gnosticism is not a form of Christianity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, thinking logically and looking at it plausibly, &#39;modern&#39; Christianity descended from a preceding philosophy as with most philosophies/religions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m writing a book on the subject and don&#39;t want to get scooped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but weren&#39;t there some Gnostic sects that attempted to amalgamate their own version of Christ&#39;s (purported) teachings into their beliefs? </p>

<p>This would have been more along the lines of shaping some of the new Christian dogma to fit their existing religious convictions, rather than changing their beliefs to fit what the early Christians were teaching. Which, assuming I&#39;m correct (haven&#39;t studied Gnosticism in a while), could potentially explain OP&#39;s confusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best place to start is by studying the Greek N.T. along with the Greek Orphist writings.  Once you have got that under your belt, learn Syriac, and compare.</p>

<p>If you just want the Cliff&#39;s Notes that point you to some already-translated material, your best sources are the Sermon on the Mount and Acts.</p>
