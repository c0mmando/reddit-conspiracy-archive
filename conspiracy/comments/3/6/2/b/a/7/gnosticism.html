       Gnosticism is a syncrete of Orphism (Pythagoreanism) and Christianity.  Its message is antithetical to Christ's, and by A.D. 60-66, disciples were writing against its teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's definitely not the original Christianity in any true sense of the word.  It continues to influence modern Rome-derived Christianity, and, in that sense, it is nearly the original perversion of Christianity.

       This is incorrect. Its writings are considered some of the earliest Christian teachings. Also, arguably its teachings can be traced back to before Christ.

       One can argue the direct opposite, considering that Gnostic teachings predate Christianity and some of its earliest writings are Gnostic.

       No. It's a scientific method that was used to determine it was some of the earliest writings as opposed to just stating an opinion. Orphism, etc, has nothing to do with the original statement.

       How can it be when the earliest writings were Gnostic? If the early teachings of Christ were Gnostic, then how can the 'modern' teachings of Christ be contaminated later by Gnostic teachings?

       Correct me if I'm wrong but weren't there some Gnostic sects that attempted to amalgamate their own version of Christ's (purported) teachings into their beliefs?
      </p>
      <p>
       This would have been more along the lines of shaping some of the new Christian dogma to fit their existing religious convictions, rather than changing their beliefs to fit what the early Christians were teaching. Which, assuming I'm correct (haven't studied Gnosticism in a while), could potentially explain OP's confusion.

       Gnosticism is an imprecise term, and the answer determines how you define that term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orphism predated Christianity and Gnosticism.  Jews who believed in a Judaism/Orphism syncrete are nowadays called the "Hellenized Jews."  After Christianity, Orphism continued to exist and some of the cults (Orphism is, by definition, a cult due to its secrecy) absorbed the new Christian teachings.  Others created competing beliefs that were responses to Christianity.  Today, all of these cults are called "Gnostic."  What they have in common are origins in Orphism, and continued teachings of Orphism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find small traces of Orphism even in the Bible.  Simon the Cyrenean is an obscure example of such.  The presence of a Cyrenean at the crucifixion march is significant.

       This is again incorrect. Gnosticism is one of, if not, the earliest religion known. The Vedic Religion is a core Gnostic philosophy.

       Gnosticism traces his teachings from Ancient Egypt. Orphism also traces his beliefs from Ancient Egypt. The esoteric knowledge found in Greece traces his origins from Ancient Egypt.

       The other guy you're arguing with pointlessly is much more educated on this topic than I am. If you'd pay attention to what he's saying and take it under consideration rather than responding in a hostile or dismissive manner, you might find that you are being provided with a great deal of useful information on this subject. Moreso than I can provide.

       The best place to start is by studying the Greek N.T. along with the Greek Orphist writings.  Once you have got that under your belt, learn Syriac, and compare.

       If you just want the Cliff's Notes that point you to some already-translated material, your best sources are the Sermon on the Mount and Acts.

       Intention is what makes this possible.  Intention is like setting a compass.  If your intention is to find TRUTH, even if you make a "wrong turn", a course correction is made that puts you back on track.

      <p>
       A certain amount of "wrong turns" is beneficial from the stand point that once experienced these dead ends are much easier to spot.

       Gnosticism is primarily defined in a Christian context.[4][5] In the past, some scholars thought that gnosticism predated Christianity and included pre-Christian religious beliefs and spiritual practices argued to be common to early Christianity, Neoplatonism, Hellenistic Judaism, Greco-Roman mystery religions, and Zoroastrianism (especially Zurvanism). The discussion of gnosticism changed radically with the discovery of the Nag Hammadi library and led to a revision of older assumptions. To date, no pre-Christian gnostic texts have been found,[6] and gnosticism as a unique and recognizable belief system is considered to be a second century (or later) development.[7]

       This would have been more along the lines of shaping some of the new Christian dogma to fit their existing religious convictions, rather than changing their beliefs to fit what the early Christians were teaching. Which, assuming I'm correct (haven't studied Gnosticism in a while), could potentially explain OP's confusion.

       Can you suggest some sources we could look into for what you have hinted at as 'true' or 'original' Christianity?

       The best place to start is by studying the Greek N.T. along with the Greek Orphist writings.  Once you have got that under your belt, learn Syriac, and compare.

       If you just want the Cliff's Notes that point you to some already-translated material, your best sources are the Sermon on the Mount and Acts.
