       I wouldn't say reddit is that censored, even has ways to monitor and report mod censorship, or creating new subs. If you think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is censored (maybe on some issues it is? I don't look that closely)  start a new one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The voting patterns , however, are very different sub to sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       brings an odd mix of truth seekers and haters and everyone else.

       From what I read last night, the only censorship is going to be directed against subs and their members specifically created to attack and harass other subs, or individuals. That's fine with me. Such malicious persecution of subs and individuals has no place on Reddit.

       Their mods have always been very heavy-handed.  They only allow a very limited "conspiracy" view to be voiced there.  There haven't been any free-spirited conspiracy sites for years.  Anywhere there were lots of people gathered in one place that allowed for instant reporting was bought out or shut down.

       All of the ones I've listed have been formally investigated and/or have been exposed to the public (to some degree, not always MSM headlines). That is what I consider an actual conspiracy, not just a conspiracy theory.

       So you just accept a theory that is 'formally' investigated and 'exposed' without much evidence. What about vested interest? I will present an example:
A government entity runs an operation of some sort that has radical affects on the nation and/or people. The same entity spawns series of formal investigations that 'expose' the doings of the original event. These investigations are marked as 'independent' that urge 'critical thinking' and the like. Which one is the legit one? I am not running a trolling event. I have genuine interest in a quick discussion. Not trying to debunk anything, but rather invoke some logical points where applicable. You can use actual examples like 9/11. Thanks

       Hmm I see where you're coming from but you sure have a way of beating around the bush about it, hence the downvotes out of misunderstanding. Perhaps creating a post with your premise and allowing the community to freely respond would be more effective in facilitating the constructive discussion that you're seeking.

       I suppose you're pinning all official investigations as coverups and psyops. I can understand the skepticism towards the theatrics of officially unveiling conspiracies in the modern age. In my opinion, I'll trust official unveilings that have been kept primarily under the rug (my list excluding Watergate and Benghazi). If something rotten has been discovered and the whole investigation has been scrapped and forgotten, it usually reeks of coverup and alludes to the presence of a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your opinion of whistleblowers that aren't publicized? They're usually title holders within organizations that come out of the gagging order with dirty details and are kept quiet by the mainstream media. Are they all setup by their organizations to release trivial information in a controlled manner then take a bullet or prison sentence?

       Well. The title of this post has a very assertive statement that is hugely misleading and is begging for a basic assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT pinning any investigations as cover ups, I am probing the path of logic when a 'conspiracy' is analyzed and talked about. For now, let's put your question on the whistle blowing aside, we are jumping to far too soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will try to relay my point in a different manner. It is clear how an event can be viewed as a pre-planned conspiracy. I can see how some individuals clearly cannot trust the official reports and other data about it. I can also see how the media cannot be trusted since it is federated by the party or parties who contrived the event in the first place. Now, the important part - with all that in mind, how can the same individuals trust the media released materials (TV news, internet articles, 'witness' testimonies, etc.) since they are channeled by the 'perpetrators' themselves. I will make an example: 9/11. We all saw it on TV. The conspiracy crowd uses TV coverage and other materials released through public sources as evidence in their research without analyzing their legitimacy at all. This is what surprises me. Instead, the same conspiracy crowd goes on to immediately believe 'Engineers' and pilots who are basing their claims on the same official evidence. I see a big problem there. Do you?

       I apologize for the delayed response.
      </p>

       I suppose for a lot of events with conspiracy theories floating around the masses are limited to information from the official sources because simply we weren't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       With events such as Sandy Hook, the Aurora theater shooting and Columbine, there were CCTV feeds that only the authorities/agencies have their hands on and only the latter were released after editing. The events were so isolated from the public view, the official recording is all we (would) have to work with. Same goes with the CCTV feed depicting four of the 9/11 hijackers go through security, we're unsure if the video has been altered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of New Yorkers on 9/11 were probably in too much shock to grab their bulky VHS camera rigs and go film. Any non-NY who wanted to have "tangible evidence" recorded the news broadcasts with their VCRs. Same goes with the Boston Bombing, there were several released clips of the bombs going off taken by amateur and professional photographers but they went through the filters of the MSM before reaching the public. Same goes with the Charlie Hebdo shootings, there were a few amateur cellphone videos that were edited before airing and distribution. Another example is of the Al Qaeda, Taliban, OBL and ISIS footage coming only from SITE Intelligence group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today we have the power of cameraphones, as we've seen with the Ferguson &amp; Baltimore riots and the Egypt revolution. These events were public and not all-at-once occurrences. Many people are able to videotape everything and upload to public hosting sites. This will benefit us in the future just as long as those video clips are shared through the right outlets. Selling them to CNN will put cash in your pocket but your video is likely to be altered and spun with sensationalism. I feel that popular video sharing sites will not be trustworthy outlets with the increasing pressure on censorship for the sake of "cybersecurity".
      </p>
      <p>
       Your skepticism is a shared opinion with much of the community and we must do are best with what we have in our reach.

       No worries. I will ask one last question. Have you ever considered any (or all) of these events being simply media spectacles with no real event taking place, just the blown up coverage and massive publicity?
