        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY)—an opponent of the secretive Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that would fast-track the Pacific Rim trade deal Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)—went inside the secret room inside the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday morning to read the TPP text and told Breitbart News exclusively afterwards that he believes President Barack Obama should make it public now.
The deal’s text is kept in a room behind double doors that each have signs: “No Public Or Media Beyond This Point.”</p>

<p>“It’s done like you’re going in to read a classified briefing though it’s not actually ‘classified.’ It’s called ‘confidential,’” Paul said in an interview with Breitbart News outside the room after reading it. Paul and his legal staff spent about 45 minutes in the room reading the deal’s text.</p>

<p>“I think the staff signed an agreement [which didn’t include a non-disclosure]—they signed in, it’s  a normal procedure,” he explained. “But I wasn’t required to sign in.”</p>

<p>When asked for some of the details that are inside the TPP agreement, Paul said he’s not allowed to tell us that. But he did say the secret trade deal that his Kentucky colleague, Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), wants to rush through the Senate is about 800 pages long. He added he plans to seek additional information from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office—including a briefing from them—and suspects that the text he read isn’t even the final version of the deal.</p>

<p>“I think I am not supposed to reveal the details of it, but I can tell you it was about 800 pages long,” Paul said.</p>

<p>I think while we’ve gotten at least some headway in understanding what’s in it, I think it raises more questions that will require more research to fully understand what’s in it. We’re going to pursue that with someone from the U.S. Trade Representative—we’re going to pursue more information from them. Some of the questions are whether we’re seeing the final agreement or this is in the interim agreement before the final agreement. That’s a question we still have. I have a feeling that what we’re seeing is a work product, not a final.
Paul said he thinks the “secretive” process hurts the “cause” of TPA and TPP advocates, and is calling on the Obama administration to publicly release the deal’s details before future votes on the matter in the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>“The thing is is that I think it actually hurts their cause by making it so secretive—while I can’t discuss the details of what was in there because of them calling it secret, I didn’t see anything that I didn’t think couldn’t be made public with a problem,” Paul said. “If so, I’m missing something because we read through 800 pages of it and we didn’t see anything that I couldn’t conclude couldn’t be made public.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t propose a thesis. I proposed a fake argument to illustrate the failure of your argument. My fake argument actually makes more sense than yours does. Rand thinks there is no reason for the secrecy and I (and I think you) agree. Even if the thing is a terrible idea, there is no reason we shouldn&#39;t know what it says. Notice that Rand gave no comments on the content and weather it&#39;s good, bad or otherwise? The reason is because it doesn&#39;t matter. We should know what it says no matter what - hence, no reason for the secrecy. </p>

<p>You go ahead and stay where you are. I&#39;m not trying to get you to move, but for what it&#39;s worth no one has &quot;initiated action against it&quot;. All anyone, including Rand, has done is say release the text. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The purpose of my argument was to illustrate your faulty logic. I do not know what is in the TPP and neither do you. Your argument is based on the assumption that there is reason for the secrecy and that Rand&#39;s lack of action is evidence that he is part of the group that would like to see the thing enacted. Rand&#39;s action&#39;s match what he is saying and that was the purpose of my &quot;fake&quot; argument that obviously went right over your head. If you believe the public has a right to know, then their is never any reason for secrecy. Just because he read the thing and didn&#39;t take action (which you also argued isn&#39;t possible anyway) it doesn&#39;t mean anything. Life and politics require more tact than you realize perhaps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now we are getting somewhere. I assume the same as you, but what you can&#39;t assume (or at least shouldn&#39;t) is that a person&#39;s reaction should be X, Y or Z because they have have access to the information that you and I do not. Just because he read the thing and didn&#39;t run out of the room like his head was on fire to tell us what it says doesn&#39;t mean anything. I assume the thing is terrible, which is the cause for the secrecy. However, it&#39;s equally possible he walked in a room and looked at 800 blank pages, and the whole reason for the secrecy is to get us to pay attention to the TPP while they do something else that is equally terrible. I doubt this is the case, but I do not  <em>know</em>, and neither do you, which was the whole point in my original post - don&#39;t pretend to know what someone&#39;s reaction should be when you have no information on which to base your judgments. </p>

<p>Anyway, back to the original topic. There is going to be a president regardless of what I do and if given the chance to vote for him, I will do so on the off-chance he is/will betray those that think they have purchased him. If you have any better suggestions on how to approach the situation, then I&#39;m all ears. However, if your original point in posting was simply to lambaste Paul, then you really had no point at all. Not that lambasting politicians has no point, Paul has plenty to lambaste as do the rest of them, but it really has no point in this thread. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you said is correct.  But its a little deeper even.  Rand Paul, Bernie Sanders, these are controlled opposition.  They are there to give you illusion that there are actual choices.  There are no real choices in the presidential election.  </p>

<p>If every uncorrupted citizen in the country wrote in the name of the same one random person, I doubt that person would become president.  Even if they did, would it matter?  He or she would be dead within weeks.  The Council on Foreign Relations (private institution, basically just a political wing of international banking) makes the majority of the decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it is. It is your responsibility to vote who you feel would do the best job. If they change once elected into office and become someone who doesn&#39;t represent you or if they have alternative agendas then you have the choice of firing their ass in the next election. I guess your sentence says it all, so many people don&#39;t want to be responsible and would rather be sitting back bothering &quot;no one&quot; but still having the luxury of bitching about how they have done you wrong. Our forefathers gave us this opportunity to be responsible, but over the course of 50 years we have gotten lazy and allowed ourselves to be lead instead of leading as a whole. I have voted for the wrong person over my voting career but you know what, they didn&#39;t get a second chance to screw me over again. In this day and age there is no reason not to be informed and spread the word who is a bad politician and who is good. The bad politicians are counting on more people like you to leave them without any oversight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came here to say this. I heard very similar complaints from Elizabeth Warren the other day on NPR:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been able to go to a special, secured room. I can&#39;t take any electronic devices, no computer, no iPhone. I can&#39;t even walk out with paper notes. I can go and read about the agreement but I cannot come out in public and talk about any of the specifics. The press can&#39;t see it; the public can&#39;t see it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why can&#39;t you come out in public and talk about any of the specifics? What would happen? Are you not protected by the first amendment? Or did you sign some sort of non-disclosure agreement in order to be able to look at the documents?</p>

<p>And tell me more about this room? Who runs it? Who has set the parameters?</p>

<p>So many important questions that reporters should be asking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not supposed to reveal it? fuck that, just blab on public media and watch the police state drag his ass through some black box prison &quot;we told you not to do it&quot; shang. that would most certainly get people talking about wtf is going on. worse yet he &quot;suicides&quot;</p>

<p>why <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> he talk about it?! national security?! fuck off, if even our most out there congress members are admittedly too pussy to fuck with the black state, who will? whistle blowers?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We ought to have the Jade Helm troops take over Washington with these type of shenanigans going on. The congress should not consider any treaty that they have not fully read and understood. I know, this is alien to them since they read nothing except the cliff note versions of legislation as prepared for them by lobbyists. But our congress writes nothing, reads nothing, does no research, etc. The US Trade Representative ought to be fully investigated for conflicts of interest and corruption. The TPP is a disaster and if these congressional numb skuills give the President Fast Track authority on this or ANY treaty, then they all need to be recalled.    </p>
