      <blockquote>
       <p>
        By now, vaccine skeptics are generally familiar with the faces of Congressmen who are attempting to take away their natural rights to determine whether or not they and their children are vaccinated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congressional parasites like Dianne Feinstein, as well as Presidential hopefuls like Hillary Clinton and Ben Carson, are now regular appearances in the “remove parents’ rights” theatre.
       </p>
       <p>
        But how many people are familiar with the faces of the state level sycophants that are attempting to eliminate basic human rights? After all, there have been a number of state level attacks against parents and children in recent months.
       </p>
       <p>
        What about the State Senators and Representatives who have accepted money from Big Pharma at the expense of their constituents or are simply trendy fanatics by nature?
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vGsInAbe2zo/VV_Xb_6moPI/AAAAAAAAGeU/_oFS00UcPEQ/s1600/tarte.jpg">
         Ladies and gentlemen, I give you NC State Senator Jeff Tarte.
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        As if his last name did not accurately describe his disposition, Senator Tarte was one of the main sponsors of the
        <a href="http://www.wral.com/nc-vaccine-bill-dead/14554219/">
         NC bill SB 346
        </a>
        , a bill that would have eliminated the “religious exemption” clause in the recommended vaccine schedule for children entering NC public schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was also a main contender for the title of worst public relations interaction with a constituent in the state of North Carolina in the last several years.
       </p>
       <p>
        This interaction took place after activists Nicole Revels and Pattie Curran arrived in Raleigh to hand petitions containing nearly 3000 signatures of NC residents who did not want their rights removed to NC congressmen and congresswomen who were attempting to do just that.
       </p>
       <p>
        After handing in a copy of the petition to Senator Tamara Barringer and receiving a very pleasant, albeit patronizing and completely phony response that she was “listening” to them, all parties shook hands and the activists moved on to Tarte’s office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon arriving at Tarte’s office, the Senator became irate at the sight of the two activists and Revels in particular. Already engaged in a discussion of the bill, Tarte immediately began whining about the presence of cameras and, in particular, the presence of Nicole Revels, stating that he was going to “get the Sgt. In Arms” to remove them.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://dailyhaymaker.com/?p=10924">
         Visibly irritated
        </a>
        at being confronted by anyone other than a fawning worshiper or someone taking his order, Tarte could scarcely cover up the look of disgust at being asked a legitimate question about a bill he was sponsoring.
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked if he was going to remove the religious exemption from accessibility to NC parents, Tarte simply responded “Yes.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Shortly thereafter, Tarte indeed found the Sgt. In Arms and had Revels and Curran removed.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1Oejvw_yX0">
         The confrontation can be seen in this video
        </a>
        . Tarte’s appearance is around the 6:53 mark.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://vaccinefactcheck.org/2015/04/02/north-carolina-becomes-3rd-state-to-reject-stricter-mandatory-vaccination-laws/">
         While the bill was ultimately defeated
        </a>
        due to the work of activists like Curran and Revels and large numbers of NC parents who valued the natural human rights, the issue very much remains alive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vaccine pushers, fanatics, along with those Congressional money vessels who have been purchased by Big Pharma dollars will no doubt return with another version of the bill or insert it as a rider or last minute amendment to a larger bill that will be politically difficult to vote against.

       The vaccine debate is not about the efficacy of vaccines. It is about the right of self determination, like abortion. Who has the right to decide what goes into your body or what you choose to do with your body? If the self, the vaccines should be optional. If the State, then we are not free people.

       The same argument could be used against drug regulation and a thousand other things the government forces you into. People need to accept that in today's world, you do not own your own body, at least not practically. You don't even own your own mind. We're just like trained dogs, chained up when we're useless and we don't benefit from our own labor.

       No, people do not need to accept slavery to the State. You are free to accept such, but do not believe for one second that your acceptance implies everyone should or will simply give up.

       So is this bill forcing people to vaccinate their kids, or forcing people to vaccinate their kids if they want them to enter public schools? Because those are two totally different things.

       If you trust your government, and the corporations that run it, enough to let them inject you with substances
       <strong>
        unknown to you
       </strong>
       , than you're out of your mind. We're talking about the very same government that perpetuated 9/11 on the American people- the same government responsible for MK Ultra, Project Paperclip, Operation Mockingbird.
       <strong>
        The list goes on ceaselessly.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mandatory vaccination is allowing the ruling class to dictate our very own, individual biology. The very same class that has refered to us as "useless eaters". If we allow them to make such paramount decisions for us,
       <strong>
        they'll sterilize 9/10th's of the US population, or worse.
       </strong>
       These people, if that's what they can be called, can not be trusted in the least to hold our best interests at heart, and you'd be a complete fool to do so.

       I remember a few months back, there was a big uproar when Kenyan doctors announced they found the anti-fertility HCG antigen in the tetanus vaccine the UN provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/mass-sterilization-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-un-tetanus-vaccine/">
        http://healthimpactnews.com/2014/mass-sterilization-kenyan-doctors-find-anti-fertility-agent-in-un-tetanus-vaccine/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if this is true. I'd imagine the rising population in African countries has got the UN worried. It would be so easy for them to slow down population growth there by slipping a little anti-fertility drug into their life saving vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has me worried is that this could so easily be done in first world countries. If a depopulation strategy does happen (or is happening) I think this is the most effective way to do it.

       I don't know about you (actually, I think I do), but it's very clear to me which one of these two choices is the best one for me, and for everyone else on the planet to make. This is called critical thinking.

       Interesting, a site so anti-medical research shows ads by Bayer for their products. I think the fact that they don't care about something as simple as ads goes to show that they probably don't care about accuracy and responsible journalism either.

       They aren't necessary for public health. Sure, there's a benefit, along with potential downsides, but necessary? Clearly not.

       It is necessary to force everyone to take vaccines for every disease? Have you even thought about what such an initiative would entail? It means medical tracking of every person in the country, forced medical treatment. Isn't that against the general ethics of medical care?

       I think that not having outbreaks of smallpox and swathes of polio-affected children isn't just a benefit, it's driven society forward. Whether it's independent labs or Big Pharma providing these to us, I don't care. In any case, they make us less susceptible to truly horrifying and debilitating diseases.

       I've been vaccinated as well.

       New vaccines,

       are created all the time. Let's say they do get these mandatory vaccination bills passed, and just a few years down the road, our economy collapses, and full-blown government dissidence becomes a major issue for the ruling elite. With the careful consideration of history, decades of social engineering saying the world is overpopulated, civil chaos and the biggest threat to the ruling class since the inception of the nation.

       Its your accusation of naïveté and blind trust that proves you jump to conclusions. You know nothing about what I think, except for the fact that I disagree with the idea that vaccines are evil, and somehow, you consider that grounds to descend to the level of attacking my person rather than my thoughts.

       No one in politics is suggesting it, and as much as most conspiracy theorists like to think otherwise, what happens in Congress is actually available to the public.

       This is just the beginning. Have you noticed the tremendous amount of attention vaccination has been getting? It's not an accident, nor is it a coincidence. It is deliberate social engineering, and it has one goal.

       What a fallacy of an argument. Funny how you can't discuss one without the other, or having some sort of "ultimatum" argument brought up to rally support for your own side.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like trying to say "If you dislike steaks you must like killing children". Because, obviously no one hates children (denying climate change) so they rally behind liking steaks (vaccines) just to seem like rational people.
