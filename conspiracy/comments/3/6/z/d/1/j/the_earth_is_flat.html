    <div class="md"><p>This is incorrect.</p>

<p>When you see the ship &quot;go down&quot; it is simply the vanishing line of your perspective.  The next time you are in a place to view a ship sailing away, bring a telescope.  After you have seen the ship disappear from view completely with the naked eye, use your telescope.  You can bring the ship entirely back into view.  This clearly indicates that the ship isn&#39;t being blocked by water.</p>

<p>To explain &quot;the vanishing line of your perspective&quot;, consider a very long hallway that you are looking down.  Think about how you see the lines of the floor, ceiling and walls converge as you look down the hallway.  Eventually the floor and the ceiling meet and you can&#39;t see any further down the hallway with your naked eye.  But there is nothing blocking your line of sight and you could see further with a telescope.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for a lot of those things our information just comes from authorities.  Clearly for this to be true there must be scientific authorities involved in covering it up.  For the question of could we go up there, the Van Allen Radiation belts appear to be a problem.     </p>

<p>Consider this video describing the problem: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51DED8dcNkA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51DED8dcNkA</a>      </p>

<p>Now consider this clip of Astronaut Alan Bean describing how they miraculously avoided the Van Allen belts to get to the moon:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3-cTwK65kc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3-cTwK65kc</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>What causes the appearance of gravity? What are GPS satellites doing?      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two questions take a lot of explaining to answer.  I won&#39;t be able to type out thorough explanations here.  Consult the resources I have linked for more detail.  Gravity is an interesting topic.  Research into how the theory of gravity became accepted is interesting.  The short answer is that it was made up as an explanation for the heliocentric model and ball planets.      </p>

<p>GPS satellites don&#39;t actually exist.  GPS is done through radio towers on earth.  There are certain places, closer to Antarctica, where GPS does not work.</p>

<p>If Earth was flat, how would you explain its circular shape when observed from space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question is, how do you explain the lunar eclipses that occur while the sun is also visible in the sky?  The earth blocking the light from the sun is not what causes lunar eclipses.</p>

<p>The Greenwich Royal Observatory recorded that “during the lunar eclipses of July 17th, 1590, November 3rd, 1648, June 16th, 1666, and May 26th, 1668 the moon rose eclipsed whilst the sun was still above the horizon.” McCulluch’s Geography recorded that “on September 20th, 1717 and April 20th, 1837 the moon appeared to rise eclipsed before the sun had set.” Sir Henry Holland also noted in his “Recollections of Past Life” the April 20th, 1837 phenomena where “the moon rose eclipsed before the sun set.” The Daily Telegraph recorded it happening again on January 17th, 1870, then again in July of the same year, and it continues to happen during lunar eclipses to this day. Therefore the eclipsor of the Moon cannot be the Earth/Earth&#39;s shadow and another explanation must be sought.</p>

<p>Also, observed from space is a whole other topic.  Suffice to say NASA does a lot of acting and CGI work.</p>

<p>But when you are considering the shape of the earth, consider the physical proofs first.  The evidence is very strong.  You can perform experiments yourself easily.  Put aside the how and why of the coverup required until afterwards.  Those things take a lot more research and the evidence isn&#39;t something you can physically experiment to prove.</p>

<p>Google &quot;photo of earth&quot;, what do you see?  There are a lot of problems with those images.  The one that you see everywhere is actually a composite image, you can find the clip of the NASA spokesperson saying that themselves.

<p>All of these things we don&#39;t have direct access to.  All of that information comes from official agencies.  We either take them at their word, or we examine the material that the official agencies provide us with.  Once you catch them lying and faking over and over you pretty much have to throw out anything they tell you.</p>

<p>Consider this:  google &quot;photo of earth&quot;.  Now, ignore the fact that its all CGI or composites rather than actual photos for a moment.  Just pick one of them.    </p>

<p>Next watch this quick clip of Neil Degrasse Tyson describing the shape of the earth:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kFjG4jpUhQI">https://youtu.be/kFjG4jpUhQI</a>    </p>

<p>They are aware that there is too much area in the Southern Hemisphere, so they come up with this explanation.  The &quot;photos&quot; you have been presented with are far too perfectly round to fit the description he gives.    </p>

<p>This describes the extra space they are trying to account for in the South:</p>

<p>“From near Cape Horn, Chile to Port Philip in Melbourne, Australia the distance is 9,000 miles. These two places are 143 degrees of longitude from each other. Therefore the whole extent of the Earth’s circumference is a mere arithmetical question. If 143 degrees make 9,000 miles, what will be the distance made by the whole 360 degrees into which the surface is divided? The answer is, 22,657 miles; or, 8357 miles more than the theory of rotundity would permit. It must be borne in mind, however, that the above distances are nautical measure, which, reduced to statute miles, gives the actual distance round the Southern region at a given latitude as 26,433 statute miles; or nearly 1,500 miles more than the largest circumference ever assigned to the Earth at the equator.” -Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, “Earth Not a Globe, 2nd Edition” </p>

<p>When you fly and look out the window, what do you see?  If you think you see the horizon bent it is only because of the curved windows.  But regardless of the window you can see the height of the horizon line at your eye level.  No matter how high you are, the horizon level always rises to your eye level.  This is only possible on a flat plane.  On a ball you should have to look down to the horizon.</p>

<p>That is actually a pretty good proof in itself.  If you send up a camera with a flat lens (most have fisheye, you can see because it warps everything else as well as the horizon), you can see how flat the horizon is. </p>

Keep in mind when the camera is bobbing up and down you can see the horizon curve both concave and convex.  Pay attention to when the camera settles.</p>

<p>It is good that you consider yourself a critical thinker.  I ask you to engage in an exercise.  Put aside the how and the why of the coverup required for this to be true and consider the physical evidence on its own merits.  Follow the links I have provided in this thread, there is a huge wealth of resources.</p>

<p>No, it isn&#39;t.  You can observe the effect yourself quite easily.  Consider looking down a long hallway.  Think about how you see the floor, ceiling and walls as you look down the hallway.  Draw the lines of this image in your mind.  Now think of what you can see as a 2d viewport.  The stuff that is close to you, ie the first 20 feet takes up a lot more space in this 2d viewport than the second 20 feet.  If the hallway is long enough, at some point you cant see any further with the naked eye.  If you were to use a telescope you would be able to see further, but the effect would still be there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t the person who started the thread, the OP seems to have abandoned it.  But I should say that asking for any question and responding to it is probably more difficult than just presenting some proofs. </p>

<p>But here a couple anyway:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>The horizon always rises to your eye level no matter how high you go. If the earth was a ball, at some point going up you would need to look down to the horizon.  Think about the last time you looked out the window of an airplane.  You can test it yourself. Get a camera, stick it on a balloon, let it go. People have gone up to 20 miles with balloons and always see the horizon rise to the level of the camera. That is only possible on a flat plane.  Do keep in mind though that air has moisture and other particles in it, so the distance you can see is not infinite.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider how much water should curve using Pythagorean theorem.  A copy of the book “The Lighthouses of the World” and a calculator are enough to prove that the Earth is not a globe, but an extended flat plane. The distance from which various lighthouse lights around the world are visible at sea far exceeds what could be found on a globe Earth 25,000 miles in circumference. For example, the Dunkerque Light in southern France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from 28 miles away. Spherical trigonometry dictates that if the Earth was a globe with the given curvature of 8 inches per mile squared, this light should be hidden 190 feet below the horizon! </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>No, this is incorrect for a couple of reasons.    </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Air has moisture and other particulate matter in it.  You cannot see through it an infinite distance.  Consider standing at a lookout and viewing two hills, one twice the distance from you as the other.  The further away one will have more of a blue tinge to it due to viewing it through more air.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider your own &quot;viewport&quot;.  Consider looking down a very long hallway.  Think about the lines of the floor, ceiling and walls.  If the hallway is long enough those lines converge in the middle of your view.  The parts of the hallway closer to you take up a larger part of the 2d &quot;viewport&quot; of your vision.  You can extend your viewing distance with magnification, but the hallway effect still remains with a telescope.    </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, if air had nothing suspended in it and you had a telescope with enough magnification (which would be quite a bit), then yes, you could make the sighting you are describing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate that you are asking a serious question.  Do you have a link to an image that shows this phenomenon?</p>

<p>The following is not directly an answer to your question(need image pls), but discusses how the sun appears to us.</p>

<p>The sun &quot;rises&quot; and &quot;sets&quot; due to the law of perspective (I know this might seem like a tangent, but it is vital to the explanation).  That has to do with how things appear as they get far away from you.  Consider looking down a very long hallway.  Think about the lines of intersection between the floor, ceiling and walls.  These lines meet in the middle of your viewable area.  If you consider your viewable area as a 2d &quot;viewport&quot;, the objects that are closer to you, say the first 20ft of hallway, take up more of the viewport than things further away.  Each 20 ft section takes up less of the viewable area as you go down the hall.  For the sections that are very far away, they get an extremely small part of the 2d space.  If you use a telescope, you can change your viewport.  The things close to you are no longer visible, and you get more 2d viewable space for things further away, but the effect at the end is still the same.</p>

<p>The sun rising is the sun coming towards you in a path that is parallel to the earth.  The sun in this case is at the ceiling height from our hallway  The sun is not nearly as high above the earth as you have been told, more like 3000 miles.  At some point it becomes within your viewable perspective and the rise is how it appears during that process.  </p>

<p>Coriolis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not my own answer.  It is copied from here: <a href="http://ifers.boards.net/thread/36/flat-earth-model?page=15">http://ifers.boards.net/thread/36/flat-earth-model?page=15</a></p>

<p>Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis performed several experiments showing the effect of kinetic energy on rotating systems, which have ever since become mythologized as proof of the heliocentric theory. The “Coriolis Effect” is often said to cause sinks and toilet bowls in the Northern Hemisphere to drain spinning in one direction while in the Southern Hemisphere causing them to spin the opposite way, thus providing proof of the spinning ball-Earth. Once again, however, just like Foucault’s Pendulums spinning either which way, sinks and toilets in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres do not consistently spin in any one direction! Sinks and toilets in the very same household are often found to spin opposite directions, depending entirely upon the shape of the basin and the angle of the water’s entry, not the supposed rotation of the Earth.</p>

<p>“While the premise makes sense - that the earth’s eastward spin would cause the water in a toilet bowl to spin as well - in reality, the force and speed at which the water enters and leaves the receptacle is much too great to be influenced by something as miniscule as a single, 360-degree turn over the span of a day. When all is said and done, the Coriolis effect plays no larger role in toilet flushes than it does in the revolution of CDs in your stereo. The things that really determine the direction in which water leaves your toilet or sink are the shape of the bowl and the angle at which the liquid initially enters that bowl.” -Jennifer Horton, “Does the Rotation of the Earth Affect Toilets and Baseball Games?” Science.HowStuffWorks.com</p>

<p>The Coriolis Effect is also said to affect bullet trajectories and weather patterns as well, supposedly causing most storms in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate counter-clockwise, and most storms in the Southern Hemisphere to rotate clockwise, to cause bullets from long range guns to tend towards the right of the target in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Again, however, the same problems remain. Not every bullet and not every storm consistently displays the behavior and therefore cannot reasonably be used as proof of anything. What about the precision of the sight aperture, human error, and wind? What about Michelson-Morley-Gale’s proven motion of the aether’s potential effect? Why does the Coriolis Effect affect most storms but not all? If some storms rotate clockwise in the North and counter-clockwise in the South, how do those storms escape the Coriolis force? And if the entire Earth’s spin is uniform, why should the two hemispheres be affected any differently? Coriolis’s Effect and Foucault’s Pendulum are both said to prove the Earth moves beneath our feet, but in reality only prove how easy it can be for wolves in sheep’s clothing to pull the wool over our eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the lateness of my reply. The Coriolis effect on toilets and sinks is far too weak to be of any real significance in the rotation of the water going down the drain, as any imperfections, deviations or currents present in the water will exert a greater effect on the direction of flow, so I agree with this to a certain extent. If a perfect funnel is used as the sink or toilet bowl in the experiment, then you do see opposite flow in the different hemispheres. </p>

<p>Same applies to bullets, as there are a large number of variables involved which will effect the direction of any deviation.</p>

<p>However, all low pressure systems in the Southern hemisphere spin in a clockwise direction, while in the Northern hemisphere they spin counter-clockwise. This is an observable, incontrovertible fact which I feel renders the flat earth theory unviable. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is an appropriate conclusion.  The possibility exists for another explanation for this effect.  I don&#39;t think you can completely ignore all other evidence.   Consider it this way:  I feel there are many strong pieces of evidence that prove that the earth cannot be a ball and they are observable, incontrovertible facts which render the globular earth theory unviable!  And many of those proofs are much more fundamental to the property of flatness.  For example, showing that water does not curve over long distances.  This, to me, is much more direct than saying &quot;Storms spin mostly one way in this location and a spinning globe provides a plausible explanation for that&quot;.</p>

<p>I urge you to consider ALL of the evidence.  This seems too weak to be an ending point for investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Distortion of the maps of Africa and Australia -- not to mention the ridiculous distance between them -- on the Flat Earth map</p>

<p>those are all the proof anyone needs to conclusively debunk the Flat Earth theory</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it a dozen times</p>

<p>so why is this nonsense still being pushed in this sub ?</p>

<p>Go look at the Flat Earth Theory map !</p>

<p><strong>Look at Africa and Australia</strong> !</p>

<p>Look at the <strong>distortion</strong> required of Flat Earthers to even include them on the Flat Earth Theory map !</p>

<p>Look at the <strong>distance</strong> between Australia and Africa on the Flat Earth Theory map !</p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  Flat Earth theory demolished !</p>

<p>And Flat EArthers <strong>know</strong> it !</p>

<p>They <strong>admit</strong> it !</p>

<p>They <strong>admit</strong> they have <strong>NO</strong> way of reconciling the distortion and distance re: Africa and Australia with their flat earth theory !</p>

<p>It&#39;s what brought Flat Earth theory to a standstill over history</p>

<p>Now, for anyone entertaining the Flat Earth theory --- look at Australia and Africa and realise you&#39;ve been wasting your time and energy re: the Flat Earth theory</p>

<p>and go enjoy yourselves instead</p>

<p>Why do you think Africa and Australia cannot be that far apart?  Are there direct flights or cruises between Australia and Africa?</p>

<p>The problem for the globular model is that there is too much earth in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>“From near Cape Horn, Chile to Port Philip in Melbourne, Australia the distance is 9,000 miles. These two places are 143 degrees of longitude from each other. Therefore the whole extent of the Earth’s circumference is a mere arithmetical question. If 143 degrees make 9,000 miles, what will be the distance made by the whole 360 degrees into which the surface is divided? The answer is, 22,657 miles; or, 8357 miles more than the theory of rotundity would permit. It must be borne in mind, however, that the above distances are nautical measure, which, reduced to statute miles, gives the actual distance round the Southern region at a given latitude as 26,433 statute miles; or nearly 1,500 miles more than the largest circumference ever assigned to the Earth at the equator.” -Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, “Earth Not a Globe, 2nd Edition” (52)</p>

<p>Also, you should understand that &quot;The Flat Earthers&quot; are not a single group.  The &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot; founded by Leo Ferrari is disinformation (seriously, he is a clown, look up some of his stuff).  It exists to make the whole thing look silly.  When you make statements like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s it. Flat Earth theory demolished !
And Flat EArthers know it !
They admit it !
They admit they have NO way of reconciling the distortion and distance re: Africa and Australia with their flat earth theory !</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those statements are intended to make the whole thing look silly.  No one made any admissions of anything on my behalf.  </p>

<p>And yes, in response to your question, there are direct flights from Australia to South Africa and have been for years.  </p>

<p>If flying from the eastern coast of Australia (Melbourne) the flight time to Johannesburg will of course take longer, because Australia is a vast landmass and domestic flights from Melbourne to Perth (Western Australia) takes several hours.  I&#39;ve flown from Melbourne to Perth (and return) and can attest to the fact the trip is lengthy (approx. 3.5 hours these days, used to be longer)</p>

<p>Flights from Melbourne, Victoria, to Cairns in Queensland is sightly less in distance and takes almost three hours, for comparison</p>

<p>Were you under the impression there exist no direct flights between Australia (either east or west coast) and South Africa?  There are, of course and people fly those routes all the time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this information.</p>

<p>I have been considering this, and other distance measurement information and I have to say that I must reconsider my model.  The earth is most certainly provably flat, but I don&#39;t know that the land masses can be laid out and of the size in the current model.</p>

<p>The flatness of the earth over long distances of water is something that I can prove myself through experimentation in several ways.  Mapping out the world I can&#39;t do directly, so it is much more difficult.</p>
