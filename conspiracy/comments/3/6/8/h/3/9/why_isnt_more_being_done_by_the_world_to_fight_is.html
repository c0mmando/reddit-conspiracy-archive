       The threat of IS is constantly pushed in our face. If it is such a threat to our way of life, why isn't more being done by world leaders to combat it? All the West seems to be doing in the Middle East is pointless skirmishes, e.g. news headlines 'Top IS commander killed in Syria'. Are we just waiting for a 9/11 before our governments get their ass into gear or is there a reason why there isn't a full crackdown/retaliation to IS yet?

       They are the US's new boogieman, which happen to be funded by the CIA, MI6, and Mossad. Just another way to keep the world in terror, in order to justify a never ending war on terror. Gotta keep that MIC chugging along because it's the only thing propping up the US economy.

       I was about to post the same thing, but I would also include the House of Saud in that mix, since they have the same skin in the game and assist all three of these intelligence agencies. There isn't more being done to fight them, because they are working exactly as designed by the ruling world powers.

       Jordan, for example, provides the training grounds for Syrian rebels (many of whom have become ISIS), which is a US operation. They are flown out from Turkey in small groups os 20 or so. PBS Frontline did a great report on this. I'll try to find it.

       Correct. The US government is funding the Free Syrian Army which is spawning IS fighters and they are interchangeable in the ranks. Fight in Syria, fight in Iraq. Warmongering McCain, actually met with these fucks and openly spouts we need to fund them to topple Assad. Most of the FSA are not Syrian, but international mercenaries (IE. AQ and co). CIA textbook strategy at show here.

       And then the real question is....why? Well, I have an answer for that. The war in Syria is a battle over the US wanting a gas pipeline running  through it from Qatar to feed Europe, while Russia already feeds gas to Europe. That's why Russia is supporting Assad and the US is supporting the rebels. Follow the money, right?

        Russia actually just signed a deal recently to bypass EU pipeline and make EU export gas via Turkey

       I/we cannot give you hard proof because it's a CIA clandestine op. But, what we can give you is... The CIA funded the very organization and people which brought you Al-Qaeda via the Mujaheddin, in the Afghan/Soviet war. OSB was a Saudi (radical Wahhabi) not an afghan, and we funded and trained them to fight the soviets. These very same people went off to create havoc/terrorism in Chechnya, which was another clandestine op against the Russians. This has been going on for a long, long time.

       End goal? I honestly do not think they have one. Get while the getting is good. Lots of people are making a shit tonne of money off all this. Bomb a country, hire your contractors to rebuild while installing a puppet government which will sell their country out to corps seeking natural resources. There is also the drug trading, weapons trading, etc etc. Lot's of money in this.

       In my opinion, there is never 1 specific purpose. They do these things for many different purposes, one of which (I think), is the NWO coming to fruition via  WW3.

       . The author, Brzezinski, is on all kinds of foreign policy boards along with Kissinger and the likes. There is most definitely an end game, but I sincerely doubt they will get there. The BRIC alliance is determined to stop them. (Brazil, Russia, India, China).

       However, that is if the BRICS aren't apart of the scheme. It just seems too good to be true. I hope a new paradigm shifts, but, I'm worried that this is just the game going as planned...sigh... Not too mention, this would be like a shotgun wound to the US... Crazy when you think about it.

       ISIS is the new Al Qaeda now that Bin Laden is dead....the new boogie man to fight. Haven't you noticed how many times Al-Baghdadi, the supposed head of ISIS, has apparently died? I think we are now working on 9 scenarios and he keeps rising from the dead.

       You've got half of it right, but you are missing a few others. This isn't just a US/Isreal plot. To say so lets the other guilty parties off the hook.

       I agree.  I was just bringing to light the two biggest culprits.  But yes, you are correct.  There are definitely others in cahoots.

       I'm sure you think Israel is the 2nd or 1st bigger culprit, but wow, their GDP accounts for nearly nothing enough to pull their shenanigans off without support. They would be crippled in a second without the US's support. They are no match for the UK, for example, who is a far bigger culprit.

       Israel isn't the strongest, but it may be P4P the worst, as it has
       <em>
        control
       </em>
       of the biggest bully on the block:  The U.S.

       I wouldn't doubt that the UK is more evil in terms of the
       <em>
        depth
       </em>
       of its nefariousness...but the U.S. is by far the most
       <em>
        overt
       </em>
       in its aggression at this point...and Israel, well...again, they have control of the U.S. pretty much.

       Yeah.  "Who's the subject of

       ?" is the question.  Not sure the U.S. isn't the subject of Israel at this point.  :/
