<p>His goodbye post to undelete,</p>

<p>My participation here is an artifact of an earlier better time that has long since run its course. We&#39;ve still been able to pretend like reddit was here and it was still the best way to spend time online, but I grow tired of this delusion.</p>

<p>When reddit was first started there were no subreddits. As subreddits were added (first by the admins and then later by the community), the original &quot;front page&quot; remained as <a href="/r/reddit.com">/r/reddit.com</a>.
The defaults didn&#39;t exist for the first 2 years. There was only <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and <a href="/u/jedberg">/u/jedberg</a> saw that it was good. Politics, technology and police abuse ruled the day. (Don&#39;t taze me bro!)</p>

<p>Then reddit decided that democracy wasn&#39;t good enough.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/8h8sy/subscribe_new_users_to_rall_18_reddits_instead_of/c09c9gy">http://np.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/8h8sy/subscribe_new_users_to_rall_18_reddits_instead_of/c09c9gy</a></p>

<p>And things went considerably downhill from there. I had no idea of this change at the time, and I blissfully ignored usernames for the first few years of my reddit experience.</p>

<p>The content of his last comment;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We&#39;re not just saying goodbye to an old friend, we&#39;re saying goodbye to thousands.</p>

<p>Reddit is not a platform to express my ideas or participate in the conversation. So I won&#39;t.</p>

<p>I hope other reasonable people will come to the same conclusion.
It&#39;s the only way we have to show reddit that they are systematically harassing the community by their own definition.</p>

<p>Drama abound in the comments as <a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a> calls out various reddit admins, board members, mods, and users by name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, shut up. People choose to do their own thing. I&#39;ve seen countless people on SW posting for their own narcissm and not truly wanting to die. This is the internet. As much as we want to make this a safe place, there will always be those who poke the bear. I&#39;m one of the firsts to say, this man wasn&#39;t suicidal, but was a metaphor. It speaks numbers, because it gives people an outlet to talk. 90% of them on SW do not blow their brains out, they just want to talk to someone/anyone. It&#39;s a last resort. This was metaphorical. Was it in bad taste? Yea, some say it would be. I commend <a href="/u/go1dfish">/u/go1dfish</a>, at least he is making a statement and being honest.</p>

<p>What point is it that you think you&#39;re trying to make?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the internet.</p>

<p>This literally doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People choose to do their own thing. I&#39;ve seen countless people on SW posting for their own narcissm and not truly wanting to die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People choose to do lots of things, some good, bad, and neutral.  This means nothing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as we want to make this a safe place, there will always be those who poke the bear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this doesn&#39;t mean anything.  I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re bringing up the idea of &quot;safe places&quot;, I certainly didn&#39;t.  You just have to use areas for what they&#39;re for.  He specifically advocates this.  While this might be a grey area in r/technology, it really isn&#39;t in r/suicidewatch.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You cannot conflate a cry for help with utilization of an apparent cry for help as a &quot;metaphor&quot;.  People were talking about reddit censorship before his sensationalized, personalized outburst.  Whatever merit it has is completely undercut by such falsity.  It would be like tossing an effigy of yourself into a fire in front of gathered news crews under the pretense that you had been planning to throw your actual self into the fire, only to reveal a day later that you had never intended to harm yourself at all.  It is crying wolf.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you think you&#39;re writing.  It&#39;s not in &quot;bad taste&quot; to pretend to be suicidal, it&#39;s outrageous and wrong.  Thus, that post was the absolute opposite of honesty.  Your words are completely out of place.</p>
