       I think it is a good idea, but if you're going to release this then you should also release the list of who votes for what. For instance, when you were reinstated it required a majority vote. In the spirit of FULL transparency those votes would've been made public, and I think the community would benefit from these kinds of disclosures.

       The mod mail would not be public, just mod actions.  I understand your desire to know more, which is why I'm pushing for public logs.  I think this would be a step forward for transparency in /conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you explain how you feel like knowing how specific mods voted would benefit the community?  Voting in any form, for a lot of people, is a very private thing.  I'm not sure you would agree with disclosing how you vote on a daily basis.  It is an option in your preferences to make all your votes public and you don't have that option turned on yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am sincerely curious how publishing who voted for what would benefit the community in your opinion.  We know it was 8 in favor and 2 against.  That's a pretty overwhelming majority.

       Well, in your case we had many members of the community up in arms. It really did cause a rift and I noticed a lot of people began to lose trust in their mods. The mods neglected to even tell us how many of them were even present for the vote. In fact, I believe that I even had a mod tell me that the vote was between 6 people with 4 voting for reinstatement and 2 voting against. An official release would help to avoid these kinds of discrepancies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your other question, I would not enjoy disclosing who I vote for when putting someone in office, but as a mod of a community your vote and influence carry a different weight entirely. Think of it like any other elected position; these officials are always documented when they vote, because they represent a group, not just themselves. Sure you don't have the same powers as a senator or congressman, but in the end it comes down to the fact that mods have the ability to manipulate this sub, and FULL transparency (IE releasing mod mail, or just the lists of who places what votes.) would help to mitigate any possible future damage. Think of what happened with Bipolar Bear, we might have been able to catch him sooner if the community had been able to scrutinize his actions a but more thoroughly!

       I actually love your analogy about how elected officials votes are documented and public.

       I agree with you now, but that being said I didn't get a vote on my reinstatement so I'm not going to release that info myself.  But your point is solid.

       Thank you kindly, Flytape. It's an opinion that I've held for quite some time now, and I've always been curious as to why I haven't seen it whenever these kinds of conversations come up. Hopefully the other mods agree with this sentiment! I can't see any reason to be against it other than the point about privacy that you made before. (Though as you know, I believe that one must be prepared for the consequences of taking a mod position in a sub that has so many users. Meaning that they should expect to have their votes questioned and scrutinized. Especially when it comes to topics that the community is invested in.)

       Edit: Thanks again for forwarded my inquiry to the rest of the mods!

       I'm pretty hated by the reddit hivemind, and targeted by the reddit trolls. Any mod linked with voting in favor of me would be putting themselves at considerable risk of being the target of the next witch hunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm okay (though not excited) with being the lightning rod around here.  I think most people would quit after being targeted by so many lies and so much organized fuckery.  That wouldn't be good for conspiracy IMHO.

       I still do not believe that we should allow the fear of being associated with you impede genuine transparency. In fact, I would wager that if votes had been disclosed from the beginning then you would not have ended up in this situation at all. The reason that these people got so upset was because of how shifty the whole scenario had been portrayed. It's very simple for the mods to say that they've taken care of the problem, but from an outside perspective it just seems so "robotic" for lack of a better term. We can't tell just how you solved the problem, or who the heavy hitters were when brainstorming up some solutions.

       If you want to beat me up over modmail, which honestly doesn't matter because if it was public then the private conversations that would be sooooo juicy for SRD would simply take place somewhere else.

       Whats important is that all mod actions here would be published to the general public.

      <p>
       But when someone sends a modmail to us they aren't knowingly publishing that information for the whole world to see. I think it would be irresponsible to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry that we disagree on this point but you're welcome to keep talking about it with others.

       I fear that public mod logs will only increase the frequency of having to explain mod actions.  Modmail probably wouldn't remedy that either,  but what i'm trying to do now is take a step in the direction of transparency.

       There is a lot of fuckery and brigading that happens here, I don't think it would make anything better for this community to have every single mod conversation on display to the whole community, even if i felt differently about it, I don't this this tool created by
       <a href="/u/go1dfish">
        /u/go1dfish
       </a>
       is capable of documenting modmails.  The main reason this can work with modlogs is because this tool makes it possible with zero effort from the actual mods.  It just happens automatically.

       Thanks, that helps a bit, but there's not much to see there (yet?).
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically, I'm wondering if it's only the moderator's actions that are visible, or whether, say, the user who reported a post would be visible for everyone to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm generally in favor of transparency, I do think that there should be the possibility of anonymity for users to be able to report questionable things without it becoming public that they did so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full disclosure, I do report things from time to time (which you're probably aware of since you're a moderator), and I don't generally care whether what I report becomes public or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, due to the issue that recently took place here regarding the post the admins wanted removed, I do think it's a good idea for people to be able to report things anonymously if they so desire. Yes, I'm aware that a user came forward and stated that he'd reported it. But I think that, key to that situation, the user was able to voluntary state his responsibility
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       describe his motivation for doing so at the same time. Rather than having his name in big neon letters on a controversial removed post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe this is how this all would work anyway though and I'm writing this all out for no reason though.
      </p>

       EDIT - There's also an invisible comment on this thread. Says there's 5 comments, only 4 are visible. Don't know why, but seems like that's been happening a lot lately.

       There is a gang of moderators behind the scenes who have conflicts of interest — too many alliances, personal vendettas, and agendas within the mod team has sent this subreddit spiraling down.
      </p>
      <p>
       This modlog idea is just a kid's bandaid over an amputated limb — especially when it's coming from a very controversial user like yourself.

       Honestly there's a lot that needs to be made up for, mainly for that Podcast. You're a meme on reddit now Flytape since you basically parade around this place like it's yours. Plus, the secret reinstatement of your powers made the situation even worse.

       I think this is a stupid and unnecessary idea, especially coming from this turd in the punch bowl.  At a time when conspiracy is under the threat of being banned , this masked vaper wants to create pseudo conflict with the mods?  If he really wants full disclosure then tell us the vote count that got you back where you may not belong.  I'm willing to bet there were a few abstain votes in there. amirite?

       Well, in your case we had many members of the community up in arms. It really did cause a rift and I noticed a lot of people began to lose trust in their mods. The mods neglected to even tell us how many of them were even present for the vote. In fact, I believe that I even had a mod tell me that the vote was between 6 people with 4 voting for reinstatement and 2 voting against. An official release would help to avoid these kinds of discrepancies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your other question, I would not enjoy disclosing who I vote for when putting someone in office, but as a mod of a community your vote and influence carry a different weight entirely. Think of it like any other elected position; these officials are always documented when they vote, because they represent a group, not just themselves. Sure you don't have the same powers as a senator or congressman, but in the end it comes down to the fact that mods have the ability to manipulate this sub, and FULL transparency (IE releasing mod mail, or just the lists of who places what votes.) would help to mitigate any possible future damage. Think of what happened with Bipolar Bear, we might have been able to catch him sooner if the community had been able to scrutinize his actions a but more thoroughly!
