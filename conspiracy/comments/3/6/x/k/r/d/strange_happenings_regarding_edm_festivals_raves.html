       "Theosophy is the Kabbalistic belief system of Freemasonry and the Illuminati and encompasses parts of all the world's religions including Satanism. It might appear to be the perfect solution for the world and will be presented as 'Oneness' but it is in fact just a New World Order that is being surreptitiously instilled into the minds of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you think EDM was just music? Think again. It's a mind control tool used alongside drugs to condition you into the correct mindset."
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Edit 7-3-15
       </em>
       It hit me today. Modern festivals and raves are TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. Or at least too good to exist without conditions. I used to reflect on how beautiful it was that thousands of people were all moving to the same beat, we could do drugs with a reasonable expectation of safety, and all under the umbrella of PLUR. 
BUT COME ON. THIS IS AMERICA. Something that beautiful can't exist without a catch. Just thought I'd share this idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a running theory that some type of evil powers (cia/freemasons/bohemians/etc.) have infiltrated and taken over the mainstream EDM scene (as evidenced by the consolidation of almost all major festivals under SFX entertainment) - see my post here
       <a href="http://redd.it/36xkrd">
        http://redd.it/36xkrd
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, at the beginning of this video from Steve Aoki at Tomorrowland 2015 he says "Do you trust me?" then has the crowd sing along as Heart of the Ocean (the Titanic song) plays. It's truly beautiful hearing the entire crowd sing (also remember that at least 50% of the crowd is on some type of drug or is inebriated).
      </p>
      <p>
       The video features a King of some sort on a throne with symbolism on his throne (could use help decoding these).
      </p>
      <p>
       The drop of the song has nothing to do with the original that it is a remix of and seems to be nothing but what I call, "hard rave music". I wonder if there are frequencies, infrasound, image on the led screen that are used to "brainwash" the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interest in this stems from the fact that the CIA seemed to play an integral role in the evolution of the counterculture movement and the propagation of LSD into America (check out Project MKULTRA if you're unfamiliar).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, watch the video, research mind control, psychedlics and everything you think relates to this subject and decide for yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
       Are TPTB/Freemasons/occult/nwo/illuminati using EDM festivals as a propaganda and brainwashing tool?

       INSOMNIAC EVENTS are drug King pins that buy/ produce a ton of drugs, and distribute them to local promoters to sell at their events, and profit.--- Can anyone dispute this??? Also, it is my belief that large drug producing operations don't exist without the help of the CIA/DEA/Intelligence Community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out the Bohemian Grove and EDC similarities

       Also, Woman goes missing from MASONIC temple after Movement after party...shows up at a hospital over a day later--sketchy "How a 20-year-old Saginaw woman disappeared from a Movement afterparty in Detroit then appeared a day and a half later, drugged and disoriented, at a Royal Oak hospital remains a mystery."

       About me. 26 years old. Non religious.
      </p>
      <p>
       After my last 2 events, I can't shake the feeling that there is something fishy/not right about some events. Our own government has admitted to mind control attempts via MK Ultra. What makes you think they have stopped?
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerns:
--SFX Entertainment has consolidated several major event productions (Disco Donnie Presents, Tomorrowland and Tomorrowworld, Q-dance, Mysteryland, Spring Awakening, Electric Zoo, Life In Color ...
       <a href="http://sfxii.com/sfx-entertainment-companies/idt/">
        http://sfxii.com/sfx-entertainment-companies/idt/
       </a>
       )
--Occult/illuminati/freemason symbolism at MAJOR EDM events (I mean tomorrowworld has a section called "Crowley Land" (named for occultist Aliester Crowley)
--Possible drug/chemical field testing at events (have you ever had someone drop a heavy drug on you then just disappear)
--Have you ever felt like you were being observed at EDM events? Like by a government/research/watcher type person
--EDM events provide the perfect platform for psyops, mind control testing. Acoustic warfare testing. Infrasound, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were in power and wanted to influence 10,000s of people...wouldn't a place where 10,000s of people who are on drugs and highly suggestible be a perfect platform for you to alter perception or behavior?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think these mega-raves and festivals are all fun and games. The sounds and images projected during these events provide a huge opportunity for influence on a mass-scale...and those in power surely see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that this means that there is a global dance music conspiracy, but there are some troubling facts about these events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to hear your personal stories, thoughts and experiences regarding possible mal-intent in the rave/festival scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Help me think through this. Maybe there is something I'm missing. I love raving. I have for over a decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you write off the idea of mass manipulation, consider this:
      </p>
      <p>
       From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Project MKOFTEN was a covert Department of Defense program developed in conjunction with the CIA. A partner program to MKSEARCH, the goal of MKOFTEN was to "test the behavioral and toxicological effects of certain drugs on animals and humans".[1]
      </p>
      <p>
       According to author Gordon Thomas' 2007 book, Secrets and Lies, the CIA's Operation Often was also initiated by the chief of the CIA's Technical Services Branch, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, to "explore the world of black magic" and "harness the forces of darkness and challenge the concept that the inner reaches of the mind are beyond reach". As part of Operation Often, Dr. Gottlieb and other CIA employees visited with and recruited fortune-tellers, palm-readers, clairvoyants, astrologists, mediums, psychics, specialists in demonology, witches and warlocks, Satanists, other occult practitioners, and more
      </p>
      <p>
       “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.”
      </p>

All the designer drugs 25I 2CI 2CB etc.. all these are government mind test drugs. They dont give true hallucinogenic experiences they are like hallucinogenic aderall. I could tell yah more...

       Wow. Really interesting. I am really interested in what else you have to say. I've never heard of gamma and atom.  Please tell more, share any links . Any other dj's you've seen this with? Or anything else strange?
      </p>
      <p>
       I love rl grime's music. But, when I saw him live a month ago, it was so strange to me how he used so much military imagery in his show...I know it's a part of his album stuff...but damn..was just really weird...maybe just art, maybe pushing an agenda..there were a lot of strange people at the show., seemed like observers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, let's get this discussion going! Damn it, I want to go to raves again without conspiranoia on my mind Lol!

       Wellll I got into the scene because i was producing and selling Thizz. We were hitting clubs and bon fires and house parties then i saw a rave on facebook and pondered "i wonder how thzz will sell at a rave" isnt that funny... Wellll i went to my first event with 150 left with 30 crushed in a bottle of morgan 30$ and hippy flipped the fk out. Passed one to every single person there... Met some hells angel DJ threw a rent party at my place for him..connections.. Every rave i went to passed thizz out free till i would come with a bag crushed ehhhh like 9 or 10grams and a straw...here take a toot... Gained many many more connections...Would trade pills for every "thing" there so i could experiment with different supplies to make mine better...Quick note- Every source of molly, i went to, every source I tried, after awhile no one had pure anymore you rock it back up with cryss and people dont realize they're on it, if you ever have this feeling something bad is going to happen at a rave its probably bevause you've ingested some.
I lay that info down so you recognize i was in a position to take note of something. Every event host and DJ in sac I knew The hosts of EPR in SF I knew. There are those who communicate amongst each other like a small community and there are those in it with a 10ft pole and a card board cut out of themselves on the end. There are those whose events the lighting is consistently Masonic. There are those that are using heavy subliminals that are recognized by anyone on acid or boomers. 
There are a few more people that i know of with masonic connections in it... My grandfather was keeper of the bohemian grove for 8yrs and that also gave me a foot in.
I am aware if a DJ being part of a secret society. Some "order of" and had the word lotus in the name...
I have had weird older men that dont belong approach me I use the "fucked up fake" to get a notion of ehats going on without letting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally if you wanna drop the fear Graduate. Go too a festival you'll realize its like going from highschool to college.
Look for my other replies to learn more...

       I never post in r/conspiracy. I think a part of me is scared of being put on some list for asking too many questions. But since you're a DJ, I just have to ask you a question, about the 440hz vs 432hz conspiracy. I read about it a while ago and this made me think of it. I don't really understand it but I imagine you are more knowledgable about sound/music. What do you think?

       <p>
        Possible drug/chemical field testing at events
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think op points out an interesting possibility here. That the MKUltra program existed is a fact. It's reasonable to assume that it never completely stopped or has continued in other forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testing experimental psychotropics is too hard to do (and get away with it) in an institutional setting. Too many people, too many witnesses, too much documentation, everything taking place at one location etc. So, what to do? Distribute the tests over a variety of locations and times. Disguise your meds as "recreational psychedelics". That way, even if when they get confiscated or cause  harm, nobody will see them for what they really are. Some anonymous drug dealer/lab can take the blame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting observation. Many of these drugs are available over the internet from online "research labs". What's more, they're "sort of" legal because of the way the current drug laws are set up. So dealing a bit of harmless weed can land you in jail. But if you're selling experimental (and potentially harmful) psychotropics over the internet the law can't touch you.
      </p>
      <p>
       That the legal situation should be this way makes no sense at all until you consider things from the "covert field-test" angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these lab synthesized drugs are eventually made illegal. But that might be because they've been sufficiently tested and the people running the program want to move on to testing the newer versions of their drugs.

       Bright lights, rhythmic noises, people voluntarily taking what could  be considered experimental drugs?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this isn't some kind of experiment, the pharmaceutical companies should look into it. They'd find a plentiful supply of willing test subjects.

       Don't thank me. If it wasn't for the other guy's comment, I would have never thought of raves that way. But when he mentioned it, I was reminded of stuff I've seen and read about MKultra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it's not a deliberate program, it wouldn't surprise me if ravers weren't unintentionally replicating certain conditions of the program. Stuff like dissociative effects, temporary memory loss, weakening of self-identity/ego etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, the more I think about it, the more I'd be interested in seeing a comparison.

       Also, what you were talking about regarding "covert field-testing" reminded me of all the times during some shows where ALL the lights are on--no flashing, strobes or lasers...just a completely lit-up and drug induced crowd---and the cameras, everywhere---a lot of them are harmless (i.e. people capturing film of the stage, etc) but some of them seem to be trying to get images of all the crowd when they're all fucked up and lit up with light. I know they want promo shots and what not, but sometimes it just seems like there is nowhere you can look without a camera pointing at you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are trying to research, then they would need the images of the crowd (full light, no lasers or strobes etc).

       i agree, i saw richie hawtin do this in the late 90's early 00's.. he had 4 turn tables, and samplers, literally sampling and creating music on the fly.. that's DJing.. I recently saw sphongle and some knob turner opened for him and he did nothing.. but the crowd was hyped as fuck everytime the bass dropped.. reminded me of that SNL skit.. he literally danced around and pumped his fst and every once in awhile twisted a knob.  Weird shit..  Most of these "DJ's" play dub step too..

       Dumstep is easily sybliminalized. Ehh popular track selection is why they go crazy for guys like that. Lmao my passion to DJ came after an event and firt time trying MXE (ketamine with a molucule of pcp attached to it.) came home and realized how much sound manipulation you can do with a base treble and volume knob on a computer speaker went for hrs till there was no more music to knob. Shit some of my tracks were picked just for 30secs of sound. The only mix i have on souncloud is barely 30 mins and theres over 40 tracks!! Some songs ill pre mix so theyre already mixed to then mix a whole diff track live with the pre mixed tracks some tracks ill pre manipulate and then add manipulation. Though those techniques are aimed at time when you would require more hands than you have... I also never joined the crowd unless i wanted to dance sometimes being the only one non stop.. beside the gay guys thatll "shake" for hrs even the fat ones -_-  When carl cox was on stage i was behind his right shoulder watching 3 feet away. Darth Vader or Darth Invader not sure but he wears a darth vader helmet and DJs he uuuber popular and i was on stage behind him watching and the diff was he seemed to know his traacks by heart. Carl was more on the fly didn't seem like a "set" more like an unrehearsed performance like skilllll and he fleeeewwww through tracks it was straight sound manipulated melodics that litteraly felt like a freestyle rap.

       that's what djing always was.. that shit was never rehearsed.. it was a dude behind two turn tables with a huge fucking stack of records.. pulling one out and flexing the shit out of it.  Not this nonsense EDM stuff they call "DJing", today.

       Exactly!! I was privileged to be able to attend an all oooold school DJ party hosted by Dina Dragonfly shes opened for deadmou5. The whole thing was alllllll DJing and old school MCs it was intense the house was one room the outside garage another. I stayed the night was pretty groovin and cleaned the whole house for her got to use her old mixin tables and her tracks but the gift of magic mushy had me murdering the tracks the bad way because i was stuck and being drawn into the swirls of the wood grain on the hardwood floors.. then Mamosas....ahhh.

       No, I agree with everything you've said... I went to Life in Color (Miami) last year and I remember being sprayed by the paint... Only that shit really, really burned my skin and everyone else said so too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember day 2 (avoiding the paint) I was on some really strong acid but I'll never forget seeing how weird it was that everyone was sucked into the stage and all standing in line... I remember moving  in between everyone and basically trying to break their trance with my dance moves (lol). I've seen "craft" over the top of the festivals during the later hours (when everyone is fully engulfed).
      </p>
      <p>
       I came back from an ayahuasca retreat last year and was shown a lot of things about how multidimensional entities manipulate us and "feed" off of our emotions/vibes (although, not all negative)... Which raises the question, what if these festivals are basically an occult practice of energy harvesting? Have you ever seen the amount of "vibrations" coming off of everyone? It'd be a feast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Precisely what one of the posters above said, there is definitely a battle of consciousness going on within the festivals... You can see it, but it's very subtle. I almost felt as though I was helping fight against it, as I feel as though that's why I'm here, on Earth. Spiritual warfare is my forte.

       Omg man, so perfect. Exactly what I feel. I've seen the 'craft'. I know what you are saying. Spiritual warfare. And yes, those are the battlegrounds. Even tho there seems to be no battle taking place, it is. We fight for the same team bro, I can tell. Sometimes I don't feel like going to a show, but I end up there anyways, and later realize I NEEDED to be there to put up a battle for our side. This is crazy shit man, I fucking love the internet. I was thinking more and more that I was crazy.

       That's the beauty of a message board bro. It stays forever and you can respond whenever you want. Just strolling through r/conspiracy and this one caught my attention. The far fetched connections op made were absolutely ridiculous. Then after reading your response it made me laugh. It amazes me that it really only takes one stranger on the internet to reinforce an idiotic theory like this. Unfortunately one of the side effects of psychedelics is that while giving you a better sense of self you also run the risk of developing a messiah complex. Don't get me wrong I appreciate everything psychedelics have taught me. They made me who I am today but the whole "I'm meant to do something great, we are part of something bigger" feeling is very self centered. You are just as important as every other person on the planet. Drama will always creep it's way back into your life, life is mostly mundane and that's okay. Eventually you will just have to live with the mystery. It's not depressing at all its actually great. Just trying to give you a heads up bro.

       Well, I distinctly remember seeing multiple lights hovering over the festival and moving in such an irregular way. Nothing like a "traditional" plane/helicopter. Pretty low down and right over the festival grounds, which I found to be strange for a flight path (fireworks, bright lights, strobe, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       ...Who knows, I mean (and I don't mean to reference it again) ever since the Aya, my experiences with ET's, dimensions, energy, etc. have all been deepened and furthered. Part of me thinks that these festivals are a mixture of energy harvesting/psychic warfare playgrounds/as well as possible test sights. It may sound crazy, but that's exactly it... Reality isn't anywhere near as "real" as we perceive it to be.

       "Reality" has been constrained to mean what we can perceive with out 5 senses...when truly, there are so many forces (electromagnetic, microwave, infrared, etc) all around us that we can never perceive with our 5 senses...so I do think there may be an inter-dimensional soup that we simply cannot perceive.

       those are drones for the purpose of taking the awesome action shot videos you see on concert recaps. I'm not disagreeing with this thread in any way, just clarifying, those are purposely flown rc helicopters with cameras, not meant to be hidden.

       That's okay, just take what you find most useful from what I've mentioned... I won't try to convince you they're real, but from my own experiences... They are out there. The rabbit hole is very,

       As a festival goer myself I would say no to your theory. If anything the government is allowing these festivals to take place in order to distract the youth from what they are doing. Can't really get involved in what is going on if you are more concerned about when this lineup or that line up is coming out, saving money, and traveling to multiple festivals a summer.

       Agreed, and I think that makes perfect sense! However, don't you think that if you allow the festival to take place and then place some influence into the show/projections/visuals then it's even more powerful?

       They could. I just don't think that it's there main concern. It's more of a distract the youth because if they aren't distracted they could be very dangerous.

       There are more videos like this which expose how literally Satanic and Demonic some festivals are.

       One concert literally has a giant visage on stage saying things such as "The next Demon performer".

       I have been personally been witnessing this for the past few years. In Canada, use of the Illuminati pyramid/all-seeing eye at raves has been growing heavily. Yes, pop culture and media have been deliberately spreading these symbols around more, but it really makes you wonder. There are some great people running many of the events but there are also definitely the shady characters as well, and the people you know are probably involved in the community simply because of the presence of half-naked drugged-out teenage girls. It's a lot less "warm and wholesome" feeling than it was in the early 2000's.

       Thanks for the reply! Honestly , I thought I might get two replies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Def agree with you about the same symbols (black and white checker pattern, all see eye, eye of Horus, pentagram and baphomet), etc) being pushed through various media and genres of music.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, regarding great people running the shows...I agree that 95% of the ppl in event production are great people, but because so many of the big events are under the SFX corporation , that means that sfx ultimately controls them. This is similar to media consolidation causing the major news outlets to be nothing more than propaganda portals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if I believe in magick , ritual, occult and energy ideas...but it is strange that the shadow government leaders at the bohemian grove worship a giant owl...and edc has a huge owl on the stage.

       There are people out there that do, and they have experiences that support these beliefs. Some of them work in service to others, and some of them work in service to themselves. There are reasons and intentions in the use of all that symbolism.

       I invested in SFXE awhile ago assuming they would do really well in the booming EDM scene. But they haven't. 
I did a lot of research on the company before investing and one of the biggest downfalls to SFXE is the founder, CEO Robert 'F. X.' Sillerman. He's very outspoken, arrogant, unpredictable and loves the limelight, but he's not much of a CEO. I'll revisit my research on him, but besides starting some advertising companies and owning some tv and radio stations, I don't remember him having a military background or any ties with government or anything like that. Maybe looking at his family history/relations could give some more insight. That and his motives behind jumping into the EDM scene in the first place.

       His background owning radio and tv stations industry definitely influences how he runs sfxe. It seems all they do is continue to acquire local and regional companies. 
Right now, interestingly, he's working towards buying back the company, making it private again. This is already pissing off some investors considering the stock went public a few years ago nearly 300% higher than it is now. Really shows his mentality for doing business. A very 'sheisty' businessman.
Summary - the EDM industry is partially run by dickheads

       College Humor is illuminati indoctrination garbage filth trash.
      </p>
      <p>
       That whole video reeked of Satanism, self glorification, self entitlement, and language reinforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also takes advantage of coincidental circumstances which is one of the lowest forms of humor. Of course there are always going to be times at giant fests where two of your favorite artists/groups are playing at the same time, because tons of people like tons of music.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can bring outside food and water to many events. Water backpacks are mostly allowed as they would rather not have people die from dehydration, which was a problem back in the early dance music scene due to the drugs part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The portable toilet problem is brought on from the people themselves. If people didn't ridiculously blow up the toilet, then it wouldn't be so disgusting. But so many people eat so unhealthy that when they make it just smells awful.
      </p>
      <p>
       This video is basically just another rehashing of "events, festivals, and arenas rip you off because you're their "hostage" so you are forced to pay their price if you want that pretzel or whatever".

       I agree that College Humor is pretty garbage but I don't see how that video specifically has "Satanism, self glorification, self entitlement, and language reinforcement."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good parody of a lot of huge music festivals and of course not all are like this, many are so it raises a good point. I think you are taking the video too seriously. CH sucks and even Cracked is turning to a crap website but they do have quite a bit of good content, one shouldn't be so antsy all the time

       This could get lengthy, as words usually fall short in describing this 'vibe' you talk of, but I'll give it a go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna have to say that I agree that there are these types of things happening. I've been to EDC for 4 years in a row now (for reference). I'm a responsible psychedelic enjoyer. I have 'tapped in' to these types of vibes while at this large rave. We're talking 100,000 ppl per night. While I have had a great time every year, there always seems to be a 'dark' spot each time as well. It usually starts with me noticing that the cell service is fucked while at the show. At first I just think network overload, then I start to wonder what somebody could do with the power of 100,000 networked phones (and ppl really). At this point I always get the feeling I'm being monitored. I wonder who is in the large booths where nobody is allowed. I start to wonder who chose the DJ's for the show (the list is strikingly similar every year). Then I realize that I'm being blasted with thousands of watts of very particular sound waves. I recall seeing the studies of sound affecting physical properties, or water. I'm made of mostly water... So yes, it seems more than probable that on some sort of molecular level, those sounds are changing you. Maybe just for the length of a set, but who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that every DJ at EDC is in on this 'main-stream-programming' though. I've noticed every year that there seems to be 'rebel' DJ's that have incredible sets (never on the Main Stage), yet it seems obvious that they're saying 'fuck you' to the powers behind these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that most of the weird shit goes on at the Main stage, where they have the 'biggest' DJ's. Some of these DJ's are horribly dreadful, technically speaking. Some times I have seen a DJ play a set while another guy sits behind (and off stage, barely visible) at some sort of 'safety station' with his own decks. This made me realize that some of these DJ's didn't get to that point on know how or hard work, they had been inserted. Bought. Prepped. It was not hard to tell that some of the DJ's were just pawns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm leaving a lot out, but ya, even if it's not every DJ at every show with a hidden agenda, there are some out there, infiltrating these areas of culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR   I agree, there's some weird shit going on

       Ya, Moir53 nailed it with the spiritual warfare. There is some sort of large, cosmic event happening at these types of things. Its hard to say what exactly, but it does feel like a large observation and/or harvest of some type. Like those kids you see stumbling around with no life in their eyes, just white. Those kids are giving something to what I would imagine are 'dark' somethings. I dunno, ET, entities, gods, whatever. Then there's the rest of us that actually can see wtf is going on, and are generally there as a good thing to the rest of the group. Even if we're tripping balls, we are helping others get water, ya know? There's gotta be some type of 'good' something there to harvest that vibe too. I gotta tell ya, this thread has had an impact on me. I always question the things I see/feel at these shows, even years gone past. Was it just the drugs? Did I really stumble upon being able to witness a battle of good and evil? Makes me feel wwaayyy better to know I'm not alone.

       EDC is deff blatantly subliminalized and the refference to the sound vibrations on the effect of water is on point in regards to the music. Im not sure if you are aware but at particular events there are specialized speakers, only 5 sets of these speakers exist in the world. I sat in front of a set at base mountain blowing an oz to the face on a 3ft bong. after getting up i waled the bout 30ft and had to collapse in a ball because it felt my inside were pouring out...

       Wow, I've never seen this before. If this is authentic that is absolutely insane. Considering Bush used subliminal messages in his campaign commercials I wouldn't be surprised but this is even crazier! "Consume, obey, consume. Government is watching you." That is madness.

       Think about The Game (as in pick-up-artists) and what kind of things that teaches. Is it too far out of the box to consider that those kinds of things are being used on you by your favorite talking heads? You
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be programmed. The only way to stop it is to become aware of it, and teach others how to become aware of it.

       My experience was that my gf and I were looking around the camping area and some random guy asked if we were lookin for Molly or yay...well ac was about to take the stage, so we said yeah...he had orange teslas...shit sent me to a place I've never been before, in a bad way...I don't trust those things..some crazy research chem or bath salts of meth...plus the pill reports on them all seem like promotional and advertising, acting like they're just super strong MDMA
      </p>
      <p>
       Point of my story is that they can find the people that aren't on anything else and are looking ...thus get them to take it without anything else...

       What are your feelings about being a participant in these sorts of festivals but being responsible enough to have your own tested verified supply of what ever you choose to take? I agree with the sentiment that there is more going on at many of these festivals than at first is apparent. Certainly there is tons of imagery and symbolism used but to portray every attendee as a mindless souless drone incapable of realizing the advertisement whirlwind (that our very capitalist society def. takes advantage of) they find themselves in is an incorrect way of thinking. whether something more sinister is going on i couldn't say, i think humans have tried to exert influence over others for ages, its nothing new, many times i've found myself in awe of the effectiveness of some of these things at bringing about some emotion or feeling of need to buy this beer lol. I personally  emphasizing the good things about so many people coming together to enjoy themselves to music they love, there are a lot of vibrant people to be found and weird experiences to be had if you take them all with a grain of salt. as far as the drug experimentation goes even if it were going on i opt out by only ingesting substances that i've attained and tested.

       You make a great point regarding having your own supply...unfortunately though there are sooo many out there who don't and they don't test it...like I did. I did it so many times before and was fine, but those orange teslas were something else

       I was at a rave, rolling, and saw some weird things on the screens thinking, "Am I in the modern MK Ultra?" In all honesty, it is perfectly possible, and a prime place for conducting studies. As much as I love the scene, I feel like there is definitely some darkness. It's a room full of drugged people being flashed incredibly fast displays with emotionally powerful music!

       Started raving back in 98 when I was in Seattle. Naff studios anyone? We had a group called dance safe out there testing drugs. Awesome group cause they didn't pass judgement just let you know if your shig was legit.

       Lots of fake xtc back then running around. I will say the cops as well as ncis were always there watching mofos like a hawk. Far as the subliminal thing haven't been to anything since 2002. Don't think it was around back then.

       Read the book
       <em>
        Acid Dreams
       </em>
       . It highlights the fact that the 60s wasn't a time of free love and protest, the US government actually used the hippies of the day as guinea pigs, in a mass experiment by giving them LSD. The free love Era and hippie movement ended the moment the government got their results and learned everything they needed to, relating to LSD. The 60s was one giant experiment and people had no idea they were actually trapped in a giant lab.

       YES, YES, YES!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT an EDM fan, but I will relate something that happened during Dead shows in the late 80's-90s. Some will remember this most assuredly.
      </p>
      <p>
       A hallucinogen called "ALD-52" was being distributed VERY cheaply and in mass amounts--almost certainly by a governmental TLA. I remember that the blotter was impregnated with some sort of metal compound (like glitter, but TINY)--I had a friend who worked for United at the time and he ran it through a dis-used x-ray machine at work one night--they lit right up on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       It "acted" like acid in almost all ways--except different. Instead of experiencing euphoria it produced anger in the vast majority of people who imbibed in it. A friend of mine bought a sheet from a guy in the lot and sold it at a party a few weeks after the shows. We did NOT take it. He lived across the street and we just sat by watching, smoking. After about 90 minutes all hell broke loose! Someone flew out the front window. Within 10 minutes EVERYONE in this huge party was fighting. Bodies spilled out the doors and windows, punches flew. It wasn't long before the piggies were arresting everyone in sight.
      </p>
      <p>
       We called it the "hate acid." It was a long while before a regular "family" supplier told us about that stuff and what it likely was.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also selling MANY synthetic phenethylamines in place of MDMA at these things today. Nowadays the big one is MDPV, which is utterly terrible and kills people. It speeds the heart up to dangerous rates--I tried 25mg once and my heart rate shot up from 68bpm to 217 within 15 minutes. NOT pleasurable at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as acid goes, a HUGE percentage of it is NBOM-e or NBOM-i. These chems only act sublingually (and numb your mouth) so, if you imbibe and want to be SURE that it's acid, reasonably, SWALLOW IT. If it's an NBOM you won't feel it--if it's real L it will likely work, albeit slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember that with these "new" RCs that the effective dosage window is usually VERY close to the lethal dosage. ALWAYS look it up!! Buy some Marquis reagent (or make it) and TEST EVERYTHING before you ingest it. There's even fake NITROUS going around...I've encountered Halothane as little as a year ago in Phish lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       DANCE SAFE AND HAVE FUN!! ABOVE ALL--HYDRATE!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Saw below comment--also cannot recommend reading "Acid Dreams" enough. Also read "Storming Heaven" by Jay Stevens and--a must--"Weird Scenes--Inside the Canyon" by Dave McGowan about the deadly Laurel Canyon scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: The "hate acid" blotter pattern was an Egyptian Eye on a light-orange background...sprinkled with silver.

       First, no one mistakes MDPV, or anything in the pyvervalone family as MDMA or anything in it's family of chems.  They are entirely different  Also, for being such a potent, strong stimulant, MDPV(and most of it's cousins but not all) are much safer than most other strong stims(legal or illegal).   Used correctly(meaning low dose in the 5mg to 15mg range and not used too frequently, heart rate and blood pressure are minimally affected, especially if you compare it to cocaine and meth.  The problems with MDPV stem from the fact that not only is a CNS stimulant but it also greatly affects the adrenaline system, causing large amounts to be introduced into the mix, which is never a good thing as when you cross that magic line(too much, too fast) your brain goes into "Flight or Fight" mode and if you do not have benzo's or the like to calm you down, nothing will get you to relax, until it wears off, which can be a long time.  This is where you see all of the problems in the media concerning people freaking the fuck out.  Some just can't keep their shit together when their brain is basically reacting as if a tiger is chasing them and going to eat their ass(not really, and not what people are thinking, but it's the same type of fear the brain is feeling).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is in no way trying to defend MDPV or it's cousins, just trying to set the record straight on the facts concerning it.

       You probably misunderstood me. I am saying that MDPV is being actively sold in the lots as molly. People who have had MDMA know, sure as hell, that they've been had if they take it...hehe. It may be relatively "safe" (toxicologically speaking) but God help you if you have a cardiac issue and use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing is that one of the best stims out there, IMHO, is legal and right in plain view. Walgreens still carries it. Of course, I speak of propylhexedrine. Don't take it unless you have about 26 hours to kill though!
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, you are 100% correct about how it causes your brain to react. I bought it knowing full well what it was, and luckily had a very strong benzo to take me down. Not that I didn't redose...that's part of the problem. It's not that great but the urge to redose is HUGE...I've never experienced that outside of blow or the cathinones.

       I had some of that ALD. In my experience it never started fist fights but it certainly turned everyone on one another, brought out the hate and power conflicts. It also made many who took it sick to their stomachs, including me. It was like acid, but bad.

       Unfortunately, I'm mostly poor and either have work or school taking up my time, so I only get to "go to shows" by watching YouTube videos. I have definitely noticed the occult-like themes, but never gave it much thought because after the music, my attention was mostly directed towards the crowd and all the flags, seeing where everyone was from, the girls, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just figured the stage props were pyramids, owls, etc. because what ever corporation that had the money to invest in that level of decoration just thought that "illuminati" symbolism was edgy or whatever. That might be me being naive, but I do believe that the artists intentions are pure. I would have a real hard time of believing someone like Armin Van Buuren has nefarious intentions. I listen to his podcast and he genuinely seems like a person that has a real love for people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you're experiencing is legit, it is disturbing. The whole purpose, from my perspective and understanding at least, of a rave scene is to dissolve social strata and connect with your fellow man from all walks of life... and to go nuts with them when the beat drops.

       This isn't necessarily on the topic of mind control but I have been noticing a lot of UK festivals occur on so called ley-lines, and those that do most often have a main stage in the shape of a pyramid, or other sky-reaching shape which I imagine is used to harness energies. This may sound like a load of rubbish but I see it at nearly every festival I go to. The one that comes to mind is Glastonbury with the pyramid stage, but I have also seen it at Green Man in Wales where the main stage is under a mountain and on a ley line.

       Okay. I am sure they know about the bohemian grove and illuminati and as artists, have chosen to copy the style in order to create a sense of mystery and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       To jump to the conclusion of "They are secret illuminati and are corrupting the crowd with trance music" is quite the stretch in logic.

       I think that you (and most of everyone else in the comments) need to go to another large event and NOT do drugs. And if you really feel the same way that you do while not on something, pursue it. I mean you think weird stuff while on drugs thats kinda the point.

       Thank you. Yes I have thought this for a long time. Rave culture, when it went 'above ground' in the nineties, became the heir to the throne that hippie rock culture once held.
      </p>
      <p>
       Participants in these events are not critical and rational. They are dazed and confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       The music volume plus the drugs fill the mind up and leave no space for creativity, which also involves critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember at one event about 6 yeas ago, I noticed some intense psychic/shamanic warfare going on. It was a battleground for human consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was the huge loud stages. Then there were these acoustic circus tents where people played folk music, juggled. These tents were put up and operated by people who were dirty, travelers, anarchist types who couldn't afford sound systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the sound stages. They represented natural order while the sound stages representing 'civilized' power structures and hierarchies, like an army.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these traveler types even set up by a trail and held signs that said 'leave no trance' and 'goa home'. I was drawn to them. Because to me, that psytrance was some dark shit. I never understood how people could associate psytrance with happiness and expansion of consciousness. It always boxed my mind in, assaulted my senses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I roamed, and kept asking myself 'where do these people get he money' for such huge sound systems. I concluded hat they had outside financiers. Yes, that the whole operation was MK or some similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like raves but small ones where the sound systems are small and the music easily averted to also enjoy being in nature. And I will always appreciate a good underground club (if such an establishment even exists anymore).
      </p>
      <p>
       But these festivals are for obedience. Keep them dazed and confused at Electric Daisy and off the streets like at the WTO protest in Seattle back in '99.

       I forget the name of the show, some kids show with three young women who are also secret agents...but one of the premises is cracking down on some dj who hypnotizes people at rave like events; who uses a particular drug to induce the violence and destruction.

       I have a friend who goes to these things almost every week, and he seems pretty not here most of the time. Its probably just all the 2CB and MDMA he does, but I do feel he like something is sucking his soul out.. I dunno he's only excited when he's taking about raving/drugs

       Drug abuse does that though. It'll consume your life to where you only care about drugs and when you get to do them next.

       Sounds like you get paranoid on drugs. I think the govt allows this to happen because it's better for them if people to go and get wrapped up in music and partying then going and solo tripping where they might actually delve deeper into their own unconscious and start asking questions. Tripping in public, especially these type of events is just about fun. Not really self discovery in my opinion.

       I have never been to a rave and never taken these chemical drugs, but I know when I was younger, extacy was legal.  This drug was the core of the "rave" movement.  When it went illegal, it was mainly imported by Israelis.

       Can confirm I have had the exact same experience at a skrillex show at Webster hall in New York. wasn't even tripping on anything, there were suits in VIP looking down at the crowd and the venue was testing out a new lighting system. seriously creepy vibes like it was all programmed as I watched the neon colored kids around bounce mindlessly about, responding to the rise and fall of the music predictably. real fucking strange shit.
      </p>

       I considered posting about it here but that I was a loon, clearly you folks have shared similar vibes.

       i agree with a lot of what is being posted here. I really love the scene and the type of people you can meet at a show! I cant really find something meaningful to say except that this is really opening up my mind i new ways. i have so many friends that rave and i want nothing except for them to be safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       i've done my fair share of research into MKUltra and things like it and honestly i wouldnt be surprised either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       one thing that makes me happy though is the spread of information just like this post and the internet in general! each and every day it becomes exponentially harder to hide sinister things from people willing to look. People have always been curious about higher powers misusing their power, but now we actually have a chance to almost entirely see the stuff for what it is!
      </p>
      <p>
       dont get me wrong there is still a lot of stuff that extremely rich people with an agenda can get away with. But compared to 50, 75 or 100 years ago the average knowledge of the population has continued to rise! posts like these freak me out but are much needed and make me happy too. I'm glad there are strangers out there concerned for their safety and the safety of others!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll be at paradiso in a month and will try to enjoy myself as much as possible but i will surely be on the lookout for anything suspicious!
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck my friends!

      <p>
       p.s. time to listen to some Rage Against The Machine to help with this helpless feeling!

       It's Tomorrowland of this year, Aoki having the crowd lift their arms to the Titanic theme...my inquiry is who the hell is the man sitting on a throne with lady servants next to him, that looks occult-like....also conspiracy theorists could dive deep into the remixing/playing of this song and say it's symbolic for We're going down as a whole...so let's cheerfully mock this film scene on a movie where people die tragically....IDK, something to think about or atleast have youtubers go crazy over

       my inquiry is who the hell is the man sitting on a throne with lady servants next to him
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he is the kind of "Melodia" (fictional kingdom of Tomorrowland maybe?)

       It was weird to me that the video gave me chills-i fucking hate titanic lol and that song

       Aoki is too big to not be controlled, so if there is a Masonic/occult conspiracy  he's def in on it lol. Also, did you know that his dad is the owner of Benihana restaurants?

       Wow, op...good post. I have recently began thinking about such possibilities. I mean sure I came to the realisation that a party is just another consumerism hotspot, but I haven't gone farther than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have one story tho, don't really know what to make of it as I'm not really surr about this multidimensional thing and if what you see during a trip is real or not. Anyway, I was at this party, Villalobos and Rhadoo were playing and I was tripping. Came there from another party, where I took a pill, and everything was great, got to this particular party, took another pill, same kind,but everything was weird there. I felt scared, like something strange or dangerous was going to happen, and kept having strange visions and hallucinations and also seemed like I could also see behind me. One time, I look at the djs and they appeared as tho they were wearing white scientist robes, a mouth mask or whatever that's called, and they were effectively mixing something in big tanks that had that toxic sign on them. I freaked out and bounced, and calmed down with all this nonsensical partying.

       While your theory may in fact be true, wouldn't you say there is also the chance that the idea might come from the fact that you are tripping?

       I should say that you might not only be affected during the trip, being a psychonaut puts your in a certain frame of mind consistently.  When I was taking a lot of drugs, I started to think everything was basically MK Ultra. Only after years later and with some perspective could I see that the drugs played a part in that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I wouldn't ever say your theory was impossible, or even unlikely, just trying to give some perspective.

       For sure. I agree. Shit is so crazy. Back when i used to go to shows i used to get weird vibes like people were always watching me or staring at me. I used to roll and thought that it was just the drugs, but hell no i would catch people staring at me as if they were looking into my soul. There's definitely some crazy shit going on.

       Seriously...this crossed my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set and setting are the most important factors affecting a psychedelic experience. In the case of a rave/festival, the set and setting is a collection of lost souls, sexual predators and unsavory characters (not to mention the undercover officers, etc)...so def not a spiritually safe pastime. Also, the set could be a occult magick ritual which we are unaware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it's eerie how there are so many similarities between the Bohemian Grove ceremony and EDC, tomorrowworld, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big festivals are owned by "the-powers-that-be" (shadow government) and it seems they are pushing their ideology and symbols.

       This is one reason that I don't really like EDM. Some of it is downright in-your-face with Illuminati symbology...like Lady Gaga (and no, I am not calling that crap EDM). I appreciate the time and talent that it takes to create it...but why the symbology in some of it? Gimmick? Or is there more to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I listen to it and immediately think of binaural brain entrainment. Which, I'm sure, is going on in some of it. This is VERY powerful stuff...much more powerful than most give it credit for.

       Thanks for your thoughtful feedback! I honestly don't get the in-your-face illuminati stuff. It's either a) artistic expression b) pushing illuminati agenda c) being done for shock value.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that option a isn't realistic b/c how is doing the same thing over and over artistic (also, none of these symbols are new)
      </p>
      <p>
       option c is pathetic and may be true
      </p>
      <p>
       option b seems the most logical

       EDM is basically an orgy in my opinion. If you feel lost its because there's a God that you're supposed to look for. Message me if you want to know more about it.

       The two most common drugs at raves according to a police officer:
Ecstasy 
Viagra

      <p>
       youre absolutely right about EDMs, they are evil and there is a high possibility that it is used for brainwashing.
