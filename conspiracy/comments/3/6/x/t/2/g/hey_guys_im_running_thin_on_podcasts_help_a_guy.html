       I am really into conspiracies from the possible to the outright absured, unsolved mysteries and critical thinking kind of shows. I currently listen to both George carlin shows, mysterious universe, thinking sideways, npr network shows, snapjudgement and this american life. I was wondering what shows do you find interesting and entertaining. Thank you

       Check out the smodcast, Carlins daughter does a show called "waking up from the american dream." There is also "Criminal" and "Sword and Scales." (Both about crimes.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you into Radiolab? They have a fuckton of amazing shows about everything from science to mysteries. Also the cracked podcast talks about some really interesting non pop culture stuff on a regular basis. I can reccomend individual episodes but just browse their history on earwolf.
       <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/episode/cracks-in-human-perception/">
        Here
       </a>
       is as good a place as any to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also wiretap on CBC. The host contributes to TAL and Radiolab a lot. his own podcast is along the same vein. There is Dan Carlins hardcore history which I find a bit too dense. Check out Radiotopia.fm as well.

       I'd second this.  He's become more of a skeptic over the years but he is cool enough to still entertain the ideas of his guests like Graham Hancock and Rupert Sheldrake.
      </p>
      <p>
       He'ss more often talking to stand up comedians than conspiracy authors but he gets a good mix of people with good conversations.

       i don't believe in the moon landing being a hoax but HE DID. And he would rant about it to anyone who would listen. Up until he had Neil Degrasse Tyson on. Then he pretended that he thought other people didn't believe in the moon landing. It was so cowardly.

       He replied to that question in an AMA:

      <p>
       He basically says that he's fascinated by the idea but not entirely convinced.  I'm sure he was probably embarassed to talk about it too bluntly with Tyson, and I think that's understandable.  He's only human.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, all his evidence comes from other people who don't believe in it.  So he talked about them and their evidence, he doesn't have evidence of his own, only the works of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's someone who talks about these things in a laid back and informal way.  He's not out trying to expose the new world order, he's just a guy who's fascinated by conspiracy shit like a lot of us.

       by the end he's literally screaming "there is no way we went to the moon." Then when he talks to Tyson he only mentions all the facts that 'other people' believe. When his friends ask him to explain his change of heart he gets defensive and changed the topic.

       People have changes of heart man.  It's entirely possible that he just eventually got ashamed of backing up that theory with so much veracity.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is no way we went to the moon." Was a silly statement that came from being excited by feeling like you're onto something.  He probably then read enough debunking articles to not feel so sure about it.  And as he said there's not a lot of smart people on the moon hoax theory unlike most of the bigger political conspiracy theories.

       I feel like I'm on the same page as him.  I've seen some weird anomolies with the moon footage that seem off.  But there's no smoking gun and it's one of those theories that you just feel like a weirdo defending.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do is read comments from people who've said that they were inspired by him to work out more, lose weight, try a shroom trip to expand their mind and think about the world differently to know he's doing good work.  For you to get hung up on his moon hoax cold feet and ignore all his positive work is myopic and very tool-like of yourself.

       Like I said.  He makes people think about the world differently and has a way of explaining things that works for some people, myself included.  He interviews people like Sam Harris and Graham Hancock and introduces them to people who'd never hear about them or read their works.

       Here's some quotes from that AMA:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        First off I know you get this a lot but since listening to your podcast you helped motivate me to lose 35lbs and I started training Muay Thai.
       </p>
       <p>
        You put it well, its good to question everything and It's good a have an open mind, just not so open your brain falls out. I'm a huge fan and listen to every episode.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish I found your podcast sooner.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm a huge fan and listen to the JRE Podcast all the time. You show has changed my life. I lost 35 pounds (kettle bells and kale shakes, yah dirty bitches!) and started reading a lot more (I also tried shrooms, which was an amazing experience). Thank you so much for not only making me laugh, but for changing my life for the better and helping me become a better person. You're a good shit, Joe.

        Who would've guessed Joe Rogan would be spiritual mentor to thousands of people? He's like the anti-prophet. "Think for yourselves, people!" It's freaking awesome.

       by the end he's literally screaming "there is no way we went to the moon." Then when he talks to Tyson he only mentions all the facts that 'other people' believe. When his friends ask him to explain his change of heart he gets defensive and changed the topic.

       People have changes of heart man.  It's entirely possible that he just eventually got ashamed of backing up that theory with so much veracity.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There is no way we went to the moon." Was a silly statement that came from being excited by feeling like you're onto something.  He probably then read enough debunking articles to not feel so sure about it.  And as he said there's not a lot of smart people on the moon hoax theory unlike most of the bigger political conspiracy theories.
      </p>

       I feel like I'm on the same page as him.  I've seen some weird anomolies with the moon footage that seem off.  But there's no smoking gun and it's one of those theories that you just feel like a weirdo defending.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you have to do is read comments from people who've said that they were inspired by him to work out more, lose weight, try a shroom trip to expand their mind and think about the world differently to know he's doing good work.  For you to get hung up on his moon hoax cold feet and ignore all his positive work is myopic and very tool-like of yourself.
