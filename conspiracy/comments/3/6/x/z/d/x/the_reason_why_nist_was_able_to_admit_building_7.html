        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>so many times i have seen things written here such as: &quot;the vague concept of free fall cant determine things about the vast amount of internal forces in a building.&quot;</p>

<p>First off:  Free fall speed is not a &quot;vague concept&quot;. It has a rigorous scientific definition: F(x) = m (d<sup>2</sup> x)/(dt<sup>2</sup> ) where d<sup>2</sup> x/dt<sup>2</sup> =g.
or in normal english: Mass times the second derivative of position with respect to time (also known as acceleration) gives the force acting on any body (or in our case a composite of bodies).  When the acceleration is equal to 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>  this is free fall as felt on bodies on planet earth.
Furthermore, its not &quot;complicated&quot; (as ive seen so many people use that argument to imply that its too hard for even an amateur scientist to contemplate)... Free-fall is a concept from <strong>first principles Physics</strong> which although are simple enough a highschool student can understand them, remain TRUE as long as speeds remain far from c (the speed of light). That equation up there is TRUE when a body falls with zero resistance in a uniform gravitational field, and acceleration is 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup> when that field is earths.  </p>

<p>the next thing i see often, are phrases like &quot;its such a big complicated building, you cant know whats going on inside of it just by just watching it fall!&quot;
Well... you cant know everything, but you can know enough.  and enough in our case means zero resistance. Einstein deduced the <strong>SIZE OF ATOMS</strong> by watching some pollen floating in water.  He deduced the internal structure of <em>matter itself</em> from whats called brownian motion (or the random motion of particles suspended in a liquid).   Given the power of physics to deduce the internal forces by observing macroscopic (large groups) behavior, how can one doubt its ability to determine the resistance experienced by groups of falling debris? (one of the simplest possibly situations)</p>

<p>the skeptic may think that the &quot;vague concept&quot; of free fall means nothing, But to a scientifically literate person, it means EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>The fact that NIST left out the fact that building 7 experienced free-fall for about 2.5 seconds either means they were <strong>incompetent</strong> (as it was a mistake no scientifically literate person could ever make), or they purposefully withheld it because they knew what it implied.  I cant for even a second believe that the people hired by the government to conduct one of the most important scientific reports of the century could be that idiotic.  But if they <em>were</em> that stupid, thats even more damning for the people who knowingly hired a bunch of scientifically illiterate people to conduct such an important study.</p>

<p>All questions are welcome.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way you do this. Is you create a &quot;committee&quot; then, you choose who goes on the committee and then you only give it evidence and a scope that will arrive at your desired conclusion. Whoever pays for it determines result. That is how the Soviets did science and its how America does it today.</p>

<p>If you had 12 scientists each do investigation independently, all of them would simply state that the building could not have failed from buckling at rate. Every single independent report comes to same conclusion and the committee comes to the other conclusion. Its mathematically and physically impossible. You can just get a bunch of &quot;experts&quot; who are paid to come to your desired conclusion. That is how system works.</p>

<p>This is called &quot;consensus reality&quot;. You have to hold both what actually happened and the consensus reality at the same time. Without contradiction. That is what doublethink means.</p>

<p>For media, the advertisers determine what the view of the media is. 70% of their revenue is coming from the pharm industry. So media is pro-vaccine and anti-supplement or else they get their ad money cut.</p>

<p>The real issue with anymmetrical damage applies to the twin towers. If a plane crashes in to one side, that side would have more damage than the other. For whatever reason, when they fall, asymmetric damage does not cause a symmetric foot print where that building will fall. The building would fall to one side or the other, instead of in on itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The collapse was clearly asymmetrical. Clearly. And if you had a view of the other side of the building you would be 100% clear. You van clearly see the penthouse failing. If you look closely at the video along the vertical line of the penthouse as it initially collapsed you can see the corresponding windows <em>blowing out</em> debris due to the structural failure of the interior columns of the building. You can clearly see a localized internal collapse that began  well before the global collapse. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>It does not.
The heat from the fire wasn&#39;t enough to significantly reduce the strength of the steel, but it was hot enough to cause it to expand. One of the main steel girders underwent significant expansion from the heat, (the longer the beam the more it expands, being a main girder, it was quite long) this caused excessive forces on one of the column connections resulting in failure. The reason this occurred is because the building was designed assuming the sprinkler system would work in the event of a fire, which in this case, it did not.
Now, after this connection broke, there was a collapse within the building that brought down a portion of several floors. This collapse left a number of the core columns without any lateral support, eliminating nearly all of there strength and thus causing there failure. Loading then shifted to the perimeter columns which quickly overwhelmed them, causing the collapse of the structure.
Regarding the free fall, this occurs only after the collapse is well under way. The increasing speed at which the top half of the tower impacts successive floors is large enough that the columns provide essentially no resistance. Its like dropping a brick on a couple pieces of uncooked spaghetti standing up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is one simple principle involved, Newton&#39;s third law of motion. Straight down free-fall acceleration for 2.5s implies ZERO counteracting force, which implies ZERO structural rigidity for at least as far as the building fell in that timeframe. The only way for a complete lack of rigidity to occur throughout that much of the building is for the steel frame supporting the building to be broken and displaced almost simultaneously across the entirety of the structure.</p>

<p>A collapse based on weakening steel at specific hotspots implies that most portions of the structure would still be rigidly standing and give resistance to the falling parts, preventing free-fall and resulting in an asymmetric, slow, and messy collapse sequence, which is the opposite of what the evidence shows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The common-sense reasoning required to identify the collapse of WTC7 as incapable of arising from buckling due to fire requires neither &quot;peer review&quot; nor rigorous mathematical proof, only simple and rational consideration of the elementary principles of physics as I explained above, and which you are incapable of providing any substantive counterargument to (because naturally there is none).</p>

<p>However, it <em>does</em> require an army of journalistic shills, committees staffed by cowardly careerists, and insecure useful idiots such as yourself to bury that common sense under a mountain of official fabrications, distortions, half-truths, and pseudoscience.</p>

<p>Nearly 4000 of them knew enough about the collapse to vote against the need for a new investigation. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s just clear this up right now. Exactly how many professional organizations <em>do</em> support the truth movement?</p>

<p>The American Institute of Architects ? Nope. </p>

<p>The American Society of Civil Engineers ? Nope. </p>

<p>The American Institute of Steel Construction? Nope. </p>

<p>The National Fire Protection Association? Nope. </p>

<p>The American Concrete Institute? Nope. </p>

<p>The Society of Fire Protection Engineers? Nope. </p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency? Nope. </p>

<p>The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat? Nope. </p>

<p>The Structural Engineers Association of New York? Nope. </p>

<p>You know what? This is going to take forever. It might be faster if you listed the professional agencies that <em>have</em> come out in support of the truth movement.</p>

<p>For <em>all 12 resolutions</em>. </p>

<p>See that bitch? <em>Much investigation! Very science!</em></p>

<p>Guess how long that took me? </p>

<p>5 minutes. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you ever get tired of me making you look stupid? </p>

You seem to have a lot of free time to spend on people who disagree with you. &quot;Bitch?&quot; The more desperate you get, the more angry you get.

I also continue to wait for an answer to my question asking if every member who voted, knew what the official story stated. Why do you continually dodge that? I also await your answer to my question as to the validity of opinion of AIA members considering 150 joined AE911Truth after a 6 minute presentation with no ability to show the collapse. What happened with them? Are their opinions no longer valid since they disagree with yours now? Were they valid before? What happened? Why do you keep begging people to believe the official story? You act like 9/11 is so inconsequential, but here you are. Continually begging.</p>

<p>Hmmm...I could have sworn it was you that asked for this:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/JRKi03P">http://imgur.com/JRKi03P</a></p>

<p>You wanted a &quot;good reason&quot; why the presentation was only 6 minutes long, and why they weren&#39;t allowed audio and video.</p>

<p>Because the entire portion of the event they were slotted into was 105 minutes in total along with 11 other resolutions being presented, as well as updates on the AIA&#39;s activities and finances, plus, meeting their newly elected national officers. I&#39;d bet a million dollars none of the 12 resolutions had A/V because that&#39;s not how they are presented.</p>

<p>You asked for a reason, now you&#39;re too stupid to <em>understand</em> it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s recap. The reason they got 6 minutes and no video is because everyone got 6 minutes and no video. They were well aware of the limitations before they presented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>heres the basic story. </p>

<p>When building 7 collapsed, it happened in 3 stages.  The 1st stage: some of the corner of the building started to fall.  A couple seconds later, the building entered freefall for 2.5 seconds. the final stage it slowed down again.</p>

<p>when NIST made their first report on building 7, they averaged the collapse time of the first 2 time periods.  And because the building didnt enter freefall untill ~ 2 seconds after the collapse started, when they averaged the acceleration from these time periods, they concluded that the <em>average</em> acceleration was less than freefall.</p>

<p>And thats entirely true.  But its also entirely uninteresting.  it would be like, when calculating the speed of a major league Fastball pitch, to take the velocity of the ball during the time when its still in the pitchers hand during his windup (slowly moving backwards before accelerating forwards) and averaging that speed with the speed when its in the air moving towards the catcher.  It may be true that the ball had an average velocity of 70Mph during that time period, but the INTERESTING thing is that that ball had a speed of 95 MPH while it was moving through the air.</p>

<p>Thats exactly what NIST did at first.  they obscured the fact that the building experienced a 2.5 second period of free fall by averaging it together with a period of collapse preceding free fall </p>

<p>Then at a NIST event, a highschool physics teacher in the audience brought the mistake (a ludicrous mistake that no competent scientist would ever make) to their attention.  They then revised the building 7 report and admitted the building entered free fall.  But they were deff hoping that it would go un noticed.  Since then it has been played down a whole lot by people without any knowledge of physics.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a stupid question at all.  theres nothing wrong with not being aware off all this, its a bit of a rabbit hole.   </p>

<p>in my opinion, its the single most important detail of the entire events ...the evidence it out in the open for the world to see.  anyone can calculate the acceleration of collapse from a video.  whereas melted steel beams and thermite, that evidence can be outright rejected.  A video collapse cant be.  From them first trying to obscure the fact, to them playing it down like its not a big deal; it shows how  much of a joke the NIST report really was.</p>

<p>Go to any university physics or engineering department, and if the professor isn&#39;t scared of you videotaping them and they&#39;re confident that the conversation is off the record, they&#39;ll tell you that something weird happened here as its not possible for a building to naturally enter free fall like this.

<p>I managed to watch a couple of links posted in this thread. One was by a conspiracy supporter and the other not a supporter.
What I found ironic is that the one that supposedly disproved the theory looked even more like CD than the one posted in favour of it! 
But ultimately they both showed essentially the same thing. I have absolutely no idea how that could have been a random collapse <em>shakes head</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>NIST states that the exterior framing failed only after the interior already failed. The interior floor framing and columns collapsed downward and pulled away from the exterior frame. The clues for the interior failing were the collapse of the penthouse (visible in youtube videos) and windows breaking before the exterior collapse. </p>

<p>They also showed that the descent time was in three stages - first one was much slower than free fall which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories; second stage was the free fall explained by no internal support and no support from buckled exterior frame below; in third stage the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a physicist and I&#39;m not arguing that the NIST explanation is correct. It sounds plausible to me. I would like to understand why their explanation could not be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it cannot be true because they didn&#39;t use physical evidence. Instead they used a model and kept modifying it until the model partially collapsed in a manner inconsistent with the actual collapse. And their modifications consisted of removing fasteners, stiffeners, altering the size of the beams, adjusting the temperature of the fires, adjusting the physical response of steel at the temperatures. When you watch the simulation, you see the initial momentum to generate the scenario for their collapse has a beam falling several stories unimpeded to knock a column off its footing. This looks nice in a frame model, but the building had floors and it would have been impossible for the beam to fall unimpeded and gain the necessary momentum to initialize the collapse. The collapse would then be partial and non-symmetrical.</p>

<p>Free-fall in itself is not the smoking gun. Global symmetrical free-fall through the path of greatest resistance is. This is what the evidence shows. </p>

<p>But this is all nonsense. In determining an engineering failure, we don&#39;t model it, we use the physical evidence. NIST had to jump through a lot of hoops to avoid using physical evidence. In order to avoid any evidence of explosions, NIST made an arbitrary measure for explosions: the explosion would have produced 130-140 decibels at half a mile. They then determined that there was no evidence of an explosion heard at such a magnitude. This is wrong on many levels. Primarily because in forensic investigations, we use evidence, not find ways to avoid examining evidence. By their standard, they can dismiss videos of first responders reacting to a huge explosion by saying it failed to meet their criteria for an explosion. </p>

<p>In short, NIST altered known attributes of WTC 7 until they could produce a model that fell. The simulation does not reflect reality and does not explain anything. </p>

<p>But what it does do is show that they went out of their way to avoid conducting a forensic investigation according to accepted standards. They went out of their way to avoid using the physical evidence. And they made unsupportable claims (no explosions) using arbitrary methods. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying JFK was killed by a meteorite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats exactly right, the descent time did happen in three basic stages.</p>

<p>but the thing to take away, is that if a period of free-fall is experienced, that means for that time period, there is zero resistance opposing the collapse of the building.  The fact that <em>some</em> of the building fell before the rest of the building entered free fall doesnt take anything away from the fact that, the a majority of the parts which constituted the building fell with zero resistance (nothing was opposing it) for a period of time. and the only way that could happen is if every support beam failed simultaneously, or failed in succession as the building was falling.   (like a row of dominoes: as the first one tips into the second one, some force causes the second one to start falling into the third one exactly as the first one hits the second so that the first one doesnt need to transfer any force to the second one.  it may seem like a small amount of energy difference in this example, but the time needed for one domino to knock over the next one gets compounded into a total time for the whole series to fall, culminating in the last domino falling over.  if the sequence of dominoes finishes 2 seconds before it was supposed to, you can conclude that the last domino falling over was not a consequence of the first one falling over, because it happened 2 seconds before the laws of physics allow it to happen.).  </p>

<p>This is precisely the reason why the NIST simulation wasn&#39;t provided for this free fall stage of collapse.  As given their initial conditions, and initial collapse stages, it would have been impossible to get the simulation to play out the way we saw it (Collapse in free fall for a period of 2.5 seconds).  </p>

<p>The chances that the entire support structures of the building collapsed first, only leaving the outer shell of the building to collapse without resistance is slim to none.  Furthermore, if it DID happen that way, NIST would have rejoiced in their ability to show an accurate simulation for the entire collapse.  but they didnt.. because the collapse didnt happen that way. So they weren&#39;t able to show the collapse in simulation.</p>

<p>The post i made last week, about the media suppressing ron paul.. well i got in a really long argument with this guy cutterjon, and he brought up a couple good points.  The argument would be stronger if I ran some statistics on the data and corrected for group differences between the different candidates internet user demographics.  Ive since done all the math and corrected for not only that, but for other things as well (posituve vs negative internet traffic on youtube).   Im going to post it all a little closer to bernie sanders campaign, as i think it will have the best chance of going viral on r/dataisbeautiful or r/politics or somewhere (and here as well of course) at an important time like that.   it was a very heated argument i had w/ that dude lol, but all in all his motivation to disprove the video has resulted in the argument becoming stronger, as now there are less things a skeptic can cling to after the statistical corrections are performed.  i know hed prob curse me out if he saw this lol, but wherever u are cutterjon, thanks for your help ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn, I&#39;ve been found out.</p>

<p>I work for Illuminaughty. I have been tasked with having discussions on unpopular threads on niche internet forums, in order to prevent the truth of 9/11 from coming out. Now that I&#39;ve been discovered, I may as well reveal the truth to you now.</p>

<p>George W. Bush commissioned a team of Mossad Agents to fill the buildings with anti-matter bombs. This is the only way free-fall collapse is attainable. The controlled demolition theories are a red herring. Anyone supporting those theories is a shill, most likely employed by the JIDF. If they state otherwise, that is further proof of their shillness.</p>

<p>The reasons for the attack aren&#39;t what you think though. It wasn&#39;t about getting to the Middle East for oil, the real reason was far more sinister.</p>

<p>Back in the 1970&#39;s, Bin Laden organized a raid on Area 51, capturing alien technology and hiding it among the mountains of Afganistan. This was used as leverage for generations, as the Americans couldn&#39;t let the truth out to the world. If the rest of the world found out that they hid first contact in order to harvest their technology, there would be outrage. All world events America was involved in were at OBL&#39;s beck and call. They planned 911 to discredit him, and destroyed the evidence by bombing the mountains, until the pretense that OBL was hiding in a cave.</p>

<p>Open your eyes, Sheeple.</p>

<p>Also you were very angry from the start. Don&#39;t blame me when I respond in kind.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m going to suggest a conspiracy here. Is it a coincidence that another user containing the name lloyd has started bothering me not long after another deleted their account? But the rabbit hole goes even deeper... the previous user, named LloydBoyd, contains the name Boyd. Boyd Crowder is a main character in the excellent show Justified, which just finished its last season on FX. Your username also contains Lloyd, and the name Bennett. The Bennett family is featured mainly in season 2 of Justified, with the character Dickie Bennett making appearances through the series.</p>

<p>Could it be, that you have switched to a different account? Could be a bit of a weird coincidence, but the fact that the LloydBoyd account stopped posting after a few exchanges with me, and then a user with a remarkably similar name singles out my comment hours after with an unusually angry tone, I have a feeling I&#39;m speaking to the same person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this a deliberate/malicious lie on behalf of NIST?</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>In a video, it appears that WTC 7 is descending in free fall, something that would not occur in the structural collapse that you describe. How can NIST ignore basic laws of physics?
In the draft WTC 7 report (released Aug. 21, 2008; available at <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm">http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/wtc_draftreports.cfm</a>), NIST stated that the north face of the building descended 18 stories (the portion of the collapse visible in the video) in 5.4 seconds, based on video analysis of the building collapse. This time period is 40 percent longer than the 3.9 seconds this process would have taken if the north face of the building had descended solely under free fall conditions. During the public comment period on the draft report, NIST was asked to confirm this time difference and define the reasons for it in greater detail.
To further clarify the descent of the north face, NIST recorded the downward displacement of a point near the center of the roofline from first movement until the north face was no longer visible in the video. Numerical analyses were conducted to calculate the velocity and acceleration of the roofline point from the time-dependent displacement data. The instant at which vertical motion of the roofline first occurred was determined by tracking the numerical value of the brightness of a pixel (a single element in the video image) at the roofline. This pixel became brighter as the roofline began to descend because the color of the pixel started to change from that of the building façade to the lighter color of the sky.
The approach taken by NIST is summarized in NIST NCSTAR Report 1A, Section 3.6, and detailed in NIST NCSTAR Report 1-9, Section 12.5.3.
The analyses of the video (both the estimation of the instant the roofline began to descend and the calculated velocity and acceleration of a point on the roofline) revealed three distinct stages characterizing the 5.4 seconds of collapse:
Stage 1 (0 to 1.75 seconds): acceleration less than that of gravity (i.e., slower than free fall).
Stage 2 (1.75 to 4.0 seconds): gravitational acceleration (free fall)
Stage 3 (4.0 to 5.4 seconds): decreased acceleration, again less than that of gravity
This analysis showed that the 40 percent longer descent time—compared to the 3.9 second free fall time—was due primarily to Stage 1, which corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns in the lower stories of the north face. During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model, which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above. In Stage 3, the acceleration decreased as the upper portion of the north face encountered increased resistance from the collapsed structure and the debris pile below.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>the first thing that jumps out in their statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During Stage 2, the north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that is outright wrong.  The entire roofline descended at free fall during stage 2, not just the north face.  also, it wasn&#39;t &quot;essentially&quot; free fall, it <em>was</em> free fall (again, they&#39;re doing their  best to play it down).  lastly, it didn&#39;t indicate &quot;negligible&quot; support from the structure below, it indicated <em>completely nonexistent</em> support from the structure below. 3 white lies in one sentence, which completely plays down the fact that the entire top of the building descended at free fall.   </p>

<p>They then go on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is consistent with the structural analysis model, which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>stage <em>one</em> was consistent, but being how they wrote that sentence directly  after the sentence talking about the building entering <em>free fall</em> (stage 2), it sure makes it sound like theyre claiming that their structural analysis model was consistent with the observed period of free fall, which couldn&#39;t be further from the truth...  so now we have 2 back to back sentences, with as many white lies as there is concepts in those sentences.  </p>

<p>Everything said regarding the building entering free fall is a serious bending of the truth, or outright deception... </p>

<p>Now factor in that they did their best to write the report without having to admit to any of this free fall business, and it takes their lying to a <em>whole, notha, level</em>...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because their structural analysis model was completely inconsistent with the free fall period.  Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t have had to cut their simulation off after stage 1.   they weren&#39;t even close to having a working model of the stage 2 free fall collapse.  Stage 1 was the only thing they were able to show in the simulation.</p>

<p>Part of the reason why this evidence is so damning, is because <em>anyone/everyone</em> has the evidence right in front of them.    there are hundreds of videos showing the collapse of building 7.  from these videos, its straightforward to calculate the speed of the descending roofline and deduce that its accelerating at 9.8 M/s<sup>2</sup> for  the majority of the descent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Building 7, and indeed the towers, were likely wired from the very beginning--like from construction.</p>

<p>If you read <em>By Way of Deception</em> by Victor Ostrovsky (ex-Mossad agent) he makes it quite clear that there are bombs planted in hundreds of Arab-controlled buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure--and that they were put there YEARS ago at the time of construction.</p>

<p>Google info on how the buildings&#39; supplies were <em>unusually</em> secured, how some welders had top-secret clearances and worked behind screens, how they ran out of their &quot;special&quot; 3&quot; rebar&quot; (coated with a black plastic-type substance) and had to use &quot;normal&quot; rust-colored rebar for a week (hence the non-symmetrical collapse of one of the towers)...and on and on. Those buildings were most likely wired from the get-go...it&#39;s quite clear that Issar Harel of Mossad knew that an &quot;event&quot; like 9/11 was going to happen 20+ years before it did. Then there&#39;s the predictive programming--some of the most obvious was contained in one of Arnon Milchan&#39;s (Israeli arms dealer extraordinaire and &quot;movie producer&quot;) films in which...a plane was saved by kids from, hmm, <em>crashing into the WTC</em>. Then...the countdown heard before the demo of WTC7 seals the deal. See if you can&#39;t find the guy talking to Leslie Robinson (one of the original architects) about exactly <strong>how</strong> the buildings would be taken down when they outlived their usefuleness.</p>

<p>It was scripted as well as most Hollywood films--they had the same people working on it, after all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, this is what NIST&#39;s model tried to show. Their story is that a beam was deformed by fire enough to detach it. This beam fell 5-6 stories and unseated a column. The column fell and brought down the supporting beams which dragged the other columns with it. </p>

<p>The resulting recording of the collapse then does not need to account for the path of resistance if their theory is valid.</p>

<p>But it isn&#39;t valid. It isn&#39;t valid because we have the plans for the building. And they changed the plans so that the models could fall. </p>

<p>Their problem was quite basic. They put in all the data, the fasteners, the stiffeners, the fireproofing, the thickness of the I beams, the seating for the column footer and they put in the forces that the building was under. And the model would stand forever under such conditions. You hit run and nothing happens. So then you tweak it and tweak it and then something happens. And you tweak that until it kind of could look like that. </p>

<p>Their model&#39;s essential problem is that it both needs and can&#39;t have the same forces at the same time. The force to drag the adjoining columns down with the falling of the lateral beams is the same force that would prevent their falling in the first place. They need to act like a force doesn&#39;t exist for long enough to allow the initial momentum and then act like it does to allow that momentum to build. </p>

<p>They need it to behave as a triangle and then as soon as it does, revert to a square, over and over throughout the entire structure. </p>

<p>Then and only then does their model fall at all. But this is impossible. The force cannot be turned on and off with a switch. It can only be turned off. That means that the supports were simultaneously taken out. Controlled demolition.</p>

<p>Engineering student here, This is wrong.</p>

<p>Even though the lower undamaged structure was designed to be able to handle the upper damaged 18 stories, this is only true in a static sense. Once the loads became dynamic (due to gravity), the dynamic loads had already far exceeded the structural design limit and the failure had to propagate until all the energy is dissipated.</p>

<p>This is true for nearly every structure in existence, and certainly true for every skyscraper: once progressive collapse begins, it can&#39;t be stopped because the supporting structure below cannot handle the many multiplications of the load it was designed to support.</p>

<p>It&#39;s erroneous to think of a skyscraper as a solid column of material that&#39;s able to stop falling objects. In reality a skyscraper is more like a skeletal structure with thousands of interconnected supporting members. The loss of too many members/supports will cause failure. A giant mass falling through the center of the skeleton will only knock more of the structure away, further propagating the collapse.</p>

<p>The heat from the fire wasn&#39;t enough to significantly reduce the strength of the steel, but it was hot enough to cause it to expand. One of the main steel girders underwent significant expansion from the heat, (the longer the beam the more it expands, being a main girder, it was quite long) this caused excessive forces on one of the column connections resulting in failure. The reason this occurred is because the building was designed assuming the sprinkler system would work in the event of a fire, which in this case, it did not. Now, after this connection broke, there was a collapse within the building that brought down a portion of several floors. This collapse left a number of the core columns without any lateral support, eliminating nearly all of there strength and thus causing there failure. Loading then shifted to the perimeter columns which quickly overwhelmed them, causing the collapse of the structure. Regarding the free fall, this occurs only after the collapse is well under way. The increasing speed at which the top half of the tower impacts successive floors is large enough that the columns provide essentially no resistance. Its like dropping a brick on a couple pieces of uncooked spaghetti standing up.</p>

<p>To slightly change topic, what are your thoughts on the pentagon?  I think its bullshit that theyre withholding all the video evidence... but i recently heard a theory that makes a lot of sense: 
 say it actually did happen the way they say.  By withholding all the videos and creating public distrust around the issue, if public trust in the <em>entire</em> event ever becomes unmanageable sometime in the future, they could release the actual video,  which would cause public trust in the *entire * event to return to normal.  I found this theory very interesting, considering that i could totally see it being used as a limited hangout damage control chess piece in the future, and actually work very well at  destroying skepticism in the unrelated events of building 7 and the twin towers...</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way in hell a piss-poor pilot who only flew in sims and couldn&#39;t be trusted to land a Cessna somehow guided their maiden and final voyage of a 757 through a high-G turn just above sea level to park the plane at 500 knots right through the recently reinforced outermost ring of the Pentagon.</p>

<p>If i were in charge of the PR though, when i sensed things were getting out of control, id flood the media with reports that theres evidence that it was <em>actually</em> a missile that hit the pentagon.  and id have the CIA feed all these fake storys to the MSM.  Then after hijacking the public distrust, and getting them to all dewll on this fake issue, thinking that real proof of a missile is imminent:  BOOM id hit them with a video of <em>A</em> plane hitting the pentagon (whether its <em>the</em> plane or not now becomes less important as its far less big a deal than what everyone had been thinking).
