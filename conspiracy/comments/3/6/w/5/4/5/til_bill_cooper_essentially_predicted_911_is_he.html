    <div class="md"><p>My experience with Bill Cooper is he had a TON of info. A lot of it was disinfo, but I feel like he did a good job of admitting that a lot of the documents and material he had may be fake, but he wanted to present everything he had and let you be the judge. I feel like he tried his best to present facts. He seems to ramble and his stories and arguments are a little disjointed...but you can&#39;t deny some of the correlations in his work with what is actually happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read Nick Redfern&#39;s book &quot;Final Events,&quot; about a unit within the government called &quot;The Collins Elite&quot;. They were real-life X-Files operatives. A lot of what they say backs up with Bill Cooper said.</p>

<p>So he wasn&#39;t a &quot;random loon&quot; with no outside corroboration.</p>

<p>To frame it like that is to be guilty of disinformation yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: And, just for the record, I don&#39;t believe in &quot;aliens,&quot; either. Extraterrestrials. According to the Collins Elite, the &quot;alien&quot; claim is a fake cover story by interdimensionals. Whether we believe this or not, it&#39;s chilling--because factions of the government DO.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no idea what Icke&#39;s views are. As for Redfern, he played it pretty even-keeled, never revealing his own belief-system as he let the documents from the Collins Elite speak for themselves.</p>

<p>I myself was fascinated by how the Collins Elite got into the X-Files business. It started randomly enough--just doing a standard background check on a scientist suspected on espionage. In this case, the scientist was founder of Jet Propulsion Laboratories Jack Parsons. A brilliant chemist and physicist, he dabbled in alchemy on the side. He started trying to replicate the work of occultist Aleister Crowley [who claimed to have opened an interdimensional portal]. The thing is: Parsons killed himself after allegedly re-opening the portal (in a tragic rocket accident at the age of 37). And, unlike Crowley, he never closed the alleged portal. Prior to his death, Parsons did something called the &quot;Babylon Ritual&quot;. (In Gnostic literature, the people in ancient Babylonia believed in a group of interdimensionals called the Archons.) Parsons was trying to open a rift to allow them to come in to our universe easier.</p>

<p>What was weird from the Collins Elite files was that someone there noticed that Jehovah&#39;s Witness founder Charles Taze Russell claimed to have calculated &quot;the end times&quot; in the 1870s. He said that the &quot;Age of Babylon&quot; would begin on October 2, 1914. It didn&#39;t fail to escape the Collins&#39; Elites notice that Jack Parsons was born on October 2, 1914. Parsons referred to himself as &quot;The Antichrist,&quot; so it&#39;d be bizarre if the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses were right after all, lol.</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting is that Parsons was right there in Roswell, New Mexico when the whole alien incident took place in 1947. He also knew Kenneth Arnold, the dude who coined the term &quot;flying saucer&quot; after a 1947 encounter. All roads, in the weirdest way, lead back to Parsons.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fascinating story.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: Parsons was like a Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon for weirdness: a cynosure of a lot of disparate threads that funnel back into one point. One of his friends at the time of &quot;trying to open the portal&quot; was founder of Scientology L. Ron Hubbard. Evidently, Scientology is based around a lot of the same belief systems. Who knew?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just listening to Stan Deyo the other day and he was talking about CERN and the LHC. They were theorizing as to why so many different groups would be interested in pouring billions of dollars into that project. What&#39;s the payoff? Looking for the god particle and advancing science is the cover story but people don&#39;t put billions of dollars into something that isn&#39;t going to payoff in some way. The Scientists at the LHC are trying to open a worm hole. Its going to be extremely small and the rumors that it will spawn a black hole that will swallow the Earth aren&#39;t true but Deyo believes that theres a group of people with the same thought as Parsons. That they&#39;ve been working with these inter dimensional beings and they&#39;re trying to figure out a way to open a portal to their universe. Which is not a good idea.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I saw that, too. There&#39;s an alleged whistleblower who claims that it has to do with interdimensionals. He said that the &quot;dark Archon energy&quot; being produced actually had sinister effects on the first university where they were doing experiments in the 1950s on anti-matter. Suddenly there was a spike in murders and rapes, and it had to be suppressed in the media. Afterward, they took the facility to a military base underground because it was deemed too dangerous for the general public.</p>

<p>He said that messing with anti-matter had a weird effect. It was the natural form of matter on the &quot;Archon&quot; side of the wall. With less than a fraction of a gram, the stuff threw out a field that subliminally affected people within a sizeable radius.</p>

<p>According to him, CERN is trying to pioneer a new method to create pounds of the stuff. Not just a gram. But <em>pounds</em>. So, hypothetically, the field thrown off is going to lead to massive psychological dysfunction (that in another age would be characterized as &quot;evil&quot;.)</p>

<p>According to the Collins Elite, the Archons--for lack of a better word--feed off of an energy we produce when we&#39;re anxious, violent, aggressive or sexual. So they try to stimulate these behaviors in us. They&#39;re manipulating our society to create these patterns to, essentially, farm us.</p>

<p>In other words, we&#39;re not the top of the food chain (though we assume we are).</p>

<p>So, according to this theory, what CERN is doing is creating a WI-FI of energy that triggers chilling behaviors in us.</p>

<p>The alleged whistleblower said that he himself had been exposed to the energy and said that he suddenly was engulfed with psychopathic and violent thoughts.</p>

<p>So he was warning people on some radio program (that I caught on Youtube), whereby he said that 1) What CERN was doing with the &quot;Higgs Field&quot; was dangerous as hell and 2) It was NOT being done accidentally, or &quot;in the name of pure science,&quot; but that we&#39;re being manipulated to do open the portal wider. To allow more of this energy to flood in.</p>

<p>If he&#39;s right--and his sci-fi logic is sound--then one could foreseeably see a triggering of violence on a global level that would culminate in World War III. (Typically, every century we have a war around now anyway. In 1814, it was the Napoleonic Wars. In 1914, World War One, etc.) 2015---- We&#39;re already slightly overdue.</p>

<p>According to the Collins Elite, the Archons are trying to trigger a war with billions dead, so that they can &quot;harvest the souls&quot;. Or, rather, energy from all the dead people.</p>

<p>They noted in all their cases, how obsessed they are with our &quot;souls&quot;.</p>

<p>And how &quot;abductees&quot; from Allied countries would wake up, saying, &quot;We have to nuke the Russians now--before it&#39;s too late!&quot; In the Soviet Union, their abductees, would wake up, raving, &quot;We have to nuke the Americans! Now!&quot;</p>

<p>Like they were setting up both sides to attack each other.</p>

<p>The end game--believes the Collins Elite--is a global cataclysm, so that these entities can harvest the--for lack of a better word--souls.</p>

<p>We&#39;re basically being farmed.</p>

He went way back in history and mentioned some biblical passages and other ancient texts that described meeting these beings and other attempts at building a portal using ancient, forgotten energy to trigger the wormhole. The tower of Soloman or Babylon was supposed to be a super tall structure with a portal on top and the height was so that as the being went further down the tower, it would acclimate to our world so that it could interact with humans. He calls them fallen angels.</p>

They were undercover cops, the ones hiding on his property, Cooper was shooting to defend himself on his own property. These cops were harassing him constantly. Sitting and watching his house. Bill Cooper must have been on to something because they fucked with him and they killed him. He was the real Alex Jones.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Cooper is on my the Mt. Rushmore. The first time I read Behold a Pale Horse I thought the dude was crazy and a liar. Reading it later in life, I was like &quot;how the hell did he know this shit in <em>1991</em>&quot;. </p>

<p>This is a must listen. The biggest shock for me this week was that BHP didn&#39;t make Osama&#39;s reading list: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w4oyP6Eq6Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w4oyP6Eq6Y</a></p>

<p>And the story about how he came out and decided to start telling people this stuff is pure insanity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. I love bill copper. I listened to his alien stuff first. And he sounds like he believes 100% of what he&#39;s telling you. He later recanted his alien stuff saying he was being fed disinfo. Takes a legit person to come out and admit they&#39;d been had and he just cared about getting the truth out and the government hates those people. Especially when they have a popular radio show and newsletter. So when he turned his spotlight on them, they set him up and assassinated him. He called 9/11 and he saw through the Bin Laden bs. He was a Martyr for Truth and not very many people even know who he is. </p>
