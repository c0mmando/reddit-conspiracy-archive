        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Lately, I can&#39;t use my cell phone because every time I make a phone call, before I even finish, a call comes in from a restricted number.  The one time I answered it a guy asked me who I was.  I asked him who he was and he wouldn&#39;t tell me, he just said who is this.  I keep the battery removed so they can&#39;t find my location.   I told my friend I was going to contact my congressman.  It&#39;s bad enough living in a police state without the Gestapo rubbing my face in it.  I&#39;m a regular white guy and have never even been to a protest.  This started after I tried to contact a law firm about something.</p>

<p>Friend:
Please take a moment and breathe.  Sending your congressmen a note about not being able to use your phone because of worries about homeland security make you look like a nutter.  Just take a beat before you send it.  Because I worry that you’re going to end up actually surveilled because of how you’re presenting yourself.  Obviously you can do what you want.  And obviously I’m not one to judge you and really won’t sit in judgement of you.  But there are times when you are hyper lucid, smart and dauntingly intelligent -and other times you sound like a raving nutter who’s become a bit unhinged.    Be clear when you communicate.  When you go from a small event that quickly blows up into a larger vast conspiracy against you - it’s hard to grasp - even for the kindest-hearted of us.</p>

<p>Me:
I already sent it.  What else is a congressman good for?  Congress already has a bill up for vote making NSA collecting of phone data illegal.  Not that it will stop them.  Somebody has to stand up to the govt at some point.  If that happens to be me, so be it.  I don&#39;t have a life anyway.  If they kill me, I&#39;ll leave it to you to make me a martyr.  I should just send the congressman my cell phone.  He has a local office so I could just drop it off.  He can see it first hand.</p>

<p>edit:  Thanks for all of the great feedback.  Glad to see there&#39;s plenty of people who see what&#39;s going on.  A lot of people like to jump on the conspiracy bandwagon, like the Alex Jones crowd, but they don&#39;t really see what&#39;s going on like some of us.  They don&#39;t know how to look beyond the facade.   And they don&#39;t know what to do, either.  I think if we stand together, speak up, slap some of our friends around to wake them up, buy some guns and hire some lawyers, maybe we can stand up for ourselves.  Although, I wouldn&#39;t count on it.   The psychopaths have been working on it for way too long.  On the other hand, with no money to leave the country, I&#39;ll be around to support anybody that needs it, with whatever I can give.  One problem is that people in America are pretty fucking stingy.  My own family, friends and relatives, except the friend referenced here, all turned their back on me when I ran out of money.  I&#39;ve got two friends in America, one in Australia, and one guy that appeared out of the blue over in Egypt, and a guy in Canada.  I&#39;m up to 5 friends that I talk to, only two of of them would fit in here, although one&#39;s too much of a pussy to make an account and upvote me, so fuck him, and call it 4 friends.  The friend in Australia would fit in here, and I&#39;m going to invite him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do you know it&#39;s homeland security calling you if they don&#39;t tell you who they are? Who are you calling? Why would they call you to ask you who you are? I sort of agree with AlwaysTurning above, it seems like you are jumping to conclusions and blowing it out of proportions. Now I don&#39;t know the whole story, but from what you&#39;ve written it seems strange to just assume that a government agency is out to get you with no real evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who the fuck else has a restricted number and all they do is ask me who I am?  It&#39;s a fusion center.  The reason I said it&#39;s DHS is because just turning it on I don&#39;t get any phone calls.  But if I make a phone call, then they call me.  Anybody can make a restricted phone call with *67, but who would have the resources to automatically call me, after weeks of inactivity, only when I make a phone call, using that as a trigger, and not know who I am?  That would have to be the govt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the biggest flaw in your story is that they have to ask you who you are. How could they specifically target you if they don&#39;t even know who you are? Looking through your comment history, and assuming what you&#39;ve said is true, you seem to jump to a lot of conclusions and are pretty paranoid believing in outlandish things. You are really quick to attack and insult others, and most of your comments are negatively down voted. You also mention, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I went to Russia in 2005...</p>

<p>I designed the software for a DARPA project, so it had target recognition, motion detection, and other cool features, such as killing anything that moves in case our troops were overrun, you could tell them to stay still, and whoever was moving would get killed...</p>

<p>I contacted one of those Scandinavian countries about political asylum, but they said I had no cultural ties to the country, like no ancestors or relatives from there. I just want to move some place quiet and away from all of the NWO bullshit going in America...</p>

<p>During the big blowout between Israel and Hamas, some time around 2006 or 7, I called the Israeli Ministry of Defense to offer some technical advice regarding dealing with the Katyusha rockets. Got right right through, told them the reason I was calling, an American working in defense, and was immediately given the fax and email for Amir Peretz, Minister of Defense at the time, who was at the Knesset, not the Ministry of Defense...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely surprised if the DHS is actively tracking you as you seem to be very vocal about your views against the USA.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thank you.  I don&#39;t have anyone to talk to, even my best friend in the world calls me a &quot;nutter.&quot;  People just don&#39;t realize how corrupt the govt is,  They don&#39;t realize we live in a police state. I wouldn&#39;t believe it either if my eyes hadn&#39;t been opened by personal experience, an ugly one at that, going back to 1998.  I went from a good salary, working at the Kennedy Space Center, and previously Boeing, to being homeless.  Regarding how the govt prevents you from working, here&#39;s a writeup I actually posted on Reddit, only to have it downvoted into oblivion by paid govt shills:  ( I swear, it seems like my internet goes down whenever I talk about what I know for a fact, but that could be just coincidence...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear about that and yeah, I get called a nutter to. People do not realize because they are too busy or do not care. We are here as a community to talk about these things, you aren&#39;t alone. Some thing may be just that, a coincidence, but I do not believe in coincidences, because of my view of the universe. Everything happens for a reason and we struggle for a reason. If the gov is shutting you down, why no go off the grid and just barter?

    <div class="md"><p>People are brainwashed and programmed not to resist.  Most people seem like they are thinking in slow motion compared to me.  They have no ability to do critical thinking.  Ignorance is bliss.  </p>

<p>I went to an evangelical church once with my roommate (I was born an atheist)  and the pastor did a whole sermon about the NWO, complete with theatrics like him dragging a huge cross across the stage.  But what were they doing about it?  Nothing other than praying.  I want to start an evangelical non profit 503c war chest fund because those morons don&#39;t realize it will take lawyers, guns, and money to prevent the churches from being burned down in the event of a totalitarian regime taking over.  If anybody wants to help start a fund, and get paid a salary, send me a heads up.  Those churches have tons of money, and something like this would actually be good for them.</p>

<p>edit:  other than having my car stolen while living at a homeless shelter, I&#39;m getting what&#39;s left of my pension, $450/month, I&#39;m in an apartment, getting food stamps, and get plenty of food from the local food bank.  My laptop was in the car when it was stolen, but the best friend I referenced sent me a macbook, which I&#39;m using now.  So, I&#39;m getting by for now on the grid.  And I&#39;m planning on a lawsuit or two against one or more entities, so there&#39;s hope that I&#39;ll end up rich in the end.</p>

<p>edit2:  I&#39;m writing a book, albeit sporadically, with my friend as my mentor.  He&#39;s an awesome mentor and was massively successful in the international TV market and multimedia, former top Disney executive, has his own company in LA, and that&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve got going for me.  I also had a top Hollywood literary agent at one time, so I&#39;m technically a writer anyway.  So that&#39;s a backup plan in itself, which is nice.</p>

I just stay in my room and watch videos of Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins.  Ironically, I know more about the bible than most Christians.  I told my roommate that Jesus ain&#39;t coming back, unless I&#39;m fucking Jesus, because Jesus said he was coming back in the lifetime of the disciples.  It&#39;s in the bible.  My roommate just said no it isn&#39;t, no it isn&#39;t, no it isn&#39;t.  Well, go get a bible you dumb fuck.  I live in Alabama so being an atheist puts me in the minority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand that sentiment. I&#39;m not religious, I was once a Catholic. God/Creator is strange, and I&#39;m spiritual. I frankly think the Creator is less caring than they believe (more deist) I believe in intelligent creation, but not religion. As far as I know, Christianity was created by the Flavian&#39;s of Rome to qualm the Jewish revolts. Was Jesus real? I think he was a philosopher, and if if you read the words, you can better yourself and the world. He is not a savior, but a consultant, lol for a lack of better words.</p>

<p>Many of the founding fathers were deists, Jefferson, Thomas Paine, probably George Washington, Franklin, come to mind, and despised Christianity.  People like to say America is a Christian nation, but Thomas Jefferson said otherwise in the Treaty of Tripoli.</p>

I&#39;d buy some them a couple drinks, but there was only a couple guys with any sense, and other than one guy I ran into at the bus station last week, can&#39;t get in touch with any of them.  Most of them I couldn&#39;t stand to be in the same room with for more than 5 minutes, anyway.  One guy was reasonably sane, until he got drunk and would swear that he was Jesus, and singlehandedly prevented WW3 off the coast of Cuba when he was in the Coast Guard.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. Ok dont worry about this.</p>

<p>This is part of &quot;fifth generation warfare capacity&quot;. They have been testing these systems for weeks now. I think we are in the middle of &quot;cyberwar&quot;.</p>

<p>They were cutting off encrypted connections to China/Russia, disrupting VPN and doing DNS packet attacks. They choose a target for a few days, deploy a capacity and then they see what he person does and if they circumvent it or who they flee to for help or if they go to social media. </p>

<p>It should end in a few days. Definitely complain to senator.</p>

<p>They do things like target person and then they post something on social media, then they can use that to have person committed, then hospital charges than for $6000 or other bullshit. Event chaining, advanced capacities, augmented reality games.</p>

<p>Tell your friend to fuck himself. If someone attacks you, rip their testicles out and gorge their eyes out. Make an example out of them. Inflict the most damage possible. Minimize the damage they can do to you, get google voice, setup VOIP, spread word, document what they are doing and how they are doing it. Create a wiki, find out people experiencing similar capacity tests, document it.</p>

<p>Then switch off systems they can disrupt. Make it as expensive and annoying as possible to target you, then strike back. Maximize the cost to them. </p>

<p>The key is to tell them to fuck themselves. If they commit you tell them to fuck themselves, document it, threaten to sue anyone who bothers you, lawyer up and point out that you would not be complaining about this bullshit if they were not fucking with your phone.</p>

<p>Dont sue companies, sue people. Make it painful for them. There is no &quot;America&quot;, there is no &quot;Israel&quot; there is no &quot;government&quot;, there is no &quot;CIA&quot;. These are groups, badges, imagined communities. If someone attacks you, they are your enemy, not the abstract organization or group they belong to. If police beat you or take your shit, the individual must be held accountable for their behavior, not some abstract institution. Groups and gangs, chains of command and software systems are used to diffuse and eliminate responsibility. Police think twice about harassing someone or being assholes if they know it means their ass personally will be dragged into court for twenty hours. </p>

<p>Physically threatening people is no-no, especially for people with guns. However, suing them and tying them up in court and psychological warfare, imposing resource costs and being a brat works well.</p>

<p>Also, determine what the other side wants. Many people are harassed by people who have small penises. In military/defense contracting and software, there are people who have micro penis and will attack people for no reason. They roam around looking for people to bother. One person was harassed and through it was official and government and that he was going to die, when its just some passive aggressive people with shrunken penis syndrome. </p>

<p>Also, going to senator is very good solution. Send him $500. One person was on no fly list for harassment and had donated senator $5000 last year. He called their office and the senator&#39;s staff sent a nasty letter to the FBI and the FBI said &quot;We checked the wrong box by accident, sorry&quot;.</p>

<p>The police or DEA will not go after children in rich neighborhoods. They could be selling 40 kilos of marijuana or joining a gang and selling meth, but the DEA does not want to deal with the parents going to judge, lawyering up and dragging them into court. If they dont get overtime pay for it, they will avoid it. Angry letters from senators looking into what they are doing or lawyers challenging all their evidence and taking up their time/money is another thing. They would rather just cut a deal and do fine. They like quick arrests of poor people, where they arrest them, they confess and its done deal. </p>

<p>So at burning man, if you are caught with drugs, they just give you $1000 fine and you can mail it in. They dont bother rich white people.</p>

<p>It takes five agents to harass someone and costs $60,000/year to imprison someone. So you are facing, low cost, automated harassment and now you need to impose a financial, reputation or time cost on attacker.</p>

<p>Also, record, take evidence. Then get lawyer and suponea phone company for records, find law stupid. There is one page form. If they say its national security, go ballistic, goto the EFF/ACLU, drudge report, media, about how communist/pedophile/terrorists are not only watching everyone masturbate with NSA surveillance but are harassing people. Make a scandal.</p>

<p>If you have no assets or anything to steal and live with your mother and they harass you and its the CIA. Go print up some articles about CIA pedophilia rings and cocaine smuggling in Mexico or running drug cartel, then poster them around town.</p>

<p>Then they have to respond to that. It takes you 5 minutes to print out 500 posters and then they have to spend a week and three people. </p>

<p>Being a victim will not get you mercy. People know that victims are victims because they deserve it. &quot;Oh pity me, I am being harassed and all these bad things are happening to me and someone should save me and this just should have mercy on the weak&quot; is what they want. They want learned helplessness, that is the objective of harassment. The correct response is &quot;If you attack me, you have made yourself my enemy and I will destroy you or damage you in any way possible&quot;.</p>

<p>The law does not matter. Arguing from law or principals or on their terms is a losing game. &quot;I am weak, have pity on me judge&quot; is a losing game. That is slave mentality and oppression only works as long as people are in that mentality. Law and morality is on the side of the strong. </p>

<p>When police beat your or harass you, there will be a complaint system. The system is within their world and designed to be ignored and control the process. You have to go outside of the system. Instead of going to the police to report the police harassing you, go to mayor, community organizers and the DA about &quot;gangs of homicidal, roid raging police officers harassing teenagers&quot;. Send a letter to the officer&#39;s mother that you forgive her son for being a thug. Go start a blog and make sure it shows up top ranked in Google. Sow chaos.</p>

<p>Police and law enforcement will harass and beat environmentalist and peace activists. They will just go in there and beat the shit out of them. They wont even get within 20 ft of anarchists, because they are unpredictable and will fight back. Armed groups and gangs will pray on the weak. They will devour the sheep, but they avoid groups that are strong and psychologically and physically prepared to play tit-for-tat.</p>

<p>If there is one person, then a group of one or three people can harass them. Three police will not harass ten anarchists. They will need to call in 60 police, or will leave them alone. Groups only fight when they have overwhelming advantage and there is no risk of being hurt or the other side fighting back.  People are weak in the west, because they do not have any social support. They do not have friends, a family, a religion or any community organizations. They are individuals pitted against a group. Keeping people atomized and preventing them from organizing collectively is one of the most important ways of dominating them.</p>

<p>That is how passive resistance succeeds</p>

<ul>
<li>you evade them, so they cannot retaliate against you</li>
<li>you build up a large enough group that they cannot arrest or bother everyone</li>
<li>you impose resource costs on them (reputational costs, time costs, financial costs) </li>
</ul>

<p>If something you do takes 1 minute and takes up 60 minutes of their time, then you can do a resource exhaustion attack. You tie up their resources. </p>

<p>Another example, some senators were being harassed by CIA for interfering with their drug smuggling and funding both sides of a civil war in some country. So they threatened him, did harassing phone calls.</p>

<ul>
<li>One senator whined for secret service protection and they declined and he was scared and had to cave in</li>
<li>Another senator got a .357 Magnum and wear body armor everywhere and got sworn into the air marshals so he could carry his gun on the plane. He made it clear that he was going to shoot them in the face and would not back down. That forced them into a compromise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, police in Texas will pull off someone random, but if they see a gang insignia on a truck for a Mexican gang, they are just going to say &quot;not worth it&quot; and just let them go by, even if they are speeding and smoking marijuana. </p>

<p>The first thing they will do when they attack you, is try to cut you off from social support, from financial support and try to make you feel helplessly and isolated. Building up social support is critical and cutting yourself off from people that pull you down, then building up communities and resources to strike back at your attackers. When a group is attacked, they need to rally for war and destroy the threat. They only attack losers who cannot fight back.</p>

<p>Countries, groups, gangs, laws are just abstract things designed to enslave and legitimatize domination. No one in the government follows the law. The police dont read it, neither do judges. Its just a bludgeon to be used against the weak. Its a controlled environment where the other side can lie with impunity, but if you lie you are punished. Where their word is taken as truth, regardless of their incentives and history of lying and wherever you must prove each and every assertion. Its a threatre. </p>

<p>In other words, act like a sociopathic. Learn to enjoy inflicting pain on your enemies. Do not shy from the fight.</p>

<p>Google</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Direct Action&quot;</li>
<li>Fifth Generation Warfare</li>
<li>Psychological Warfare </li>
<li>&quot;Might Makes Right&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Be a wolf, not a sheep. Dont whine. Destroy your enemies. Make an example out of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is some awesome information.  I actually do most of that already.  I have created a dead man switch in case I&#39;m abducted where several friends will send info to the media and alternative media in case of my disappearance.  I fought a battle with the police state in 1998 when I filed a complaint against against the school district on behalf of my kid and was attacked by the evil incarnate conspiracy that is city hall and quickly got charged with &quot;police harassment.&quot;  Long story short, I defended myself in court, pleaded guilty, got probation with no conditions (impossible to violate) and $3k in fines which vanished if I didn&#39;t pay them in one year.  In other words, I got a good judge, older lady who was well aware of police shenanigans, when the school district decided to sic them on me.  The judge did that so the police thought they fucked me, when I actually walked away free.  There&#39;s a lot more to that story, got fucked over by the district attorney, CA dept. of Justice, Dept. of Edu., and my stupid fucking cunt ex-wife, who was a no-show at the big hearing, who had a dead end job only two blocks away, and was ultimately the one who sank the ship.  I was kicking the shit out of city hall, but was done in by friendly fire.  Wait for the book.</p>

<p>edit:  I&#39;m saving your comment in a text file.  It&#39;s good info.  I might use it in my book.  I&#39;ll give you credit.</p>

<p>Just get out of the United States. There are people who are stockpiling weapons and ready go to war for Jesus and &quot;Defend the American way of life&quot; and I am like &quot;Let them him this shit hole&quot;.</p>

<p>The food supply is so polluted with endocrine disruptors that men are changing gender and have gender identity issues (same issue in fish and amphibians). Instead of fixing the problem, we promote transexuals in the military.</p>

<p>The women are fat and miserable. The people are brainwashed. The air, water and food is polluted. The government is corrupt. The rulers, are terrorist, pedophile, Nazis who came to power by staging a terrorist attack on US citizens, engaged in trillions in theft from the public and murdering/threatening/blackmailing their opposition.</p>

<p>The US has had negative GDP growth for almost two decades. In China every&#39;s wealth is doubling every six years and they are complaining that they are only going to do 6 to 8% this year.</p>

<p>In Brazil only 9% of women are overweight and in the US its over 60%.</p>

<p>The propaganda does not tell people about the rest of the world. What I found out, is that everything is better somewhere else, but media will not tell you that.   The US is just a nation of slaves to be extracted by a corporate elite. It is a market. All of the production and money is offshore. There is nothing here. Now the new plan is to destroy the economy after it has been looted completely, privatize water/food/communication/transportation and hike the rates to suck out anything they can.</p>

<p>They are going to &quot;normalize the wages&quot; with the third world. The old, the poor are useless for taxes, generates no revenue and is just a mob that needs to be controlled. So they are going to sterilize, genocide, destroy them. Maybe ebola, maybe a race war, maybe starvation.</p>

<p>They are putting in place FACTA and biometrics to ensure that each citizen (slave of a particular nation state) cannot emigrate, cannot flee or escape fleecing. The whole thing is bullshit.</p>

<p>The CA DA are corruption. They have guns and meth put on people to arrest them. They work for the mob and drug cartels. I know someone who was harassed by DA through the wife because he got involved with mafia bullshit. The women and family courts are just there to control the men. They went to her with a thing about planning divorce, how to fleece person of assets, gave her that book, walked her through it, pushed her through it and then told her she would get more money if she told the judge he threatened her with a knife. Then made up whole story (was coached and pushed into it), just so they could threaten him with jail, to hold it over head and for security clearance bullshit. Then she tried to step out because she didnt want him to go to jail (the DA did parallel prosecution that the gf didnt want to be involved in) and then the DA told her if she did does not go with story or recants testimony, she would throw her in jail for perjury. The women/family court system is just for controlling men.</p>

<p>San Francisco is Babylon. California is the most corrupt, socialist place and pinnacle of corruption and decay.</p>

<p>Just get the fuck out of the United States, before they put in place biometrics and start doing exit Visas. Goto Asia or Latin America. Just flee.</p>

<p>You will be healthier, happier, richer, have a better sex life and you will be able to accept the world for as it is, instead of dealing with the hypocrisy of what the law and America pretends to be vs reality.</p>

<p>I am in California and I combed it up and down and saw the top and the bottom and I concluded that there is nothing here. Its going to look like Detroit soon. The whole economy is FED money circulating around, surrounded by ghettos.</p>

<p>In the richest, nicest part of the Country (where I am now). On the beach, it is sterile, dying. You can see the thirst for annihilation in people&#39;s eyes. There are no children and no one under 40. People struggle to get by, the are miserable, sexually frustrated and life is meaningless. It is a gilded nightmare.</p>

<p>Within 24 months, this place will burn to the ground. It will be like Detroit. Just escape.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck, you are so right on, man.  I&#39;m in AL at the moment, never thought I&#39;d end up here.  I have two sons in CA, 27 and 30, who don&#39;t give a fuck about me, or care if I&#39;m alive, unless I come into money.</p>

<p>I went to Russia in 2005, expected it to really suck, but had the best time of my life.  Had an awesome hot young girlfriend who blew my mind in bed, and I&#39;ll skip the pun, she was awesome at that as well.  I even brought her over here for a visit, but had to send her back because I had no job.  Had invites to visit other Russian women, which is a guaranteed fuckfest, beautiful high class women,  all smoking hot, one was an MD and a captain in the Army, one was an MD with big tits, one was a lawyer, and one was a concert pianist with a PhD in music, and was the director of a ballet academy that won 1st place in world competition, and was a fucking celebrity in Russia, and is a concert pianist in Philly now.   I was in my 40s at the time, and they were all 10+ years younger than me.  One girl told me she had a pair of handcuffs.  All fluent in English.  I don&#39;t fucking waste my time with American women at all.  Too much trouble and I&#39;d rather just do without.  And I didn&#39;t see a single fat chick over there.  At the Moscow airport, I was sure there was a supermodel convention in town.</p>

<p>And, you&#39;re right about corruption in CA.  It&#39;s not just corrupt from top to bottom, it&#39;s right in your face if you have to deal with it.  Like, oh... that case you had, yeah we decided to bury it so go fuck yourself. And if you don&#39;t take the hint, they will fuck you up, put you in prison, or find an excuse to shoot you.  The way I dealt with them was to act dumb and crazy and predict what they were going to do next, which saved my ass several times.  They&#39;re not that clever, but they&#39;re used to winning, and they hit really fucking hard.  The trick is, when they hit you, go down and stay down.  They will walk away and assume you won&#39;t won&#39;t come back, because nobody ever does.  Then you get up and hit them from behind.  Then hide.  Then my cunt ex-wife got me locked up on a 3-day hold.  I got out of CA and got a job in FL on the beach.  It was a little bit quieter down there.  I was in SoCal from 1980-2000 and couldn&#39;t believe how much housing was put up in that time.  Way too fucking crowded now.  Although, the air was much, much cleaner in &#39;00 than it was in &#39;80. You could only see the mountains 1 day a month in &#39;80.  Now you can always see them.  I used to go hang gliding out there, and raced speedway bikes for a few years, 500cc, ethanol fuel, and no brakes.  Yeah, I&#39;ve gotta scar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sociopaths protect the group. They harm and destroy the enemies of the group, that more egalitarian people are unable to handle. Groups without sociopaths, end up being fleeced and enslaved, by people willing to use force and coercion against a population which is unwilling to fight back.</p>

<p>It is when there is an &#39;imagined community&#39; like a nation where people say &quot;we are all in this together&quot; and there is really a group of sociopaths which is an elite and its in-group and then sheep (which are there to be fleeced), that you get these problems.</p>

<p>If the leaders are instilled with genuine sense of obligation and belonging to the group they administer, then the group can improve as a whole. If you have parasites, like currently run western civilization (~30 families, who are increasing non-representative of mass society), then you get suicide of the culture and civilization itself.</p>

<p>Then people realize that the group in control is a different group, then they perceive the actions of that group as an attack. Then they destroy the threat.</p>

<p>The public needs to be constantly distracted (ebola, boogyman, terrorism, communists) to keep the rulers in power, once they become parasitic.</p>

<p>So sociopathy has important part to play. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not violence. Violence should be last thing, if the other thing does not work.</p>

<p>What I am telling you to do, is to think and act like the FBI and police. They act like thugs because it works.</p>

<p>You should not thug people, but you should be thug enough to protect yourself against getting thuged. If you cannot protect yourself against thuggery, non-violent and passive resistance does not work because you just get thugged. Passive, defenseless political groups are always destroyed by getting thugged. That is the lesson of history they dont want you to know.</p>

<p>What people do not understand is that society is held together by violence. Its an unfortunate but true part of reality. In general, you want the police on your side and the judges and you want it to be &quot;us vs them&quot; and the other side will try to drive a wedge between the police and public and drive a wedge between blacks and whites, and between men and women. They will divide and conquer.</p>

<p>They want to destroy any group that is powerful enough to challenge them, by subdividing the groups in society and pitting them against each other. That is why the federal government is flipping out over &quot;Sovereign Citizens&quot;. They go to the police and make an agreement, &quot;The government is retarded, so lets just ignore it and wont enforce XYZ&quot; and so on. So the local judge and sheriffs wont enforce illegal IRS tax liens, so the federal government wants to destroy the group and label them as a terrorist threat.</p>

<p>So they are copting the police rather than fighting them. So then the ruling elite come in and they need to make police believe &quot;Soveign Citizens are terrorist who murder police&quot; and create propaganda, when they are just people who want to return to rule of law and legitimate government.</p>

<p>The majority of sovereign citizens are actually law enforcement officers, but the FBI says they are the &quot;largest terrorist threat in America&quot;. So they are federalizing the police and bringing in foreign troops from Europe to police the US. To maintain federal power. Then you have a government that 95% of the population does not support, so you need to disarm the public, they are dependent upon the government for protection and so any revolting slaves can be crushed.</p>

<p>The whole thing is retarded. Groups and powers can compete and fight each other. The individual does not have much choice or power of influencing the struggle, so the only option for the individual is to leave.</p>

<p>So you have people leaving and now the US is pushing for biometrics on the border exits and eventually for exit Visas. They dont want the businesses fleeing to lower tax areas or moving assets where they cant be seized, so you have things like TPP and FACTA/GACTA.</p>

<p>Prepare your anus. The TSA was just the start. It is going to look like East Germany in a few years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is lots of choice. Stop supporting the system, divest from it completely. Secondly if you know who you are in the system you can remove yourself from it and not be bound by its devices. The only reason the state of things have gotten as far as it has is because:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>people dont know their status within this system (I.E The system treats people within the system as slaves)</p></li>
<li><p>people have allowed themselves to be deceived into exchanging rights and freedoms for benefits and privileges. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that the system is collapsing the controlling forces have to manipulate their chattel into subscribing to a new and improved system of control by using fear and intimidation. </p>

<p>If you dont by into it and withdraw from this system, stop paying them to exploit you then that system will collapse no matter how much violence happens.</p>

<p>If you try to fight fire with fire you will lose because they have a monopoly on violence and have a monopoly on the perceptions though the media.</p>

<p>Your best bet is to stop supporting the system and work with people on a small scale using guerrilla tactics. The system is weak in a lot of areas that we can apply pressure to.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly. It would be easy to kill them all, but its just not worth it. The people who could use violence are not interested in it. What is the point of saving someone else&#39;s sheep from another wolf?</p>

<p>What good is a Jesus wolf who tries to &quot;save&quot; the sheep from the other wolves? He is just meddling in other people&#39;s business. What business does someone have trying to free someone else&#39;s slaves. The slaves would bleat and plead until they found another master. The wolves leave each other alone and are concerned with their own issues, not politics.</p>

<p>Politics is the slave bleating for better treatment from his master. The master is just a slave who has stricken down his oppressor.</p>

<p>When some idiot goes around and tells all the sheep the ways the rich dont pay taxes and how the tax code doesnt make any sense and is full of holes, they go and make an example out of him. If he were merely exploiting what is in front of him, for his personal gain, no one would care and people would even congratulate him on his cleverness and genius. However, when he goes around trying to free other people&#39;s sheep, then he has a problem.</p>

<p>It has no benefit to him and it is simply meddling in other people&#39;s affairs. That is what activists do and that is when the FBI gets sent out to bootjack them and shut them down. I am 100% sure you can do almost anything and no one cares. No one even knows you are doing it, unless you are an idiot. The CIA smuggles drugs and who cares? Who is going to stop it? Who is going to know about it? Who is going to stop it? Why would anyone even mettle in their business anyways? The only reason drug dealers are arrested is because they are competing with state sanctioned drug dealers. So it is about restricting supply and keeping the price high for the insiders, through a government cartel. It is impossible to actually arrest or fine the people running the cartel because there is no evidence it even exists, anymore than people can prove who did 9/11. That is how society is run now at the top level.</p>

<p>When you begin looking at clandestine operations, you realize that the state is completely helpless in absurd ways. Power is a myth. The world is really anarchy. The law doesnt exist, there is only enforcement. No one even follows the law and district attorneys just pull things out of their ass to arrest people once they become someone there is pressure to go after.</p>

<p>Life is cheap and companies have people killed all the time and its legal. Police are like &quot;this clearly was not a suicide, but oh well, suicide&quot; and just wonder who you pissed off and say &quot;shouldnt have pissed whoever off&quot;. Bribes are not bribes, they are consulting fees, political contributions, gifts or donations to the non-profit of a wife. The law is flexible and can be changed for anyone with money. </p>

<p>You can even have drugs or guns planted on people and just pay police in California to have people thrown in jail. Its ridiculously cheap and everyone does it.</p>

<p>There is literally infinite money. Money is not scarce. The majority of people spend all their time trying to get money, to live, to eat, but its just illusion. Above a certain level, there is infinite money. Twelve trillion dollars go missing and no one cares or notices. Money gets created out of air in a database and then a few decades later some bank goes under and people shrug and say &quot;oh well&quot; and then the government insures the loss.</p>

<p>There are literally people and they sit down and say &quot;This is worth $500 million&quot; and its worth by fiat and its worth what they agree its worth and then take a 2% loan out on it and buy corporate bonds at 8% and then insurance them for lossless return of millions a year. Politics, economics, the government is just theater. Its a game and no one ever goes to jail and at worse you get a paper loss or fine, unless you did something really bad (to someone else). </p>

<p>The state has no where close to a monopoly on force. The state just chooses to avoid bothering or going after people that can claw its eyes out. There are mafia and organized crime groups, secret societies, cults, private military contractors and families which have institutionalized military power and they overlap with the state. The state has grown to include CIA drug smuggling operations, the mafia, Mexican drug cartels, private military entities and what people traditionally think of the state.</p>

<p>The state is actually just the group of wolfs and people who can retaliate with military force or symbolic or physical violence. Crevald noted that the distinction between governments forces, terrorist groups, organized crime and private security forces has completely blurred. Organized crime is incorporated as a PMC security company working for the government securing the opium harvest in Afghanistan (organized crime) on Monday and bombing &quot;terrorists&quot; (terror bombing civilians into selling homes so Enron can build an oil pipeline) on Tuesday.</p>

<p>There is no moral difference. Its the same group of people. Its the same method. Its becoming a completely false distinction. For instance, when the US drone strikes a wedding with a hell fire missile, is that any different than a road side bomb?  Its the same thing. Same reason. Same method. Drug cartels use the military drone fleets to kill third world poppy farmers, to control trade flows.</p>

<p>This is a neoliberal war. Its war beyond the nation state, after the labels break down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At some point (late in the game) when I started receiving harassment by government agency employees/associates I contacted Ron Wyden. Even though he never responded to me directly, I knew that he had my back. </p>

<p>I will caution you against contacting regional law enforcement and the FBI about stalking and harassment from government agency employees. When I originally did this it lead to an even <em>higher</em> volume of unwanted attention and retaliation by informants, undercovers, community policing groups, security workers, and other folks. The people that were tracking me tried to paint me as a paranoid schizophrenic, a pervert, a fraud in my professional career, and a range of other nonsense that was simply not true. Most LE will not know what is actually going on because it&#39;s fairly rare to experience what you describe, and they are used to dealing with other types of crimes. </p>

<p>Most people will think you are crazy and it&#39;s almost impossible for people to empathize with a series of ongoing circumstances that sound like they are out of a crappy espionage novel. If you have no criminal background, have committed no crime, have no criminal intent, do not keep criminal associates, and do not contribute to criminal activity I recommend you keep your head straight and try not to let them get to you. It is not an exaggeration to say that if you piss the wrong person off they will try to institutionalize you, incarcerate you, or decimate your life potential. It happened to me. There are other stories of this happening plastered around the internet. </p>

<p>I will also caution you that depending on how much attention you are receiving, there may be a LOT more people keeping tabs on you than you are aware of. I eventually discovered that it is futile to protect your privacy if someone wants to know what you are doing. My laptop was being monitored, my emails from up to 2 years prior were being read, I was/am being followed around by vehicle and foot, all of my phone calls were being intercepted, and my apartment and vehicle were bugged. </p>

<p>Best wishes and remember: most people that work for &quot;the government&quot; are good folks that dislike what you are experiencing as much as you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks.  I agree completely.  Actually, I find this to be such a minor annoyance, compared to everything else I&#39;ve been through, I thought I&#39;d just put a bug up my congressman&#39;s ass.  There&#39;s bigger issues I&#39;m dealing with that I wouldn&#39;t think about asking my congressman or senator to look into.  I just don&#39;t trust them.</p>

<p>If I can ever find a lawyer I feel comfortable with, I might sue somebody in order to get some compensation for having lost everything and having my life ruined.  Unfortunately, I find the ACLU to be useless, and haven&#39;t found any other attorneys to be sympathetic to my plight.  I&#39;m hoping to get in touch with one of the many organizations who claim to be fighting for freedom, such as <a href="http://www.bordc.org/">http://www.bordc.org/</a> to see if they can help me.  Too bad I can&#39;t use my phone, although I could use my roommate&#39;s, at least until they start harassing him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be careful! I have a feeling those Fusion Centers are pretty well-oiled to manufacture criminals out of thin air. It starts with software that connects people who may be in criminal networks, then monitors electronic activity collected through web usage and other means. After that someone profiles you and activates people in their network to pick apart your identity. If it goes deeper they will dissect every area of your personal life in really intrusive ways. Even if you&#39;re not a criminal, they can find things that will make you look like one. You can end up in a world of trouble for completely innocent activity and behavior. There are vast resources available to go after criminals, including a large network of human intelligence gathering that extends into neighborhoods and workplaces. It sounds paranoid, but these people want to keep their job and department funding so they have to justify it somehow. I hope you don&#39;t get any attention from the offending party&#39;s opposing groups; local militias, anti-police activists, anti-government nutters, and Anonymous can be just as bad as &quot;the government&quot;. Stay safe!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that removing the battery doesn&#39;t render a phone untrackable, but I disagree.  RFID only works at very close range, like inches, unless they blast you with enough RF to give you cancer.  Phone tracking systems, like Stingray, require the cell phone to send a signal to a cell tower which may be half a mile away.  This takes more energy than can be generated with RFID, or a tiny hidden battery, therefore I know without a battery a cell phone cannot transmit anything to a tower, even in data mode.  Also, I&#39;m an electrical engineer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is some awesome information.  I actually do most of that already.  I have created a dead man switch in case I&#39;m abducted where several friends will send info to the media and alternative media in case of my disappearance.  I fought a battle with the police state in 1998 when I filed a complaint against against the school district on behalf of my kid and was attacked by the evil incarnate conspiracy that is city hall and quickly got charged with &quot;police harassment.&quot;  Long story short, I defended myself in court, pleaded guilty, got probation with no conditions (impossible to violate) and $3k in fines which vanished if I didn&#39;t pay them in one year.  In other words, I got a good judge, older lady who was well aware of police shenanigans, when the school district decided to sic them on me.  The judge did that so the police thought they fucked me, when I actually walked away free.  There&#39;s a lot more to that story, got fucked over by the district attorney, CA dept. of Justice, Dept. of Edu., and my stupid fucking cunt ex-wife, who was a no-show at the big hearing, who had a dead end job only two blocks away, and was ultimately the one who sank the ship.  I was kicking the shit out of city hall, but was done in by friendly fire.  Wait for the book.</p>
