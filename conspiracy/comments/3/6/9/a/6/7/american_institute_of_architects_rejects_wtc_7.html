<p>Look through the list of &quot;architects and engineers&quot; that have signed up on the ae911truth site and see how many of the 2,000 plus are structural or civil engineers or architects.

<p>I&#39;m not dressing anything up, I&#39;m stating a fact, while you, in typical fashion, are twisting the story. Shills and trolls like you have been appealing to emotion like this for 14 years, it didn&#39;t work in the last decade, it won&#39;t work in this one. We&#39;re not kids any more Hudson.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, maybe the NIST report isn&#39;t quite as flawed as you think.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about what I think. The <strong>NIST reports are not and cannot be peer reviewed</strong> (for &quot;national security reasons&quot;). So by definition, they are flawed. Many people have also pointed out the problems with these reports and, as a sceptic, I&#39;m not comfortable nor interested in acting like these do not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Second, do you think the NIST report is the only investigation into building 7? It isn&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed it isn&#39;t. <strong>Many scientists have studied it and have concluded that it came down by explosives</strong>. In fact, <strong>even FEMA in their original metallurgy analysis stated that a high temperature corrosion attack could&#39;ve led to the collapse</strong>.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that a new investigation is needed. You, however, argue that only scientists in favour of the official story are real scientists, and those who go against it aren&#39;t. That&#39;s highly convenient for you, but it has nothing to do with science. It&#39;s the &quot;no true Scotsman&quot; fallacy, and it is on this fallacy that you base your belief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess 95.9 percent of the AIA membership is dishonest then.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d say ignorant of how shoddy the official report is. It takes a dishonest man to know the WTC reports and still claim they are truthful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or maybe you&#39;re the ignorant one. Have you ever even considered that? Do you think you know better than 4 thousand licensed architects? Or the hundreds of engineers that worked on the NIST report?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can state without a shadow of a doubt that I&#39;m not ignorant about the building collapses. Though undoubtedly there&#39;s a lot to be figured out from a proper investigation. I&#39;ve spent 14 years of my life on this. I&#39;m familiar with both sides, I&#39;ve read reports and papers from all sides and evaluated them best as I can. And I come to the same conclusion as many licensed engineers and architects. Can you say the same about those architects? Or do you just assume they are informed?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not going to do your homework. You&#39;ve made a claim, back it up or retract your words. I know you people love to marginalise everything without ever backing up a statement, so put your money where your mouth is and tell me how many licensed professionals you&#39;d like us to ignore.</p>

<p>Need I also remind you that there&#39;s a difference between a group of people &quot;semi-qualified&quot; (whatever that means) and a group of people of which half are fully qualified. Of course, &quot;fully qualified&quot; is probably a term you are not allowed to utter when it comes to people critical of the official story.</p>

<p>The second official investigation was done by Aegis insurance, and included collapse modelling done separate from NIST.  Guess what they found?  Yup, no explosives needed, substandard fireproofing and construction that violated several NYC building codes is all that was needed to bring the building down.</p>

<p>No, they are not, that&#39;s not a peer review. If you read the abstract, you&#39;ll realize that. In fact, just the first sentence will do.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to Section 7(d) of the National Construction Safety Team Act, I hereby find that the disclosure of the information described below, received by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (&quot;NIST&quot;), in connection with its investigation of the technical causes of the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers and World Trade Center Building 7 on September 11,2001, might jeopardize public safety. Therefore, NIST shall not release the following information:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All input and results files of the ANSYS 16-story collapse initiation model with detailed connection models that were used to analyze the structural response to thermal loads, break element source code, ANSYS script files for the break elements, custom executable ANSYS file, and all Excel spreadsheets and other supporting calculations used to develop floor connection failure modes and capacities.</p></li>
<li><p>All input files with connection material properties and all results files of the LS-DYNA 47-story global collapse model that were used to simulate sequential structural failures leading to collapse, and all Excel spreadsheets and other supporting calculations used to develop floor connection failure modes and capacities.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;The technical paper published in the Journal of Structural Engineering summarizes, but necessarily condenses, many details found in the National Construction Safety Team Act Reports NCSTAR 1A (Sunder et al. 2008), NCSTAR 1-9 (McAllister et al. 2008) and NCSTAR 1-9A (MacNeill et al. 2008) published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). However, the paper lacks references to public sources of information sufficient to verify the authors&#39; assumptions and conclusions. For example, structural calculations demonstrating the &quot;walk-off&quot; failure mechanism that hypothetically triggered the progressive collapse are unavailable. This information was placed off limits in 2009 when the NIST Director determined that release of calculations &quot;might jeopardize public safety&quot; (Gallagher 2009). If released, according to NIST, the calculations &quot;would provide instruction to individuals wanting to learn how to simulate building collapses and how to most effectively destroy large buildings&quot; (Kollar-Kotelly 2011). <strong>But the Ethical Standards for ASCE Journals are clear; technical papers are required to include &quot;detail and reference to public sources of information sufficient to permit the author&#39;s peers to repeat the work or otherwise verify its accuracy.&quot; This standard aligns with the engineer&#39;s responsibility for ensuring public safety and has nothing to do with devising ways to destroy buildings.</strong>
Although structural calculations demonstrating the &quot;walk-off&quot; failure mechanism are unavailable, many structural design, fabrication and erection drawings of WTC 7 were released by the NIST Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office and are available for those interested in studying the building&#39;s structural system. A comparison of original construction documents with details of the NIST study raises numerous questions germane to the collapse initiation. This discussion summarizes several of these questions.&quot;</p>

<p>So the blueprints, structural information and a list of all of NISTs assumptions (literally hundreds of pages worth) are <strong>not</strong> enough for skilled Structural Engineers to review their conclusions? And the NIST team are the <strong>only</strong> people on the planet capable of building an ANSYS model with that information?</p>

<p>Ooooh, sorry about that. The peer reviewers at the Journal of Structural Engineering disagree with you. And since <strong>you are not a source</strong>, and have yet to provide a <em>peer reviewed, published</em> refutation of the <em>peer reviewed and published</em> article from the Journal of Structural Engineering, it looks like you fail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument that tries to discredit AE911 on the merits of member qualifications has never made sense to me.  AE911 was specifically created to form a highly qualified panel of professional architects, structural and civil engineers, academics in both fields, as well as thousands of other engineers and architects.  You can view the list on their website:  [<a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/Petition-2000-AEs-13-09.pdf%5D(Link)">http://www.ae911truth.org/signatures/Petition-2000-AEs-13-09.pdf](Link)</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the vote really proves, in terms of factual basis of arguments.  The vote results say that an overwhelming majority of other architects don&#39;t have an interest in questioning the 9/11 events, for one reason or another.  I think most other architects do not believe it is politically possible, feasible, or desirable to discredit the official story.  It may be that doing so could open them to financial backlash - a negative press story or a customer boycott.  It may be possible that they have no interest in researching the events.  It may be possible that they have researched the events, but disagree with the AE911Truth statements.  However, a Yes/No vote loses this kind of definition.</p>

<p>However, I think that AE911Truth should continue their work, in the event that they find a breakthrough in evidence, or find a whistleblower.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Quick 15 Minute Q&amp;A with Richard Gage, AIA, founder of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth on the upcoming AIA convention campaign this weekend.  </p>

<p>Where are you?  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>We&#39;re in London right now! I will be in a theatrical performance written by Peter Neathey which has played in London about 20 times, it&#39;s called &quot;7 Seconds&quot; — I play Richard Gage and conduct a live presentation of the evidence for Building 7&#39;s key demolition features. It&#39;s a couple hours long.</strong>  </p>

<p>You&#39;re in London right now as apart of your tour, correct?  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>Yeah, we started in Reykjavik on the 11th of April and we went to Copenhagen where we were with Neils Harrit on the stage with around 150 people in attendance. Later on we presented in front of around 950 people in Amsterdam at Delft Technical University—largely students—which was great. Then we&#39;re off to Paris, Lavon, and then onto Vienna, Rome, and Budapest. Then we go straight back to Atlanta where the conference is going on with the American Institute of Architects.</strong>  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s get into this AIA stuff -- how did the 55 sponsors come to be?  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>We have more than 100 AIA members counted among our 2,300 architects and engineers. We realized we could sponsor a resolution, so we got 50 of them to sign the resolution which calls for a new investigation into Building 7. The good news about this is that they have to accept it due to our sponsors, which they did, and on May 16th in a session with 300 delegates a vote will be held. We will have the opportunity to present the evidence for Building 7 and why the NIST investigation is flawed.</strong>  </p>

<p>So you get to present in front of these 300 delegates before the vote? That&#39;s great.  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>Yes! We have 3 presenters and they get 2 minutes each, but we&#39;re a little disappointed that we do not get to actually show Building 7 coming down...we will have to describe it.</strong>  </p>

<p>Is the voting anonymous? People have been saying that if it is, there would be a better chance of it passing.  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>Well it&#39;s a visual vote, it&#39;s very open as to who is voting for what and how many voted and did not for each resolution. It could go both ways. Originally the AIA leadership from the top down bought hook line and sinker of the NIST report. We don&#39;t know what the level of openness or discussion was, so among these 300 mid level members I think we would rather have an open vote. I don&#39;t think they are going to feel any pressure that might intimidate them in voting openly for the resolution.</strong>  </p>

<p>What happens if it passes?  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>I guess it could be amended, but it would be an adopted resolution in writing on their website. I don&#39;t know what happens after that, certainly a lot of discussion and hullabaloo will ensue if it passes!</strong>  </p>

<p>Some say that this could be used to discredit the truth movement by having it rejected by the AIA, which would discredit AE911Truth and the overall message that Building 7 was a demolition and needs to be re-investigated because the NIST report is fraudulent — what do you think about that?  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>I think that&#39;s a risk that we take, you know? Anytime we speak the truth about 9/11 we run the risk of the Powers That Be discrediting or at least trying to discredit us. This is one of those risks and we thought it would be worth taking. At least at the minimum we are bringing the truth about Building 7&#39;s uniform, 7 second, symmetrical, free fall collapse, suddenly, on the afternoon of 9/11 at 5:20—which was not hit by an airplane—after witnesses hear explosions. So that information will be given to at least 300 mid level members in this open meeting and that is unprecedented. Now, if they choose to vote down the resolution I don&#39;t know what else we could do, but we are presenting at Georgia Tech that night, so hopefully more come to learn more about the controversy.</strong>  </p>

<p>My good friend goes to SDSU for Mechanical Engineering and his class was assigned to do a report on building failures and his group chose Building 7 — all of their minds have been blown...they&#39;re confused as to how it collapsed so symmetrically! Ever since your C-SPAN video and Rudy Dent things seem to have reignited. How&#39;s it going since Rudy has jumped on board? He&#39;s a former Fire Marshall, 9/11 survivor and FDNY first responder. He&#39;s very articulate and his original interview has over 1 million views on youtube.  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>(Laughter) Yeah that&#39;s a phenomenon! And we&#39;re just delighted to have Rudy on board of course, he saw Building 7 go down with his own eyes and he was on the towers&#39; pile where he lost brothers. He is quite a force for speaking the truth out there. The video with LeAnn Macadoo who interviewed him is very powerful. We have enjoyed having him on our conference calls and we&#39;re strategizing and forming new ways of getting to the fire fighters that haven&#39;t been able to speak out yet because of their own internal battles going on. It&#39;s been great. I have to go in about 60 seconds, but you can call me anytime.</strong>  </p>

<p>No problem, one more question before I let you go — recently your &#39;Solving the Mystery of WTC 7&#39; video on youtube was removed, which was at over 1 million views as your most popular video. None of your other videos were touched and it was just taken off your youtube channel — do you know anything about that?  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>I sure do. We&#39;ve been in a series of communications with Google from our attorneys and now they have hired attorneys. We want them to act responsibly and legally with respect to the arbitrary removal of our video. So far it is not going as well as we want it to, they won&#39;t even tell us specifically what copyright infringement or spam or commercially deceptive content they have claimed. Obviously they are acting illegally and arbitrarily, but we do believe eventually somehow we will get justice and force them to put it back up. They haven&#39;t taken the new one down, but of course we lost the view count which was well over 1 million.</strong>  </p>

<p>I tried to e-mail you about it when it happened, so I am glad you noticed. Just having a million views gives credibility and helps the video go viral through different youtube channels, so the fact that it was censored is not very cool.  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>They&#39;re just not responsive. A few times they have sent us some lame responses saying basically there&#39;s nothing we can do and stating their non-descriptive problems, so we&#39;re still continuing that battle too.</strong>  </p>

<p>Coming up on 15 minutes, I&#39;ll let you go now, thanks for this interview and we&#39;ll be in contact later. Have a great tour!  </p>

<p>RG: <strong>Okay. Thank you, Goodbye.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh.. They sort of did though. The north face descended essentially in free fall, indicating negligible support from the structure below. This is consistent with the structural analysis model which showed the exterior columns buckling and losing their capacity to support the loads from the structure above.

<p>Alright, so considering the above explaination is there. Would you like to actually say <em>why</em> this is physically impossible. If you bring up Newton&#39;s Laws I will start laughing uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Also, while you are at it, tell me why this is <em>better</em> explained by a controlled demolition (also throw in what devise/substance explains this). Is it the columns buckling that you have a problem with? The fact that the north side of WTC 7 was essentially just the facade for that phase of the collapse? I mean you are pedalling this idea that because it attained free-fall, that is the smoking gun. Give me a reason to belive you.</p>

<p>2.25 seconds of free fall is evidence that points to bombs in the building. NIST never recovered <a href="http://imgur.com/RKFC8H9">any steel</a> (even though the FBI had it all in a special section of Staten Island before being shipped off to China) from b7 and didn&#39;t look for evidence of explosives nor are they qualified to conduct an crime scene investigation.</p>

<p>Ehh.. Again, yes they did. And what makes you think that a group of engineers investigating the collapse of a building need to be trained to operate in a crime scene? Your timeline is also way off, NIST had no part in the initial handling of the wreckage.</p>

<p>Because NIST doesn&#39;t have a tape with a loud noise on it, they ruled out controlled demolition and took 7 years to reach this conclusion?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERhoNYj9_fg">WTC 7: Sound Evidence for Explosions</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is ample evidence, from both witnesses and recordings, of explosions associated with the destruction of World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7). NIST sidestepped investigating explosions and explosives by setting up an artificially high threshold of interest. They swept aside any testimony or recordings of explosions that would not register 130-140 dB one kilometer away. They established this criterion using RDX (one of the loudest explosives) in a scenario that produced a far higher sound level than other possible uses of explosives to bring down the building. Then they turned around and used sound level as the sole criterion for deciding whether the use of explosives was a credible hypothesis. By this maneuver, they sidestepped investigating the testimony of explosives or possible evidence of explosive residues. This is just one more instance of fraudulent behavior on the part of the NIST investigation of the World Trade Center disaster.  </p>

<p>building 7 with 25 central columns and 58 perimeter columns.  Who knows how long it took? </p>

<p>A CDI site reports that after four months of study by associate contractors:  </p>

<p>CDI&#39;s 12-person loading crew took 24 days to place 4,118 separate charges in 1,100 locations on columns on nine levels of the complex. Over 36,000 ft of detonating cord and 4,512 non-electric delay elements were installed in CDI&#39;s implosion initiation system, some to create the 36 primary implosion sequences and another 216 micro-delays to keep down the detonation overpressure from the 2,728 lbs of explosives which would be detonated during the demolition.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget the fact that the &quot;official story&quot; combustion cannot account for the VOCs measured by the EPA at Ground Zero.</p>

<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10669-008-9182-4</a></p>

<p>&quot;The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb.&quot; &quot;EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Regarding the large-scale finite element analysis using ANSYS, <strong>it appears that the failure criteria for the slab may underestimate the true performance and be responsible for initiating the failure</strong> (although failure limits used for the studs are not clear in the report). Concrete strain limits of 0.15% in tension or 0.4% in compression are applied at the slab mid-depth, <strong>after which the slab element is completely removed from the grid</strong> (p.487). For slab elements near beams, <strong>this removes the lateral support to the beam.</strong> When the beam subsequently buckles, <strong>it is also removed from the analysis.</strong> Failure then progresses. <strong>This is quite unrealistic.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>In other words, when the model slabs received 0.15% tension/0.4% compression, NIST completely removed them from the model. This <strong>&quot;unrealistic&quot;</strong> removal then causes the beams to <strong>&quot;unrealistically&quot;</strong> buckle. When the beams <strong>&quot;unrealistically&quot;</strong> buckle, they are also completely removed from the model. This <strong>&quot;unrealistic&quot;</strong> removal then leads to the <strong>&quot;unrealistic&quot;</strong> progression of failure.</p>

<p>How <strong>&quot;unrealistic.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Does yours read &quot;Structural Fire Response and Probable Collapse Sequence of World Trade Center Building 7 Volume 2&quot;?<br/>
I ask because on page 598-607 it goes over Probable Collapse Sequence and then goes on to Other Possible Hypotheses. It doesn&#39;t mention or explain 2.25 seconds of free fall?</p>

<p>I hope you feel NIST should explain why they started the 5.4 seconds of collapse time at frame 16? You can scrub the video back and forth to your hearts content but it doesn&#39;t show any progressive movement after that until frame 60. <em>You can verify this yourself.</em> It&#39;s like they wanted to match the 5.4 sec they got from the model to the video and had to back it up to frame 16. That&#39;s my bet.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Although members of the 9/11 Truth Movement had long been pointing out that this building descended at the same rate as a free-falling object, or at least virtually so, NIST had long denied this. As late as August 2008, when NIST issued its report on WTC 7 in the form of a Draft for Public Comment, it claimed that the time it took for the upper floors – the only floors that are visible on the videos – to come down “was approximately 40 percent longer than the computed free fall time and <strong>was consistent with physical principles.”</strong>52</p>

<p>As this statement implied, any assertion that the building did come down in free fall, assuming a non-engineered collapse, would not be consistent with physical principles – meaning basic laws of Newtonian physics. Explaining why not during a “WTC 7 Technical Briefing” on August 26, 2008, NIST’s Shyam Sunder said:</p>

<p>“[A] free fall time would be [the fall time of] an object that has <strong>no structural components below it</strong>. . . . [T]he . . . time that it took . . . for those 17 floors to disappear [was roughly 40 percent longer than free fall]. And that is not at all unusual, <strong>because there was structural resistance that was provided in this particular case.</strong> And you had a sequence of structural failures that had to take place. <strong>Everything was not instantaneous.”</strong>53</p>

<p>In saying this, Sunder was presupposing NIST’s theory that the building was brought down by fire, which, if it could have produced a collapse of any type, could have produced only a progressive collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sunder even said free fall didn&#39;t / wouldn&#39;t / couldn&#39;t happen with this collapse. Then people did his job for him and showed him that it did take place. He kind of dug himself into a hole with this one....Oops...</p>

<p>Yea.. no, that difference is so small that it does not warrant me to add &quot;nearly&quot;. The point is that it was so close to free fall that we can conclude that there was no resistance from the 80 stories below the impact zone. That&#39;s quite remarkable.</p>

<p>Basically all you wrote is nonsense.. Richard Gage and his troop AE4911Truth essentially strong armed the AIA into deciding whether to further investigate the collapse of WTC 7 and NIST.</p>

<p>They received 160 votes supporting it (they already had 100 members signed up to their group who are part of AIA), but received 4% of the vote.</p>

<p>So no, this is not some sort of test for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, although I was very interested to see what the reaction would be, especially what would have been if the vote had passed. This post would have reached the front page IMO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What should be born in mind is that the goal of the Council of Worlds war is not to unveil every lie or correct every injustice. The goal is to allow Obama to announce [the passage of Nibiru]. That said, peripheral crimes that are incidental to this process may get exposed.  The benefactors of the 911 crime are many, and include a number of individuals formerly in the Bush administration who still have tentacles into the federal bureaucracies such as the DOD and CIA. They pull strings. It is no secret that Jewish owners of the World Trade Center buildings benefitted from 911, and Jewish bankers are part of the cover-up crowd.  </p>

<p>What does it imply, that the truth about 911 was creeping into the US media last Summer? Global Research is correct in guessing that no more than Saudi involvement in 911 will be revealed should any currently classified documents get declassified. The truth about the Bush family’s involvement, and in particular Dick Cheney’s central orchestration of events, was never investigated, so cannot be declassified. Putin was threatening to release 911 satellite images during the Ukraine standoff, and all this was in process well before the October 20 announcement date was missed.  We have mentioned that the rats are starting to turn on each other, and even <strong>though 911 is not central to the cover-up, proof lies in many hands, it is likely that by this process 911 justice will result.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oooooh sorry! We would have accepted &quot;the input model data&quot; or more specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All input and results files of the ANSYS 16-story collapse initiation model with detailed connection models that were used to analyze the structural response to thermal loads, break element source code, ANSYS script files for the break elements, custom executable ANSYS file, and all Excel spreadsheets and other supporting calculations used to develop floor connection failure modes and capacities.</p></li>
<li><p>All input files with connection material properties and all results files of the LS-DYNA 47-story global collapse model that were used to simulate sequential structural failures leading to collapse, and all Excel spreadsheets and other supporting calculations used to develop floor connection failure modes and capacities.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;The 16-story ANSYS model was used to determine the sequence of events that led to fire-induced collapse initiation.&quot; - Dr. S. Shyam Sunder Director and Lead Investigator</p>

<p>&quot;NIST developed and used a series of rigorous and comprehensive models to determine the probable collapse sequence for WTC 7 &quot; - Dr. S. Shyam Sunder Director and Lead Investigator</p>

<p>You&#39;re all about quantity over quality. It&#39;s cute. But childish.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JSE was not tasked with reviewing NISTs ANSYS model. They were tasked with reviewing NCSTAR 1A, which could be done without the completed model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then their copypasta means nothing. And you literally failed to prove that the NIST report is peer reviewed. Thanks again!</p>

<p>JSE was tasked with following their own standards. Which they directly violated. You can try all you like. You&#39;ll never change this.</p>
