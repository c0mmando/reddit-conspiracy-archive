       Perhaps people downvoted because the cause was found to be a bacterial infection, rather than anything inherent in vaccines themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2015/05/12/bacteria-causo-reaccion-a-vacunas-en-chiapas-confirma-el-imss-1047.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So this issue likely points to improper procedures rather than the vaccine itself. Somehow the vaccines were compromised and caused the infection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, my reason for downvoting was your NaturalNews and Farrell sources. Both of these articles attempt to conflate this isolated case with the vaccine issue as a whole. Natural News goes as far as to claim this is some sort of depopulation test run, and that vaccines will be used in some attempt to cull the population. This childish hyperbole is dishonest and pathetic. It has no place in honest discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had you provided some sources that discussed the need for reforms on vaccine care, or potential issues with that specific vaccine's implementation in light of this eveny, discussion would be warranted. We do need to know what caused this and ensure it never happens again.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, because you instead decided to include these links that shamelessly try to discredit an important public safety measure as a whole, your post comes off as dishonest and scare-mongering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence the downvotes. But if you want to blame the shills, go for it.

       According to numerous sources (including one from the same site OP cited in their post) Mexican authorities confirmed that the problem came as a result of a bacterial infection. So far, given the isolated nature of the event, I really don't see a good reason to suspect otherwise, and I really don't see how this is evidence of a depopulation event. (Edit: Although if you have any evidence regarding this case to suggest otherwise I'll be happy to consider it)
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your citation of numerous comments from the comment section of that article, I really don't see how that is relevant. Perhaps you could advise?

       It seems you are far too emotional to engage in anything resembling an adult discussion. If your next response contains a similar level of vitriol, I will refrain from responding again. If your instinct is to spew hateful comments for a user who disagrees with you over the internet, I fear you lack the maturity to engage in any form of meaningful discussion.

       I don't see any other evidence to suggest any fault of the vaccines themselves. Do you have any? Like I said, the isolated nature of the incident indicates that the problem is localized, and thus probably not an issue with the vaccine itself. Either way, my issue from the get go was with the OP's sources dishonest framing of the event before all the information was known. Describing an issue that came about from a then unknown cause as a depopulation event is just stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I sure that it wasn't a vaccine? Of course not. I was simply expressing that the evidence suggests otherwise at the moment. If new evidence through further investigation were to present itself, my position may change. But, as of now, I see little reason to conclude that this is the fault of vaccines alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the commenters critical opinions, I still fail to see how this is evidence of anything. Have you seen an internet comment section before? People say all sorts of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I should note that I was in no way offended by your "rat" comment. I merely used it as an example for your apparent inability to converse maturely and without emotion. Even your latest comment contains a tone that runs contrary to productive discussion. If you would like to continue, please leave emotion aside and discuss the evidence.

       I say probably, because if the problem were inherent to the vaccine itself, we should see more widespread issues. Because the currently available evidence suggests an isolated incident, and testing done by those in the country has concluded a bacterial cause, it is fair to say that the evidence suggests that the vaccine itself didn't cause the issue. If contrary evidence is presented that could change, but so far, I see nothing.

       Well, I think there is enough evidence to at least tentatively take a position that the vaccine being the cause is unlikely. Judging by your emotional response to my position, I doubt you will ever allow yourself to reach this conclusion.

       In my initial response, I was sure to detail that I thought bacteria was a likely cause, not the sure cause. I'm not sure where you think I said nothing is wrong, I was pretty clear that I thought this was a concerning issue that should be investigated and addressed. Honestly, it seems like you are just angry that I don't think this works as an antivaxx talking point. It would certainly explain the tone of your reponses.

       And there we have it, the final nail in the coffin containing what little credibility you had left. A shill accusation is nothing more than a juvenile attempt at discrediting another user. Your insults, dishonest editing and now shill accusation have shown conclusively you do not possess the motivation or ability to converse like an adult. Seeing as I made a promise earlier in this thread that I would not continue to converse with you should you continue in this manner (and the conversation has run its course anyway) I would prefer to end this discussion with you now.

       Rat is an insult generally used for the purpose of calling someone dishonest (or something along those lines). Whether you agree with the severity of the insult or not, it is a personal attack (not the only one from this user in the thread I might add) and is therefore against the rules.

       I'm not offended by anything that was said to me. I want to discuss conspiracies and their merit and find it difficult to do so when users here refuse to abide by the rules. Sorry I expect a moderator to enforce rules and not congratulate the fucking user who broke them.

       There are other instances of users making shill accusations in this thread as well. Why haven't you enforced those. Here's one:

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       You can't even try to pretend that isn't a shill accusation. I don't believe in deleting posts, but does that not at least warrant a warning?
      </p>
      <p>
       But of course, I think we all know why you won't enforce it. Because you agree with those users. You moderate according to you own biases and turn a blind eye to violations that suit your agenda.

       I used that source because I tried to use one close to the source of the incident. In retrospect perhaps I should have included the English one as well. No worry though, as you aware I have provided plenty of other sources as confirmation now.

       Its been a while, so I thought you may have missed my response. You accused me of being a shill and of artificially effecting vote totals. I would like you to present your evidence, as I find your accusation insulting and without merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely you just missed my response. I would never accuse someone of being cowardly enough to purposely refuse to justify your insulting claim.

        Could you please provide your evidence that I am artificially impacting the vote totals?

       <p>
        Considering most of my comments in this thread have negative scores, I am really interested to see your theories on this. I mean, you wouldn't make such an accusation without real evidence would you? Of course not, that would be dishonest, as well as serve as an indicator of your willingness to believe things without evidence.

       Vote detective says you're lying.  1 downvote.  That's not to say your obsession as an anti-vaxxer won't draw some of the attention you expect, just that you can't cry out til it happens.  Persecution complex much?

       edit:  multiple downvotes in minutes.  someone doesn't want discussion......
