        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I would like to ask. Does questioning the official narrative of any significant event automatically make you a conspiracy theorist? </p>

<p>At what stage of degeneration is a society democratic or free when citizens are willing to accept anything presented to them? Is the lack of public interest in reopening the case due to a &quot;leave it to George&quot; mentality? </p>

<p>Are we at the point of no return? And have things always been this way and this is simply how &#39;Murica works or for the matter any system of centralized government?</p>

<p>Thanks for any informative input.</p>

<p>I should add that I&#39;m asking because I don&#39;t know if I should get worked about any of this and just keep to myself if nobody is interested in finding out the truth of the matter. If so, then why bother? Maybe all the hype that all of this will lead to some totalitarian state is just what it is, hype. Why bother fighting over something you have literally no control over? </p>

<p>The fucked up part is, if you ask the people who believe the official story, &quot;Does the US Government use propaganda to control public opinion?&quot;  Most will say &quot;of course they do&quot;, but at the same time will take an official story as truth until proven otherwise.  Once proven otherwise, they will act as though they knew all along, a perfect example would be the Snowden leak.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer: yes. </p>

<p>The official narrative of any significant event will be investigated by our democratically elected representatives and their appointed organs who have nothing but our well-being on their minds. Who are you to question it, to fact-check, to demand plausibility and accountability? For your objection to hold water, you would have to postulate a vast, monolithic conspiracy. Do you want to be a conspiracy theorist, a tinfoil-hat wearing crackpot nutjob? No? Then go back to work, and watch some TV to educate yourself on these matters before you spout your nonsense. </p>

<hr/>

<p>I recently noticed some sarcasmometers are seriously out of calibration, I got upvotes to no end in two &quot;standard&quot; subs for totally overrepresenting the official narrative of 9/11 with what I thought was cauterizing sarcasm. So here it is, total disclosure: everything above the &lt;hr&gt; is to say: fuck consensus. You were given a brain and are free to use it. Do not externalize your thinking processes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short answer, yes. It does.</p>

<p>You get this label when you accept that anyone can lie to you and probably will. This is not limited to Bob down the street; the newscaster can lie to you, the president can lie to you, your priest can lie to you. </p>

<p>If you can think of an event that you <em>know</em> didn&#39;t go down exactly like establishment said it did, you are a conspiracy theorist. This is such because someone can point to some random document, website or newscast that will &quot;debunk&quot; what you <strong>know</strong>. There will always be some voice saying conspiracy theory and that voice is likely complicit, ignorant, or another Useful Idiot. </p>

<p>Never listen to those who would tell you to not look into something. If you don&#39;t find out for yourself, you can never really know for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Always remember. Human nature is self serving. Govt is run by individuals with self serving interest. Govt admins use govt to push and support thier agendas. Mostly, those interest have nothing to do with the well being of the Country. It is about the wellbeing of the Interest Groups that put the Admin in power. Sometimes the country&#39;s best interest and the special interest overlap, that&#39;s called (bipartisan support) but it usually means the special interest are getting 100% benefit from the deal while the country&#39;s benefit is nuetral. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Questioning an official narrative does not make you a conspiracy theorist.  When you offer an alternative explanation that involves a conspiracy you are a conspiracy theorist.  In other words if you say &quot;The 9-11 Commission Report does not seem to give me enough information and I&#39;m not 100% convinced of the official story put forward&quot; you are not a conspiracy theorist.  If you say &quot;The 9-11 Commission Report does not seem to give me enough information and I&#39;m not convinced of the official story put forward <em>therefor</em> I believe that elements of our government worked covertly with Saudi Arabia and Israel to attack our own country so that we could pass the Patriot Act and go into an endless war in the Middle East&quot; you are now a conspiracy theorist.  </p>

<p>In other words, wanting more information does not make you a conspiracy theorist.  Using a lack of information to invent your own idea of what happened does make you a conspiracy theorist.  That is NOT to say that conspiracy theories are always bad or always wrong.  However, there is a big different between thinking Oswald didn&#39;t act alone and thinking that on 9-11 the planes were actually holograms.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are describing more of a conspiracy hypothesist.  </p>

<p>A theory has been extensively tested and is generally accepted, while a hypothesis is a speculative guess that has yet to be tested.</p>

<p>The term conspiracy theorist as it is used, is simply a jab at anyone who doesn&#39;t believe everything that they are told.  </p>

<p>reddit has a skewed view of it all.  </p>

<p>For instance the majority of people on this sub are technically skeptics.  The actual definition of a skeptic is </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a person inclined to question or doubt all accepted opinions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, subs like <a href="/r/skeptic">/r/skeptic</a> are devoted to questioning non mainstream opinions.  Like the ones that you find on this sub.</p>

<p>I guess my point is... Who gives a shit.  Everyone should be questioning everything, all of the time regardless of what is known or accepted.  </p>

<p>Too much time is spent trying to quantify and qualify the person asking the questions IMO.</p>
