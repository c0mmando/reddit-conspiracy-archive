       I found this on another website, but have put it in this format so you can share bits and pieces with people who are still not convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the CIA was actively working to help the Libyan rebels topple Gaddafi was no secret,
       <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/cia-sends-teams-libya-us-considers-rebel-aid-20110331-065759-284.html">
        https://sg.news.yahoo.com/cia-sends-teams-libya-us-considers-rebel-aid-20110331-065759-284.html
       </a>
       nor were the airstrikes that Obama ordered against the Libyan government.
       <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/29/world/la-fg-obama-libya-20110329">
        http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/29/world/la-fg-obama-libya-20110329
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, little was said about the identity or the ideological leanings of these Libyan rebels. Not surprising, considering the fact that the leader of the Libyan rebels later admitted that his fighters included Al-Qaeda linked jihadists who fought against allied troops in Iraq.
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8407047/Libyan-rebel-commander-admits-his-fighters-have-al-Qaeda-links.html">
        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8407047/Libyan-rebel-commander-admits-his-fighters-have-al-Qaeda-links.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These jihadist militants from Iraq were part of what national security analysts commonly referred to as Al-Qaeda in Iraq. Remember Al-Qaeda in Iraq was ISIS before it was rebranded.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the assistance of U.S. and NATO intelligence and air support, the Libyan rebels captured Gaddafi and summarily executed him in the street, all the while enthusiastically chanting "Allah Akbar". For many of those who had bought the official line about how these rebels were freedom fighters aiming to establish a liberal democracy in Libya, this was the beginning of the end of their illusions.
Prior to the U.S. and NATO backed intervention, Libya had the highest standard of living of any country in Africa. This according to the U.N.'s Human Development Index rankings for 2010.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi#mediaviewer/File:UN_Human_Development_Report_2010_1.PNG">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi#mediaviewer/File:UN_Human_Development_Report_2010_1.PNG
       </a>
       However in the years following the coup, the country descended into chaos, with extremism and violence running rampant. Libya is now widely regarded as failed state (of course those who were naive enough to buy into the propaganda leading up to the war get defensive when this is said).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now after Gaddafi was overthrown, the Libyan armories were looted, and massive quantities of weapons were sent by the Libyan rebels to Syria. The weapons, which included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles were smuggled into Syria through Turkey, a NATO ally. The times of London reported on the arrival of the shipment on September 14th, 2012.

       Now after Gaddafi was overthrown, the Libyan armories were looted, and massive quantities of weapons were sent by the Libyan rebels to Syria. The weapons, which included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles were smuggled into Syria through Turkey, a NATO ally. The times of London reported on the arrival of the shipment on September 14th, 2012. (Secondary confirmation in this NYT article) This was just three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed by the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi. Chris Stevens had served as the U.S. government's liaison to the Libyan rebels since April of 2011.
While a great deal media attention has focused on the fact that the State Department did not provide adequate security at the consulate, and was slow to send assistance when the attack started, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh released an article in April of 2014
       <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line">
        http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line
       </a>
       which exposed a classified agreement between the CIA, Turkey and the Syrian rebels to create what was referred to as a "rat line". The "rat line" was covert network used to channel weapons and ammunition from Libya, through southern turkey and across the Syrian border. Funding was provided by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Stevens dead any direct U.S. involvement in that arms shipment was buried,
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-syria-heavy-weapons-jihadists-2012-10">
        http://www.businessinsider.com/us-syria-heavy-weapons-jihadists-2012-10
       </a>
       and Washington would continue to claim that they had not sent heavy weaponry into Syria.
It was at this time that jihadist fighters from Libya began flooding into Syria as well.
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9606691/Syria-despatch-rebel-fighters-fear-the-growing-influence-of-their-Bin-Laden-faction.html">

       </a>
       And not just low level militants. Many were experienced commanders who had fought in multiple theaters.
       <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/11/isis_praised_slain_c.php">
        http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2013/11/isis_praised_slain_c.php
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. and its allies were now fully focused on taking down Assad's government in Syria. As in Libya this regime change was to be framed in terms of human rights, and now overt support began to supplement the backdoor channels.
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/world/middleeast/arms-airlift-to-syrian-rebels-expands-with-cia-aid.html?pagewanted=all">

       </a>
       The growing jihadist presence was swept under the rug and covered up.
However as the rebels gained strength, the reports of war crimes and atrocities that they were committing began to create a bit of a public relations problem for Washington. It then became standard policy to insist that U.S. support was only being given to what they referred to as "moderate" rebel forces.
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/syria-civil-war-us-will-arm-moderate-rebels-says-barack-obama-confirming-use-of-chemical-weapons-by-president-bashar-alassads-regime-8658368.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This distinction obviously has zero relation to the reality of the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview given in April of 2014, FSA commander Jamal Maarouf admitted that his fighters regularly conduct joint operations with Al-Nusra.
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/i-am-not-fighting-againstalqaida-itsnot-our-problem-says-wests-last-hope-in-syria-9233424.html">
        http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/i-am-not-fighting-againstalqaida-itsnot-our-problem-says-wests-last-hope-in-syria-9233424.html
       </a>
       Al-Nusra is the official Al-Qa’ida branch in Syria. This statement is further validated by an interview given in June of 2013 by Colonel Abdel Basset Al-Tawil, commander of the FSA's Northern Front. In this interview he openly discusses his ties with Al-Nusra, and expresses his desire to see Syria ruled by sharia law. (You can verify the identities of these two commanders here in this document from The Institute for the Study of War)
       <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Selected-Supreme-Military-Command-Members.pdf">
        http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Selected-Supreme-Military-Command-Members.pdf
       </a>
       Moderate rebels? Well it's complicated. Not that this should really come as any surprise. Reuters had reported in 2012 that the FSA's command was dominated by Islamic extremists,
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/07/us-syria-crisis-rebels-idUSBRE8B60QX20121207">
        http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/07/us-syria-crisis-rebels-idUSBRE8B60QX20121207
       </a>
       and the New York Times had reported that same year
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/middleeast/jihadists-receiving-most-arms-sent-to-syrian-rebels.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/world/middleeast/jihadists-receiving-most-arms-sent-to-syrian-rebels.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0
       </a>
       that the majority of the weapons that Washington were sending into Syria was ending up in the hands Jihadists. FOR TWO YEARS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT KNEW THIS WAS HAPPENING BUT DID NOTHING AND CONTINUED DOING IT.
And the FSA's ties to Al-Nusra are just the beginning. In June of 2014 Al-Nusra merged with ISIS at the border between Iraq and Syria.
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/10925602/Al-Qaeda-merges-with-Isis-at-Syria-Iraq-border-town.html">
        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/10925602/Al-Qaeda-merges-with-Isis-at-Syria-Iraq-border-town.html
       </a>
       In that context, the sarin gas attacks of 2013 which turned out to have been committed by the Syrian rebels,
       <a href="http://scgnews.com/the-syrian-war-what-youre-not-being-told">
        http://scgnews.com/the-syrian-war-what-youre-not-being-told
       </a>
       makes a lot more sense doesn't it? If it wasn't enough that U.N. investigators,
       <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22424188">
        http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22424188
       </a>
       Russian investigators,
       <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/09/us-syria-crisis-chemical-russia-idUSBRE9680YZ20130709">
        http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/07/09/us-syria-crisis-chemical-russia-idUSBRE9680YZ20130709
       </a>
       and Pulitzer prize winning journalist Seymour Hershhttp://
       <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin">
        www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n24/seymour-m-hersh/whose-sarin
       </a>
       all pinned that crime on Washington's proxies, the rebels themselves threatened the West that they would expose what really happened if they were not given more advanced weaponry within one month.
This threat was made on June 10th, 2013. In what can only be described as an amazing coincidence, just nine days later, the rebels received their first official shipment of heavy weapons in Aleppo.
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10131063/Syrian-rebels-get-first-heavy-weapons-on-the-front-line-of-Aleppo.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       After the second sarin gas fiasco, which was also exposed and therefore failed to garner public support for airstrikes, the U.S. continued to increase its the training and support for the rebels.
      </p>
      <p>
       In February of 2014, Haaretz
       <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/.premium-1.576083">
        http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/.premium-1.576083
       </a>
       reported that the U.S. and its allies in the region, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel, were in the process of helping the Syrian rebels plan and prepare for a massive attack in the south. According to Haaretz Israel had also provided direct assistance in military operations against Assad four months prior. Here's an archive:
       <a href="https://archive.today/qeRSZ">
        https://archive.today/qeRSZ
       </a>
       Then in May of 2014 PBS ran a report
       <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/foreign-affairs-defense/syria-arming-the-rebels/syrian-rebels-describe-u-s-backed-training-in-qatar/">
        http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/foreign-affairs-defense/syria-arming-the-rebels/syrian-rebels-describe-u-s-backed-training-in-qatar/
       </a>
       in which they interviewed rebels who were trained by the U.S. in Qatar. According to those rebels they were being trained to finish off soldiers who survived attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They trained us to ambush regime or enemy vehicles and cut off the road,” said the fighter, who is identified only as "Hussein." "They also trained us on how to attack a vehicle, raid it, retrieve information or weapons and munitions, and how to finish off soldiers still alive after an ambush."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a blatant violation of the Geneva conventions. It also runs contrary to conventional military strategy. In conventional military strategy soldiers are better off left wounded, because this ends up costing the enemy more resources. Executing captured enemy soldiers is the kind of tactic used when you want to strike terror in the hearts of the enemy. It also just happens to be standard operating procedure for ISIS.
One month after this report, in June of 2014, ISIS made its dramatic entry, crossing over the Syrian border into Iraq, capturing Mosul, Baiji and almost reaching Baghdad. The internet was suddenly flooded with footage of drive by shootings, large scale death marches, and mass graves. And of course any Iraqi soldier that was captured was executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Massive quantities of American military equipment were seized during that operation. ISIS took entire truckloads of humvees, they took helicopters, tanks, and artillery.
       <a href="http://www.news.com.au/world/iraqi-sunni-insurgents-seize-huge-cache-of-usmade-arms-and-equipment/story-fndir2ev-1226952811362">
        http://www.news.com.au/world/iraqi-sunni-insurgents-seize-huge-cache-of-usmade-arms-and-equipment/story-fndir2ev-1226952811362
       </a>
       They photographed and video taped themselves and advertised what they were doing on social media, and yet for some reason Washington didn't even TRY to stop them.
U.S. military doctrine clearly calls for the destruction of military equipment and supplies when friendly forces cannot prevent them from falling into enemy hands, but that didn't happen here. ISIS was allowed to carry this equipment out of Iraq and into Syria unimpeded. The U.S. military had the means to strike these convoys, but they didn't lift a finger, even though they had been launching drone strikes in Pakistan that same week.
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/world/asia/pakistan.html">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/world/asia/pakistan.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who know their history will remember that Zbigniew Brzezinski was directly involved in the funding and arming the Islamic extremists in Pakistan and Afghanistan in order to weaken the Soviets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officially the U.S. government's arming and funding of the Mujahideen was a response to the Soviet invasion in December of 1979, however in his memoir entitled "From the Shadows" Robert Gates, director of the CIA under Ronald Reagan and George Bush Senior, and Secretary of Defense under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, revealed that the U.S. actually began the covert operation 6 months prior, with the express intention of luring the Soviets into a quagmire.
       <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=M51ssIgLMl8C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=arnold+horelick+afghanistan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bl7g3nnYYo&amp;sig=dg3QsuSnSTUAeUrAdW8QzNtL5r4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_sz3U-6tC8OfyASrh4GYDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=arnold%20horelick%20afghanistan&amp;f=false">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The strategy worked. The Soviets invaded, and the ten years of war that followed are considered by many historians as being one of the primary causes of the fall of the USSR.
      </p>

       This example doesn't just establish precedent, what we're seeing happen in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria right now is actually a continuation of a old story. Al-Nusra and ISIS are ideological and organizational decedents of these extremist elements that the U.S. government made use of thirty years ago.
The U.S. the went on to create a breeding ground for these extremists by invading Iraq in 2003. Had it not been for the vacuum of power left by the removal and execution of Saddam, Al-Qaeda in Iraq, aka ISIS, would not exist. And had it not been for Washington's attempt at toppling Assad by arming, funding and training shadowy militant groups in Syria, there is no way that ISIS would have been capable of storming into Iraq in June of 2014.

       destabalize syria and iraq, giving justification for more weapon sales to our iraqi puppet regime and give way for future military operations in the region, also the many permanent bases we now have in the middle east is good evidence of the overall agenda. Funding to Israel is also more justified. The strategy is ultimate control and stability through years of controlled chaos.
      </p>

       I have also heard that if a civil war between the Sunni and the shiites could be triggered, it would last 100 years until one toppled the other. This is great for weapon sales and the terrorism creation sought to justify our vast military industrial complex.

       Couldn't one facet of the agenda also be the general destabilization of the middle east, and particularly Syria and Iraq, so that Iran loses any kind of real buffer between them and Israel. Kinda like how China would hate to lose North Korea since it serves as a buffer between them and western backed South Korea.

       Syria was a long long time ally of the Soviet Union which was a counter to the US's deep support of Israel. The US (spurred by the Neocons @ PNAC) has long wanted to overthrow Syria.  It was just lower on the list than the other destabilizations in the middle east that those PNAC cunts also pushed.

       I am still amazed that so many people don't even know what PNAC was. To understand PNAC you must also understand the CFR and so on but none of these organizations ever get any real scrutiny from the mainstream media. Hell they don't even touch the federal reserve.

       For sure, media pretends the politicians make policy. They categorically do not. Politicians politic ... that's all they fucking know. It's shameful that people don't know that Henry fucking Kissinger and all these ridiculous old cold war hawks turned neocon have the influence they do. This is real shit while conspiracists focus on stupid shit like bilderburg and that disinfo nonsense from the radio.

       You think too small, it's about destabilizing ANY middle easy regime
that has an industrial base and that dabbles in international politics.  Egypt, Iraq, Libya, when Syria is gone it's down to just Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in the process of keeping up an ongoing war, they siphon off more and more lunatic muslims from Europe and elsewhere. They go off to war, wipe out a regime the superpowers want gone but can't touch under the rules of war, and maybe get killed. If they don't, and they try to go home, they end up in prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for mopping up when it's all over... Well, years ago I dreamed up some really really cool smart munitions. It's all off the shelf stuff, but it'll take a few years for testing, and for the costs to come down. Really though, consider what you can do with a smartphone, and the cheap CPUs those are based around. Now imagine if those things had "teeth: so to speak. :D

       I replied to a similar comment further down, but the main goal is to establish a precedent of "terrorism" in regions that control oil production so we can secure petrodollar hegemony worldwide, without hundreds of nations across the globe being required to have billions of USD in their treasury to purchase oil, the defunct USD would surge back into the economy creating hyperinflation and a vacuum in which USD would be worthless since we have little exports to establish our credibility domestically. A secondary goal is to create a psychological fracture in all capitalist societies that enable wars to be fought to gain control over any resource under the guise of terrorism, these wars can be either international, or in the event(s) leading up to the above scenario of USD collapse, to secure the domestic population easily and with their tacit approval.

       Stir the bucket, let the population in appointed country bleed themselves dry, and let NATO come in and "save the day". 
This refined method costs money, kills people, brings fear in the population, and is easier to convert to a western style of government and control of resources.

       Path to persia. It's about regime change in iran. But the bigger strategy of destablization in the middle east on the grand chessboard is about eastern vs western world order. In the west,  It's royals and technocrats and academics who fled communist eastern europe, pushing western authoritarianism against what they see as asiatic totalitarianism. Also, the Russians supposedly don't like jewish academics and oligarchs, so they're drawn to asia. Clash of civilizations.

       There's no real goal at this point to fuck with Iran in that manner. Sure, the US will spew loads of bullshit propaganda and vile rhetoric at Iran but it's just way to complex at this point to really doing anything to Iran directly.

       As to "clash of civilizations" ... it's more akin to a struggle for dominance between Russia and the West nowadays versus some ideological differences.

       Iran is a better one to sort of "slow roast", over time it'll fall apart. But for now, and the another
3 decades, they'll make a great boogie man.

       And for anyone who thinks they can hide some huge nuke weapons factory, remember, 
any atomic pile always produces neutrinos. Just cascades of the little bastards. And you've 
got all these neutrino detectors looking for solar neutrinos, etc. They routinely subtract out
known reactor sites. If a new one crops up that's an earth source, they jot it down, put it 
up on the database, and forget about it. They're after stellar sized kabooms after all, so 
what's another tiny mega/gigawatt atomic pile in the scheme of things. ;)

       said it's about the Military Industrial Complex, but another big factor is Resources. If a country is destabilized, it is cheaper to get oil, minerals and elements out of the ground. The factions that control the resources sell them at a fraction of their price for weapons, ammunition and supplies.

       Get Oil and opium production back online and funneled to companies like Halliburton (oil) and who knows where the Opium goes. Some have accused George Soros of running one of the biggest cartels on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that many of the locals there have these "radical" ideas that they don't want foreign occupation and colonialism. Last time this happened (Vietnam war), Americans got upset that we were waging a war for companies like Halliburton so they protested. This time, Americans were fooled into thinking foreign enemies did 9/11 (which was an inside job to create support for the Middle East wars).

        Two months ago
       </a>
       I put out a post analyzing a presidential memorandum regarding amendments to the current NDAA which is relevent here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, the president removed the restrictions on providing arms sales and other support to
       <strong>
        groups supporting international terrorism
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if you've been paying attention our leaders typically do things regardless of legality and either amend ie change their laws afterwards to make it A-OK, and when you couple this OP with what they are doing in Syria
       <strong>
        right now
       </strong>
       , I don't think it's that big of a logical step and one more feather in the hypothesis cap that arlt the very least, the US helps and supports these guys who either are or inevitably become drunk eith power and become really and guys.

       I'd just like to point out that in your second source for Assange revealing that the west was behind ISIS the quote form the article is "“The IS is A Direct result of the adventurism of the West,” Said Assange." While this says they are responsible, it doesn't indicate the West being directly behind the group in the way of funding and/or directing them.

       I would really love to, but I do such reports trying to use only mainstream media sources so less awoken individuals can't discredit the sources even though they are historically and monumentally biased. Unfortunately, I can hardly find any public domain information regarding the TPP.

PM me if you could use another perspective/set of hands. These kinds of collaborations are great because (as you said) mainstream coverage of this stuff is damn near undeniable.

       This is a fantastic idea, and this sub as a whole should start collaborating on things wayyy more often. We can make this sub great again with well researched original content, as opposed to just posting random articles and youtube videos. Don't get me wrong, some videos and articles are great, but it seems to have all but replaced original content that is user sourced and well researched.

       This place is for organizing a fight against TPP. Stop being scared, do something to fight back. If people don't fight this, TPP will win. H1B Visas will replace more and more Americans. It's already happening, if you look at companies like Amazon (in Seattle), it's mostly foreigners workers (Chinese and Indian) there as contractors for a few months.

       Bravo, OP !!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still a few missing ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly that the CIA actually
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       ISIS. The same reasoning can be applied to AQ. Yes, they laid the foundation, but to say they created or even directly assisted (as in the case of the Kosovo Liberation Army) is still vague. Even if rebels which the CIA trained and armed went on to become ISIS or AQ, that can also possibly be just blowback. Would the CIA continue assisting these groups
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       their emergence ?
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/mar/11/edvulliamy.peterbeaumont">
        While it certainly did for the KLA
       </a>
       , we don't have yet proof of such direct involvement in regards to AQ or ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem with ISIS is that Assad deliberalty avoided engaging them directly, rumors go that Assad had a non-engagement agreement and was even buying oil from them. It was basically his "self-fulfilling prophecy". So again, maybe the State Dept. turned a blind eye on the ascension of these groups, in order to achieve their endgame. Hanlon's Razer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://rt.com/usa/petraeus-benghazi-attack-cia-535/">
        Benghazi was a CIA black-site
       </a>
       . This was the reason for the attack that killed Stevens. But to what purpose was it if the CIA was assisting the Lybian rebels. Was there some disagreement or intentional cover-up ?
      </p>
      <p>
       The infamous
       <a href="http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2014/07/was-camp-bucca-pressure-cooker-extremism">
        Camp Bucca, where Baghdadi was imprisoned
       </a>
       , and went from being a Muslim scholar ("bad, but not the worse") to the leader of a group deemed " too radical" for AQ itself. His "stay" in Camp Bucca is also plagued with contradictions, contradicting periods, no official reason fro detainment.
      </p>
      <p>
       And from Camp Bucca we have the final thread: al-Khlifawi, who came there to meet al-Baghdadi.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://m.spiegel.de/international/world/a-1029274.html">
        A former Saddam Intelligent Service col. he was, allegedly, the "mastermind" behind the Islamic State
       </a>
       . From "blueprints" recently uncovered, al-Khlifawi envisioned a radical Muslim state, but as organized and repressive as Saddam's regime. Religion was only a cover, a recruitment and indoctrination tool.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't know what am I seeing. Can Hanlon's Razor be applied ? For Saddam himself it certainly can. How the fuck both Assad and CIA come up with the same plan, is ISIS so meticulous as to manipulate both ? How much of the information we have is factual and not just disinformation ? Is the CIA rogue or is everything planned ? What attritions are there between the CIA and Pentagon ? Why and by whom was Gen. Petraeus purposefully ridiculed ?

       This is probably a dumb question but for me it needs answering. Why would America support the destruction of the Middle East and the ongoing chaos instead of investing and making profit off of those countries? Wouldn't this, in the long term, pay off far more than those weapon sales AND give the USA more influence and power in those countries as it converts them into capitalistic countries which is good for export and such?

       Not a dumb question at all.  It's because the military industrial complex is a vast, hideous conspiracy and feeds off a never ending series of wars.  The MIC controls foreign policy and is the #1 threat to democracy in America.  People get mad at the bankers and Monsanto, but it's the Pentagon that has the real power.  They have the guns and the technology and the CIA and won't hesitate to kill you if you get in the way, no matter who you are.  And from the perspective  of the defense industry, who is their biggest customer?  It's the Pentagon.  Also, foreign weapons sales are not as lucrative because of competition from overseas weapons manufacturers compared to the captive market of the US military.

       So good people often get confused when thinking about geo-politics. The decision makers do not act in the best interest of "america" they act in a more narrow self interest that benefits a smaller group and increases the power of a select club at the expense of the masses. To paraphrase George Carlin...you ain't in that fucking club.

       War is the biggest debt generator imaginable. And the military and banking interests profit most from this. The elite who control those industries in turn then use a fraction of their ill-gotten gains to pay for the election campaigns of politicians amenable to their interests. Thus perpetuating the cycle.

       The more I read about Chomsky, the more I am in awe of him. I mean I understand (for the lack of a better word) most of the BS around these issues, but Chomsky always brings it a few levels higher where it just seems like he can see through it all and reason with logic as well as come with detailed information to back up his claims, but always stays within a reasonable approach. It's so weird no teacher in school ever told me about Chomsky, for sure he's very left, but he's also extremely intelligent and inspiring.

       Well sadly enough that's a fact, I've always been stunned by the fact that our primary source of survival (food) is completly untouched in schools (well they did gave me 2 cooking classes), but I mean where food comes from, what it contains, which is healthy, which is not. It's only adding to my belief that schools are not educating, but simply conforming to society. Probably also the reason I never cared for school.

       A very low percentage of people pay this close attention to what is real or being "in tune" with reality around. My internal feeling is that someone has hijacked this planet a long time ago and we are here either watch or try to save it before these "so called leaders" kill it via lies and fear diversions.

       Great question, I believe the ultimate goal is global destabilization to justify constant war that is confusing for the layperson to understand the meaning of by blanketing all conflict under the banner of terrorism or "the good fight" and also to maintain petrodollar hegemony, without which our empire would immediately collapse and would send Fed interest rates and bond yields through the roof to the point of systemic global economic collapse, which is on the agenda, but only after we've secured enough resources to maintain control in a state of international political and social upheaval.

       Agreed.  The end goal is constant war.  Ever since communism was no longer the enemy, the USA needs new a new perpetual enemy to keep the profits flowing through it's military industrial complex.    The CIA is stirring things up to destabilize the Middle East, topple governments, create civil wars, and sell more weapons.

       Do you think your perspective excludes the multitude of other influences besides the Central Intelligence Agency maintaining a petrodollar hegemony?
      </p>
      <p>
       It was only about a hundred years ago that Iraq and most of that area was a province of the Ottoman Empire. Did you know Baghdad had a population of just 145,000 people in 1900? After the Ottomans collapsed, Iraq was stabilized by the British Army as a monarchy until 1954. If that had lasted, Iraq would look much like Saudi Arabia does today. By this point, though, these until recently medieval people found out they were sitting on the world's most precious new resource. However, the Communist dominos swept across the middle east, and Iraq became a socialist revolutionary state in 1968 governed by the Ba'ath party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saddam Hussein took over the Ba'ath party in 1979 and it performed all roles of government authority completely until 2003. The Berlin Wall had fallen 14 years earlier. Then their entire government disappeared when the United States invaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it is a group of over 35 million people with vast social and cultural differences that live in a former communist dictatorship that they have no idea how to run. It is a forced-together nation and a group of people that are going to have to find themselves and learn to govern in a modern age. There should be a debate, even a bloody one, in order for a new order to appear. Or else split their country up and they can govern smaller regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, it is chaos and probably will be for the near future. It's, unfortunately, in times like this that new dictators rise to the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       No doubt that the US government has dumped arms all over the middle east all will continue to do so. But ISIS would have happened anyways. It's part of the story. But it's as much a reaction to post-Ba'ath secularism than it is to the pinings of the CIA. They're a limited group of mostly bureaucrats with a budget similar to a company like Staples, Inc.
      </p>
      <p>
       While there is some comfort to believe the CIA governs the world for us, no one is in control of Iraq.

       I'm rather suggesting that these are all events that have been set in motion long ago. And they are not events cloaked in secrecy. The British invasion of the Suez Canal in 1956 is a bigger factor in the Middle East right now than any number of guns provided by the CIA in Syria. The West lost most of its influence in Iran and Iraq after their respective revolutions against Western influences. This is not a mystery or a conspiracy. Was there a "major player"? Sure, it was the US, but it was very overt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than pick up a history book and read why this country is the way it is, people prefer to boil it down to a secret agent man calling the shots through an earpiece. Frankly, it usually seems like intellectual laziness. Conspiracists seem to view the world myopically through a lens of US CIA omnipotence and secret dealings. The world is a lot more complicated than that and I wish people would study the interesting truths rather than piece together their own unrealistic fantasies.

       Intellectual laziness would be ignoring the litany of CIA supported regime change cross the world and ascribing the entire situation to a British invasion nearly sixty years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put down your state commissioned history book and read some independent historical accounts of the CIA. Then look around for contemporary alternative journalists and whistleblowers who are all saying the same thing, that a branch within the CIA has gone rogue and now works for the highest bidder.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA doesn't have omnipotence or omniscience despite how badly they'd like to be deified. Most conspiracy theorists realize it's not as simple as one clandestine group calling all the shots. There's divisions within the agency and within their military, hell even infighting amongst the Rockefeller's and over at the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, some enthusiastic sheep with proclivities for conspiracies have a vastly simplified and frankly incorrect view of history and current event. I respect that you've pointed this out. But ignoring the CIA's historic and current role in regime change and destabilizaton efforts across the globe is worse than intellectual laziness, it's flat out denial.

       The problem with "state commissioned history books" is that there are a lot of them that all say the same thing. Together, they form the near entirety of our society's literature on the topic. What a shame it's all lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       These books are written by people who have dedicated their careers to understanding middle east politics. But they all must be part of this conspiracy. Plus the 20,000 or so CIA employees and their families all keeping this secret; plus the majority of the federal government and their families. And then the hundreds of thousands of people who work for the media, NGOs, and most international tourists. So the theory that the CIA, the Rockefellers, or the Catholics secretly control the world requires the intricate and willing cooperation of thousands and thousands of American people to conspire against the remaining portion of the populace. Occam's Razor anyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's only an enlightened few who weren't included in the conspiracy who can see past the sheep and through the lies. An exaggerated form of that condition is called clinical narcissism. But maybe that's a conspiracy too.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never stop to think that if such a conspiracy was even possible, and that power existed to control such chaos, then wouldn't it be much easier to control things overtly? It cost Iran $295 Billion to overtly run its country in 2010. The entire CIA has a budget 1/10th that size and can run the entire world? I wouldn't even be mad, that's impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, The two possible solutions are that:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Our countries' intelligence agency is just another proportionate factor in world influence and maybe people take this whole alternate conspiratorial world view a little too far sometimes or
      </p>
      <p>
       2) That a minority of Americans are being lied to by the majority for no discernable reason in the most elaborate and unnecessary hoax ever concocted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a hard time accepting the latter.

       Dude you ain't even arguing with me you just making shit up. Your filtered perception omits other possibilities 
3) That our country's intelligence agencies play disproportionate roles in dictating world events because American culture indoctrinates us with this queer notion that if we fail in our God given duty to police the world we will all end up killed by terrorists. Most Americans blindly accept this, funding the system of war with their votes and tax dollars. Ironically, the wars we fund create breeding grounds for terrorists, thus ensuring the boogeyman exists to scare us into perpetual compliance with this bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I clearly haven't argued that the CIA runs the world, nor that textbook companies are in on the conspiracy (tho sometimes they have their own agendas be it standardized testing or blatantly false propaganda.) Nor have I argued that the majority of people appear incapable of calling American intelligence agencies on their meddlesome and often violent ways. Truly though, you stand testament to the old adage, "it's easier to fool a person than to convince them they've been fooled."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either that or my second possibility, that you are simply full of BS.

       You're right, getting off topic. But in all fairness, the post is called, "Proof CIA created ISIS." I don't know what your personal beliefs are on the matter, but OP clearly believes that the CIA is the direct cause of ISIS. That's what I took issue with. Your arguments are fairly moderate and I'm not confusing your arguments with the OP's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am trying to convey that ISIS was a long time in the making, its origins well predate the existence of the CIA and go back to the creation of a Caliphate, an idea that existed even prior to the Ottoman conquest of Iraq in the 16th Century. And it's an idea about Iraqi political sovereignty and Pan-Arabism which has been around sine the 1950s. Furthermore, the secular Ba'ath government had hindered religious expression in Iraq since the 1970s and the country was ripe for fundamentalists to take control when the US invaded. My point is that 1) These are actual legitimate direct causes of the creation of ISIS in 2003, and 2) Any action by the CIA could only speed up or slow down that development; making it a contributing factor rather than a direct factor. So, no, the CIA did not conspire to create ISIS.

       While we will be consumed by our debt, we are also the global purveyor of debt-based monetary policy, and the central banks, organizations and individuals that control the international money supply will profit handsomely from both the creation and destruction of the system. It is no longer dependent on domestic economic policy, growth, or in our historical case, the complete lack thereof.

       Of course they don't. But just because you don't know the motives doesn't mean it's not true... That's just terrible logic. That's like saying "Hey we just saw some Japs bomb pearl harbor.", "Really? Why? Oh we don't know why yet? I don't believe it then."

       This question in general has been asked a few times in this thread, to which individuals I tried to establish the most the most concise reason, although it is quite difficult because it is a combination of multiple goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Middle East is essentially the "factory" of all value arbitrarily assigned to the USD, both tangible in terms of resources and intangible in terms of perceived US military supremacy. When either of these ideals fail to maintain their standing, our currency experiences massive increases in our interest rates and bond yields, which leads to more quantitative easing and inflation leading to hyperinflation. For instance, the tangible reason why we must maintain control of the region is because without every single country on this planet agreeing to finance all oil purchases in USD, the economic necessity of having them at all disappears, and with it our value as an economic vanguard. The intangible reason we must maintain constant military pressure on any country challenging that paradigm is much the same reason as China refuses to grant independence to Taiwan; because it would establish a precedent for the dispute of a long-standing agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the cost of "supporting our troops" is magnitudes greater from an economic standpoint that maintaining our domestic integrity, much as a factory in China would sacrifice the lives of workers to ensure the product is still manufactured. Our product being supremacy, our nation behaves much as a corporation and in a twisted way, it would be a terrible fate for the average American if we removed our military presence and ceased engaging in any more war. We do it now because we have no other choice, our economy would collapse of we lost control.

       Indeed, and as I myself have said before: "The U.S. is an empire and a military plutocracy, certainly no real democracy exists there, nor can it be allowed to. The imperial-piratical system in place in the U.S. post-Cold War cannot, nor does it seek, to outperform in kind the stabilist mercantile forms at which Germany and Japan excel (neither, of course, does it have the demographic reserves of a vigorously industrialized China), rather, it pursues through the force of unequaled military might (legacy of its unscathed position after WWII) to create and determine the very terms of order and even of existence on this Earth, but—and this is key—not through the imposition/maintenance of a stable and expansive Pax Americana, but rather through the supposedly controlled disruptive yet creative potential of perpetual war throughout the unconcluded project of history."

       There isn't really an enemy, it's about profit, control and currently the expansion of Israel's borders (see greater Israel) - as long as they can get away with it the war on terror will never end, it's a whole lot easier to use proxies / mercenaries to attack people like Gaddafi and Assad who threaten profits than to convince people they should be attacked through propaganda.

      <p>
       Since WWII, we have had a permanent military industrial complex. We could use the USSR as a boogeyman to encourage the populace to incur debt for the benefit of the MIC. After the downfall of the Soviets, we needed an enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       PNAC should be regarded as a marketing plan. It was a way to ensure that Americans maintained MIC spending. Since the "catalyzing event" we have been spending 700+ billion annually and made it so we don't really know how much is being spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB know this cannot go indefinitely, but they also know they are not restricted to this nation and that each dollar spent on their tech belongs to them and not the American public.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are robbing us fast and hard, while enraging the rest of the world in the process. They will soon jump ship, taking their tech and wealth and blaming the U.S. for their dirty work. Having allowed them to capture the public dialogue for profit also allows them to lay the blame on us. When I say them, I mean take September 2013. At this time, the question of Obama's redline was being debated. The president had 10% support for sending troops into Syria. But what this allowed was a unparalleled look at the synthesis of our "democracy". While the constitutionality of the president "going in alone" was being debated (as well as the effectiveness of engaging in such a war), each main contender for the presidency this century was promoting the same concept in the media: "the president has the power". McCain, Kerry, Romney, Clinton were all saying the exact same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point, we must accept that the synthesis is manufactured, not merely accidental. They all want to spend us into oblivion. What's more; during the same period, Russia and China were standing on Syria's side, sending in troops, ships and planes saying lets do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US PTB were quite content to send us into WWIII. Why? Is it true that the US is so warlike that each of our contenders for the last few decades is happy to abrogate democracy at home and abroad, or is it true that we don't actually choose our leaders?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whichever, the president is merely a salesman, promoting the GDP, and who can blame them? Imagine Obama really meant what he said pre-election. He gets into office and says, let's shut these wars down. He is told, we can't. I'm the potus, I damn well can! he replies. So was JFK, he is told.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we are to blame for allowing our presidents to be threatened by the killers of JFK in perpetuity. We have allowed them to say, you are dead if you don't follow orders and the people will do nothing about it. Because this is not merely a threat, it is the implication that those he is attempting to protect don't give a shit and therefore shouldn't be protected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MIC knew they have been bankrupting the US and that the time they can do so is drawing to an end. They will use us a bit more while preparing us to be scapegoated to the world to mark the next stage in their plan. And the reason that all presidential contenders for this century are on board is because they were promised a seat at that new table, while we the American people only offered them the chance to be slaughtered.

       You should've continued with more evidence. ISIS now operate in Srt, Libya too right?? How did they manage to get into Libya to control the Srt area and execute the Egyptian and Ethiopian Christians? They were in there in the first place since the assault against Gaddafi. I'm just trying to add to your words because it all makes perfect sense.

       How come John McCain was for arming Syrian rebels then profaned all innocence afterwards?  Am I wrong in that? It was bizarre and made me feel like men of his generation just really don't get how much the world has changed.

       I was with you until the last paragraph where it seems you reverted to the mainstream view that the creation of ISIS happened due to mistakes made and they are actually Muslim extremists and not a random bunch of mercenaries on the US payroll.  I know you wanted to stick with corporate media reports but nothing will change unless it's exposed that the US, Israel, Saudis, Turkey etc continue to support and control them - I have a bunch of links I'll add later.

       “we are confronted by political myths of the most astonishing kind and by documents often fraught with a downright magical intensity. They…naturally have an esoteric character…the Leviathan represents ‘the cattle upon a thousand hills’…namely the heathen. World history begins as a battle amongst the heathen…[they] stand by and watch how people of the world kill one another. This ritual slaughter is for them lawful…and therefore eat the flesh of the slaughtered peoples and are sustained by it.”–Carl Schmitt
      </p>
      <p>
       Description, proscription, prescription?–All, potentially and empirically. And for this reason it is both the very opposite and simultaneously a near synonym (as is the tribunal’s statement itself) of the Nuremberg tribunal’s decry of aggressive war as the supreme international crime, containing within it the accumulated evil of the whole of the crimes of war. The two, chronologically, restate the vision of divide et impera on a vast geopolitical scale for which, as praxis, the Nazis were convicted, but which today in the Middle East and other significant areas of the world is being to the letter (“the accumulated evil of tbe whole”) and the “spirit,” as well as the destructive scale of the physics, faithfully reproduced again.

       Failed states.   Iraq,  and Libya for example.   Which warlords help get the oil to port?   Which warloards don't?    From week to week,  ISIS is the name of the tribal groups who we decided we don't need.   Last week we were training and arming them.   Next week we might be arming them again.    No Saddam,  or Gaddafi to deal with,  no one lives that long in a failed state.    But the oil keeps flowing,  the opium keeps growing.    Failed state is the new US policy in Iraq,  Syria,  Libya,  Afghanistan,  and ISIS is the strategy.    Al-Qaeda was just as fabricated.

       Most of ISIS leadership are "former" Baathists from the Iraqi military, makes me wonder if they aren't secretly allied with Syrian Baathists and are only there to undermine the other foreign backed "revolutionaries".

       I have my own theory about the current situation in the Middle-East. It is based on the assumption that the U.S and its allies cannot be so stupid as to totally misjudge the situation and the potential outcomes. There is obviously many tribal agendas and double-crosses going on and switching of sides, but this must be expected. I believe the current chaos is a deliberate ploy by the West for reasons I cannot explain. The real backlash that the West must face is the veteran soldiers of the Mid-East that are radicalized and generally very young.

       The 2013 bombings in Syria conducted by Israel are actually indirect attacks on Iran. Syria and Iran are bound by a mutual defense pact and are strategic alliances. The US and Israel's senate resolution 65, surely to pass states that congress reaffirms the long-standing bonds of friendship and cooperation between the United States and Israel, supports the full implementation of U.S. and international sanctions on Iran, recognizes the tremendous threat posed to the United States, the West, and Israel by Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, formerly Iran has not even decided nor has the capability to create a nuclear warhead, stated by the CIA. It also states that if Israel is compelled to take military action in self-defense against Iran's nuclear weapons program the U.S. government will provide Israel with diplomatic, military, and economic support. Hence, the foreign relations committee voting to endorse resolution 65 (April 17, 2013) is the latchkey should Israel attack Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       By now, people should know that Israel has openly indicated its desire to use military force on Iran. Formerly, on January 30th of this year the US government affirmed that the Syrian government under Assad utilized chemical weapons against its own people. Following this event, it was revealed that a hacker leaked emails and a large quantity of sensitive documents from a UK based military contractor. Particular emails within these hacked documents were manipulated to make it look like this operation had full proof from the US government, however this is incorrect and stains the documents’ credibility. Nevertheless, a plan by Qatari was to have the firm provide false evidence that Syria would give the go ahead to use chemical weapons. The documents also revealed details regarding a contract with Saudi Arabia to help prepare their forces for a War with Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three months later, on March 19th sarin gas was used in Aleppo, Syria. Israel and the US accused the Syrian government when many of those killed were Syrian government soldiers. Obama then began talking about the event as a ‘RED LINE’ that had been crossed. However, the UN investigated the subject and on May 6th 2013 UN investigator Carla Del Ponte went public, stating that it was in fact the Syrian rebels that utilized sarin gas and that there was no sign that the Syrian government launched any chemical attacks whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the lab results, investigators discovered the presence of Hexogen, which was utilized as an opening charge and is not used in standard chemical emissions. Therefore, results pointed to the attack being launched by the Syrian rebels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mysteriously, the Obama Administration backed down from previous claims. I believe this was done to create the ostensible reason for military involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran-backed Hezbollah weapons were said to be the target according to Israel. The real motive however, was to derail Syria’s progress in their fight against foreign militants originally from Lebanon. Hezbollah, who sides with president Assad’s regime, declares that it was a war against foreign backed terrorists. Iran has sent over 4,000 troops to aid Assad and Russia s-300, have responded to take Syria's side as well as China. This is all about how Iran has one of the largest oil reserves; in addition they are not cooperating with the US. The USA's excuse to invade Syria is an excuse to draw Iran into an exposed conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States has had Syria and Iran in its crosshairs for quite some time. Four Star General Wesley Clark states, “I talked to one of the Generals in the Joint staff, he showed me a memo that describes on how we are going to take out seven countries in five years. Starting with Iraq, then Syria, then Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off with Iran.”
      </p>
      <p>
       NATO and the US have been running a proxy war by arming and funding the FSA. Funneling these resources through their allies in the region. To obscure the source of this support, Qatar has been used to purchase the weapons from countries like Sudan and route them to Syria via Turkey. Qatar is a close military ally of the US; they provided tank support in the Gulf War and served as the US Central Command Headquarters during the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. The US government has now openly admitted to funding, arming and training the Syrian rebels.
The US government does not like to present their wars as empire building but instead paints themselves as defenders of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following this event, the US increased their support significantly. In July, the US openly began discussing kinetic strikes against Syria as if their lies hadn’t been exposed. Shortly after, on August 21st 2013 the US attempted once again to frame the Syrian government. Initially, the media coverage tried to pin the attack on the Syrian government and the US and France instantly came out condemning Assad. By August 24th the Pentagon already announced plans for missile strikes. That very day the Syrian army came forward with footage to back up their report that they uncovered a massive chemical weapons stash in Rebel tunnels in the Damascus suburbs of Jawbar. This is the exact neighborhood of where the chemical weapon attacks took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       On May 31st 2013 Turkey finds a 2kg cylinder filled with sarin gas in homes of Syrian militants.
On July 7th the Syrian army went public regarding a chemical lab that they found belonging to the Syrian rebels outside the city of Damascus.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the motive? The only parties that benefit from the ensuing attack are the Syrian rebels, the US and its allies. The Syrian government knows full well that NATO and the US have been looking for any accuse to invade. The rebels on the other hand have already been caught committing ruthless killings as well as creating fake videos of civilian casualties. Two days after the attack, the Syrian rebels release a video statement vowing to strike back with any and all means. They claimed to have access to chemical weapons and that they now intended to use them with zero misgivings from this point forward. Basically, they are using their own crime for a pretext to openly utilize chemical weapons in battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the US invades a lot of civilians will die. Their situation is not going to be enhanced by the US attacking, anymore than it was in Iraq and these limited strikes are no different than chemical weapons. Western nations have a conditioned aversion to chemical weapons. Historically, because of the conditions of World War 1 their usage became taboo, in spite of their minor role in combat. Having no doubt, chemical weapons are barbaric, but so is land-mining, machine-gunning, the utilization of white phosphorous and DU as well as other 'orthodox,' 'legal,' methods of warfare the US and its allies utilize regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the very actuality of the taboo permits Western nations to selectively cite use of chemical weapons as reasons for military action. This use is, of course selective; if it's a client regime using them against enemies of the US or its allies, no enforcement, and perhaps even outright aid, as in the case of Iraq against Iran. And of course it's all hypocritical, and downright irrational: hence the importance of media saturation campaigns and consistent government propaganda concerning WMDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, the financial elites are longing the expansion of the Rothschild Central Banking DEBT BASED fiat currency system. (Only Syria, and Iran have independent central banks in the Middle East.... most recent example was Libya.)
Furthermore, just recently “Obama now admits Assad MUST go before ISIS can be defeated: President plans to focus on Syria and ousting brutal dictator as he tries to beat back terror group,” Strange when Assad is an enemy of ISIS, which if he was to be ousted would pave way for ISIS control over that region. It would make more sense to help Assad destroy ISIS in Syria leaving the reduced and concentrated in the killing sand hoc of Iraq. That's been the plan all along. ISIS was used as a pretext to attack Syria and then Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand how they get away with such idiocy. Can't the general public see this?

       Here's research about the CIA creating insurgents in Laos. Guess what these insurgents excelled at once they began receiving CIA funding/supplies/logistics? Massive fields of Opium:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Hmong [Laos ethnic minority backed by the CIA during the Laos civil war] had traditionally grown opium, but under the guidance of the warlords and with the infrastructure and protection of the CIA, business soared to unprecedented heights.

      <p>
       It seems like wherever the CIA goes, opium fields are planted. This is pretty much history repeating itself with the Opium wars.

       In the UK, we're being asked to believe that young suburban muslims are leaving in droves to join ISIS....but despite this, all the intelligence agencies in the world still can't seem to get handle on the organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah right! I'm sorry, but the intel agencies are either criminally incompetent or criminally complicit. And judging by this post it's both.

       The fact this shoddy collection of only tenuously connected events blown up to assert the cia actively created isis is so blindly accepted is the best evidence I've seen for members of this sub being tin foil hat wearers. Most people on here are greater sheep than the very people you call sheep. You guys just blindly accept any narrative that goes against that of the mainstream.

       But it doesn't prove his claim whatsoever. Have you followed the Syrian civil war? All of what he presents is indeed established fact, namely that the US has provided support to rebels fighting the Assad regime, some of whom at times have indeed allied with jihadist groups including Jabhat Al-Nusra.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has nothing to do at all with his claim that the 'CIA created Isis' in some conspiracy.

       I feel that we're going in circles here. I never claimed that it's proof. The OP presented a theory which he supports with facts (as you claim) from reputable sources.

       The thing is that he doesn't support the theory. He poses a hypothesis and then gave facts that supported a wholly different point.
      </p>
      <p>
       His hypothesis, as fleshed out in the comment section, is that ISIS is a CIA vehicle designed specifically to perpetuate the military industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       The long-winded narrative and sources he cites, however, are all uncontroversial (and known by everyone) discussion of the United States' support of FSA affiliated rebels in Syria (and anti-Gaddafi rebels in Libya + muhajideen during the Soviet-Afghan war).
      </p>
      <p>
       What we can conclude is that the US has a long-standing history of using certain proxies to encourage regime change of countries hostile to the United States. Assad has long been a thorn in the US' side, hosting and facilitating the earlier Iraq Insurgency post Iraqi Freedom. What's funny is that there is if anything a stronger conspiracy theory that ISIS is an Assad creation, considering his links with the same militants years earlier and mass release of jihadist prisoners at the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011 (for the record, I don't believe this either, but it has a much stronger body of evidence than the CIA/ISIS junk).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not ISIS. There is not one shred of evidence that he gives that supports his hypothesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, this is perhaps the area in which I am most knowledgeable. Go to
       <a href="/r/syriancivilwar">
        /r/syriancivilwar
       </a>
       , and you'll find a very well-informed international community (highly critical of the United States' and other actors' actions, we're far from shills) that finds the CIA-created-ISIS conspiracy absolutely asinine.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no jingoist shill -- I'm a supporter of Noam Chomsky's longstanding criticism of American foreign policy. I do however think critically and do not blindly accept every conspiracy theory that comes along, as so many in this community seem to do. There is no evidence for the direct ISIS/CIA connection, nor does it make any sense based upon what we do know.

       I found that nowhere in his comments. I don't think anyone is saying that they believe ISIS is the idea of some back room CIA dealing. I believe that the "narrative" asserts that actions taken by the CIA and US government can be pointed to as creating conditions which gave rise to ISIS.

       I think the blame can squarely rest on the psychopath leaders like Al Baghdadi using the guise of religion to satisfy their bloodlust and obsession with power over mankind. The sin of all sins.  Obviously the CIA has funded rebels all over the world to fight our greatest enemies.  We certainly had more to fear from the USSR than we did from rebels in the middle east.  The same could be said of the Syrian regime, the Iranian regime, Saddam's regime.  Would you rather deal with a large military or some random suicide bombers who think killing a few innocent people threatens the US government at all.

       That large military posed an equal threat to the U.S. as ISIS. WMD that could reach the U.S. from the Middle East didn't exist at that time. More importantly, the United States spends more on military than the next 8 countries combined. Launching any sort of attack on the United States would have been suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your question implies that perishing from Iraq's "huge" army or giving weapons to known extremists were our only two options. How about mind our own business? What about critically analyzing intel? How about a little less fear lingering and a little more diplomacy?

       Mi6 is in there too. The British Monarchy want WWIII to start as a method of population control and arms sales. They have already chosen their victims for a 'terrorist attack' down in New Zealand in October this year. It is a planned beheading. It will look like an ISIS. The planned victim is a woman who has perviously been a victim of the British VIP paedo ring (think Jimmy Saville and royal friends). They want to get rid of her and need a stuge to start the war.  Remember this come October.

       There is always more than meets the eye in these kinds of situations, 'dirt' and bloody games, and your perspective and information is tangential and different than what one usually reads in regards to the topic being discussed here.

       Yeah, Operation Hydrant is but a tip of an iceberg it would seem (and global society as it is organised now a merry Titanic on its way to a collision). It's all interlinked, in a bigger picture.

       Iran is now providing aid and resources to ISIS. Do we have a feeling Iran is just an ally being used as a badguy because it drums up sales for contractors?

       Also you think Hillary Clinton and Obama let them overrun and kill those at the embassy to cover up their involvement and eliminate witnesses? There were several chances to save them and all the people in the area were told stand down...

       I don't think that is the case, Iranian government is Shia, they are backing the Maliki government in Iraq, as Maliki is a Shia with strong ties to Iran, namely he as in Iran during Saddam's time IIRC. When we put Maliki in place, we pretty much just handed Iraq to Iran. ISIS are sectarians who consider Shia to be non Muslims and considered ok to kill. ISIS has been killing Shias with out mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran is becoming more influential in the region, so we are now interested in taming Iran, since it is Iran that we want to control, more influence in the region from Iran is dangerous to our foreign policy. So we want Iran to be under control extending that control over the places Iran is influencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thoughts regarding when this is all said and done, Iraq is in the process of being divided in to 3 pieces. Kurdistan, ISIS and Iraq minor. We are expected to see ISIS take hold of and control areas that are closer to Israel. I suspect, Israel will then wipe out ISIS quiet easily, taking over the lands IsIS had claimed. I think this will happen in a bid to expand Israel to its original size, known as greater Israel. Expect to see us getting chummy with Iran the way we have been with KSA. Greater Israel alsos include lands that are considered part of KSA. We would need Iran's help for that. I am starting to see a trend where in the past, no one in main stream media would really openly mention KSA and its beheading rules and other unlikable things associated with KSA. We are starting to see media is giving more visibility to KSA now. This is the setup to break ties with KSA with in the next few years. KSA is already not happy that U.S. Is looking to make deals with Iran. They in KSA really really hate Iran.

       I guess it's possible that a corrupt general gave ISIS the weapons from Iranian's stockpile for personal profit and got caught but they still got a steady stream of weapons from Iran. Somewhere long the line they switched from US supplied weapons to Iranian supplied weapons and that's just fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Iran didn't intend to give them the weapons it might show Iran as a unstable entity that doesn't have tight control over it's own military.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems all too convenient that the US and Iran have both armed isis to the teeth and there's no way I'm buying the "we lost the weapons" or the "we didn't know who were were dealing with" lines. I am upvoting you for your research. Thanks.

       Have you even tried researching any of this?? I find some of the conspiracies on here laughable, but events like 9/11, the golf of tonkin incident, operation northwoods and mk ultra aren't hard to figure out. Have fun in the status quo.

       It's just that every post is so tinfoil it's like you're parodying yourselves. It's comedy gold. And then when anything is challenged or is called a little far fetched then everyone turns into Morpheus and it's hilarious. WAKE UP SHEEPLE.

       I have never seen this constant neckbeard of Illuminati Confirm shit. Do you even go in this sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know who actually say Illuminati Confirm and tin foil hat and Jet Fuel Can't Melt steel beams? People like you who troll this sub. So whenever you see someone who says that shit look at their history and you'll see they are just neckbeards like you circle jerking their inside job jokes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck it took me 3 seconds to find you say. "I hate this sub" on an American Sniper post. Are you one of those Amercafags who cried on that movie?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have a severe case of cognitive bias when you think this sub is shitty when all you all you post on it is shit.
