       Those who have been completely mistreated and subjugated by the forced stagnation devised by the corporate sector do not only have the right to march, but the obligation to do so. An economy, that is well understood to have been built on genocide, oppression, neocolonialism, and most dependently slavery, is to be entirely blamed for the current living conditions and cultural deterioration of an alienated sector of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       By 1840, the South Cotton industry produced 60% of the world's cotton. Anyone with a basic understanding of capital and infinite free labor is capable of concluding that the reason slavery was abolished in the European world 30 years before it was in America - without a brutal civil war-, was due to those directly benefiting from free production in a cornered market (both American and European elites with interests in the sector); those willing to go to war for the sake of profit -which they effectively did and continue to do-. Had it not been for the incredible wealth amassed by this sector of the industry, not a single military conflict following the civil war would've been financially feasible; the first stepping stone to the military revolution that both followed and financed the current American way of living.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a continuous struggle to gain but basic human rights, nothing extraordinary, merely what is recognized as inalienable to any living person, these people are now marginalized as rebels, criminals, and bigots. It's only reasonable to think of them as such when they had to literally thrust themselves against an entirely evil and regressive system, imposed by those pocketing billions while devising policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today communities have yet to be structurally restored, people have no career prospects in an outsourced manufacturing economy, terrible integration and educational programs, all accompanied by the heavy stigma protracted by the deplorable daily living conditions and the resulting subdued self-determinism of the individual. The only hope for these people is to reject the notions and needs imposed on them by the pressing authority. A degree of non-conformity that transcends their material desires will effectively lead them to the justice they both want and deserve. 
By rejecting these standards and conditioned necessities, an authentic Black Culture will rise, allowing for black individuals to identify themselves with a prospect of cultural identity that is legitimately created by them rather than the white supremacist's perspective on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is without even mentioning the CIA efforts to introduce and distribute drugs in predominantly latino and black neighborhoods as means to finance coups in Nicaragua, Panama, and the rest of central america. End the war on drugs, the biggest racial assault on a group of people, crafted by an extraordinarily racist president, and protracted by the most fearful one (obamallama).

       This is the same thing black revolutionaries have been saying for the past century, back to marcus garvey.  The answer that he, and the counterculture influenced by him, had was to simply check out of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem, as with most protest movements, is that the masses of disillusioned people don't have a unified vision.  The rioting and looting that takes place during urban protests is because the majority of the people are marginalized in a manner that they can't achieve the goals set up by the society in which they live.  They want consumerism, but are stuck between the cultural value of helping their people and the cut throat drive to "hustle" and "get mines".  There's an entitlement that comes with it, and it leads to a conflagration where the mass gets blamed for "acting like animals".  We ARE animals, and they are treated like animals.

       Nobody wants to go back to africa.  We want to live in america and get stuff.  But not everybody can get away with breaking the rules.  A small percentage of rule breakers are allowed to be successful, and those people are an incentive for millions of others to break the rules and end up in prison.

       Rap music and Drugs are basically a honeypot for marginalized black youth.  And then there's that whole divide and conquer.  Huey Newton was killed by a member of Black Family.  Malcolm X by Louis Farrakhan. Bloods vs Crips.  It's the same reason the DEA funds the Sinaloa cartel in mexico.

       But we don't...and we keep fighting each other...thinking that it's each other that's causing these problems and that's at fault for the problem...all the while being totally ignorant of the fact that the fault lies in a secretive elite

       While fomenting and nourishing what could be called "integrated sectarianism", they maintain a rigorous grip over essential criticisms and dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technological innovation and progress, at the hands of those who the population considers "the providers" of such (but are in reality are those who took corporate proprietorship of the means of production early on), has effectively halted any possibility of future social advancement and progress because of the fear that rebelling would lead to their depriving from these "fake necessities".

      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Marcuse puts it quite well in The One-Dimensional Man, 
" The power over man which this society has acquired is daily absolved by its efficacy and productiveness. If it assimilates everything it touches, if it absorbs the opposition, if it plays with the contradiction, it demonstrates it cultural superiority. And in the same way the destruction of resources and the proliferation of waste demonstrate if ts opulence and the "high levels of well-being"; "the Community is TOO WELL OFF TO CARE!""

      <p>
       Very correct.  This is all part of how the stringent grip on the “divide and conquer” paradigm is kept:  Foment dissent, and attack anyone who is critical of that dissent; attack anyone who goes against that dissent and tries to advocate for a level of universal togetherness and communal cooperation.

       Absolutely, 100% correct.  Those citizens that come up with any type of invention that might stand to overturn or undermine what TPTB have in place get undermined, bought out, or simply taken out/murdered/suicided.

       No.  You are on the rollercoaster, and while on it, you encourage action and activity that helps keep those on it ignorant, unthinking, racist, and hateful.  I certainly wish this wasn’t the case, but your many comments have unambiguously shown this to be the case.

       I certainly wish this were actually true, but when what you’ve said before is as indicative of certain less-than-intelligent perspectives as it is - and when that very primitive point of view is shared by many others as well - then it means that this very ignorant mindset is actually a lot more indicative than it needs to be if the human species on this planet as a whole has any real hope of overcoming the manipulation it is so burdened by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your opinions and (especially) your actions mean a
       <em>
        lot

       in the grander scheme of things.  ALL of our opinions and actions do.

       it.  On more occasions than I can remember, your posts sooner or later, and more often than not, eventually devolve into a commentary that you usually make - veiled or overt - about the “superiority of the white, Aryan race over and above the African race and all other races on the planet”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really wish I was making this up, but, unfortunately, I’m not.  The extent to which you hold as tightly to such an abysmally repugnant mindset shows that you absolutely
       <em>
        do

       contribute greatly to the types of problems that ensure our continued subjugation as a slave race.  This kind of mindset is a great part of what helps ensure that we remain divided and conquered as a species.

       You'll notice I don't criticize you as an individual. I don't insult you personally. I don't call you names. What I do in my posts is express ideas. If I have insults, it is for those who are running the show, and those who are committing the crimes, the Obamas, the Holders, the Hillarys and the Cheneys. I'm an ideas man, and the only reason this bothers you is because you disagree with my ideas. But guess what? We have freedom of speech, for a while, at least. I'm sure you want to see it disappear, since you don't want me to use it. But we still have it. As long as we do, I'm going to say what I think. You don't have to believe it.

       No.  You’re actually not an “ideas man”.  You’re a “racist ideas man”.  Ideas are fine when they don’t advocate the perpetuation of the very state of being that has caused untold suffering to the human race on this planet.  The core of the ideas you’ve advocated over and over again contribute to the continued pushing down of all of humanity - including you yourself.

       What I want to see disappear is not freedom of speech, but ignorance.  That is why I respond to you the way I do and let it be known that the core of the beliefs that you’ve expressed many times are not ultimately intelligent ones.  That’s not in any way attempting to keep you from saying what you say.  It’s an attempt to simply let you and others know just how degrading to yourself and to all of us the mindset you have is in that regard.

       You don’t have to ask me because neither am I trying to keep you from expressing yourself, nor do I imagine that I would actually be able to (nor
       <em>

       </em>
       I be able to) if I were even trying to keep that from happening in the first place.  You do not need to ask because you in no way need my permission on such a matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I’m not trying to keep you from expressing yourself.  I’m simply pointing out that there is a distinct conflict of interest between the individual who wishes for the betterment of humanity on one hand…and the individual who is a racist on the other.  Those two things are incompatible, as you cannot wish for the improvement of a species while going on about the superiority of one specific section or subset of it over all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, whenever you make any sort of statement that might come across to others as beneficial or intelligent
       <em>
        if applied to ALL of humanity as a whole
       </em>
       , the truth is that I for one know that the statement is in all actuality the disingenuous double speak of a person who has in point of fact shown themselves to be an unmitigated racist toward all humans that are not white, and the comment itself is, therefore, nowhere near as humanitarian as your cowardly omission would otherwise actually show.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, you are not a stupid human being.  I know this.  It is just unfortunate that you have had the life experiences and/or upbringing that you have had that has caused you to have, again, such a very ignorant and closed-minded perspective.

       The reality of racial distinctions and peculiarities in no way prevents the successful implementation of a system and philosophy within which A) all individuals are nonetheless allowed equal opportunity, and B) no group is allowed undue advantage over another.  As such, whether you know it or not, you created a straw man fallacy, as even though racial distinctions and limitations

        are

       real, one could still implement a system within which all are very much equal

       causing everyone to adhere to standards they cannot meet and to which they are ill-suited.

       Of course it does. To put it simply blacks have less developed powers of cognition and they are far worse at delaying their gratification; in other words: they are dumber and more impulsive. This means that they will always lag behind and be more susceptible to have run-ins with the law and to commit crimes -- especially stupid crimes where they are almost certain to get caught. This occurs in spite of equal opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, it is worth mentioning that East  Asians are actually better at these things than Whites. That is an important part of why so many have excelled and have integrated rather seamlessly into our culture.

       Really well thought out and written.

      <p>
       Gets to the core of the issue but doesn't even begin to scratch the surface on the mainstream popularized "hip-hop" (I use quotes because it is NOT hip-hop, it is the white corporate portrayal of what hip-hop SHOULD BE to represent black stereotypes) image of the modern black male - the good for nothing, drug dealing, gun toting ignorant thug. One who lives a life of crime and then turns to rap music and "makes millions."
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the advent of "gangster rap" in the 90's and the cultural subversion of hip-hop, nearly 2 generations have now grown up thinking that this is the only way for young black men to act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Young blacks see this and aspire to it. Young whites see this and either 1) want to imitate it or 2) are scared shitless by the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is 1 more reason why the black community in America is not only stuck and unable to progress forward - but actually regressing when it comes to recognizable mainstream social progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yea
..you can blame Yung Thug or Bobby Shmurda....but the REAL blame goes to the people glorifying them, giving them millions of dollars, and requiring them to continue to brainwash the rest of the black youth to think that the only options in life are committing crimes, or rapping about committing crimes.  Fuck Jimmy Iovine.

       The music definitely adds to it but it's really just the environment. I feel I can add more than the average person on here because I'm 1. black 2. aware of what's really going on (I'm in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for example) 3. a person who listens to that ignorant stuff but knows better.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fairly young (22) born in the trenches of Newark, NJ but I moved to the suburbs of delaware at a young age (13). Like I said I still listen to all that ignorant stuff but I know better than to imitate any of it. That's because I wasn't surrounded by the embracers when I went to middle school/high school. Only white kids who like you said impersonated it. Anyone and everyone is a product of their environment. My brother didn't move to delaware when I did, he instead stayed in jersey with my dad, we are the same age. I went on to go to college and he went on to be a drug dealer. The only difference is where we lived growing up cause together we were the same Mario kart football loving kids. Place a regular white kid in the middle of the hood with no dad, gun toting friends, and he's gonna grow up to be just like them, I've seen it first hand. I think the problem starts with the war on drugs and music is a smaller problem.

       Black culture send to be great before desegregation and integration. And I say this as a black man. There's a heavy Jewish element in both the civil rights movement and the feminist movement, both of which have led to the disintegration of the black community.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also Jewish influence in rap and black television. All the major black TV channels and TV shows are owned and produced by, you guessed it. Same with music, same with the magazines.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been a very strong force doing everything it can to influence black culture. What you see is the end result.

       Correct. What you should realize, but probably don't, is that this Jewish attack on our culture was

       Jews weren't the one's firebombing Black Wallstreet and blasting Civil Rights protestors with firehoses. I get your point, but your thrust of trying to blame "Jews" as being the top of the oppression pyramid is myopic at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could make a case for "Zionists" being in that position, as that title encompases a wider swath of the kinds of people who do actively support suppression of the masses. But you chose the label of "Jews" instead. Means one of two things:

       Don't worry about it because jews don't even claim to exist at all. They will always find a way to distance themselves from their racial ties by deflection. They even adopt last names of the nations they inhabit like parasites. It really doesn't matter what you call them, they are intruders from the middle-East and Eastern Europe where they should have been kept except that their lobbies in Britain and the US fought for them to have not only a place in the West but to pit the other races against each other so they could make money like the holy merchants they are.

       Let's also mention that white society actively embraces and emulates the very worst aspects of "black culture", while rejecting, marginalizing, or flat out refusing to recognize the black people who work the hardest to make something of themselves and build within their community.
      </p>
      <p>
       America revels in the black stereotype actively.
       <a href="https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/ay_116945699.jpg">
        It wants to get away with "acting" stereotypically "black", but retain it's white privilege.
       </a>
       It's cool to act, but not to be. And we wonder why our black children are frustrated and confused and angry. They're constantly getting mixed messages about who, how, and where to be.

       Exactly.
They're forced to identify with a notion of self that is completely disdainful, thus end up following the steps of those the white media portrays as "successes from the ghetto"; basically drug slingers and rappers. What about the lawyers, doctors, and other professionals? Nope.
Only way a black kid can escape the projects is through rap music or dealing dope. This is what they're taught to believe. Government provided education is not only heinous, but the incentives to keep black children away from it are alive and well in the media.

       I don't know which white people you're talking about. You mean ghetto kids who want to fit in with the lifestyle because they feel victimized? When really their parents are worthless and breed to fill the void? When these white kids have been split off from their race and forced to live with black people as a result of integration? Most white people try to live away from black neighbourhoods and pay to get into parks because they know black people won't pay the 2 dollar cover charge.

       White society helped vote a black man into the white house.  The majority of people who voted for Obama were white.  White society loves Tiger Woods.  White society loves Neil DeGrasse Tyson.  This idea that white society is somehow only promoting gangster rap and criminal behavior is bullshit.  That is something that is occurring within the black community itself.  It isn't white people who call black people "coon" and "uncle tom" if they speak intelligible English and excel in school.  Not everything can be blamed on whitey.  At some point people within the black community will need to recognize that they need to change things that are within their control to shape a better future for their kids.

       I did not blame everything on "whitey", but white people are notorious for trying to shrug off any responsibility for their role in society if it paints them in a negative light, while going on and on about how 'ethnic' communities need to take responsibility for their actions. You're proving to be a fine example:

       White people make fun of educated blacks all the time when they "try to act black" or "try to talk black". What do you think happens when a black male can't dance well or play sports? Condescending comments about his lack of blackness. Don't even get me started about white comments about black hair, especially between females.  It happens in the community, black and white. It's up to everyone to understand how these comments (and equivalent comments towards white people) hurt and are unnecessary.

      <p>
       But if you talk like a white person that's ignorant of the white role in pressing blacks into these stereotypical roles, you are clearly ignoring your personal responsibility for propagating an unequal system. And I thought white people were supposed to be all about personal responsibility?

       Or is that only when they can use it as a cudgel to denigrate the actions of non-whites?

       I'm completely disagreeing with you when it comes to white people talking shit about black people for doing well in school.  Black people make fun of other black people for that shit.  White people don't tell black people "hey you are acting white!"  White people don't give a shit.  Do you see white people trashing Tiger Woods for golfing instead of playing basketball?  Nope.  Black people sure gave him a ton of shit though.  White people don't talk shit about black women's hair.  Black women go out and buy weaves because they are unhappy with their hair.  That is nothing to do with white people.  My room mate in college was black and he was very smart and very well spoken and the only people that gave him shit were other black people.  He hung out with my group of friends and was completely accepted.  The only time he was marginalized is when other black people gave him shit for "acting white."  I have never once seen anyone white give anyone black shit for being smart or speaking proper English.  It just doesn't ever happen.  White people can't change how black people treat each other and white people can't force black people to value education over reputation.  White people can't bring the illegitimacy rate in the black community down under 70%.  That, I believe, is the biggest issue in the black community and that needs to be rectified from within the black community.

       I could write a thesis alone about what the Media's whitewashed standards of beauty do to the egos and self image of ethnic women (and men) in this country. It's very striking to see the same thing happening in SOUTH KOREA as well, with girls finding ways to make their eyes wider and more anglo. It's not just an American problem.

       Because whites run the prison industrial complex and need those slaves to remain profitable? Excuse me, how is the black community who is most victimized by this business model supposed to rectify it on their own with no help from the whites whatsoever? You accepted the Irish and the Italians and the Welsh and the Jews into modern society, yet the Blacks continue to be marginalized by a slanted system. Even the Irish knew that they had to distance themselves from the blacks or the WASP power structure would never accept them. So they did, and they became white within two generations. White people are even eager to assimilate latinos, permitted they do the same and deride the blacks like animals. Just look at George Zimmerman.
      </p>
      <p>
       So explain to me why it's so important for whites like you to continue to put blacks in a place of responsibility to resolve completely systemic societal problems they can't possibly hope to fix on their own? The data is right in front of you just like everyone else, but you can't accept that black problems are American problems. This curiosity is the only reason I'm even still talking to you. Very curious to see if you can even answer my inquiry, or if talking points and rhetoric is all you have to draw from.

       Black people aren't supposed to rectify the situation with no help from whites.  There have been plenty of laws passed to help them.  I will grant you that they had a very shitty deal until the 60s when they finally had their rights put on paper and affirmative action and civil rights laws were passed.  After that it is just a matter of them beginning to trust the system put in place.  Tons of black people do very well.  How are so many black people able to achieve the "American dream?"  If the system is still so heavily rigged against them this should be impossible..  Well.. it's not.  Black people that apply themselves in school have every chance in the world to get any job they want.  There are laws on the books that protect them from being passed over... in fact... there are laws on the books that say if a black person and a white person have the same qualifications and experience the hiring company must hire the black person.  The issue is no longer that there are racist laws/discriminatory hiring practices.  For a long time that was the case but it is no longer an issue.  If ANYBODY goes to school and applies themselves and graduates and applies for a job they can get it.  It's as simple as that.  The issue now is that when black people score lower on tests (like the FDNY hiring exam) they say "the test was racist."  Racism is used as an excuse now.  It's used because everybody allows it to be used because if a white person dares to say "wait.. that test isn't racist.." the person is now called a racist.  Are drug laws fucked up in America.  Absolutely.  I'm all for alleviating all drug laws.  However that isn't going to fix everything.  And cops aren't just patrolling around picking up random black people to take off to prison.  90% of arrests made are due to somebody calling the police for a crime in action.  Guess who is making the call most of the time?  A black person is calling the police because another black person is doing something illegal.  That isn't a racist system.  That is people reporting a crime and the cops responding.  There seems to be this idea that every time a black person is arrested it was simply the case of a white cop driving around until he sees a black guy and then grabbing him when in reality it's almost always a police officer responding to a 911 call because a crime has been/is being committed.  Black people can do 2 things to reduce their interactions with the cops (hint it's the same 2 things any race of people can do to stop their interactions with police): Stop committing crimes or stop reporting crimes committed by other black people.
      </p>

       Obviously I didn't go around telling my room mate how well spoken he was.  I would not have even noticed that there was an issue with the way he spoke if it wasn't brought to my attention by the other black guys on campus giving him shit about how he dressed and talked.  And your women's hair example I still don't ever see happening.  Sure black girls give other black girls shit about their hair being "nappy" or "ratty" but that is a black cultural thing.  White people don't give a shit about their hair.  Chris Rock made a documentary about this.  Sure you can say that the media puts out an image of beauty but that's an image that EVERYBODY tries to keep up with.  White girls starve themselves and get plastic surgery to try to look like Barbie does.  This is not something that is racist.  This is something that is sexist.

       Oh so I guess that all of the black people who are succeeding in America are just anomalies.  They jokes too because they follow the law and work within the system and it works for them the same way that it works for white people and Asian people and Latino people and every other race and creed in the country?

       I never understood why black people would want to stay in a country that treats them so poorly. They are just being terrorized by those evil pale-faces morning, noon and night. Africa is looking pretty good now, isn't it? Warm weather.... Oh, but there isn't any welfare and that's just unacceptable.

      <p>
       When are black people going to realize that the slaves who were brought to America were the luckiest black people on the planet? They not only had communities in America and had it a lot better than where they came from, their future generations would be suckling at the guilt tit of the white devil for all of eternity after a couple generations of working to help establish the white vision of a new land where black people could suck from the breast of white ingenuity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black people today should thank their lucky stars that they were able to be sold by black people to jews in Africa and shipped to big industrialists in the US and then have the white middle-class of the current generation take all of the blame and pay all of the money to keep their kind in comfort.

       Who's to blame for the current state of the black community?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews, who deliberately set out some fifty years ago to destroy white Christian culture, as a way of weakening white power, using the weapons of propaganda, drugs, abortion, feminism, and pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the Jews who did this may or may not have understood at the time is that black culture was much more vulnerable to this kind of social engineering than white culture. So, while white culture has been severely damaged, perhaps fatally, black culture was completely and utterly destroyed and made a wasteland.

       Only 1% of the world's slaves headed for the new world ended up in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first legal, black slave owner in the US was a black man. Black people sold their own kind into slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term slave has its origins in the word slav. The slavs, who inhabited a large part of Eastern Europe, were taken as slaves by the Muslims of Spain during the ninth century AD.

       Call it what you want, but they are those things. Genetics have revealed that black males from age 7-24 have 1.5-2 times the testosterone that white males have. They are an aggressive breed of human.

       That's because black communities are built solely on white charity. Throwing money at the fire. Black parents and black culture is to blame for what they do with their gibmedats. Black entitlements are why black people are stagnant. They want but they don't want to work for it.

       Incorrect, the first slave owner in the US was not a black man. The first black slave owner and land proprietor was a slave by the works of the Virginia Company himself. After acquiring his freedom and amassing tobacco wealth, he did what any businessman of the time would do, got himself some slaves and continued to amass wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Spanish conquests in north Africa did yield a prominent slave trade, which was adopted by several of the neighboring European nations. You can trace slavery further back than the Egyptian Empire of Hatshepsut and the Athenian right of citizenship while marginalizing foreigners to less-than slave conditions.
This is all true but incredibly peripheral to the actions and industries that developed in the US.

       What genetics are these exactly? Testosterone, a hormone secreted by the brain's pituitary gland in the endocrine system can be attributed to an increase in excitatory behavior and physical prowess, however has very little to do with the pre frontal cortex's ability to rationalize situations and make rational preemptive decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Black communities being built solely on WHITE charity? 
Black parents are to blame? 
White charity is more like white reparations and amends if anything. Calling it charity is an outright racist remark, which is completely fine (free speech) just pointing it out.

       Like I mentioned in my post, these people are forced to identify with a false and subdued self-determinism in a society that does everything to promote the worse in these people. A man leaves his child for one of two reasons:
1. He is not ready to be a father, and the conception was the product of his ignorance in regards to safe-sex. 
2. He has no means to support this new family because there are no jobs, and to avoid the inevitable shame and depression associated to this he decided to walk away entirely.

       Reparations for what? The white working class at the time worked the same fields. They were not slave owners. Why should the white middle-class pay for big business' greed? And while the average white working man pays for black people to feel justified, they are still toiling and making decent lives for themselves without rioting and without the gangster mentality.

       You seem to think culture is based on some fantastical outside force and not from the people it's applicable to.

      <p>
       Genetics determine behavior. And while genetics can be adjusted by environment as in evolution, and while environment can also play a role on behavior at a superficial level, the breed will always lean towards certain tendencies.

       You're looking at the result. The result is based on the culture of the people who have created the atmosphere for themselves. Everyone has to live in this shitty, communist, slavery nightmare. The difference is, black people are the only ones who haven't been able to pull themselves up. We're all debt slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think back to segregation. Black people were mistreated more then than now. They had communities and were respectable, contributing members of society. But they were being held to a higher standard back then. White people ensured they adapted to white civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, they have reverted back to their African tendencies because the majority let up and allow them to do as they please. Well, the result is clear.

       Today, culture in the West is being destroyed by those who claim we are all equal and that individualism is king. Community was destroyed but it wasn't a made up thing. Nazi Germany was based around unified culture and race. That wasn't "made up." It was a threat to globalism. There was a war fought to stop it.

       Cultural Deterioration? Blacks live today, better than they live/lived in Africa and blacks in America live unquestionably better than their counter parts in Africa today. So, talk to the hand. You can make up all the mumbo jumbo bs you like. Blacks aren't suppressed. A significant portion of their population has low IQ, which makes them low skilled and many unemployable. Its that simple. Low IQ and poor impulse control makes a breeding ground for crime and anti social behaviour. Any area with large populations of blacks these behaviours manifest themselves quite obviously.

       They are unemployable because there are no more manufacturing and factory jobs in America, this is the product of trade deals like the trans pacific partnership between the US and private corporations as a means to outsource production to decrease manufacturing cost and raise revenue. A model of this nature completely disregards people in the sake of profit. Anyone who has looked into the job market recently, that is the career sector outside the service industry, knows that a higher education is almost a requirement to be a competitive applicant for a decent position.
      </p>
      <p>
       The educational system from K to 12 in states were the black population is more significant receives the least amount of government and private contributions. This is most clearly a move of favoritism intended to keep out this sector of the population from the work force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being forced to assimilate a false notion of cultural identity, being raised in a "project or ghetto" ran by crime and drug trafficking (which everyone knows who introduced), and having to violently protest for just reparations is what makes black culture a breeding ground for the crime and anti social behavior you speak of. 
You talk about mumbjumbo but resort to the vaguest, most generalized, most misused, and discredited argument known to the debate of the races. "aii kiuuuu".

       The reason blacks have lower incomes than whites is because blacks are not as intelligent as whites. That difference in racial intelligence between blacks and whites is the basis for all black inequality, not only in America, but in Africa and around the world. Blacks will never be the equals of whites, because blacks are not as smart as whites. They
       <em>
        cannot do
       </em>
       many of the things that whites do. The
       <em>

       If you notice, low IQ is germane to Africa. It has nothing to do with education. The American black has an average IQ of 85, and thats with a 25% admixture of European. I don't want to sound crude but facts are facts and we need to start recognizing the facts if we want to get anywhere on the racial issues in America. Blaming black lack of success on the evil white man is counter productive, especially when it is really cognitive  impairment
