        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We think we are so smart, now that we know that international bankers are weasels. As if an epiphany for mankind occurred.</p>

<p>Looking back at our previous currency crisis scenarios, it is blatantly obvious that we have been down this road several times.</p>

<p>When Roosevelt took control, he blamed Bankers for economic depressions.</p>

<p>&quot;Roosevelt began blaming the economic crisis on bankers and financiers, the quest for profit, and the self-interest basis of capitalism: Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange of mankind&#39;s goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men. True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence... The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.&quot;</p>

<p>I ran into Roosevelt because I was looking at events from 1935, when the &quot;eye of providence&quot; (Illuminati&#39;s claimed logo) appeared on our currency. </p>

<p>Since, Roosevelt makes it evident that they too have previously fallen victim to malicious usury from International bankers, we begin to see a pattern. </p>

<p>So I looked at the currency of early America. When we believed in our constitution, and feared tyranny. </p>

<p>I noticed that the &quot;eye of providence&quot; was looked at in negative light.</p>

<p>On one bill, the pyramid is missing the eye completely.</p>

<p>On another bill (Continental Congress note 1776), there is a capstone with no eye inside. In fact, it is being guarded from the &quot;sun&quot; (Osiris) with the warning to the sun &quot;Mind your business&quot;. This blew my mind.</p>

<p>TLDR: Previous currencies have anti-eye_of_Providence art work</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever heard of the company cutco? The company that employs people to go door to door and sell knives to people?  Well the whole company is simply a large net cast out to find people with natural sales skills.  And if you sell a lot of knives for a year or so, the &quot;real&quot; company (I forget the name, but if you Google it you&#39;ll find it) will contact you and offer you a job.   </p>

<p>That&#39;s basically what freemasons and skull and bones are.  They&#39;re the cutco for the real group.  </p>

<p>No, you would &quot;allow&quot; organizations, the more secret the better, to flourish and thus give the peasants something else to shoot at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that one method of trying to unite the world would be to first destabilize it by igniting religious tensions, and then step in to offer the world the stability it desires.   And I can see that working.</p>

<p>But I could also see it working by trying to unite them instead.  Just go in and offer superior infrastructure in exchange for cooperation.  Almost like the Romans did. Go around building aquaducts and then they&#39;ll see that joining the nwo would benefit all their people.   </p>

<p>But all I see now is more central banks siphoning off wealth.  Which makes it look from the outside like greed... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the illuminati as a grand conspiracy may be mostly bunk at this point.  But when people say illumati these days there is certainly an oligarchical class that fulfills that role today.  Those who control most of the wealth and governments of the world, while never running for office, or being known by the public at large.</p>

<p>That said there does seem to be something to the rituals, the orgies and the sacrifices among elites that harkens back to the cult driven illuminati.  And people like Aleister Crowly made connections and inspired many within the wealthy class.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious what your opinion on the true man/men behind the curtain(s) is/are.</p>
