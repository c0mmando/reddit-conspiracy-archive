       If my car battery is dead and I sat in my car all day turning the key that would be retarded. The claim that abstaining from voting is wrong is like thinking that battery will suddenly recharge itself.

       You're not getting a candidate worth a damn, just like the dead battery analogy, you'd have to go buy one.  That being said, if you don't know who stands for what/ whats going on, obviously don't vote, but its not useless to vote, you may get fucked either way, but there's always a better and a worse and if you sit there with your thumb up your ass and get "worse" you played a part in causing the problem.

       So, ok. What if I truly don't see one being better. What if I AM informed and all choices are fundamentally repugnant...as is the usual. Do I just pick red or blue then? ;)

       If we can't get candidates that are worth a damn, then it is just a game after all. I don't play games with peoples lives. I object.

       Ok, If you can't find an upside in any candidate thats fine, but i've never felt I can't decide on SOMEone.  I'll admit, if Bernie isn't in the running its gonna be tough because Hillary isn't happening and the G.O.P. candidates are just

       EditEdit:  Yea, I know... I'm not anti-vax.  I don't think risk outweighs benefits for most people, the thimerisol in flu-vax does concern me, but I don't take issue with the mmr-vax.

       I respect Sanders for being honest. I'm not socialist though. I respect Carson for the same reasons, and he might be a good man, but I disagree with him on too many fundamental points.

      <p>
       I wish I could know that Rand was just playing politics (being too cozy with McConnell) and if he won he would put the Republicans through the ringer after what happened to his dad. But I can't even vote for him atm.

       When did casting a one time approval vote for a 4 year public figurehead become 'participating in democracy'? Probably around the time this nation became obsessed with children's games of sport and showing their allegiance to one of the franchise

       No, it's not just 'things are hard'. We humans have learned how to make things really really easy for ourselves. But the money system we use was rigged from the beginning and the imbalance of power was used to exploit the overwhelming majority and makes things hard, so miserable that a generation is foregoing childbirth, a necessary part of the cycle of life.

       You can't have a discussion with insults. Ffs, you really think getting salty on an internet forum does any good? You ruined my comment here because I'm addressing your churlishness instead of your first paragraph.

       If you do the same in real life be prepared to be alone.
