<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m Starting to worry, I&#39;m not one that gets paranoid or into conspiracy theories but this jade helm thing is scary, they filled both Wal-Mart&#39;s the closed one in big spring and the major one in Midland, we watched them filling the one on big spring full of their body bag boxes the military ships dead bodies home in and then they closed I20 down for 2hrs to the public while over 100 unmarked trucks unloaded in Midland. Today a 48 mi long train full of military vehicles came through here and left half it&#39;s load in big springs and the other half in Midland, what&#39;s really fixing to happen? Where do we go? They&#39;re talking about tx being an oppositional state and martial law exercise.</p>

<p>My boss told me he saw the body bags being trucked in and he sent his wife to his parents country house, he&#39;s worried too, no point in all these body boxes for a training exercise</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Body bags and coffins?</p>

<p>Her friend took video and she&#39;s asked him for the link. I&#39;ll update if that happens.</p>

not that i believe anything out of the ordinary is taking place , cause really, what&#39;s ordinary these days?, but there is a huge difference between something conducted in a few counties in N.C. and a multi- state operation with designated hot zones in zones where the population is hot.  The thing is ,  sometimes these drills go live or something really bad happens at the coincidental moment the drill is getting into high gear.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKvkhe3rqtc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKvkhe3rqtc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>But they have done this for decades.  They always train off base in America.. they are just typically away from populated areas.  I remember in 2012, US and Russian Soldiers were training in the US and everyone got crazy about that too because they thought we were somehow teaming up with the Russians to attack Americans because it would be easier for Russian soldiers to pull the trigger on American civilians than it would be for American soldiers... naturally no civilians were killed by anybody and the training came and passed without any incident but still the InfoWars and other like-minded alternative news sources reported about those exercises as if it was the beginning of the end for America as we know it.  It&#39;s just hysteria pumped up by people like Alex Jones becuase the more he hypes up something like this, the more people will tune into his broadcasts and the more money they&#39;ll spend on his shitty survival food.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t really a change.  The majority of their training is still away from populated areas.  People are just seeking the training out now.  If the government was going to use the military to take over Texas don&#39;t you think they would do it secretly instead of announcing that they are having training and releasing where it is going to happen and when?  Wouldn&#39;t it be much easier if they waited until like 3am one night without ever saying anything and had a bunch of helicopters full of soldiers descend on major cities while everyone was sleeping?  They are training in desert areas of TX California and Utah because that is similar terrain to the Middle East.  </p>

Now that everybody over there is whipped into a frenzy because they think that they are being taken over by the government if something does happen people will call it a false flag no matter what.  Even if some civilian really does start some shit because they think they are defending their homeland against a tyrannical government it will be called a false flag.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I was talking about Marshall law. It&#39;s where my buddy Marshall decides to be a kill joy and enforce a bunch of over the top rules on a random group of people that he just feels &#39;meh&#39;  about. He does it when he gets a little moody once in a while. I usually keep some snickers on hand to cool him down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh sorry, I forgot that good spelling makes the argument. I guess that perfect spelling means that the government is going for martial law. Great observation, I&#39;ll make sure to quadruple check for the quality readers of reddit next time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, of course that&#39;s a straw man argument: that good spelling makes the argument.  Bad spelling, on the other hand, is an indication that the argument comprised around it, will also be bad.</p>

<p>Typos are a form of spelling mistake that isn&#39;t such a strong indication.  Homophonic substitution, as in Marshall for martial, is.</p>

My cousin recently told me that he actually saw aliens helping the military load the bodybags onto trucks that were hovering using some kind of new technology that runs of the blood of citizens who question the government.  He says he has a video and will send it to me, I&#39;ll update if that happens.</p>
