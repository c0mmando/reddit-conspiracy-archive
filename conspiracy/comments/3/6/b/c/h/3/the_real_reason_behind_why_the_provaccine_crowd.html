        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe the underlying motivation for the majority of the &quot;pro-vaccine&quot; people, and especially those who wish to force people into getting all vaccines at the US version of a vaccine schedule, is not what it seems. I&#39;ve personally witnessed quite a few openly pro-vaccine coworkers go to work with the flu, which is extremely inconsiderate and a way that you can legally kill somebody. The flu kills many thousands each year and going to work spreading your illness is not helping anybody.</p>

<p>They are so selfish that they will risk the lives of others because they don&#39;t want to miss a few days of work. So, Reddit, I have to ask, what is the real reason that most people are so against any form of suspicion of vaccines? It&#39;s clearly not because they actually care about the lives of others. It must be some kind of sick control fetish they have. They just want everyone to fall in line as they have.</p>

<p>There also seems to be a quasi-religious aspect to it as well- authority worship. You just gotta have faith in the pharmaceutical corporations that they will, to the best of their ability, create vaccines and perform scientific studies with the public&#39;s best interests in mind. If it has the &quot;science stamp of approval,&quot; it is objectively correct and no grey areas exist, just as followers of religions blindly follow what their priest claims. The scientists are the priests, the corporations are churches, and the vaccines are the blood and body of Christ, now take your offering!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s crazy to me is that the same people who are rabidly pro vaccine and say if you don&#39;t vaccinate your kids you&#39;re putting their kids at risk of dying of horrible diseases, have absolutely nothing to say about the millions of illegals crossing the border with highly contagious diseases that have no vaccines. Drug resistant TB has no vaccine, and is carried by many illegal border crossers. Where&#39;s the outrage? If these people were really so concerned about public health, wouldn&#39;t they demand we stop the flow of illegals who are carrying so many diseases? But they don&#39;t care about that, because they are hypocrites.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shitty math. 1 out of 100,000 = .001 percent, which is actually higher than many other diseases that are vaccinated against.

    <div class="md"><p>Notice how nowhere in my post I made any claims about whether we should all get vaccines or not. I&#39;m specifically only talking about the hypocrisy of people who are militantly pro-vaccine, yet go to work/school/the store with the flu. We could even get into guessing how many pro-vaccine people speed on highways, putting people in danger. They don&#39;t actually give a shit about the lives of others, so what is their motivation?</p>

<p>Lets be real here. Do you actually take a week off from work if you get the flu? And don&#39;t even try to claim that you don&#39;t get the flu because you get flu-shots. Last year they got the wrong strain and people still came down with the flu.</p>
