    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t fleshed out the idea entirely. But basically what we refer to as &#39;reptilian&#39; are people who turn off the human or sympathetic part of their brain in order to gain money/power/influence. They might not even consider themselves to be human. They probably think of themselves as superior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah- I have always thought of it as our reptilian brains, basically our lower consciousness or survival instinct.

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding certain bloodlines can host/channel these reptilians.  I have also heard that there are reptilian aliens that feed on humans. (not saying i believe any of this) There are many videos of world leaders with there eyes changing into what appears to be reptilian eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t get over the idea there is a malevolent non-human force interfering in some ways. I think Reptilian is just a modern name to what people have referred to throughout history as demons, d&#39;jinns, faeries, archons etc; something that can take over the mind of a human or shapeshift into human form. The idea is much, much older than David Icke. Check out Gnosticism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to others, however, they believe the reptilian race is very real. In fact, it is the serpent being mentioned in the book of Genesis that temps Eve into eating from the tree of knowledge. I think either side makes sense but it would be nice to know the truth. The race being real is a bit creepy. If theyre real though I find the good guys to be real was well and if theyre real just ask for their help and youll be more than well off. According to the same source, the angels punished the nacash, the serpent being, by breaking its arms and legs off. The screams could be heard throughout the universe. It was punishment for messing with the creation of man by God. I really think its all pretty cool.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was working the register one day and this kid who looked like a body building steroid junkie came up. He had great muscle conformation but he was razor thin. His trapezius  muscles,  from his neck to his shoulder, was developed till it was almost straight from the point of his shoulder to his ear, but it was only a half inch thick. He spoke with a slithery lisp and looked furtively around never looking me in the eyes. I have believed since that day.</p>
