       I haven't fleshed out the idea entirely. But basically what we refer to as 'reptilian' are people who turn off the human or sympathetic part of their brain in order to gain money/power/influence. They might not even consider themselves to be human. They probably think of themselves as superior.

       yeah- I have always thought of it as our reptilian brains, basically our lower consciousness or survival instinct. If you got attacked and killed the person attacking you out of defense it wouldn't be as malicious as if you actually stalked and attacked and murdered someone.

       I think its just a joke they put out there so if anyone becomes interested in conspiracy topics and they find this one they think, "wow, what a bunch of retards." That is when they stop researching. That's what I think it's really all about.

       Nothing is too crazy. If the multiverse view is true, and there are infinate numbers of infinate expanses we call the universe then in one of them, somewhere, there are lizard people ruling humans on a flat hollow earth. Now, I don't think we're in that universe, or on that earth, but what a trip it would be to find out ya were.

       I'm not sure if that is a possible scenario even in the multiverse theory. As far as I know, the other laws of physics would still apply, so I can't see how a hollow or flat earth would not collapse or be ripped to shreds by gravitational forces.

       Infinite possibilities in infinite universes means there is a universe which is created by God, which contradicts science. Just because someone like Steven Hawking says it doesn't mean it's true, even scientists fantasize.

       I've always believed it to be a metaphor for those who lack humanity and empathy or those who seek power and wealth through corruption (and/or both). I think very few people actually believe that there are lizard people walking around in human costumes.

       From my understanding certain bloodlines can host/channel these reptilians.  I have also heard that there are reptilian aliens that feed on humans. (not saying i believe any of this) There are many videos of world leaders with there eyes changing into what appears to be reptilian eyes.

       I can't get over the idea there is a malevolent non-human force interfering in some ways. I think Reptilian is just a modern name to what people have referred to throughout history as demons, d'jinns, faeries, archons etc; something that can take over the mind of a human or shapeshift into human form. The idea is much, much older than David Icke. Check out Gnosticism.

       According to others, however, they believe the reptilian race is very real. In fact, it is the serpent being mentioned in the book of Genesis that temps Eve into eating from the tree of knowledge. I think either side makes sense but it would be nice to know the truth. The race being real is a bit creepy. If theyre real though I find the good guys to be real was well and if theyre real just ask for their help and youll be more than well off. According to the same source, the angels punished the nacash, the serpent being, by breaking its arms and legs off. The screams could be heard throughout the universe. It was punishment for messing with the creation of man by God. I really think its all pretty cool.

       I was working the register one day and this kid who looked like a body building steroid junkie came up. He had great muscle conformation but he was razor thin. His trapezius  muscles,  from his neck to his shoulder, was developed till it was almost straight from the point of his shoulder to his ear, but it was only a half inch thick. He spoke with a slithery lisp and looked furtively around never looking me in the eyes. I have believed since that day.

       I won't discount the possibility,  but most of the reptilian boosters have shit hypothesis and Icky is batshit crazy. With that being said, it's still a possibility that a race evolved from reptiles.

       Don't dismiss it completely, but think it more likely a metaphor for people still driven by the reptile core in our brain than actual real six foot tall reptiles. Could easily be what's keeping Icke alive, the crazy caveat that nullifies his many good points to the majority of humanity.
