       For the past month, i've been reading and watching everything I can related to 9/11. Unfortunately, I am convinced that 9/11 was committed by the US government. All 3 WTC were controlled demolition, not sure the deal with the Pentagon and Flight 93, but there's enough evidence that conflicts with the gov't's narrative. 
I've read the Popular Mechanics article that claims to debunk the truth movement, but i've subsequently read and watched many sources that then debunk the Popular Mechanics debunkers.
This is completely fucking with my head. At this point I actually want to be convinced that i'm wrong. Can anyone, who believes the US Gov't's story, explain why they don't believe 9/11 was a conspiracy?

       Once you dig beneath the surface, so to speak, there is no looking back. The naivet√© is gone; you no longer have an unquestioned faith in the US government. There is no point to try to convince you otherwise. Don't let the truth scare you to the point of being downtrodden. Take the emotions you say you are feeling and turn them into something productive.

       JFK took away faith in the government. It seems like the only ones who learned from it were the ones behind it.  They learned the steps needed to be taken to fool the people long enoungh so they could get to their graves without doing time.   We can get H.W. if we push it.

       This isn't a case of "I want to believe" nonsense. Most people here are only interested in truth. For 9/11, that just happens to be that the government story is BS.

       Well I now feel like an idiot about my post. You're right, I shouldn't be asking for convincing. I meant rather, does anyone have a source of information that assuaged all their doubts they had about the official government narrative. As i'm sure you've all experienced, I am becoming alienated from my friends and family for this opinion. They think i'm insane. I was just looking for maybe some information I missed during my research that supports the government's story.
I've been red pilled fairly recently and it's all a bit overwhelming. Not to mention almost lonely. I feel like I can't talk about this with anyone, yet I feel the need to tell everyone about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: I apologize for my stupidly worded post. Does anyone have a source that supports the government's 9/11 narrative in a scientifically accurate way?

       I have. Definitely the best documentary on 9/11 that I've seen. That documentary basically removed any doubts I had in the truth movement. The documentary made me Architects and Engineers for 9/11 truth is fantastic as well. It's all science and fact driven.

       The scientific way like the whole jet fuel can't melt steel beams? Because people have been making steel armor and weapons and for hundreds of years. Of course steel is gonna melt from jet fuel, hell you can melt it WITHOUT jet fuel.

       You can melt it without jet fuel, in a

       Fact is, the way steel disipates heat, in order to even weaken it, you need a concentrated amount of heat, in a small area, in a small amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fires in the WTC were oxygen starved as evident by the black, sooty smoke produced.  There is no scientific evidence that the temps were anywhere close to the conditions necessary to even weaken steel.  Which makes the reports of molton steel very hard to explain.

       Last I checked no one pours kerosene on some steel and lights a match to smelt it. Most of today's engines are made entirely from aluminum, which melts at around 600f. I've witnessed car fires after an oil filter spins itself loose and I've never seen fire melt an engine. I've seen a car burn to the frame, but no molten engine, no weakened frame.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if a 20 minute fire can't so much warp a soft metal let alone melt it, what is a bit fire going to do to reinforced steel?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're asking a pretty big leap of logic here.

       Remember Benjamin Chertoff was the one who originally penned the Popular Mechanics article.  I would call him being a relative to then Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff a conflict of interest.  He at first denied any relation until someone asked his mom.  Then he said, if you look you will find a relation there.

       Surely the simplest way to show the official narrative is false is by the simple fact that in the only video that is legitimately him, Bin Laden denied being reponsible, and even said the US Government was responsible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely Al Qaeda, which is fast to claim responsibility for small bombings around the world, would be scrambling and making it very clear that they were responsible for the most sophisticated, successful and devastating attack against the greatest superpower of all time.

       OP-
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the buildings falling is a sideshow. Instantly, those that accept the official narrative point to the buildings falling as conspiracytards.
      </p>
      <p>
       HOW ABOUT THIS:
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares how the buildings fell? Look at all that has happened since. A corrupt war. Our economy has dropped thru the floor. A secret law was passed, that we are only beginning to understand its effects 10 years later. Militarization of the police. "Homegrown" terror.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US govt ignored credible info from allies of an impending attack. Most of the military was imperforming a drill on 911. The passport and engine that ended up on Church street. I mean, cmon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you find out that these things have happened to other civilizations (ie Rome), you see the forest thru the trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr;  The buildings falling, I think, is just a distraction.

       Yup, focusing on the demolition question is a sidetrack. The evidence is gone. Other evidence is still available and irrefutable.

       Go ahead and try to prove the official version to yourself. You will fail and spiral into the same rabbit hole of truth.

       I think you did pick the right sub for this. Most of what you will see in other subs will be the "least persuasive argument" that has worked to convince that one person. You will see a lot of appeals to authority, ad hominem, appeal to popularity, appeal to ignorance, etc. If there is some argument that could convince you (or me for that matter) it would likely come from someone here.

       Unfortunately, this sub is no better than any others as far as this goes. There are many, many posts daily that are editorialized, misunderstood, exaggerated, or simply wrong. People regularly make claims without sources, or just make things up. This sub is no different from any other in that regard.

       What are the chances they release the tapes at the pentagon?  Or the chances that they made any changes in the building codes other than more robust fire proofing that doesn't dislodge that easy since then?   Surely they would have had to change that if it came down like they said it did.  What are the chances that vote was political?  Just like the NIST report that has never been peer reviewed.  What are the chances of the NIST report being peer reviewed?  ROTFLMAO!!
      </p>
      <p>
       What were the chances that Henry Kissinger would be the first one the Bush white house named to head the 911 commission?   What were the chances that Bush would testify without Cheney under oath?  Or the chances of the 911 commission coming out with anything that didn't support the official story with white house insider Phillip Zelicow as the executive director?  What were the chances that almost everyone incharge of intelligence and air defense that day would be promoted opposed to fired?  I think it was 96% on that also.

       No one really cares about "convincing" you or other people. Maybe I speak for myself, but I'm just a naturally curious person. Thus, during my research I found a lot of facts that didn't add up on how 9/11 took place. Its up to you to make sense of what happened, follow the information and see where it takes you. 
Nonetheless this video does a pretty good job and mentioning the weirdness about the whole event.

       If it was a closed system, which according to NIST it was, momentum cannot change or increase as it would need to do to continue to destroy floor after floor. Again, high school physics.

       First of all, I don't want to debate anyone on the facts here because it never ends well when I do. But here's my opinion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Documentaries/youtube videos are a terrible way to form an opinion. They are nearly always incredibly biased, and they are good for convincing people of something, even when there isn't much evidence to support it. You can skew and twist the facts all you want and the average viewer isn't going to have the time or motivation to check. And I'm not specifically talking about 9/11 documentaries here, this is just a general statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want an informed opinion you should read the actual science, and so I would suggest you start with
       <a href="http://www.civil.northwestern.edu/people/bazant/PDFs/Papers/405.pdf">
        this
       </a>
       . This paper is NOT by NIST, it is an independent peer reviewed paper by a world famous structural engineer that discusses in detail how the twin towers collapsed from the plane impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are interested in the consensus among experts in this field, I would point you toward a recent vote by the American Institute for Architects. They voted on whether or not to do a new investigation into building 7. The motion was voted down 3892-160... There was a lot of hype on this subreddit leading up to the vote, but interestingly enough I don't see any posts about the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for what it's worth (I know this is anecdotal) I am a structural engineer and I have only ever met a single structural engineer who disagrees with the official report. So I believe the consensus among people in my own field is similarly overwhelming.

       Here is a starting point for anyone attempting to validate the governments theory.  I tried to keep the you tube reference points to a minimum, however it could not be all together avoided.  I do like the way you are attempting to get in front of the issue that the NIST report is not peer reviewed.  That is the official theory to this date.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have a peer reviewed source, why aren't they asking for a new investigation regardless of what theory they have the buildings coming down as?  If it supports what NIST is saying, why hasn't NIST's been peer reviewed?  Does it address the points brought up here?  Does it address all the other unrelated issues that leave serious questions with the official story?*

        Here is article
       </a>
       with the specific questions to the 25 points the NIST report either omitted or distorted contrary to scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are legitimate questions and those issues need to be addressed before anyone can view the  NIST final report as scientific opposed to political motivated. There also needs to be transparency on their input data for the collapse models.  To this date, the computer model input data and software have not been made available to the actual architects &amp; structural engineers who design and build those structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       If fires brought them down like the NIST report states, that should have been made available to at least those communities, to eliminate the potential for it to happen again in new buildings, or to determine if existing buildings would need to be retrofitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NIST report has not been peer reviewed to this date.  The following report:
       <a href="http://www.scientistsfor911truth.org/docs/IEEE_Ethics_Paper_030714.pdf">
        Ethics and the Official Reports about the Destruction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers on 9/11: A Case Study
       </a>
       highlights the failures of the NIST investigation to follow the most basic fundamental procedures.  They also have not made their data or computer models available to structural engineers or for peer review.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the Popular Mechanics books and articles in relation to 9/11, there are conflicts of interest that question the objective view point they claim to have.  The most serious of which is the original report was penned by
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Chertoff">
        Benjamin Chertoff.
       </a>
       Related to the head of the Dept. of Homeland Security at the time
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff">
        Michael Chertoff.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That report appears to be politically motivated, opposed to being made out of scientific curiosity.  Their reports have been rebutted by the scientific community, who had nothing to gain, every thing to lose, and based on their conclusions on evidence that is supported with the video record and known laws of physics..

        Here is a lecture given by David Ray Griffin

       that puts the Popular Mechanics "investigation" in the proper light, and has yet to be challenged.

       Here are peer reviewed published articles in mainstream scientific journals that question the official accounting of the events of that day.

       The National Geographic specials on the issue are also lacking any realistic data on the actual events of that day.

        This scene
       </a>
       shows a steel beam failing with jet fuel being the heat source.  Their are many issues that are misleading about this footage.  The first one is that the show itself admits that the temps. produced during their experiment were not present in the WTC fires.  The second issue is the whole length of the beam was heated, with a undetermined amount of weight placed at the weakest part.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KvMxf9i.jpg">
        Here is one of the types of beam used at the WTC.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A beam could fail with no heat if enough of a load was focused on the weakest point.  Those types of beams were not used in the WTC.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Q3IGLDYxqdI?t=53s">
        This video is another example of what it takes to cause steel to be weakened and the force required to shape it.

       shows the top of the tower tilted approx. 22 degrees, and should have continued to fall like the building in this

        clip.
       </a>
       The way the building topples over, and does not disintegrate in mid air is how the tower should have behaved.  Some force other than gravity was acting on it to have it travel through the path of most resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4mDzgSP.jpg">
        image.
       </a>
       The path the debris is slightly upward and outward, working against gravity.  If you also notice most of the debris cloud is outside the footprint of the building.  There is not enough material working together to pile drive its way through the path of most resistance.  The undamaged bottoms of the tower.   The cloud shows the direction the energy was expended.  Up and out.  Gravity pulls down.

       is the bottom of the plane from four different angles.  Each angle shows an anomaly on the bottom right side of the air craft.  It is not a trick of light and shadows or the paint scheme since it is present at four different angles.
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DT2aifl.png">
        Here is the flash BEFORE impact on the south tower from four different angles.
       </a>
       These anomalies are present on all footage showing the bottom of the plane.No mention was ever made of either anomaly in the 9/11 official reports.  They are direct video evidence available to the public, and the commission.
      </p>

       This is only a small portion of what the official story has working against it.  If answers can be provided with LEGITIMATE scientific backing, opposed to finding reasons why questions shouldn't be asked, or attacking the ones who asked them, we can move on to the next set of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to get this insane notion out of my head that we have been not told truth about the events of that day, and the investigation that followed.  And that all these educated scientists, scholars, pilots, architects, engineers, former high ranking military, FDNY, PhD's, and former high level administration officials are in fact insane, opposed to the official story that has relied on unverifiable theories, and the omition and distortion of evidence.

       9/11 happen on 9/11/01 and this "independent peer reviewed paper" was written on 9/13/01 (??) with revisions dated 9/22/01 and 9/28/01. That doesn't sound like a full peer review was possible?

       Can we be sure the 3000 plus AIA members fully understood the case against NIST's b7 report and that NIST admitted to 2.25 seconds of free fall? It takes much more than six minutes to see inside NIST's deception.

       This isn't a case of "I want to believe" nonsense. Most people here are only interested in truth. For 9/11, that just happens to be that the government story is BS.
