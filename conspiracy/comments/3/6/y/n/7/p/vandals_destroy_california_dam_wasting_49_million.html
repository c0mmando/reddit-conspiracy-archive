      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Sophistication of attack
       </p>
       <p>
        Former Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Jon Wellinghoff stated that military experts informed him that the assault looked like a "professional job," noting that no fingerprints were discovered on the empty shell casings.[6] He has described the attack as "the most significant incident of domestic terrorism involving the grid that has ever occurred".[8]
       </p>
       <p>
        Henry Waxman, the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee stated that the attack was, '"an unprecedented and sophisticated attack on an electric grid substation with military-style weapons. Communications were disrupted. The attack inflicted substantial damage. It took weeks to replace the damaged parts. Under slightly different conditions, there could have been serious power outages or worse."[7]
       </p>
       <p>
        Preparation
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the attack, a series of fiber-optic telecommunications cables operated by AT&amp;T were cut by the culprits. Additionally, following the attack, investigators found small piles of rocks near to where the shots had been fired, the type of formations which can be used to scout firing positions.[6][7]

       Yeah I find the "Vandals" causing this to be true if you replace "vandals" with "government agent". And to think that California is under a major drought this would happen huh do smell what I thing I smell and that is bullshit.

       The thing about the San Jose attack, that makes me think it was a legitimate attack, was the fact it wasn't reported for a year (except local news).  Typically it would be bigger news, although it did happen the day
       <del>
        before
       </del>
       after the Boston Bombing, so maybe it was just overshadowed.

       These words were/are
       <strong>
        EXACTLY
       </strong>
       the false and contrived premise of Operation Gladio:  staging false-flag "terrorist" bombings and blaming it on Leftists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the original link to the relevant part of Wikipedia's entry on Operation Gladio:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio#2000_Parliamentary_report:_a_.22strategy_of_tension.22">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, that link has been SCRUBBED from Wikipedia during the past 30 days.  I don't have time to dig up my screenshot, but I'm sure you can find it with Google or simply read about Operation Gladio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would NATO or the Pentagon want to stage fake &amp; contrived "eco-terrorism" and blame it on "Leftist" groups?
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is exactly the same answer it was in the 1970s.
      </p>
      <p>
       The SCRUBBED Parliamentary report from the Wikipedia entry described the documented findings of Italy's Parliament that NATO conducted false flag bombing campaigns &amp; blamed the Left to shift electoral results away from "Leftist" election victories and toward hard-right-wing election victories.

       Yes. The patriot/militia movement represents American values and justice, so they must blame them for terror attacks and try to demonize them or turn public away from them.

       However, its back firing. After the World Trade Center 1993 bombing, everyone just assumes that any terrorist attack had government involvement.  ISIS would not exist without US government recruitment and funding.

       I haven't watched much TV in many years, but I remember a while back that there was a commercial with some corporate exec (maybe form GE, but I don't remember).  In the commercial, he says that his hobby is busting dams.  That's what I was referencing in my mind.  This guys hobby was de-industrialization.  But, the whole commercial was about it.
