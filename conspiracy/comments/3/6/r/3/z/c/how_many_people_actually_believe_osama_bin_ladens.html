       Youre not crazy, man. To believe this "reading list" is legit is to put 100% faith in the words that come out of provably corrupted individuals. I, for one, dont have that much faith in the people who, time and time again, have made decisions and statements that nepotistically favor the well-borns rather than The People.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of those cases where it could be 100% true, or it could be 100% false, or it could be 50/50. We have absolutely no way of knowing for sure -- thus to make a choice of opinion on the matter is done so subjectively in faith, rather than objectively.

       This is the exact reason people accuse "conspiracy theorists" of claiming everything is a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that everything is a conspiracy. It's just that knowing what we know, there is a deep distrust of the government and corporations.. and it's well founded.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like having a chronically abusive, lying family member. You always want to give them the benefit of the doubt, and usually do, because you love them. Time and time again you get betrayed and disappointed.. but for most people, they still continue the unhealthy cycle of co-dependance. For others, they realize that just because they are a family member and you love them, doesn't mean you have to be naive about everything they do wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be real about it. Don't assume fault, that's not fair.. but question everything.

       Yes, it is the same situation. Whereby only a few select individuals truely know what happened that day, and since all "evidence" is withheld from public scrutiny save those hand selected to be presented (undoubtedly with ulterior motives), to believe Osama was actuslly killed, and in such a manner as those select few decided to share with us, is to, again, put 100% faith in the words coming from provably corrupt individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cant deny the events of that day, but nor can i subscribe to the alledged events either.

       The reading list is fascinating with so many conspiracy books on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, either one of these scenarios could be the truth:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. This is the reading list of an actual person, who may or may not have 'played' the character of OBL at some point after the real OBL died. Many of the videos released after a certain point are clearly fakes and several different people must have filled this function at some point, perhaps one of them was an ISI agent living in abbottobad. It almost reads like a list of study materials for someone on the inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. This is a fake reading list meant to embarrass and/or discredit the books contained within,  also to conflate conspiracy theorists with terrorists.

       I was thinking the same thing, actually. Why would his reading list contain books like:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Al-Qaeda’s Online Media Strategies: From Abu Reuter to Irhabi 007 by Hanna Rogan *(Id think, being the "leader", hed know all about his own organization's strategies...)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A Brief Guide to Understanding Islam by I. A. Ibrahim
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Again, why? Did he have a have probpems understanding his own religion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Makes more sense to me, what you said. I mean, there might be some legit reasons for these, but i jist cant think up of one atm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think maybe its a combination of your A) and B), as the list contains a wide variety of books and content, which may actually have some truths, but undoubtedly has many omissions as well as some additional titles invluded, in order to draw that parallel between terrorists and conspiracy theorists...

       The disinformation working. Several faithers I've talked to in the past few days/seen posts by on social media preach it like the Gospel "Oh, Bin Laden and his crazy books. No wonder he why he hated America. I hope he burns in hell."

Noam Chomsky and some other heavy books in native english.

       Michael Ruppert's Crossing the Rubicon caught me off guard.

       Those three books, in combination with the MKUltra hearings... Ok, the message they are trying to deliver by presenting this as "OBL's bookshelf" seems pretty clear. Don't accept the truth. Ignore that shit.

       My mother talked to me today about this, she said she remembered me buying one of those books several years ago (i'm more of a non-fiction history reader, although I do love a bit of fantasy). I had mistaken her initial concern as a "why are you reading this", after talking to her I realized her concern was "why are they trying to associate those books with OBL?". Doing this has had the exact opposite effect than they had probably hoped.

       My family didn't demonize me for this, they asked why I was being demonized for this.

       Well, they say there is an 'extensive' list of porn that they are not going to release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds like either Osama was just as much as a religious fanatic as his highjackers (ie, not at all) or the list is bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, Osama knew he was a wanted man. Guy would have used incognito mode.

       I'm looking at 3 possibilities:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) they're genuine, and releasing them adds to the "refined psychopath" image they be cultivated for OBL.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) they're fake as hell. And by using these books, they allude to these kinds of books as being bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) it's a calculated disinfo move, aiming to change the conversation to irrelevant questions. "Why would Osama have a truther book?"

       They could have come out with this stupid story at any time since the "raid" but only released it after the Seymour Hirsch story came out.  Pretty obvious what's going on here. It's their typical modus operandi.

       pfft, every single title was carefully chosen to create a specific impression of this individual in the publ7c mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or mzybe it's really a portion of the individuals real collection with an unknown quantity of specific titles removed to prevent the public from forming an im9ression of the individual that is undesirable to the narrative being created.
