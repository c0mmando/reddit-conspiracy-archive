    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so many layers of lies and subterfuge going on here, while I don&#39;t think Hersh is wilfully complicit, I think the truth of the whole stinking mess is likely found in the description below:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/05/11/seymour-hersh-succumbs-disinformation-paul-craig-roberts/">Seymour Hersh Succumbs To Disinformation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do not believe Hersh’s story for <strong>three reasons</strong>. One reason is that bin Laden was suffering from disease that no one can survive for a decade. His death was widely reported in 2001. One reason is that even Hersh’s “true” account of “what really happened” is contradicted by eye witnesses and the initial Pakistani TV interviews of eye witnesses. One reason is that Hersh’s story is too convoluted for an assassination raid, a routine event. He exposes lies within lies, indecision within decision, payoffs within payoffs, and reports such a huge number of people with advance knowledge of the raid that it cannot possibly have been kept a secret.</p>

<p>I could add a fourth reason–the US government’s lack of credibility. Washington lies about everything. For example: Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, Assad’s use of chemical weapons, Iranian nukes, Russian invasion of Ukraine. If, as Hersh reports, lies comprise 99% of Washington’s tale of the raid in Abbottabad, why believe that 1% of the story is true and that bin Laden was killed. It is difficult to have murder without a body. The only evidence that bin Laden was killed is the government’s claim.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Washington’s disinformation agencies have finally managed to deceive Seymour Hersh with a concocted “inside story” that saves Washington’s claim of having murdered bin Laden by proving that the US government is an extraordinary liar and violator of law.</p>

<p>The two things aren&#39;t necessarily unrelated. We have decades of government education and compliant corporate media programming to thank for what passes for the average American&#39;s critical thinking skills.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>I quit, I think</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’ve come slowly to understand what it is I really teach: A curriculum of confusion, class position, arbitrary justice, vulgarity, rudeness, disrespect for privacy, indifference to quality, and utter dependency. I teach how to fit into a world I don’t want to live in.</p>

<p>I just can’t do it anymore. I can’t train children to wait to be told what to do; I can’t train people to drop what they are doing when a bell sounds; I can’t persuade children to feel some justice in their class placement when there isn’t any, and I can’t persuade children to believe teachers have valuable secrets they can acquire by becoming our disciples. That isn’t true.</p>

<p>Government schooling is the most radical adventure in history. It kills the family by monopolizing the best times of childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents.</p>

<p>An exaggeration? Hardly. Parents aren’t meant to participate in our form of schooling, rhetoric to the contrary. My orders as schoolteacher are to make children fit an animal training system, not to help each find his or her personal path.</p>

<p>The whole blueprint of school procedure is Egyptian, not Greek or Roman. It grows from the faith that human value is a scarce thing, represented symbolically by the narrow peak of a pyramid.</p>

<p>Stop this nonsense. SEALs that died in the helicopter crash were from Gold squadron, the SEALs that did the raid were from Red squadron. </p>

<p>There are close to 200 operators in DEVGRU. I&#39;m tired of hearing complete nonsense in this sub, people ignorant about the most basic facts.</p>

<p>lol... Yeah ok. That&#39;s the dumbest thing i&#39;ve read.</p>

<p>DEVGRU members were there, they did the mission. JSOC ordered it. Sorry, not everything is a conspiracy. Hersh story is already discredited. </p>

<p>Only conspiracy about the OBL raid was if Pakistan ISI was involved in killing the gold squadron SEALs, for revenge. some  of us who know what we are talking about think so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but don&#39;t you think these respected journalists have the potential to recognize the fact that they can be fed disinformation?

<p>The potential, sure. I&#39;m certain that good journalist probably turn down many stories that just don&#39;t seem &quot;right&quot;. But, anyone can get fooled, as big lies always seem more believable in the right circumstances. Limited hangout type operations don&#39;t require every &quot;asset&quot; to know the real deal, in fact it works better when they don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Also, Hersh may be a victim of his own past successes, for instance when he broke the Mỹ Lai Massacre story he may have effectively drew attention away from a far broader range of atrocities.  Again, I can&#39;t say he was wilfully complicit, but that doesn&#39;t mean he wasn&#39;t useful to certain factions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t need to &quot;believe&quot; in whether he is complicit wilfully in order to recognise the more cogent aspects of the coverup. </p>

<p>I would rather withhold judgement for lack of evidence than just automatically place him in the liar category. To me this is what decent people should do when they don&#39;t have definitive proof about someone.</p>

<p>Gross negligence? No, not even that, Hersh may still actually believe the system &quot;works&quot; and he sees himself as a troubleshooter for corrupt bits and pieces of it. </p>

<p>Like so many other Americans, he may simply not realize to what heights and depths the corruption goes. Sounds very human to me. </p>

<p>Disparaging people serves no great purpose if there&#39;s every indication that they are operating in good faith. If that changes, I&#39;ll change my assessment, but not before.</p>

Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, in a stunning about-face, has dutifully reported back to Congress these “findings” as fact and in so doing has shifted the US war machine from “neutral” into “drive”.&quot;</em></p>

<li>Russian invasion of Ukraine, &quot;the aggressor&quot; claim</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Relevant quote:</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Russian aim, one Western official said, may possibly be to seize an outlet to the sea in the event that Russia tries to establish a separatist enclave in eastern Ukraine.”</em></p>

<p><em>This of course hasn’t taken place. So what happened to all these Russian soldiers 30 miles inside Ukraine? What happened to all the armored vehicles, weapons, and equipment?</em></p>

<p><em>“The United States has photographs that show the Russian artillery moved into Ukraine, American officials say. One photo dated last Thursday, shown to a New York Times reporter, shows Russian military units moving self-propelled artillery into Ukraine. Another photo, dated Saturday, shows the artillery in firing positions in Ukraine.”</em></p>

<p><em>Where are these photographs? And how will we know that these are Russian soldiers? And how will we know that the photos were taken in Ukraine? But most importantly, where are the fucking photographs?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same thing with:</p>

<p>-The Obama administration releasing the report of CIA detainee abuses in December 2014...just weeks after democrats suffered their worse midterm election in 80 years.  Why release it then?  The election results were seen by many as a referendum on the Obama administrations policies.  People were talking about it (the election), it was the news, it was pointing out how the administration did little but say &quot;this is all X&#39;s&quot; fault and offered little to no solutions, etc</p>

<p>...then, just like that, that report is released and the focus is taken off the election loss.</p>

<p>-Just a few days ago, another story about the CIA and deleting vids, evidence, etc is released, promoted, and posted all over social media.  Why was it release just then?  What just happened in the world?  IS had taken over Ramadi.  It was worldwide news and it reflected poorly on the administrations foreign policy, decisions, calling them a JV team, etc.  </p>

<p>Of course, pointing this out is &quot;crazy&quot;, &quot;rightwing bullshit&quot; because people are partisan and feel scorned by the failures of the administration.  This is clearly apparent even in a sub like this that likes to think it &quot;looks beyond the BS to get at the truth&quot;, etc.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No discernable source? IIRC It was a personal photo of a bridesmaid&#39;s dress, posted after a wedding. I don&#39;t know the name of the person who posted it but as the viral event unfolded the original poster also provided some clarifications and confirmed the actual dress color but these developments were probably not as viral as the original post.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible for the event to have been planned to that level but for a bunch of reasons I don&#39;t think it was. On the other hand, I am not the only one who studies the spread of information, Facebook employs data scientists for this too. Embedding a variable within facebooks algorithms that could be adjusted to either encourage or discourage viral memes is quite possible. the government could pick a day, and the algorithm would select whatever new meme is most viral on that day, and supercharge it by giving it higher priority to appear in feeds.</p>

<p>In this way organically viral content could still be used to distract the public whenever necessary, without having to plan anything. Just set distraction level to high and that&#39;s that. I am almost certain that something like this is actually being done.</p>

<p>All of us who generate internet content (even us typing away at our keyboards here) have the potential to create a resonance that anyone could then increase by bringing their attention to it, which will bring more attention, etc. It doesn&#39;t seem outside the realm of possibility that some people would have a non-linear means of artificially producing, increasing or even disrupting that resonance.</p>

And of course they&#39;re right -enough people are stupid AND, more importantly, the media will lie to us about what &quot;we&quot; believe, so even if a huge majority of people don&#39;t believe the government, we will never know. For instance, years ago, a Zogby poll showed that a significant majority of the citizens of New York City did NOT believe the official fairy tale about 911. We&#39;re not supposed to know that.  We&#39;re all supposed to think we&#39;ll be branded and mocked as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; if we ever state our doubts aloud.
