       want people to travel? i'm trying to figure out just wth they're trying to do,
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier this year, Aaron Heuser of Eugene, Oregon, had to travel to Washington, D.C. The trip had two purposes: The 37-year-old mathematician was officially leaving his job at National Institutes of Health and starting a new position at a private firm. Since he is terrified of flying he booked himself a sleeper car on Amtrak. Upon reaching Reno, Nevada, there was an unexpected knock at his door. “There was a DEA badge on the window,” he said. “Having a good reason to be making this trip and being a law abiding citizen, I opened the door and politely asked if there was a problem. The officer asked if I was Aaron Heuser, and then asked to see my ticket. He then told me that there were many red flags on my trip, mainly that I had a sleeper car, was traveling alone, and did not check my luggage.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The officer asked him why he was traveling, and at first seemed satisfied by his explanation. But he quickly changed his tone, began acting like he knew Heuser was guilty, and asked to search his room. Since Heuser had nothing to hide and felt intimidated a part of him wanted to comply. But as a fan of the ACLU and the son of hippie parents, he instead decided to assert his right to be free from unreasonable searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DEA agent pressed the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       “After that he asked if he could bring a dog into my room to check out the bags, to which I again said ‘no,’” said Heuser, who hasn’t passed the bar but knows a little bit about Fourth Amendment law. “Finally he told me that he was going to bring a dog, walk it by my room, and that if alerted, my room would be searched. He told me that I could not argue this and that I was not allowed to be present for the search. His reasoning for violating my right to be present was that the dog might bite me.”
      </p>
      <p>
       . . . “I found my backpack moved and open, and my wallet, which was set down on the room table, had $60 missing,” he said. “I told one of the dining car attendants that I felt Amtrak and the DEA violated my rights. She told me that Amtrak is forced to give passenger info to Feds, that the DEA comes on every trip, usually arresting someone in the sleeping car or taking all their money. When I asked for her name in case I needed it later she refused and told me Amtrak would fire her.”
      </p>
      <p>
       One needn’t rely on her hearsay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year, the Associated Press reported that the DEA “paid an Amtrak secretary $854,460 over nearly 20 years to obtain confidential information about train passengers, which the DEA could have lawfully obtained for free through a law enforcement network.” (This was reportedly done so that the DEA could avoid sharing seized assets with Amtrak police, which hints at how lucrative such seizures are.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Later an ACLU staffer reported on the results of the request. Amtrak employees are instructed to report conduct "indicative of criminal activity" to law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among them:
      </p>
      <p>
       Unusual nervousness of traveler
       <br/>
       Unusual calmness or straight ahead stare
       <br/>
       Looking around while making telephone call(s)
       <br/>
       Position among passengers disembarking (ahead of, or lagging behind passengers)
       <br/>
       Carrying little or no luggage
       <br/>
       Purchase of tickets in cash
       <br/>
       Purchase tickets immediately prior to boarding
      </p>
      <p>
       So to avoid getting hassled by the state, don’t act nervous, but don’t act too calm either. Don’t stare straight ahead unless you’re on the telephone, in which case don’t look around. And disembark right amidst all the other passengers with lots of luggage.

       Money making is what they are doing.  They are going after the drug dealers that are trying to move loads of cash and grabbing it.  My friend got profiled like this at midway airport in Chicago.  Said they were undercover and went through his bag.  He felt they were looking for money and prob not even real cops, even tho they flashed a badge.

       Lol. I think the dude was robbed! Did he see a dog? You may have something illegal but go somewhere else or off the train because my "dog" may bite you. My guess its a gypsy who spotted him in the train depot, older mathematician alone = easy target. I think even the DEA knows if you smuggle drugs you use a "family". They have a recent comedy about this: "We're the Millers". And yes if you look like a terrorist I hope the Amtrak people call someone, I could only imagine their security skills are just under a TSA.

       Honestly this seems kinda likely. But that shouldn't detract from the other points OP made about the am track secretary and the behaviour they monitor. Good post
