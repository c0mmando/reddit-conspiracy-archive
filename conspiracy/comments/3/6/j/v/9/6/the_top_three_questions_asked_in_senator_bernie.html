<p>The top three questions posted are done by three separate accounts all created in the past few days. They are also worded strangely and the whole thing seems completely staged. </p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36j690/i_am_senator_bernie_sanders_democratic_candidate/creerjy">Here</a>,<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36j690/i_am_senator_bernie_sanders_democratic_candidate/creels7">here</a>, and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36j690/i_am_senator_bernie_sanders_democratic_candidate/creeuge">here</a> are the posts in question. The accounts are all very new and have not (yet) posted elsewhere. They may not be at the top of the AMA at your time of viewing, but each one has over 1000 upvotes and is very near the top.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say the people who asked those questions are all new to reddit. How is their timing so perfect they made it to the AMA perfectly on time and were &quot;lucky&quot; enough to have their questions answered. Pretty amazing considering this would have to be one of their first times on reddit. And for the flip side, say that they are second accounts made by veteran users. Why go through the trouble of creating a new account just hoping that the questions would even get answered. It all seems very fishy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m on mobile and I hope to update this via PC later. Let me know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that people need to look at his voting record themselves,  and not just what he is saying.   I had heard several times that his voting record was what set him apart from other candidates,  and the number one reason why I should vote for him. </p>

<p>I then decided to check his record myself,  and was shocked to see these votes. </p>

<p>The NDAA is what bothers me the most,  and this is my litmus test for all 2016 candidates.  If your willing to vote yes on allowing the US government to legally kill American citizens,  in the United States or abroad,  with no due process,  or oversight from anyone other then the executive branch,  and then after doing so be able to declare it national security,  and have the entire dossier classified and not privy to any scrutiny,  your judgement is clearly questionable.  Maybe he&#39;ll answer me on why he voted in favor of it,  but I won&#39;t hold my breath. </p>

<p>Not sure what&#39;s so controversial about this one.  Consistent deficit spending, which we have year after year, is bad, but sometimes it makes more sense to borrow.  In an ideal world maybe this wouldn&#39;t be the case but in our current reality forcing the federal government to have a balanced budget simply wouldn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah because average citizen is so ignorant as to how things work, they&#39;ll just vote for anyone who rants about circumventing the status quo. I do believe Bernie has better intentions than shitholes like Obama, Bush, etc...but the fact that it sounds like buzzwords and idealistic fantasies leads me to believe he&#39;d just be Obama lite. The people in Vermont DO speak very highy of him, and he&#39;s had viscous arguments with the fed chairmans (particularly Greenspan) is a good sign. We&#39;ll see...the fact that there&#39;s a &quot;Ron Paul of the left&quot; in Sanders and Rand Paul on the right is a welcome sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You left out &quot;And he&#39;s a Joo.&quot;</p>

<p>Sanders is a politician. I&#39;m not particularly enthusiastic about everything he&#39;s done, and I agree he&#39;s too much in the pocket of Israel -- but which politicians aren&#39;t at this point? </p>

<p>Sanders is far and away the best option I see on the docket right now, the ONLY one with any hope to him (or her) at all. I will watch him closely, but I am not ready to lump him in with ever other corrupt, greedy, pedophile-mongering member of the Elite. Not yet. </p>

<p>And for those who write him off simply because he&#39;s Jewish, I would point people to Paul Wellstone, who was also Jewish and extremely liberal. He was murdered because he was pursuing the Real Truth. So not every Jewish person is a plant or subversive or Zionist. </p>

<p>At least you don&#39;t hear him singing Bomb Bomb Iran.
He has stated clearly he supports a 2 state solution.
He abhors needless useless war.
He does not shy from the hard questions.</p>

<p>His Jewish issue is the least of the things I worry about. </p>

<p>Mind the people that Article 6 of our constitution clearly states that there shall be no religious test for anyone to hold public office in this country.</p>

<p>For as much as people harp on the Jew Isreal bash train I have yet to see money from the Israel PACs for him and he made it a point to not attend the Israeli Presidents little stunt speech over here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am just a guy. Not a US citizen, but I do keep an eye on you guys just so I know when to duck.</p>

<p>Do the members commenting here feel that a White Knight is going to ride up over some hill and set your country straight. Or perhaps an uprising of mountain men will form the next Congress.</p>

<p>It is clear that all members of the DC club are suspect, regardless of party. Sanders is getting lumped in with all the rest, if I read these comments correctly.</p>

<p>OP points out 3 questions made with new accounts, that were answered. OP does not mention any other questions or answers, but suggests the whole thing is staged. </p>

<p>Of course it was staged. A mix of honest questions by real folks, and questions by Sanders election team to expand the topics into areas that will make Sanders more appealing to members of this site. There were many other questions that were not answered. Do the lack of answers mean something beyond a lack of time? Maybe. It is election time. He is trying to mobilize voters to act.</p>

<p>This sub appealed to me because I found a greater amount of critical thinking going into the words that I read here as opposed to other subs. What I see today smacks of a self-fulfilling argument along the lines of the culture this sub is painted with by those that would ridicule it to the fringe.</p>

<p>I may be too tired to phrase my words as eloquently as they are needed to get my point across. Please don&#39;t let yourselves paint all before you with the same brush. Use the power of reason that made this place worthwhile.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>If you are coming here to report that you have discovered that an AMA from a politician was staged you are not reporting any recent discovery. AMA&#39;s have become just another way to advertise. </p>

<p>Most media is this way. They answer pre-formatted questions. And any question they are unfamiliar with or are not up to speed on they just dismiss it and move on. I dont mind the idea of a politician answering pre-formatted coordinated questions. And if they happen to answer some of the real questions along the way that&#39;s just a bonus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well yeah because average citizen is so ignorant as to how things work, they&#39;ll just vote for anyone who rants about circumventing the status quo. I do believe Bernie has better intentions than shitholes like Obama, Bush, etc...but the fact that it sounds like buzzwords and idealistic fantasies leads me to believe he&#39;d just be Obama lite. The people in Vermont DO speak very highy of him, and he&#39;s had viscous arguments with the fed chairmans (particularly Greenspan) is a good sign. We&#39;ll see...the fact that there&#39;s a &quot;Ron Paul of the left&quot; in Sanders and Rand Paul on the right is a welcome sight.</p>
