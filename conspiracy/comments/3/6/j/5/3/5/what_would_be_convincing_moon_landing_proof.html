       Personally I am already convinced. I have a hard time believing that the many thousands of people hired to build the rockets and space equipment were all fooled or are all lying. That and scientific consensus has convinced me. I also think it is a too big lie to risk it all on. Just as 9/11. It doesn't seem to be worth the risk as the coverup has to last at least 100 years and be extremely expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what would convince you? Found footsteps on the moon? Found equipment and flags? Going there again? Or nothing at all?

       It's not cheaper. They still pay people to build a fake rocket. And the wages still go to people with great expertise. And they still send up rockets which is very expensive.

       An exposed mirror that would easily break or be misplaced if sent like the Curiosity was at Mars. A mirror that had to be meticulously placed and fixed. I'm pretty sure about that. Another prove that convinces me: the inscription left by the mission. And, if everything fails, Mythbusters episode about this.

       hahaha I'm so glad you mentioned the Mythbusters episode! I saw that too! Do you know when it first aired? It was like the 50th (or some number) anniversary of the moon landing and they were doing this big thing on Discovery channel about it where they were going to show the original footage or something of the moon landing as a celebration, and right before that the Mythbuster episode aired. And as I was watching the episode, half way through, I thought well you know, no shit they're going to determine that it wasn't faked. How could they air an episode that showed that it was fake or plausibly faked right before they were going to air the footage for the anniversary. It would've been like, "we've determined that it could or was faked. Next up, watch the footage of us ACTUALLY going to the moon from 1969!" There's no way they could ever say it was faked and have that shit air on TV. I'm sorry but that's not proof of anything.

       Humans are much more trustworthy in a new scenario. Sure, they can make simulations and the robot can be manually driven but only being on scene can give you information about the landscape and the best way to avoid mistakes.

       And, about Mythbusters, for what I know you could be an agent of some clandestine group trying to set doubts among the population, make them think that the government lied to us about a key even. You want the people to go against the government and destroy it so you can rise to power. Can you disprove me?

       You're right. I should prove that. However, it's not the key point of what I'm defending thus "why would I waste my time". Nevertheless, statically, you're not. So the "normal" thing should be you're a regular citizen. The abnormality, you being a member of a secret group, should be prove by the accuser, AKA me. Following the same path, a "normal" thing would be Mythbusters being an independent regular show. The abnormality would be them being hired by the government. I'm not the one having to prove the "normal" thing, because is normal. Can you prove the abnormality? I believe, Sir, that you want to accomplish that. And for the "you may be part of a group" I don't need to prove that, since it was only a way to get to my real argument, this one.

       Oh I see what you're getting at.
      </p>
      <p>
       This myth has been busted already. The reason there is no thrust crater is because there is NO AIR.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you fire up a thrust source on Earth, you are creating an explosive expansion into a medium which already has a density of compression, which will act as a carrier of vibrational energy, and will result in a much greater chain reaction of disturbance.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the moon there is NO AIR to act as a carrier of vibrational energy. There is ZERO density around the thruster. The gas molecules leaving the thruster disperse into a vacuum, which means the hot gas will bounce off the ground causing only minimal disturbance to dust particles on the ground which are orders of magnitude more heavy than the gas particles which are pounding into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some mathematical proof of this concept if you are still not convinced. The calculations show that a crater formed by the lander's thruster would be around 10-11mm, which is consistent with photos showing a slight disturbance of the dust directly beneath the exhaust.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: addendum: Actually according to the math, the dust particles that are picked up are going to leave the ground at a fairly high velocity, which means they will end up farther away from the landing site, not just a few inches to the landing pads. That is why they are not "full of dust"

       Yup, because a spacecraft cannot travel hundreds of thousands of miles only to just barely not burn on reentry without carrying a shit ton of dust on the outside.

       Quite a few people will simply never accept it despite there being a ton of junk left on the surface of the moon, never a single whistleblower among thousands of NASA employees ever working there, the amount of material brought back by each mission and the fact that the rationale for whatever reason one may have for faking it is tenuous at best, most people won't believe it till you fly them to the moon.

       We never landed on the moon because the LEM in which they blasted off simply was not large enough to accelerate back to Earth in three days.  Nor the CSM they claim to have rendezvoused with could go that fast.  They would have needed a 500,000 lb rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the CSM was in a deep gravity well at it's 62 mile altitude.  No way it's tiny amount of fuel could climb them out in three days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand that fact, you understand how most definitely the moon landing is fake.

       In fact, a Saturn V is really just a heavylift to LEO.  The space shuttle fuel mass was roughly 75% of the Saturn V, and where did the shuttles lift to?  LEO...

       IMO, the footage is Hollywood...quite likely Kubrick as people claim.  As for rocks...Earth is a big enough planet to go digging up exotic fake moon rocks.  In any case, how do you scientifically control for someone presenting a moon rock claim?   Not some moon rock shelf to grab and compare...

       See my recent posting history as to the "why"...
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at your photo, it has the standard backdrop horizon line that's in every moon photo, which shows a fake backdrop was present, usually off color from the ground lighting.  In desert photos on Earth you don't see this contrast.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the lunar module, where's the 500,000 lb. (Earth weight) rocket underneath it which they would have needed to descend and ascend it's 6000 lb. effective weight (36,000 lb. on Earth)?  There wouldn't be enough fuel in the LM we see here...why are all other rockets just that, long rockets?  Because you need a great mass to propel a tiny mass to orbital velocities, or especially to descend to zero using only a rocket since they couldn't use parachutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon gravity is 1/6th Earth but not zero, still significant.  The astronaut in the photo had to ascend to 3600 mph in 7 minutes standing up in the LEM, not strapped in, as it also made an arking maneuver to circular orbit, that's ludicrous.

       If perhaps there were a staunch foe of the USA at the time, and that staunch foe had the capability to call the USA out on their bluff with ample proof of same, but didn't, that might be convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another might be a convincing explanation of how traveling through the Van Allen Belt at whatever speed the astronauts would have traveled, twice (once each way, right?) would not have given them a lethal dose of radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, of course, you would have to prove that the earth is actually a sphere(ish) and not flat and centered at the dead nuts middle of the universe with everything else revolving (or a projection) around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end, some people seem to be incapable of considering evidence they do not directly experience for themselves, so for them, it will require nothing less than getting their ass strapped to a rocket and being sent there for themselves. Return trip not necessarily required; they can just hang out in the hollow-moon base being anally probed by ET's.

       I was all about staying on the moon until you brought up alien anal probes. It's this style of hyperboil insult, to take the concept of scrutizing a moment in history, and turning into an insult, that shows the level of maturity those that hold up the globalist point of view have.

       Some subjects are simply ridiculous, meriting a humorous (if off-color) approach to them. Of course, the anal probing only applies to people who are capable of considering only evidence they experience for themselves.

       The chinese photos do nothing but prove we shot something to the moon. I know the moon is there. I know it's a round sphere, kinda hollow, as it rung like a bell forever after we hit it, so i know we can put things on the moon, but you can't show me proof that people have ever been on the moon. Not a shred. All of it is more circumstancial than my religion, and if my religion has literally more proof to it than the moon landing, then it sounds like people do things in the name of science that are false and use the truth that science offers to cloak their lies. Happens all the time, not the first time in history either.

       What would be the point of me attempting to deliver evidence if by, your own admission, there is none you would accept?

      <p>
       If you judge "Mr. Ham" as an insult, perhaps you should reconsider your position on the types and sources of evidence you would accept.

       Those are the words you put in my mouth to defend your stance. Which shows just how shaky it is. I posted a 10 reasons why the moon landing may be a hoax, and I know you guys hover over this site with nothing better to do, so just reddit, and refute it, or stop with the insults and time waste, mate.

       None from you, you put words in my mouth and create conditions with the intent of bringing some kind of 'rules' which you can 'win' an arguement by, instead of having a discussion. I have already decided that you're not a source of anything but hate and insults. Why would I care about your perception of me, or what I believe? You're just a little hater. Clones like you are a dime a dozen.

       It's been 50 years, it should be a vacation spot by now, and until it is, I ain't buyin it. Today, more than ever, it would be easy to fake. Just like they would fake the Mars landing, but they know no one will be for it until it's a united internation collition and not 'americans' or 'russians' trying to win another space race.

       Many millions of people did believe in Mars One and now the in SpaceX. But the problem is the cost. It would probably cost a billion dollar per person even if we made it 10 times cheaper and it would be nothing but a tourist attraction.

       Yep, because to get 9/11 to work, everyone from the air traffic controllers to the passengers had to be in on it to make it a government conspiracy, but 14 saudis with nothing but plasic box cutters is totally ligit. That's the extremes 9/11 debunkers play off of to hide the truth about all the shady moves that took place the day before, that day, and the following day. If they did, and could still convince me it was just some pissed of terrorists, I would be flabbergausted at the number of conviences that took place for those in key spots and would later be in key spots.

       Actually, the air traffic controllers were so disturbed by what went down on 9/11 that after it happened they went to the basement and recorded their experiences so others would know. Then a higher-up immediately jetted in, took the recording, cut it into hundreds of little pieces and put the pieces in different garbage cans all around the building. So there's the air traffic controllers angle.
