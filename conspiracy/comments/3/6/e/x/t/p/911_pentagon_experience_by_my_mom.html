       Hello guys I am kind of new to this subreddit, infact I just stumbled upon it a few weeks ago.  I finally took the time to check it out, it has some interesting good stuff.   But anyway that's not what I am here for, I am actually hear to ask a question.  Can a plane crash cause the area to shake?   Let me start off by saying I am not really a conspiracy theorist kind of guys.   I mean its fun to read them to kill time and all, but I never was heavily involved in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways the reason why I asked this question because I brought up a conversation with my mom the other day regarding about the attacks on 9/11.   You see during that time we lived in Falls Church Virginia really close to DC. (well 5.4 miles)   On the day of 9/11 when the Pentagon was hit my mom was at home making breakfast in the morning.  When all of a sudden she heard a booooom!! (That's the verbal expression she used) when she heard it.  Keep in mind she doesn't speak a lick of English her main language is Arabic. I couldn't really get lot of detail out of her because I don't really speak alot of arabic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I played a few Youtube videos of sonic boom sounds and missile sounds for her to match if that is what she heard.  Apparently none of them sound what like she experienced and heard.  She told me the experience of the sound that she heard was like ''a huge rock just fell from the sky''  That was basically in her own words.  She proceeded to tell me the ground shook for a split 2 and a half seconds.  It was such a scary experience that my relative that was staying with us ran to the other room and ducked undress the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We lived in these apartments, when the attack took place.

      </p>
      <p>
       Btw feel free to ask me any questions I will try direct them over to my mom.  Also admins if this is the wrong sub reddit to post in please move it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Sound she heard
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounded simular to this credits go to FutzBucket

       2:49 and 3:00  When I showed my mom the video a smile whipped on her face after countless hours of me showing her Youtube videos of explosions.   She said it sound exactly like that, but extremly loud that caused the apartment to shake.  We lived on the top floor.

       Please proceed with caution, as you could trigger some unwelcome trauma!
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you could find someone to help you get a more concise translation. A rock
       <em>
        falling
       </em>
       out of the sky isn't going to make much noise unless it's coming in like a meteorite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have her
       <em>
        listen
       </em>
       rather than watch. Remove visual stimulation. If you use head phones that might  help her recall.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO: Whatever hit the pentagon came in fast, low and silent. The noise and blast came about from penetration of the first ring and then it sliced through and left a big round hole where it did exit and stop. *Which is probably pretty close to the length of time your mother experienced the ground shaking!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Added words for clarification.

       Does your mother or sister recall any broken glass reports? Residential, business, automobiles on that day or the next?

       Although my dad told me the neighborhood residential area was quite as a library during the attack.   He told me not even a car was in sight, people had ran inside their homes and were shacked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he gets home I will ask him if he was on the beltway during when the attack took place.   Because he worked at Maryland which requires you to take a interstate from DC.

       The ground did shake  from what she told me me.   She said the blast noise she heard was so loud she never heard anything like that in her life.  During the attack my relative who was on a temp was eating cereal in the dinning table, when she heard the blast.  She literally fit feet and ran to her room and hid under the bed.   This is all coming from my mom.

       I recently asked my sister of her experience during the attack.  When the Pentagon was hit she was attending Baily's Elementary school.

      <p>
       Its 5.7 miles away from school
      </p>
      <p>
       We recently had a sit down a few hours ago.   This is what she told me this is word for word btw.

       ''I was in forth grade. The plane hit the pentagon and the whole ground shook!! she is not exaggerating. It was very weird that floor shook I remember that.  The first thing I said to my classmates was omg did an elephant fall on the roof of the school!It was a really loud bang. Like a really really Loud bang I had never heard a sound that loud   Its hounded like a big crash. Not like an explosion. The plane hit the pentagon really early like 11:00 am. Then at 12:00  all the parents started coming to school to pick up their children.
      </p>
      <p>
       I asked her if she could describe the blast she heard.  She said it was ''just a very loud crash''

       This is certainly interesting, as I've not to my knowledge come across similar stories from the DC area. Has anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember watching a video of a man interviewing eyewitnesses to the Pentagon attack, who were making the claim that the flight path of the plane given in official accounts did not match the eyewitness accounts, including several policemen, guards, and grounds crews. I don't remember them describing such a boom, but it has been a while since I saw the video, and was not looking for that.
