       The Rothschilds funded both sides of the war against Napoleon, and tricked the English into thinking they lost, and selling all their stocks back to them because they would be going to spanish money. The Rothschilds then lent out all that money back to the English and their government, in turn essentially owning the English. When the US was founded the Rothschilds tried to do the same to us by establishing the First National Bank. 20 years later we did not renew the charter and the Rothschilds tried to kill our president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without their banking we experienced the biggest industrial and economic boom of any country. The Rothschilds then tried again but this time doing it with smaller banks run by the people. They funded the English to start a war with us or some crap, while also funding us. They also started our Federal reserve which is the only authority to tell the US mint when to print money. Essentially they are running a scheme where they continue to print money to loan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only THREE nations in the entire world whose central bank is not owned by the Rothschilds. They are N. Korea, Cuba and Iran. Tell me these facts don't disturb you:
      </p>
      <p>
       this is from this website:
       <a href="http://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message1680855/pg1">

      <p>
       The Rothschild family is slowly but surely having their Central banks established in every country of this world, giving them incredible amount of wealth and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the year of 2000 there were seven countries without a Rothschild owned Central Bank:
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan
      </p>
      <p>
       Iraq
      </p>
      <p>
       Sudan
      </p>
      <p>
       Libya
      </p>
      <p>
       Cuba
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not a coincidence that these country, which are listed above were and are still being under attack by the western media, since one of the main reasons these countries have been under attack in the first place is because they do not have a Rothschild owned Central Bank yet. The first step in having a Central Bank establish in a country is to get them to accept an outrageous loans, which puts the country in debt of the Central Bank and under the control of the Rothschilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the country does not accept the loan, the leader of this particular country will be assassinated and a Rothschild aligned leader will be put into the position, and if the assassination does not work, the country will be invaded and have a Central Bank established with force all under the name of terrorism.
Rothschild owned Central Bank:
      </p>
      <p>
       Central banks are illegally created private banks that are owned by the Rothschild banking family. The family has been around for more than 230 years and has slithered its way into each country on this planet, threatened every world leader and their governments and cabinets with physical and economic death and destruction, and then emplaced their own people in these central banks to control and manage each country’s pocketbook. Worse, the Rothschilds also control the machinations of each government at the macro level, not concerning themselves with the daily vicissitudes of our individual personal lives. Except when we get too far out of line.
The only countries left in 2003 without a Central Bank owned by the Rothschild Family were:
      </p>
      <p>
       Sudan
      </p>
      <p>
       Libya
      </p>
      <p>
       Cuba
      </p>
      <p>
       North Korea
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran
      </p>
      <p>
       The Attacks of September 11th were an inside job to invade Afghanistan and Iraq to then establish a Central Bank in those countries.
The only countries left in 2011 without a Central Bank owned by the Rothschild Family are:
Cuba North Korea Iran
After the instigated protests and riots in the Arab countries the Rothschild finally paved their way into establishing Central Banks, and getting rid of many leaders, which put them into more power.

       Listen, can we get a thorough documentation of the world and its financial systems on September 11th, 2001, and the same ten years later?  I'd like a well-sourced explication of the notion that central banks owned by Rothschild families now pervade the world, please.  It is difficult to go on believing something without proof of what should already be documented regardless of nefariousness.

       Good luck finding some, none really exists publicly.  In fact, I'd be impressed if you could find an official list of the
       <em>

       that own parts of the various private central banks around the world, let alone the actual individual shareholders.

       There isn't which is really a huge part of the issue.

       These people and banks quite literally own the money supply itself and the means to create more out of thin air and this is true for a huge majority of the currency in circulation around the world - yet there isn't any transparency whatsoever and none of these people have been elected by anyone.

       Of course they could, and especially when you consider the information a group like the NSA could have access to.  And high frequency trading accounts for a substantial percentage of day-to-day activity in markets around the world (there's probably no way to get an accurate number) which is another way electronic transmissions could be compromised at some level.

       If you expect rational, reasonable discourse from us you're barking up the wrong tree. We exist in a world of stress. We eat poison every day. Some of us have PTSD, and wake up on the floor in the next room a few times a month. Afraid to kill ourselves only because we know the balance of our life has been to cause suffering to people who, ultimately, weren't our enemy. And if there is another level of hell below this, maybe we can earn our way the other direction this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we can't afford bodyguards, and security systems, healthy food. So we suffer in terror, or just eventually accept the fact that our things will go missing, we will be shot at even after coming home because our cities are in such bad shape, and if we watch the news we might just GO FUCKING INSANE and use the IED we learned how to make on people who we know, through their absence, will make the world a better place.

       How does this offer anything of value?  It is just as trivial as if I were to tell you to do it.  Why wouldn't someone making these claims want to substantiate them?  Why can't one of the many posts about the Rothschild ownership of all central banking systems in the world that has spread to all but a handful of countries be clear illustration of even tangential Rothschild connection to the extant central banks of the nations of the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe mainstream narratives without evidence?  If not, why do you believe this one?  If the evidence is clear and everyone who espouses this narrative examines it, point me to something other than a five hour YouTube documentary or a disorganized website that shows the current complete Rothschild domination of the financial system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschilds have undeniable global influence over the course of the last several hundred years.  But what is it that now says they control every single aspect of finance the world over?  Why is there not a list composed of the central banks and their owners that demonstrates this apparently clear-cut association?

       Interesting how homicide is acceptable as soon as we put the rubber-stamp approval of "legality" on it. If someone says "kill the Rothschilds" it is unacceptable, but "try the Rothschilds in court, then kill them" is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good example of how the criminal justice system exists primarily for the protection of persons in power. There is no chance for individuals in positions of power to end up in the legal system, convicted and executed. They're effectively immune from this kind of "justice."
      </p>

       If anything, a vigilante mob dragging them out into the street is both more honest and more realistic.

       What I am saying is that the current justice system has failed. It does not work. People in positions of power - politicians in particular - can literally commit war crimes and genocide, and walk around as free men and women.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no legal remedy, then. If any form of justice is to be done, or more importantly if these people are to be stopped, then it will take the form of vigilante squads, militias, individual activsts, peoples courts, etc.

       How many politicians are paying for major crimes in supermax prisons and in the gas chamber? About zero.

      <p>
       What about corporate overseers and oligarchs? Also zero.

       Okay, so your point is that the law doesn't apply to those with money/power/influence, and I agree with that to a slightly lesser extent but still mostly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we're split on different definitions of the word justice, I think it means more than the act of trying/punishing oligarchs, but extends further.

       Yes I'm speaking in the context of the powerful. The justice system works well for punishing poor people. (Even if they turn out to be innocent.) Ultimately the problem is the nature of power itself. We all say "power corrutps," but we're too hesitant when it comes to applying technology to limit power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decentralization of power structures, such as replacing the state with community-level direct democracies, would eliminate a lot of the too-big-to-touch situations we see with politicians and oligarchs.

       This guy speaks the truth right here. To the guy arguing, our justice system is an absolute failure and is on the side of the elite and a big tool to keep lower class in chains. There have been very rich people some apart of dynastys that have gotten in trouble and with their money they get a slap on the wrist compared to a poor or working class guy with a public defender who gets fed to the dogs and without the money, connections and no paid attorney hes gonna face alot more than the rich folk......even with a lower status of offence. Those rich socalled elites commit horrible acts and still get away with it. One from the du pont family was convicted of molesting his INFANT daughter and was sentenced to prison but the judge ruled he wouldnt fair well there and gave him house arrest........there are many more examples.

       Perhaps he is referring to establishing town or county courts with elected judges and prosecutors to handle criminal matters.  This, of course, is much easier said than done. The state remains sovereign in its responsibility for handling such matters, and to have so many sovereigns would create a nightmare whereby there would be so many sets of disparate rules, law enforcement procedures, methods of adjudication and punishment, making the legal system even more difficult to navigate for the layman.  Uniformity does have its advantages in keeping much of the power to adjudicate civil and criminal matters with the judiciary of the individual states.  And to politicize the the role of the judge or prosecutor could be equally dangerous, seeing as elections always come down to money and power.

       Yes, a federation of small communities would be a good solution. It's definitely worth a try.

       Interesting! Let's go with it (I'm enjoying this discussion btw, I you are as well.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If I understand correctly, each community will have:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A judicial system
       </li>
       <li>
        A police to enforce the judicial system
       </li>
       <li>
        A legislative system (you mentioned before a direct democracy, I think)
       </li>
       <li>
        Some form of currency for trade with neighboring communities
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Some questions I have:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Private Property rights (less of a question and more of an ask that you address that component)
       </li>
       <li>
        As each community has it's own judicial system, how do you settle disputes between communities?
       </li>
       <li>
        In a globalized economy with other countries that have amalgamated their ultimate force (a gov't), what stops those countries from dominating us?
       </li>
      </ul>

       Nonsense. There are all sorts of politicians and business figures in jail or paying heavy penalties for crimes they've committed.

       ave you ever been through our glorious judicial branches or perhaps been to our Corrections facilities?  You will get a different view about this all if you had.
 I say sop paying taxes, its the only non-violent way to get  a real point across. And be prepared to get your head smashed in, because it will all be for shit unless people have the balls to stand up for it, even if it is a little inconvenient.

       Not really, because there is no court with jurisdiction over "the Rothschilds" that would carry out the death penalty for whatever crimes Flytape imagines they have committed.

       You hear all the far-right libertarians (et al.) pining for "The Constitution" and "The Rule of Law" and "liberty." But you help demonstrate it's all an act. While praising The Constitution out of one side of their mouths, they call for murder out of the right.

       People fear the alien.  They especially fear innately strange people who threaten to kill them on a continual basis.  So far, to my understanding, we're basically in a situation where everyone's threatening to kill everyone else, a situation which does not breed a lot of mutual trust.

       Yeah. And if this happens to be true, the people responsible are long dead. Are you advocating the murder of the current generation based on crimes [you claim] they committed 200 years ago?

       Can I see your sources showing that the US Federal Reserve is owned by "a Rothschild?"

       For that matter, can you produce evidence that "a Rothschild" owns
       <em>
        all the central banks

       in
       <em>
        all the other hundreds of countries in the world

       Making such an amazing claim, surely you don't expect people to just take your word for it.

      <p>
       If this is true, I imagine it's pretty easy to prove. If "a Rothschild" owned all the banks in the world [but 7], you would think it would be a very well known fact! Why isn't it?

       So you are comparing modern day mentality to the Nazis? Come the fuck on man. You are adding fuel to the fire for anyone that wants to make fun of the users within this sub.

       Please don't just dismiss what I am saying. For every step we make within this sub showing we are not all loons and wack jobs some shit like what you just said gets posted. When a mod says shit like that it is construed as the voice of user base.

       If you factor in the money they suck out of the world every day it could account for at least a couple hundred deaths a year, this is not including the funding of both sides of various wars, the loss of many jobs, and the misdirection and enslavement of the entire planet, in conclusion what you consider crazy is not that crazy, if we dragged them onto the street right now and slaughtered them then many lives would be saved, I know its not ideal and there is no due process, but the problem is that they are above due process, and all that "evidence" u talk about is gone for a reason, so that people like you can say that believing they own the world is crazy nazi talk, they want you to keep looking for proof so that they can hide themselves in the defenders chair in the supreme court

       So how would you use fear to stop that unstoppable force, fear is their weapon, fines, jail, etc means nothing to them, sometimes they prefer to be fined if the financial benefit is greater in the end, if you want to show everyone what happens if you take their place then I can't think of a better way

       I know all that as I've followed it since it's conception. What I would like to know is why isn't it under siege from the Rothschild dynasty in the same way that these other countries have been. My own personal opinion is they see an opportunity to use the technology for a one world currency however I think the grass roots development in cryptocurrency is leaning more toward privacy and anonymity.

       I would speculate that they would like to besiege bitcoin, but they realize only the most extreme and publicly visible forms of attack would be effective.  Take bit torrent for example; the government spent billions trying to clandestinely disrupt / hack bit torrent with literally zero effect.  Like bit torrent, bitcoin is designed from the ground up to be very resistant to attack.  Short of making bitcoin illegal, which risks drawing attention and further popularizing it, what can they really do?

       I agree and on top of bitcoin being hard to attack there are new cryptocurrencies that use Tor and even steganography to encrypt transactions for added privacy. So its becoming even harder for them to siege crypto.

       Until people are no longer willing to sell them for useless paper. I understand what your trying to insinuate but being educated on how cryptocurrency works and what gives it value i disagree that it's value is pegged to paper money. Obviously not or it would be worth a lot less.

       Do you think the people abusing the monetary system currently are oblivious  to this? If it were me and I was intent on continuing to exert financial dominance, I would buy a bunch of stuff(grains, metals, cars, houses, ect...) to continue amassing bitcoin with.  And as I would be printing 'promise ' money to buy  those resources, I could have a limitless supply of goods to trade for bitcoin.  There is no way to escape the grasp of those who currently dominate the financial world while non-local currency rules.

       I say, we should not kill anyone from this network of psychopaths.  We have a systemic vulnerability to their corruptions.  We need to imprison them for the rest of their lives and study them.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing about psychopaths is that they do what is good for themselves, seeking pleasure and avoiding pain, calculating the risk involved.  So, take that predictable behavioral protocol into account to create a system whereby we can retrieve the important contents of their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also often have strong egos, so gratifying them by praising their intelligence, apparent superiority and magnificence can also get us places.
      </p>
      <p>
       For this to work well, contrast is very important, so start them off in poor, yet healthy, conditions in prison.  Then after a time, a year or so perhaps, offer them upgraded conditions in exchange for verifiable information on the methods, operations, protocols, and skeletons of their network of co-conspirators.  Don't give them all of the upgrades at once, but slowly, incrementally over time, in order to milk them of all of what they know.  Freedom from prison is not to be an upgrade.  Also, keeping them from communicating with each other could avoid unnecessary shenanigans and coordinated deceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is not simply against future conspiracies of evil men which we have to guard ourselves but it is against ourselves, against weaknesses and faults in our own social order, in our own ways of living against which we have to be on continual guard."
      </p>
      <p>
       These psychopaths will relish being rewarded for calling us stupid and telling us our faults.  Let's let them sing like birds in cages, drinking champagne. Why let our thirst for vengeance get in the way of the permanent eradication of the potential for their way of life to flourish? Let's not the be the fools they think we are.

       We should just tell these sociopaths that they're the best people ever, and make them like kings and queens in europe... powerless but with the appearance of respect and power... that's how you take them out of commission without causing a big stir.

       It's not about being 'funded' by both sides. The Central Bank essentially means slavery for that country.

       No, the military-industrial complex is what sells the weapons. The money is useless if no one wants it, and it can't just be

       Listen. When you say, "lethally inject them after charging them," there is no implication or insinuation of a fair trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the contrary, you are literally saying, "take the person into custody and kill them." It is pretty much the opposite of demanding a fair trial. You called for murder first, detainment second, and a trial... not at all.

       Just remember, the wrong side won ww2.  Adolf Hitler turned Germany from the hyperinflationary Wiemer Republic into a world super-power of the Third Riech because he
       <em>
        KICKED THE BANKERS OUT OF HIS COUNTRY
       </em>
       and re-established a non-debt based currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that the federal reserve, made up of the nation's largest banks, gets 6% interest in perpetuity on the money?  It is in their Charter.  That is why it is debt based money, that is why we are not free.  Revolution and public flayings are not good enough for these criminals.

       So, how's all that hatred going for you?  Keep you warm at night?  It must, feeling all superior to others based on some arbitrary thing like blood lines or skin color.  I'll bet the whole world opens up for you when you share your true opinions with people, you know, face to face.  Unless of course, you're a coward and only share your thoughts about non-whites online where its safe and warm.  Hatemongers like you are like cockroaches.  You breed filth and hide when the light is shined on your face.  Go back where you came from, vermin.

       Wrong.  Prove to me that God exists, or alternatively prove to me the holocaust happened.

       By the way, you didn't refute the red cross report, and you haven't produced a single document that proves there was a National Socialist mass extermination program via the gas chamber.  Surely if there were such a program that killed an alleged 12 million as commonly accepted, then there would be at least
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       document?  I.e a smoking gun.

       Holy shit, this is so incorrect. 97% of Federal Reserve profits go back to the US treasury, furthermore the Fed is self financed.

       The largest number of US debt I can find the Fed ever holding is 8.7% which is tiny, compared the other holders of US debt, private citizens, China, Japan, a handful of Caribbean nations, Venezuela, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia.

       It's not wrong, its in their fucking charter.  I can get a link to it in in a about 1 or 2 googles.  Our monetary system costs us 6% dividend annually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twelve Federal Reserve banks provide the financial means to operate the Federal Reserve System. Each reserve bank is organized much like a private corporation so that it can provide the necessary revenue to cover operational expenses and implement the demands of the board. A member bank is a privately owned bank that must buy an amount equal to 3% of its combined capital and surplus of stock in the Reserve Bank within its region of the Federal Reserve System.[12][13] This stock "may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan" and all member banks receive a 6% annual dividend.[10] No stock in any Federal Reserve Bank has ever been sold to the public, to foreigners, or to any non-bank U.S. firm.[14] These member banks must maintain fractional reserves either as vault currency or on account at its Reserve Bank. As of October 2008, the Federal Reserve has paid interest to banks' holdings in Reserve Banks' accounts.[15] The dividends paid by the Federal Reserve Banks to member banks are considered partial compensation for the lack of interest paid on the required reserves. All profit after expenses is returned to the U.S. Treasury or contributed to the surplus capital of the Federal Reserve Banks. Since shares in ownership of the Federal Reserve Banks are redeemable only at par, the nominal "owners" do not benefit from this surplus capital. In 2010, the Federal Reserve System contributed $79 billion to the U.S. Treasury.[16]

       I'm sorry but godlikeproductions is not a credible source on anything really, unless the original poster on that site also provided a source, which he didn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard this notion that all but x banks in the world are owned by the Rothschild's. I have yet to see a source that actually proves that this is real. I'm not saying I don't believe you either, because I most certainly do believe that the House of Rothschild has a hand in most of worlds central banks, because that's what initially made them their fortune. The Rockefeller's and likely many more elite families have branched off from the main Rothschild family tree, so I would suspect that perhaps the Rothschild's themselves don't own every central bank themselves, rather they are at the very least close business associates and possibly the boss of other banking families.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further research needs to be done, and I suspect we will find that the Rothschild's do have the leading authority over the majority of the world's banking schemes, but I also think they are manipulating how they are perceived to some degree.

       I made another post in this thread just now because I noticed something odd about this post and Flytape's recent post history. He deleted a thread that was nearly identical to the one he posted here, just so he could reconstrue its message, which he executed very poorly from a rhetorical standpoint. I can't tell what the original post contained because he deleted it, but his rhetoric is pretty shit.

       He said "after charging them", which suggest a trial. That's not a tool against the powerful. That's just the law being used in the same way against the powerful as it is used against the 'normal' population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which would be a fresh breath of air, rather than excluding the rich and powerful from common law.

       Hmmm.  Kill them so we can take over the world?  Seen this before.  Like ten times.  Then "we" become corrupt by our power we took.  Then someone kills us.  And they become corrupt.  Maybe just killing the other side and taking the moral high ground sounds good but I'd if it has ever.worked in practice.

       Try to fix.  If can't fix them then killthem so a non broken human can be born.  But it doesn't make sense to kill 500k people to get to kill one murderer.  Focus on love and spreading it.  Not on hate and killing.  In all honesty 99 percent of people are non violent.  The rest is craziness and planned wars by the elite.  Peace doesn't come from war.  It comes from peace.

       Another thing I noticed, Flytape deleted
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/368pxi/kill_the_rothschilds/">
        this
       </a>
       thread a few hours before he posted this.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did this because he quotes: "I've removed this post because it advocates the committing of a serious crime.
If you would like to repost with a more civilized method of dealing with the rothchilds (like a court of law and appropriate non-mob punishment) then I will let it stand.
Sorry but we just can't advocate murder, among other serious crimes."
      </p>
      <p>
       But the first thing the title of this thread mentions is "lethally inject the Rothschild's."
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care if one is legal and the other isn't, they are saying the exact same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flytape jacked the subject of another thread and then through in some extra bullshit from an un-backed source on another conspiracy forum that was posted 4 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably the single most unoriginal post I have ever seen on this subreddit, and we can obviously see this is a sloppy and lazy plea for attention from Flytape.
      </p>
      <p>
       We shouldn't be upvoting this kind of stuff incessantly, just because the title is "anti-Rothschild." We need to be checking facts and sources. Flytape has no ethos in this argument, and he stole the logos from another user. Beyond that the emotional appeal here is simple and overused.

       What is killing them going to accomplish?
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as they are gone another will rise to take their place. Getting rid of a family will only bring more violence. If you want them to go away then you will need to think of a better way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem with all of you is you think they have all the power. They don't because there are less of them and more of those that feel they are fucked over by them. People have to start getting more creative with their demands for stupid shit in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of you need to learn there are so many more greater forms of fucked up then just killing someone. You get into their heads. This family is still confined to the planet same as the rest of us. So it isn't like they can get away. Also you know the forms of transportation they would use so its easy enough to confine them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Damn people get with the program and stop just wanting to kill someone.

       Killing people makes shit happen does it? You are so wrong on man levels. All it does is force retribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to get into the mind of your enemy. Become what they fear the most and execute the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do these people have that you don't? Pretty much everything tangible I assume. They have no worries about finances. So you have to use that as a weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well what do they take for granted all the time? Give up yet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern standards of living wherever they may reside. So you take that away and force them to stay there. Lock them down and make it so they can't leave. Constantly making as much noise as possible to fuck with their sleep patterns. Make the sewage back up in their homes so they have to deal with shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut off the water so they can't have clean water. Shut off the gas and electricity so they can't have that. Just relentlsy fuck with them until they are forced to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Killing people doesn't solve anything. If it did then war would be so much eaiser.

       There's only one problem, you'll eventually run into holdouts who refuse to change and double down. Those are the one you eventually have to kill. It's nature.

       It won't do anything for benefit in this circumstance. I am sure there are ways to force change that don't involve death. Say drugs. Inject them with enough heroin to get them hooked and then take it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Force them into withdrawls. You are not thinking outside the box at all. You need to stop thinking practical and start thinking playstation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main thing is leadership to organize all this instead of talking about it. Actually fucking doing it rather then the consistant bitching. Organize it to a point that it would make a change or at the very least get attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is all you need is attention. Want another way to force change. If you are on foot as soon as you see a police officer run the opposite direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just flat out run till they say stop and let them hurt you. When they find out you have no reason to run say because I wanted you to chase me as I am starting a new movement to prove police want to assume everyone is guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to use mind games anymore. Breaking shit and setting cars on fire is over. You are going to have to prove things to the public. Like running from the cops that shouldn't matter. Just cause you are running away don't mean you are guilty and require to be fucked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to take back this country and show how bad shit really is. Remember there are way more of us then there are of them. That is a fact.

       The Rothschilds probably get a ride to the runway in a private helicopter and fly on their own private jet.  They don't mingle with the unwashed hordes.  Their grandiose view of themselves and a huge load of paranoia prevent that.  Your ideas are helpful, though.  The problem is widespread complaceny among the masses.

       The desire to murder political opponents is a defining element of fascism. That's why the American far right, most clearly manifest in the extreme libertarian / tea party / militia types, are the pure essence of American fascism. They routinely call for the execution of journalists who don't report the news the way they like, citizens who support the 2 parties, all of our past and present leaders at all levels of government. You can't go to any right wing web site, mainstream or fringe, including examples from Stormfront to Brietbart to Fox News, without finding conservatives tripping over themselves dreaming about violence and bloodshed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They talk about "liberty." The pretend to be opponents of authoritarianism. But bypassing democratic solutions with violence and imposing political preferences by force are the classic hallmarks of fascism. The militarization of politics is historically exemplified by the Nazi Sturmabteilung, but finds a modern parallel in rightwing movements like The Oathkeepers, and the many, many Republican / libertarian spokesmen who have openly fantasized about killing all their opponents over these past 6.5 years.

       Killing journalists and US citizens and even politicians  is a bad idea, and it's nowhere comparable to the idea of eliminating the Rothschilds.  The Rothschilds are a HUGE problem and have been for a long time.  In any case, it's not a good idea to talk about killing people any time you're online.  Or talking on your phone, or speaking near your toaster, or TV.

       Because it's unprovable, there is no verifiable way to confirm this affirmation as truth. The large majority of Central Banks are publicly owned, there is no one sole owner of these banks. Just saying they OWN a bank is in itself incorrect.

       This entire conspiracy claim comes from Eustace Mullins, under the direction of his mentor Ezra Pound. All of this stuff comes from Nazi Aryan propaganda, Ezra was a well known leader in Aryan League of America.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the late 1940s, when the poet Ezra Pound was incarcerated in St. Elizabeths Hospital
        <strong>
         on treason charges against the US
        </strong>
        , he corresponded with Mullins. In their correspondence, Mullins exclaimed "THE JEWS ARE BETRAYING US", in
        <strong>
         a letter written on Aryan League of America stationery
        </strong>
        . The two became friends and Mullins often visited the poet while he was detained.[16] In his "Foreword" to The Secrets of the Federal Reserve Mullins explains the circumstances by which he came to write his investigation into the origins of the Federal Reserve System: "In 1949, while I was visiting Ezra Pound ... [he] asked me if I had ever heard of the Federal Reserve System. I replied that I had not, as of the age of 25. He then showed me a ten dollar bill marked "Federal Reserve Note" and asked me if I would do some research at the Library of Congress on the Federal Reserve System which had issued this bill."
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         His October, 1952 article "Adolf Hitler: An Appreciation"
        </strong>
        was mentioned in a report by the House Un-American Activities Committee.[21] In it,
        <strong>
         he espoused anti-Semitic views and expressed the belief that America owes a debt to Hitler
        </strong>
        .[22] The article first appeared in The National Renaissance, journal of the National Renaissance Party
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In 1968, Mullins
       <strong>
        authored the tract The Biological Jew,
       </strong>
       which he claimed was an objective analysis of the forces behind the "decline" of Western Culture. He claimed that the main influence that people were overlooking in their analysis of world affairs was "parasitism"

       The Federal Reserve is different, I said the
       <strong>
        majority of central banks are publicly owned
       </strong>
       . Like in Europe for instance, and Canada.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         The stockholders in the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are the privately owned banks that fall under the Federal Reserve System. These include all national banks (chartered by the federal government) and those state-chartered banks that wish to join and meet certain requirements.
         <strong>
          About 38 percent of the nation’s more than 8,000 banks are members of the system, and thus own the Fed banks
         </strong>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The concept of “ownership” needs some explaining here, however. The member banks must by law invest 3 percent of their capital as stock in the Reserve Banks, and they cannot sell or trade their stock or even use that stock as collateral to borrow money. They do receive dividends of 6 percent per year from the Reserve Banks and get to elect each Reserve Bank’s board of directors.

         The ECB is governed by European law directly, but its set-up resembles that of a corporation in the sense that the ECB has shareholders and stock capital. Its capital is five billion euro held by the national central banks of the member states as shareholders. The initial capital allocation key was determined in 1998 on the basis of the states' population and GDP, but the key is adjustable Shares in the ECB are not transferable and cannot be used as collateral.

       See above.  The BIS works similarly to the ECB only on a much larger scale, operating as a for-profit corporation which doesn't represent any single one of its members but rather all of them collectively.

      <p>
       The BIS was also founded by western financiers and Nazis, among others, for whatever that's worth.

       I agree with your original point that there's no definitive evidence that the Rothschilds own all central banks in the world besides three and in fact that's an absurd claim to make that in my opinion (and probably yours too) undermines the legitimacy of the complaints regarding central banking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point I was making, though, is that central banks' shares aren't publicly traded and there is very little transparency with regard to their regulation, ownership, or management and so it's very hard to say who actually
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       own or control them despite the massive amount of influence they wield all around the world.  And that that is an issue that needs to be addressed rather than downplayed from where I'm sitting.

       Fair enough, perhaps I misunderstood you a bit and if so I apologize.  I do dislike this whole "Rothschild owns all central banks in the world" meme because even if the truth of the matter is that they are an immensely powerful family involved in international finance, and to me historical events and precedent suggest they probably are, they certainly wouldn't be acting alone nor would they be the only family involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it also makes the entire concept of central banking and it's lack of transparency very easy to dismiss entirely once this core premise is challenged and unable to be proven definitively.

       See I think the Rothschild family has been so diluted by marriage, and spread out that they really have no legitimate power over anything anymore. The richest Rothschild today is not even listed on the top 10 richest people in the world. Evelyn Rothschild is only net worth $ 20 Billion, paltry sum in comparison to Bill gates and his $ 79.2 billion net worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't think the conspiracy holds any weight, if the conspiracy community isn't blaming the Rothschild family it's the Rockefeller family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think it's way more complicated then that. And given the origins of this conspiracy are rooted in the American Nazi - Aryan League, I tend to not take it very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is a fucked up place, but I don't think we have secret rulers. The scarier thought is that no one is in control.

       I mean the global price of gold was fixed in the offices of NM Rothschild and Sons for literally hundreds of years and as recently as a decade ago so I don't think it's fair to say the family has lost all of its global power.  You don't get to that level of wealth and influence and then have it evaporate overnight - at the very least we'd have some very specific reasons which led to the downfall of the family (like we do for the Kennedy family, as the first example that comes to mind).
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't really trust the Forbes lists personally.  Bill Gates' wealth is minuscule compared to the hundreds of trillions of dollars that are at stake in the shadowy derivatives markets, for instance, as well as the hundreds of trillions of dollars the world is in debt (and as we know, where there is debt there's a person or persons who are owed the payment on that debt).  I wouldn't expect to see the name of the actual wealthiest person on Earth on that list.
      </p>
      <p>
       As another example, the RCC/Vatican is the largest land-owner on the planet the last time I checked.  That's a level of wealth and power that Bill Gates couldn't even touch yet none of it is reflected on the Forbes list.  I realize that the RCC is not one single person but the point here is that the Forbes list is not the be all end all when it comes to international wealth and influence.

       I don't think it's either of those two specifically but I think both families, among others, have had an incredible level of influence on global affairs for the last few hundred years and I don't see how that can be denied.  I mean you can listen to them tell you as much in their own words in various historical sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're right, it is certainly a hell of a lot more complicated than "Rothschild owns every central bank on Earth" but I wouldn't go so far as to say "Rothschild has no power whatsoever".

       I don't agree.  It's far scarier to consider that the huge majority of people on Earth are being enslaved and controlled by a tiny group of powerful people hiding in the shadows.  But being afraid is useless in either case so shouldn't be a factor when it comes to considering or discussing these things.

       Okay, so your point is that the law doesn't apply to those with money/power/influence, and I agree with that to a slightly lesser extent but still mostly.
