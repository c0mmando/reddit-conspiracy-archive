       As a free thinker myself, and a host of various theories that may or may not be posted on this subreddit, I've naturally looked into quite a few far fetched theories. While chemtrails are one of the much more sane and plausible conspiracy theories I've heard of, and I've also noticed the weather in the past few years has a surprising knack for screwing up my plans for the day, I've never really heard very much evidence to back up why people believe this to be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       As such, I've even hit Google a few times and have come up short on convincing evidence to support the theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence is there?

        this

       The thought that there may be planes flying overhead which are dispensing chemicals into the atmosphere for some purpose or another is a theory based on observations by some people that what they observe in the sky behind airplanes is at times not consistent with what they are used to seeing on average over time. No one needs evidence of what may be actually happening in order to introduce a theory about that what they observe. It is why we have science. Something is observed, someone thinks about what they have observed, and then posits a theory about something within the realm of all that is possible about what may be causing the observation. If the theory includes the participation of people who are acting in concert to surreptitiously achieve some means unbeknownst to those it is affecting, it may be called a conspiracy. Hence a conspiracy theory regarding trails left in the sky by airplanes operated by entities who may have a common, generally hidden goal.

       We see the chemtrail gridwork of lines most days in this part of central Texas, I finally convinced my brother and father that they are not just contrails/water vapor. I asked them to watch the sky for a few moonlit nights and tell my if they ever see the long straight lines or gridwork of "contrails" that we constantly see all through the day. After a while they had to admit that they never saw them at night- you'd think that water vapor cooling into contrails would still occur at night and maybe even at a higher rate since average temperatures are lower and humidity higher at night.
       <br/>
       TLDR: Whatever they are spraying has a relationship to sunlight- you never see chemtrails at night- just contrails and clouds. Self repost from the other day btw

       Eye-witness testimony is still quite powerful in court, and it isn't just me that sees them- its thousands of people worldwide. Read up on cloud types then watch the skies for a week or two during the day and moonlit nights and see for yourself.

       Seeing someone hold a gun and pull the trigger is much different then what you are describing. Thanks for the downvote for asking a legitimate question, though. Shameful.

       And fucking Google "contrails at night" and your nighttime theory is put to bed. Or is Google owned by the Man who is just lying to us?

      <p>
       Planes that you believe are dropping chemicals on us would need to be flying super low in order to affect the areas they have targeted. Our sky has many different layers with different conditions that would affect the special "dust" you think is falling on us, but I'm sure you know that. That being said, how have we never once caught a plane flying at a few thousand feet spraying dust on a town?

       Hi there,
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many patents linked to chemtrails. I have seen them linked but they are hard to find as they use patent language to describe the process which is a lot more abstract. Somebody may have some links and post to be helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a youtube channel Suspicious0bservers who does a very good objective look at weather, space weather and general solar activity. He has a video a day so theres a lot of stuff but if you look through you will find info. He also has some very interesting theories on various things such as the link between stars and water &amp; climate change. If you interested in this stuff I highly recommend you check him out, he uses credible primary sources like nasa and noaa to support what he says.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Suspicious0bservers">
        https://www.youtube.com/user/Suspicious0bservers
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You also get videographic evidence which is easily found:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypW4p2X_YHo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypW4p2X_YHo
       </a>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-xD0QxGlGM">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-xD0QxGlGM
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Hard to argue these videos are fake - especially the second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the best evidence I have seen is admittedly the least accessible from your PC. Its in person, I sometimes like to head up to the hills for walks and climbing. When you are outside all day you can see the effect of them. I have seen what starts as a small 'vapour trail' from an aircraft gradually over the course of several hours expand and become a giant long cloud. This is not a rare occurrence in the UK if you are watching the skies. You can often see clouds that look like they started as long straight lines even when you haven't been out in the hills all day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit - already linked elsewhere but here is a good list of patents:

       "Method of modifying weather
      </p>
      <p>
       Abstract
      </p>
      <p>
       A method for artificially modifying the weather by seeding rain clouds of a storm with suitable cross-linked aqueous polymer. The polymer is dispersed into the cloud and the wind of the storm agitates the mixture causing the polymer to absorb the rain. This reaction forms a gelatinous substance which precipitate to the surface below. Thus, diminishing the clouds ability to rain.

       Rhode Island just passed H5480, it's called Relating to the Health and Safety of Geoengineering. It defines Geoengineering as a method of injecting clouds with aerosols and particualte:

       Geoengineering is not chemtrails. Geoengineering is a serious issue concerning our future. In this case it is talking about cloud seeding - a process that's been in use since the Vietnam War. Chemtrails are just a bullshit conspiracy theory which falls apart under even the slightest examination.

       So wait. Is cloud seeding synonymous with Chem trails? I recall hearing quite a few recent news articles talking about using cloud seeding in dry areas and I thought that was a fact of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was under the impression that Chem trails had a potential negative effect on the population, or so some of the theories go.

       Yes. But when people use the term "persistent contrails" they are referring to the trails as unintentional. "Chemtrails" usually implies they are being sprayed intentionally. There are different degrees of the chemtrail debate:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Contrails are just water vapor and completely harmless.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Contrails are unintentional but still a pollution problem. Obviously planes have fuel burning engines and so the trails have to be at least fuel exhaust and not just water.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Chemtrails are intentional Geoengineering programs. Mixed in with the normal contrails, some of these trails are actually government/industry sponsored experimental programs to reverse global warming. Geoengineering is admitted to science with some admitted experiments but it is still denied in the mainstream that these programs go on regularly.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Not only are the Geoengineering programs going on, the military is using them as cover to test biological agents. This became a thing because a geoengineer named Ken Caldeira came out and said that he was in a military meeting where they discussed putting diseases into sprayed geoengineering clouds. Vid here:

       Huh. I'm not backing this guys up, nor am I calling him a liar, but if the guy truly doesn't have a security clearance than it's likely that he'd have no idea even if they were planning on doing stuff like this. Whether it could be done or not (which I have no doubt that it could), it wouldn't be made public nor would people without a clearance hear any hard proof about it until many years later (if ever), or unless some martyr blew the whistle.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the past few months I've heard the news stating it as a fact that they HAVE used cloud seeding in quite a few areas which is what piqued my interest for proof of these chem trails. I don't remember the articles, or even the subject, but I'm 99% sure I heard/ read this very recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also recall reading up on cloud seeding when the subject first got started quite a few years ago, and I recall that after some real world tests to in an attempt to bring rain to dry stricken areas, they ended up making a good number of mistakes when they first started messing with it (it's hard to predict when and where the precipitation will actually take place if clouds were seeded in x location, and so on). I recall hearing something about making some areas drier because of mountains in the area not cooperating or something like that, but I don't recall if that's actually what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Heres a link about cloud seeding:

      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Cloud seeding is no longer considered a fringe science, and is considered a mainstream tool to improve rain precipitation and snow. New technology and research have produced reliable results that make cloud seeding a dependable and affordable water-supply practice for many regions.[6] While practiced widely around the world, the effectiveness of cloud seeding is still a matter of academic debate.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So if cloud seeding is synonymous with chem trails, then obviously the answer is yes. They do do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as any conspiracy behind it, I'm not sure how easy that is to believe. It'd essentially be suicide for the people who ordered the spraying etc. which is one of the reasons why deadly gasses are now illegal as well. I have no doubt the capability is there. But unless they could control the dispersal of said agent somehow (which again, I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest), then this probably hasn't made it to the 'practice' stage yet.

       No.  I think you'd agree that the "chemtrails" idea is really about those persistent cloud trails that planes sometimes leave, right?  Cloud seeding doesn't cause those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the believers try to equate the two ideas, because (as you pointed out), cloud seeding is a real and well-documented thing.  So, it's helpful if they can point to documentation of weather modification (cloud seeding) and claim it as evidence for "chemtrails."  But there's no logical connection.

The idea is that they are spraying metallic nano particles that reflect the sun to counteract global warming. They can also activate these particles using directed energy from ground stations (HAARP Program,) to affect cloud formations

       I've seen some decent videos showing them turning off the sprayers then resuming ect. I've also seen the with my own eyes. The have a particular look to them. One could argue it's a common contrail but these trails turn into milky wispy clouds that block a portion of the sun out. I've also seen rainbow type formations just outside of the direct sun which would indicate something strange is being sprayed.

        WRGB WEATHERMAN RESIGNS UNDER CLOUD CHANNEL 6 SAYS STEVENS LIED ON RESUME

   Section: CAPITAL REGION, Page: B1
   Date: Wednesday, February 15, 1995

       <p>
        NISKAYUNA Weatherman Scott Stevens has resigned from WRGB (Channel 6) after station management accused him of lying about his credentials.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a statement read during Tuesday's 6 p.m. broadcast, David Lynch, vice president and general manager, said WRGB "hired Scott Stevens to be chief meteorologist based on faulty information provided by Scott'' and his agency. WRGB subsequently learned that "Scott has never completed the necessary academic course of studies that would lead him to the official title of meteorologist,'' according to the statement read by anchorwoman JoAnne Purtan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lynch's statement emphasized that Stevens' allegedly false presentation of his credentials and the station's concern for its integrity was the issue, not Stevens' performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        ``During his time at WRGB, Scott Stevens has done a superb job of forecasting the weather. His knowledge of meteorology and his broadcasting experience have provided him with the background to serve you well,'' the statement said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meteorologist Steve LaPointe will replace Stevens on the 5, 6, 6:30 and 11 p.m. broadcasts, the station announced.
       </p>
       <p>
        When contacted Tuesday night, Stevens, 28, an Idaho native, said he never lied about not completing his bachelor's degree at the University of Kansas.
       </p>
       <p>
        He said he plans to finish his degree, which he originally put on the back burner in favor of a television job. ``As a 22-year-old, when you get a good job offer, that's what talks. My priorities weren't right,'' he said.
       </p>
       <p>
        He contends that his resignation was forced by a technicality; namely, the credentials required to be a meteorologist.
       </p>
       <p>
        ``Meteorologist is a very vague term . . . and then when you get into television on top of that, it adds another whole mix into it,'' he said.
       </p>
       <p>
        ``It's television. It's different than academia. They're buying a personality. They're buying talent. That's what the TV game is about. It's about people,'' Stevens continued.
       </p>
       <p>
        He said he has no immediate plans. ``I wasn't thinking about looking for work, to be honest with you. It's time to gather the thoughts, and goals and mind, and go on.''
       </p>
       <p>
        Stevens said his time in the Capital Region was enjoyable. "The people have been surprisingly wonderful. You have a lot of preconceived ideas about New Yorkers,'' he said. "I've enjoyed living up here and was looking forward to a much longer tenure.''​

       Well, there are patents for geoengineering, but that's about as far as real evidence goes. Most chemtrail posts in this sub are just pictures of contrails and someone who doesn't know how clouds form freaking out about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure a user will drop by soon with a huge chemtrail copypasta full of half-truths and debunked YouTube videos.

       Is a bill the same thing as a patent? Short answer, no.
      </p>
      <p>
       And didn't you say the only evidence is a patent?

       I'm pretty sure when a state issues an ordinance to specify and limit an action within the state, that it exists.

       The bill specifically says that it doesn't exist in practice and the bill is aimed at stopping it from happening in the state should it start anywhere else.

       It's just proposed legislation, it's far from being passed.  And no one disagrees that the potential is there for geoengineering to exist in the future - which is explicitly what that bill is about.
