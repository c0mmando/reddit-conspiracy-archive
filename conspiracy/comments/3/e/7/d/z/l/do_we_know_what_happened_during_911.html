    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxl06jxfgRk">WTC 7 went into free-fall (click for a compilation)</a>, literally gravitational acceleration <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N23Y89K.png">(the official reports even admit this)</a> which is impossible in a steel framed building, there is nothing in science or engineering that would explain how every single supporting column would disappear within mere fractions of a second, the only explanation, within the realms of science, is explosives of some description, taking out the columns in a timed sequence.</p>

<p>This violates basic Newtonian physics, IF, you choose to believe the official report that fires caused the collapse, obviously it is impossible for a building to go into freefall in any other scenario, this explains why NIST refuse to release there data for independent validation, the only relevant documents that support their theory that fire brought down a steel framed building (first time in history, still to this day) <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">are classified for public safety</a>, they will not even release them to a <a href="http://cryptome.org/wtc-nist-wtc7-no.pdf">licensed NYC architect in regards a FOIA request</a></p>

<p>Why are they hiding this data? Likely because it is not based on any known science and engineering principles, if we have to go on what they have released so far, <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/NIST-collapse-model-building-7.jpg">a collapse model that bores no resemblance to the observed collapse</a> </p>

<p>Thus their findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data and so if anyone outside of NIST believes what they say, they believe it on pure faith. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QyTbq5P">Page 3 and the architect&#39;s appeal over the remaining 3370 files</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>The acceleration of gravity in New York City is 32.159 ft/s2. WTC7 had 2.25 seconds of literal freefall, this is equivalent to approximately 8 stories of fall in which the falling section of the building encountered zero resistance. The collapse was complete in 6.5 seconds. Free-fall time in a vacuum, from Building 7&#39;s roof is 5.96 seconds</p>

<p>For any object to fall at gravitational acceleration, there can be nothing below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance. If there is anything below it that would tend to impede its progress or offer any resistance, then not all of the potential energy of the object would be converted to motion and so would not be found falling at gravitational acceleration (where did every single structural supporting columns go, instantly, at the exact same time?)</p>

<p>There&#39;s no exception to that rule, those are the conditions that must exist for gravitational acceleration to occur for the entirety of the duration of the time it occurs, this is basic Newtonian physical principles.</p>

<p>You either agree with this very basic concept, or you need to start making a case for a new realm of science that has never been witnessed before.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltP2t9nq9fI">Remember also that the BBC even reported that the building had collapsed 20minutes before it had</a>, remarkable.</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YmynBCH.jpg">The tilting of the south tower,</a> just before collapse.</p>

<p>According to Sir Isaac Newton’s law of the conservation of momentum, it should have kept tipping over, but it didn&#39;t, it fell through the path of greatest resistance. The top was tilting at approximately 20 degrees or so, how could it be exerting a uniform, symmetrical pressure on the floors below? it didn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08nhsn9w9Vg">Watch a compilation of the collapse</a> what you are observing is approximately 30 upper floors begin to rotate as a block, to the south and east.They begin to topple over, not fall straight down.The torque due to gravity on this block is enormous, as is its angular momentum. But then  this block turned mostly to powder in mid-air! How can we understand this strange behavior, without explosives?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Ag88tNY.jpg">Video evidence also shows that the lower sections of the Towers do not even begin to start collapsing until the upper sections are completely destroyed</a>. </p>

<p>This is an impossibility if we are to believe the official reports </p>

<hr/>

<p>NIST&#39;s global collapse theory, in regards the complete collapse of two 110 story skyscrapers violates Newton&#39;s laws of motion.</p>

<p>It is scientifically impossible and completely illogical that these two buildings, which had an upper block exerting a force of only 36% of its static weight, could crush the larger, stronger, undamaged lower section of the building
to the ground, when the building, at any level, was designed to support several times the weight above
it,  while it maintains its downward acceleration. </p>

<p>The persistent acceleration of the top section of the building is
direct evidence that some other source of energy was used to remove the structure below it, </p>

<p>Videos show that the section of the building above the plane impact point was the first section to disintegrate</p>

<hr/>

<p>Perhaps the most compelling evidence in favor of the demolition theory is that the NIST WTC Reports, which took up to seven years to produce, exhibit all six of the characteristics of politically motivated pseudoscience</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lack of experiment - NIST performed no physical experiments to support its conclusions</p></li>
<li><p>The results of experiments were ignored or contradicted in the conclusions - steel temperature tests performed on the few steel samples saved suggested that the steel reached only about 500 degrees Fahrenheit. This is more than a thousand degrees below the temperature needed to soften steel and make it malleable—a key requirement of NIST’s hypothesis</p></li>
<li><p>There was no peer review and public comments from peers were ignored - NIST published its own WTC reports and therefore its work was not subject to peer-review as is the case for all legitimate science.</p></li>
<li><p>The findings cannot be replicated or falsified due to the withholding of data - NIST will not share it computer models with the public. A NIST spokesman declared, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, that revealing the computer models would “jeopardize public safety.”</p></li>
<li><p>False conclusions are supported by media or marketing propaganda - NIST’s pseudoscience was fully and uncritically supported by the mainstream media, many journalists have since stated they were under pressure from management to not report 9/11 stories if they were critical of the official narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>Hypotheses that are supported by the evidence were ignored - Throughout its seven-year investigation, NIST ignored the obvious hypothesis for the destruction of the WTC buildings—demolition</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, the WTC reports produced by NIST represent the most obvious example of politically motivated pseudoscience in history. The physical experiments NIST performed did not support its conclusions. The reports were not peer-reviewed and public comments that challenged the findings were ignored. NIST will not share its computer models (the last supposed evidence that supports its conclusions) with the public and therefore its conclusions are not verifiable.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a biomedical engineer fuckboi, you haven&#39;t proven anything wrong. I&#39;m an engineer that studies cancer, as is my entire department. </p>

<p>Aside from that, if you think engineers can&#39;t study cancer, you&#39;re even stupider than I thought. Run along in your small, ignorant little world where fields fail to overlap. </p>

<p>No where here does it say edited YouTube videos as a source, did you even read your own link or did you just Google something vapidly (which makes sense because it&#39;s about as concrete as your argument). </p>

<p>Yeah, you&#39;re just a le conspiracy shill. Muting this conversation, trying to have discourse with your chest beating is a waste of time and frankly a little disheartening. If I keep this up, I might become disenfranchised with people, if they&#39;re at all like your nonsensical shouting. It&#39;s a shame people like you get to vote.  &quot;/</p>

<p>EDIT: I also like how you think even if you have a bachelor&#39;s degree in engineering that it makes you qualified to talk about doing research. I ACTUALLY have a bachelor&#39;s degree in engineering and am a senior PhD student (doing, you know, ACTUAL research) and it&#39;s hilarious and sad how much undergrads think they know when compared to what they actually know. Enough to get a job, not enough to do much else. </p>
