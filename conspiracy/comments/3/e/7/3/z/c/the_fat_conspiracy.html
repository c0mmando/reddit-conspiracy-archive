It seems that modern society does everything it can to fatten us up and dumb us down and convince us to have a little of fat little kids.   Then when people start speaking out against this subreddits are banned and its labeled hate speech.  What do you all think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rise in obesity is due to two things, in my opinion.</p>

<p>1) The rise of shitty food. There has always been bad food, and there has always been fat people. But the influx of shittier, and admittedly tastier, food options has allowed people to really get out of hand with every meal. It allows them to shut their kids up with some Burger King, or appease them with some Ho-Ho&#39;s. Don&#39;t get me wrong, that shit tastes good. But it has to be in moderation.</p>

<p>2) Lack of discipline. No one is forcing us to eat anything. My first year of college I realized I wasn&#39;t happy with my body. I also wanted to get laid more. I lost 45 pounds in 3 months, and it is still off 4 years later. All because I ate better day to day and played a little bit of basketball. Personal responsibility and self-discipline can really improve our lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget that education plays a big role.  Nutrition is barely taught in schools.  Most adults don&#39;t pay attention to ingredients lists and have no idea what nutrition labels mean.  Michelle Obama was going to start an anti-obesity campaign aimed at nutrition education until junk food lobbyists bought her out and it became focused on &#39;light exercise&#39;.  Not to mention the disinfo propagated by the Fat Acceptance movement and the media regarding obesity being genetic and diets not working.</p>

<p>Like you said, it&#39;s up to personal responsibility at this point.  We can&#39;t trust the government to have our best interests because junk food companies are buying them out.  I honestly think it&#39;s in the government&#39;s interest to fatten people up so they&#39;re impotent and dependent on the system.  Like you, in college I cleaned up my diet and took up gymnastics to improve how I looked as well as general athleticism.  Once you break free from all the processed foods you see how badly it affects your body and mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if schools did teach nutrition, what would the lessons be? That&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>Would they get the same schpeel of low calorie, low fat, high in grains and dairy (because dairy is good for bones!) bullshit that has made our country fat, sick, and diseased?</p>

<p>We are one of the top consumers of dairy on this entire planet yet have the highest instances of osteoporosis.  But... but... I thought milk was good for our bones, that&#39;s what the government, my doctor, that commercial... that&#39;s what they all said, right?</p>

<p>The fact that the medical community has been wrong about dietary fat for fifty fucking years and still hasn&#39;t changed its guidelines, heart disease is still a number one killer, and everyone is more overweight and obese than any time in history, I really don&#39;t know how much faith I have in schools to teach nutrition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for any typos or errors, I&#39;m on mobile, but....</p>

<p>Your two primary reasons are wildly incorrect.  As a medical professional, someone who has studied dietetics and nutrition for the past several years, and someone who has worked on the hill to influence medical policy, I can tell you the primary reason for the obesity epidemic in America lies with whoever is making the most money off of it - and that&#39;s a lot of fucking people.</p>

<p>Almost 50 years ago, when heart disease was on the rise, doctors and scientists alike sought out to find out why.  Their result?  A study with fabricated outcomes, which gave birth to low fat dieting and low fat hysteria.  Food companies started replacing fatty ingredients with sugar.  Big Corn started producing HFCS to add to these products, and everyone just kept getting bigger.  </p>

<p>Poor people are more likely to work labor intensive jobs, but they are also equally as likely to be overweight and obese.  How can those two statements coexist when we, as a society, put so much emphasis on calorie expenditure? Because CICO is a flawed science and the true cause of obesity is primary food and not &quot;laziness.&quot;  Keep that in mind when you&#39;re thinking about people who are trying to eat and be healthy.  </p>

<p>The influx of sugar in the SAD is toxic, but it&#39;s all everyone knows.  Now you&#39;ve got a billion dollar pharmaceutical industry, billion dollar food industry selling &quot;low fat&quot; foods - which (surprise!) cause obesity instead of helping it, Big Corn, Big Dairy, doctors literally getting away with treating people for hypertension and high cholesterol while their patients are still dying of heart disease, and no one thinks... Let&#39;s go back to the drawing board here!</p>

<p>Companies lobby our government to stay relevant.  Food companies buy themselves a spot on our food pyramid. The American Heart Association, the one that puts cute little labels on sugary shit cereals, takes money from General Mills, ...</p>

<p>... and the public buys into this idea that we, the people, are 100% at fault for the state of our health.  It&#39;s our fault if we are obese... we must eat shit and not move enough while we are quite literally being sold disease and death.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; and 125lbs, btw.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling and no links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are plenty of fiscally capable people who can afford healthy eating and choose not to. I&#39;m nowhere near well off still and was able to make simple changes during college (a time when I had even less money) and still drop 45 pounds. A lot of bad choices are still made and are avoidable, regardless of the monetary situation of an individual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is people don&#39;t even know what&#39;s healthy to begin with.  They think processed sugary cereals are healthy because it has an American Heart Association logo on it.  Cereal is cheap as fuck.  People skip over eggs to buy that crap while wholeheartedly thinking they are doing the right thing.  </p>

<p>Affordability is a small part of the problem. Misinformation is the majority of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes we all technically have choice, but that does not reflect reality. Why on Earth would so many people &quot;choose&quot; to be in thousands of dollars of student debt when there are alternatives? Why would so many people work such long hours, neglecting their family? Why would people continue buying things they don&#39;t need with money they don&#39;t have? Why would people continue to elect criminals into our government year after year after year when they know very well that all the choices are shitty?</p>

<p>When they make the McShitburger combo cheaper, easier and tastier than the healthier alternatives, do we really have a choice? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know taste is subjective and all, but fast food/junk food is not even remotely tasty. Stop eating it for 6+ months and then go back and order anything from McDonald&#39;s or Taco Bell... you can literally taste the cocktail of chemicals they put in it. I suppose some people might find the taste of artificial ingredients more palatable though. IMO fast food is the most vile and disgusting thing that has ever stimulated my taste buds ever. This is coming from a cigarette smoker too (trying to quit lol). Not too mention, I don&#39;t know how regular eaters of it go #2 without a daily supplement of MiraLAX.</p>
