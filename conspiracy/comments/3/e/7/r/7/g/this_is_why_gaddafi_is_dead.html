       Lack of an IMF backed bank to enslave the populace lead to Libya's downfall. Gaddafi did not play ball and they f'ed him over.

       The people on top are delusional and sick, but this is nothing new. Those who think they know best and want to be better than the rest generally lack the sense to actually figure out how to be happy without oppressing others to the point that their schemes topple.

       Easiest way to scare some of their followers or citizens into falling in line is to kill the messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Death on its surface seems like the easiest solution for those who would love to maintain control in a world that is through their choice of suppression techniques becoming more open.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of trying to be so open about it, they need to be more subtle. I bet the people in charge have advisors telling them not to rush certain things, but when you have an ego the size of a country or planet, you tend to fuck up a lot because you know you "know" better.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is it does not always work (killing someone to quiet a message) and does not work on people who are (for lack of a better descriptive term) radicalized: people educated enough not to just go on a shooting spree but to research and build their own knowledge, spurred by the sound silencing of the source of the message.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to target people like this I have seen in action, is to create puppets or open hangouts. It weeds out the smarter than average but still not quite there as far as understanding that whom they are watching too is still apart of the system the same as they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet another layer of control to get them back in line, or at least focus their anger in a direction that does not change anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, these limited hangouts only work on some, and the smarter individuals still watch, but to learn the techniques of how to spot "fake saviors".
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end you are going to have dissenters no matter what you do, but to escalate things to kill someone levels always shows a lack of imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because something works does not mean it will work forever due to many factors that cannot be seen nor predicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       But TLDNR: they kill because they are lazy and take what seems to be the easiest way out, without realizing all they are doing is making the problem worse.

       I remember watching an HBO special on Gaddafi and the only thing that really stuck out to me was how they toured his palace that had an underground area just for him and his underage sex slaves. I don't know how true it was but it worked very well for making the people cheer for his death. They painted him as a very sadistic pedophile.

       While I found this list too in a documentary, I want to see the other side with some facts too if someone has and/or they exist. Like the accusations of being a murderer or pedophile. Don't wanna be biased just because its "conspiracy friendly subject". Also I recommend reading his book called "The green book".

       And threatening western nations directly in his last speech to the Arabian council over WMD's, albeit in a tongue and cheek fashion.  It was the speech with Assad and the Saudis in attendance and they were laughing with/at him at his most outrageous comments.   A little ironic Assad was laughing, although he isn't dead yet so maybe not so ironic.
