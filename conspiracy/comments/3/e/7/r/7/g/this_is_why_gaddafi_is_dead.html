    <div class="md"><p>Easiest way to scare some of their followers or citizens into falling in line is to kill the messenger.</p>

<p>Death on its surface seems like the easiest solution for those who would love to maintain control in a world that is through their choice of suppression techniques becoming more open.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to be so open about it, they need to be more subtle. I bet the people in charge have advisors telling them not to rush certain things, but when you have an ego the size of a country or planet, you tend to fuck up a lot because you know you &quot;know&quot; better.</p>

<p>The problem is it does not always work (killing someone to quiet a message) and does not work on people who are (for lack of a better descriptive term) radicalized: people educated enough not to just go on a shooting spree but to research and build their own knowledge, spurred by the sound silencing of the source of the message.</p>

<p>The best way to target people like this I have seen in action, is to create puppets or open hangouts. It weeds out the smarter than average but still not quite there as far as understanding that whom they are watching too is still apart of the system the same as they are.</p>

<p>Yet another layer of control to get them back in line, or at least focus their anger in a direction that does not change anything.</p>

<p>The thing is, these limited hangouts only work on some, and the smarter individuals still watch, but to learn the techniques of how to spot &quot;fake saviors&quot;.</p>

<p>In the end you are going to have dissenters no matter what you do, but to escalate things to kill someone levels always shows a lack of imagination.</p>

<p>Just because something works does not mean it will work forever due to many factors that cannot be seen nor predicted.</p>

<p>But TLDNR: they kill because they are lazy and take what seems to be the easiest way out, without realizing all they are doing is making the problem worse.</p>

I don&#39;t know how true it was but it worked very well for making the people cheer for his death. They painted him as a very sadistic pedophile. </p>
