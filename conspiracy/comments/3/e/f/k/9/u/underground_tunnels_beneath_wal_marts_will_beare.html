        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Was deep in the rabbit hole of YouTube and found a video with this link from a post in Paulding County Georgia from 2004. It talks about Homeland Security wanting a means of &quot;rapid deployment in the South.&quot; It sounds exactly like what they&#39;re doing in the South/Southwest right now with Jade Helm. It even mentions the locations of certain Wal Marts nearby were picked for a specific purpose, and more will be (have been) done like it in the future. Again, that was 11 years ago. Imagine how big that rail system is now... Or how much of the country it already covers..</p>

<p><a href="http://paulding.com/forum/topic/10778-tunnels-walmart-yorkville/">http://paulding.com/forum/topic/10778-tunnels-walmart-yorkville/</a></p>

<p>Edit: New video I found referencing the same post with more detailed info: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCyH5Bu5TY4&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCyH5Bu5TY4&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>Further edit: I never said that all Wal Marts were connected to this, just the ones that are in good geographical regions and are centralized around the system as it is.</p>

<p>Two or three wal-marts have closed in my town. All of them relocated accross town within a few months and the old building was either destroyed or repurposed in the same timeframe.</p>

<p>Sounds sketchy if it&#39;s still around and being used but no one new bought it.</p>

Expensive as in Switserland does not have an abundance of tunnels and some of them both directions in one pipe.

<p>It&#39;s only &quot;real&quot; when it comes to &quot;peons&quot;, otherwise it is merely a tool to control the &quot;peons&quot; with which makes no matter to those who issue the currency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to look at the cost/benefit ratio of something like this, as the price tag would be beyond staggering.  There&#39;s a reason why tunnels are the last resort for engineers, and why you see bridges over lakes and rivers as opposed to tunnels underneath them.</p>

<p>The cost of underground rail ranges from $100m/km on the cheap end, to $500m/km on the expensive end. To connect Wal-Marts with tens of thousands of kilometers of tunnels would have a price tag that approaches the entire GDP of the US. At that point you need to ask: what <em>can&#39;t</em> the US military do on their own land and in their own airspace, that would justify the cost of a tunnels system costing, optimistically, 20 times the annual expenditure of the entire military? Could those trillions of dollars be better spent elsewhere?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Call me crazy but I believe there is already an extensive tunnel system connecting deep underground military bases all over the country using some type of high speed train or pod. </p>

<p>The technology to quickly build these tunnels easily has existed since as early as the 50s or the 70s at the latest. The idea that they are expanding this network to walmarts does not seem out of the question to me. Look at what the soviets did with sub tunnels during the cold war. Its impressive to say the least. </p>

<p>Lots of different places out there with varying credibility to look at this but I thought this link had an interesting mix of information.</p>

<p>I can tell you that north of Camp David in the Catoctin National Park there are some strange sheds sprinkled through the woods with bars on the windows and red, yellow, and green indicator light bulbs on them. Probably just for water treatment but I could see how they could be tunnel access or ventilation as well. </p>

<p>Another side comment, when I was a kid I hiked up the back side of the park land up towards Camp David and there was a sand bag fortress firing range into a massive dirt mound (like football field 40 ft high huge). Just sitting there no fence on public land. I never got chased away or anything. They say the buildings visible are nothing compared to the underground facilities there. I assume that&#39;s where all the dirt came from. </p>

<p>I also went to a sleep over at Camp David when I was in elementary school. Didn&#39;t get into many buildings though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The simplest answer would be to support underground life between deep underground bases after the surface was uninhabitable. Look up Alternative 3. I&#39;ve never watched it and people claim its a hoax but regardless it makes sense.</p>

<p>The first alternative was the drastic reduction of the human population on Earth. The second alternative was the construction of vast underground shelters to house government officials and a cross section of the population until the climate had stabilised, a solution reminiscent of the finale of Dr Strangelove. The third alternative, the so-called &quot;Alternative 3,&quot; was to populate Mars via a way station on the Moon.</p>

<p>Playing devils advocate for a second:  it would extremely easy for DHS to build rail ways under Walmarts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even close to easy.  Take a look at a project like Vancouver&#39;s Canada Line. 19km, only two km of which are bored tunnel. It took 5 years and over a thousand construction workers, and was highly disruptive to the city for years. You can&#39;t just plop a machine into the ground and start digging a ready-to-use tunnel. This isn&#39;t an Austin Powers movie. You need years of planning for even small projects. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transporting the equipment could easily be disguised in Walmart trucks that get dropped off at certain stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it couldn&#39;t. Back to to the Canada Line project. At just 19km it was the largest construction project BC had seen in 20 years. It required over 350,000 cubic meters of concrete and 40 million kg of rebar.  It stretched concrete supplies in BC thin for years, and we produce a shitload of concrete. How do you go about shipping hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of concrete into WalMarts? At 8-10 cubic meters per concrete truck, you&#39;re looking at thousands of truckloads of concrete for even a short run of tunnel, and a massive disruption to concrete supplies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DHS gets pretty much unlimited funding for the government and could allocate funds necessary to do this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DHS has a budget of about $38B a year. We&#39;re looking at a cost in the trillions to do a single tunnel from one city to another.  What is so important about a tunnel like this that they couldn&#39;t better spend those trillions on something else?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The issue I foresee is the actual digging of the tunnels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s definitely an issue, but it&#39;s only one of many issues with every aspect of the theory. </p>

As far as footage goes, I haven&#39;t been able to find any yet, but have just started digging on the subject. I think that it is totally possible for them to build something like this without the general public knowing, look at the deep underground military bases (D.U.M.B.s) that exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sounds like the MX Missile Tunnel thing, just repackaged.</p>

<p>Edit: I guess that was missing some context.  It was theorized, back during the Reagan administration, the most of the ICBM launch complexes were linked by a thousands-of-miles-long underground rail system.  In thirty years, no evidence of the existence of such a thing has surfaced, and honestly, the logistics on maintaining something like that are pretty hairy.  It&#39;s not impossible, but if it actually existed, keeping it a secret would be.</p>
