       I don't post often in this sub, but I do visit everyday &amp;  read a LOT of the threads. It seems like there has been an unsual amount of trash posts in here lately, as well as people who seem to be pushing a racial agenda or just trying to bait the community. Is it just me or has anyone else noticed?

       This sub has been constantly discredited for the past few years. I've seen it in many posts across reddit where the users will point to all of the racist stuff that goes on in here. If you weren't aware, it's extremely easy to pretend to be a racist. That isn't to say racists aren't here. I know some are. I'm also pretty sure a lot of it is fake.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">
        Here is just one example of a former r/news mod pretending to be an antisemite in this sub
       </a>
       . (click on the screenshot and look at the link flair. Bipolarbear0 was logged into his account, screenshotted it, then logged into a fake account and posted here. Also see all of the other antisemitic posts he submitted here)
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter the percentage of fake racist garbage in here, I'd say just ignore it. Perhaps a few of them can be talked out of their racism? Who knows. The most important thing to take away from this is the fact that since we are being targeted, there must be content here that is good enough for "them" (whoever they are) to go after this sub. So, in a roundabout way, it's a good sign.

       I agree with everything you said :) I've only strayed from the herd &amp; started looking for the real truth in the last two years, so I'm still learning. I think I just find it insulting that they think we can be so easily baited. I'm sure I'm a little touchy because I'd rather be asleep right now. :)

       You're just noticing this?  I've been here at least 7 years.  Way back I'd have conversations that stretched many pages and were, despite disagreement, polite and edifying for all commenters and readers.  Now I rarely comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sick of bigots and idiots who insult rather than discuss.  We also should probably urge the promotion/creation of a sub for people to discuss pyramidal magic and ley lines and such.  I'm tired of that here.  [In all fairness I insult that stuff sometimes because it makes so little sense.]  This sub is about conspiracies, not completely illogical and disprovable "magic", faked ancient giants and disprovable ancient civilizations with flying machines.

       People get really aggressive here lately. One comment and then
       <em>
        BAM
       </em>
       suddenly you're a shill because you thought critically about something and you're free range for ad hominem and other rule-breaking behavior that never gets removed no mater how many times you report them.

       It's not that I'm just noticing. It just seems like in the last two weeks or so, there has been an uptick in these types of trash posts. I've only been on reddit about 11 months, so I don't have the experience or knowledge that you most likely do. You are spot on with the insult vs. discussion. Sometimes, I'm hesitant to post because of thise issues.

       I've been on Reddit since the beginning like 2006ish and well under many different user names. What I noticed was /conspiracy has already been destroyed. /conspiracy use to be not as raciest, in fact it was really rare to read raciest commentary on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       just because you believe in conspiracies does not mean you are a raciest but racism is the easiest and quickest way to divide a community. people would come to this sub to discuss anything and everything related to their own personal versions of conspiracies and would also link to news events that support their claim. In the end this sub takes all news and links that support any conspiracies that other subs wont, for the fact of anti censorship alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       what happened next was the sharing of views and this became a threat for some outsiders, they started a mass campaign against mods and users of this sub, this sub was brigaded and then an attacking sub decided it would be fun to flood /conspiracy with raciest content. As others pointed out there is tons of proof out there, i don't think i need to link any, you can search for yourself. In fact there were not just one but several subs created to flood this sole sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       for some reason now conspiracies are also "streamlined" in this sub, if you don't believe the group thought here then your conspiracy version is not valid. This view had changed, originally you could bring a viewpoint and others would elaborate on it but i think since trolls and shills moved in if you think differently then may be considered a shill or troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       in the end, this sub went on defense against shills and trolls and lots of its users have left or routinely change names. I left myself because I don't believe racism applies to typical conspiracies.  Also the amount of anti post made it NSFW for me. After the outsiders flooding this raciest commentary on here this sub looks less creditable and is in no way looking like its former self, it will never go back also if there is a persistent threat against it.

       I think it's sad that you had to leave based on the changing low value threads being posted. I find myself basically weeding through the nonsense &amp; racist trash to find the informative, insightful gems that are still in here. Granted they are becoming harder to find due to the influx of racist/baiting posts. Reddit is definitely not my only source for info, thanks to some kind people on this sub who directed me to a plethora of sites. I may abandon ship at some point as well, but I'm hoping things in here will turn. Hopefully that's not just wishful thinking on my part.

       Is there a chance you might have list of those trust worthy sites? Im not trying to be rude I'm just asking since It would be really helpful for people who don't know many great sites with good info, like me. If you don't want to then that's completely fine.

       Sure..these are a few I was told about when I posted for help looking for info a while back. Some may or may not be to your taste, but you may find one you like in there somewhere. Personally, I'm not a fan of infowars/Alex Jones, but I included it because it may interest you. Hope this helps.

       Yes the sub is being manipulated a lot worse than usual. The racial stuff and the alternative web sites pushing hard for views. Their also seems to be more than usual outsiders voting and commenting. Hot mainstream conspiracy posts like the planned parenthood chick wanting a Lambo for baby parts couldn't get over 17 up votes.

       It seems they are trying to destroy the community from the inside out. I doubt it will work though because most in this community seem way too intelligent to fall for it. Ridiculous posts aside, I have found this to be one of the most welcoming, friendly subs on Reddit with most people willing to help me gain insight without the usual snark &amp; sarcasm.
