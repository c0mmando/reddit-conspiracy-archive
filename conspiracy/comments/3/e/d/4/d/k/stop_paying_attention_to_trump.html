The electronic voting machines can have malicious code in them that self deletes and can be undetectable favoring one candidate over another. They are also elected by the Electoral College, do your own research I don&#39;t have time to rant about that. Trump is being propped up in the Republican race to make you forget about Rand Paul. Notice how it was all Rand in the beginning then it went Trump Trump TRUMP? He&#39;s going to pull a John Kerry and concede to Hilary Clinton in the final moments. It&#39;s all a game people, I suggest you learn how to start playing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I got caught up in the theater of politics for a while before I learned better. What I came to realize though is that I am indeed a slave to the system, and my only options at this point are to be responsible with my finances enough to slowly and painfully remove myself from it. I&#39;ve spent the last 10 years working my way to a comfortable enough income that is now allowing me to save and invest in making the detachment from the bullshit a realistic possibility down the road. My wife and I will be buying property in the next 5 years hopefully, and in the meantime are learning as much as possible about self-sustaining lifestyles and homesteading to be able to put ourselves and our children in the best position we can. It may be a little misanthropic, but I&#39;ve lost hope for a massive awakening before it&#39;s too late, and have opted to look out for me and mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It still doesn&#39;t work the way you suggest. The electoral votes for each state are now tied directly to each state&#39;s popular vote. There is absolutely no decision-making in the Electoral College. There <strong>was</strong>. The Founding Fathers set that up as a way to protect the wealthy and powerful from the will of the (drunken) masses. But it&#39;s not like that any more. Now the wealthy and powerful simply purchase all the candidates and use the media to bury those they can&#39;t buy as &quot;unelectable&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? he&#39;s been spot on with what he&#39;s said. Even Rand hasn&#39;t stood up and said these things. Maybe Rand needs to take a lesson from Trump and grow a pair. The more people back Trump and pay attention to him, the more likely at least one of the other 15 candidates realizes that this is what the public wants....someone who will speak his mind, not give a shit about upsetting the status quo, not be a part of the &quot;establishment&quot; and also willing to dish out smack when someone does it first. </p>

<p>and yes, many do realize he&#39;s not a republican or a democrat. He has conservative views on some things, liberal views on other things. We are more than willing to accept that as long as the guy is going to speak his mind and not be a typical lying corrupt politician.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is playing the Republican game but is a closet classical liberal/libertarian. If elected they know he will go hard on day 1, they know he is just toeing the line for now.

    <div class="md"><p>so in other words, you&#39;re saying he&#39;s acting just like all the others? One difference though...</p>

<p>We know what he is. He&#39;s not a closet anything. He&#39;s running as a GOP because anyone with brains is going to do that to get into the debates and get the support. Bernie is running as a Democrat but we all know he&#39;s a communist/socialist. He&#39;s doing the same shit. </p>

<p>Even Trump admitted a couple days ago that he may even run as a 3rd party if the GOP pushes him out. Good. If the GOP isn&#39;t going to learn from Trump and his growing support, then they should be taken down and the Democrats should win.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I love everything he is saying but people need to realize he was registered as a democrat until 2009, but more importantly he is saying exactly what we want to hear by his owners. No man is allowed to make it that far unless he is willing to play ball. He is a puppet meant to serve a purpose, this being eliminating Rand Paul as competition as assassination of him would be too obvious, and after he is eliminated as opposition he will &quot;throw&quot; the Election to Hilary. Just a big game and another circus for the masses to drool over.</p>

<p>He has many uses of course and such theories abound;</p>

<p>a) closet democrat sabotaging GOP</p>

<p>b) usual clown to draw attention of the circus that is elections</p>

<p>c) lowering the &quot;bar&quot; to make other candidates seem &quot;coherent&quot;</p>

<p>d) attention grabbing whore for another one of his reality TV shows</p>

<p>Anyhow, its always how <em>we</em> (the people) interpret it. If we can filter through all the hubris, Trump is actually showing us that the King (the system) is <em>Naked</em> !!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a fabricated quote by some half-ass news outlet, and if you were watching his press conference literally 10 minutes ago you would have seem him address that and embarrass the loser that keeps trying to misquote him as saying that.  But you seem to only want to believe what you want in order to fit your opinion of him.  </p>

<p>Dude, if want to comment and add something to the conversation, at least make sure your information is accurate.  My advice to you would be to start paying attention more, instead of hearing bits and pieces and forming them into your own narrative.  </p>
