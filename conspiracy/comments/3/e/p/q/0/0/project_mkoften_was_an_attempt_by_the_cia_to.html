        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At roughly around min 22 in the <a href="https://vimeo.com/22766863">&quot;Monarch: The New Phoenix Program&quot; on Vimeo</a>, they mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKOFTEN">Project MKOFTEN</a>, which sounded kind of loose-headed so I decided to fact-check with wikipedia&#39;s source.  Not found?  What&#39;s wayback have to say?  Oh:   <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110430024832/http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/02-A-0846RELEASE.pdf">This.</a></p>

<p>Excerpt from Monarch: The New Phoenix Program:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a 1977 Senate hearings former CIA Director admiral Stansfield Turner stated that the program took place at 80 institutions, including 44 universities, 15 private companies,
12 hospitals, and 3 prisons.  MKULTRA&#39;s subproject 119 was the foundation of all non-lethal weapons programs currently active and included a summary of five areas.  One of which is entitled, &quot;Techniques of activation of the human organism by remote electronic means&quot;  This memo was dated August 17th, 1960.   And when viewed with other evidence that was not destroyed, shows significant interest in radio frequency weapons and direct control of human behavior at a distance.</p>

<p>By 1960 the CIA dropped emphasis on the use of LSD in favor of electronic influence.  This aspect of the research is where the greatest modern emphasis has been rather than chemical or biological agents, both of which violate existing treaties and leave physical traces.</p>

<p>Dr. Stephen Aldritch took control of the office of research and development in 1962 from from Dr. Sidney Gottleib.  Aldritch started Operation OFTEN, an investigation into the occult with the help from Houston sorceress Sibyl Leak.  CIA behaviorist carefully studied every aspect of the occult underground. The Scientific Engineering Institute SEI was a CIA cutout that had been setup in 1956 to study radar.  In 1962 SEI set up a lab to study the effects of electrodes deep in the brain. In 1972, SEI also sponsored a course at The University of South Carolina in rituals in Demonology and Voodoo.  Dr. Aldritch was an MKULTRA programmer who focused on remote brain manipulation and the occult: the twin threads that run through the SEI corporation.</p>

<p>In 1962, a CIA manual focused on Radio Hypnotic Inter Cerebral Control--RHIC--which was developed by the pentagon.  Quote, &quot;when a part of your brain receives a tiny electrical impulse from outside sources such as vision, hearing, et cetera, an emotion is produced: anger at the sight of a gang of boys beating an old woman for example.  The same emotions of anger can be created by artificial radio signals sent to your brain by a controller.  You can instantly feel the same white-hot anger without any apparent reason.&quot; Endquote.</p>

<p>Another term,  Electronic Dissolution of Memory EDOM, refers to the the ability to erase memory at a distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just.  I can&#39;t.  Ugh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you looked into Michael Aquino and his escapades? Once you start going down the MKULTRA rabbit hole its really hard to sit on your hands and pretend that things are ever going to get better. Or that there is such thing as good guys in the government. The fact is they never stopped Project Monarch Naomi or MKULTRA they just stopped declassifying the documents after like 1979. Meaning they have had 36 years of complete darkness to operate under..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was looking into it just now.  I found the <a href="https://archive.is/g7mwT">wiki page in spanish</a>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Michael_Aquino&amp;amp;oldid=232504731">they scrubbed in the english wikipedia page in a weasely way by a mod not surprisingly called Wizardman</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Set">Temple of Set</a> entry remains and he&#39;s mentioned there without link.  Note that he&#39;s married to a woman <em>maga</em> named <em>Lilith</em> (Gnostic Adam&#39;s first wife aka <em>Babalon</em>, or Baphomet&#39;s female counterpart)</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another entry <a href="http://www.realliberalchristianchurch.org/2010/12/04/cover-up-wikipediaarticles-for-deletionmichael-aquino-wikipedia.html">into that rabbit hole</a> you spoke of trinity.</p>

<p>Also, did you notice I said rabbit and trinity in the same sentence. I &#39;m having a &#39;whoa&#39; neo moment lol.  Blue pill quick -- make it end!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may also find this interesting- <a href="http://www.xeper.org/maquino/nm/PSFSummary.pdf">here</a> is Aquino&#39;s response to the 86-87 Presido Child Abuse scandal. <a href="http://www.rachane.org/Directory.html">Here</a>is his Barony of Rochane page, and <a href="https://xeper.org/maquino/">here</a> are links to his writings on the Temple of Set. Might as well have everything. IMHO- Temple of Set and the Church of Satan were/are a bastardization amalgamation of OTO and Golden Dawn rituals with a heavy focus on Satan. Not that Satan is bad in the way that he is viewed in ritual magic (he is the giver of truth to mankind, hence the Lightbringer mantle). People only familiar with Lucifer or Satan in a Judeo-Christian sense will inherently see him as evil. People who care not for such religious convictions will just see any religious practice as another fairy tale in action. The scrubbing you referred to may have been removing material that is confidential to the order (happens w/ freemason &amp; oto entries pretty regularly when former members go in to &quot;spill the beans&quot;). The fact that it is hard to find info on Aquino in wikipedia may also be that LaVey&#39;s followers want to eliminate all mention of him because they feel he caused a schism in the church. Also happened in OTO after the death of Crowley and 2 men battled over who Crowley&#39;s true successor was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh but &#39;he&#39;s not a significant enough public figure to merit his own wikipedia page&#39;.  Lol.  The suppression was so lame and thinly-veiled.  Did you notice it also said in the marked-for-deltion talk page that Michael Aquino was a contributor to wikipedia?  So he was a mod, basically.  One of a very small few.</p>

<p>People--especially baby boomers who say wikipedia &#39;wiccapedia&#39;, a fox news affectation for sure--have this fantasy that <em>anyone</em> can edit wikipedia.  I say to them, &quot;try it&quot;.  It hasn&#39;t been that way since 2 yrs after its inception.  It&#39;s a fallacy to think you can edit wikipedia and not have your edits be immediately reversed by a snarky assed mod and then your IP banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And porn as well.  In the shemale autogynephilia compilation videos (yes I&#39;m unashamed to say I look at those also--they are stylistically impressive!), I have noticed this one symbol cropping up subliminally at various points of different videos on 1 video frame... it&#39;s an amalgam of <a href="http://imgur.com/a/DLVer">(NSFW!!) Lebensborn&#39;s SS with the Venusian Female gender symbol</a> -- EDIT ie female nazis.  The overt agenda behind these &#39;hypno&#39; videos is for one to watch them to &#39;hypnotize oneself into becoming a slutty shemale...or bi/gay)&#39;.  They are called hypno because they flash so many images so quickly you can&#39;t even register them. Typically with dubstep in the background.  I would characterize many of them as psychedelic or dissociative.</p>

<p>Perhaps this symbol is just a gang sign letting us know who&#39;s behind the videos, but for some reason they want to burn that image in your subconscious--why?  The videos&#39; production value, the time required to invest into making these videos, the skill level required, the dearth of content needed to mine in order to make these videos suggest that they have deep pockets or lots of time to make what seems innocuously like video fanfriction.  </p>

<p>Or it&#39;s a crackpot theory and I should stay off the perv stuff for a while.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no doubt, Hip Hop and EDM are 100% mind control. Especially with the recent emphasis on popping Molly (MDMA) and drinking Codeine Syrup while listening to the music. The loud, discordant sounds, heavy emphasis on booming base, heavy materialistic undertones and the emphasis on sexuality are all signs of left hand ritual music (this is from my understanding of occult ritual). I stopped listening to music like that about a year ago and my attitude towards the world has become considerably less nihilistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh.  I have to watch it now.  I really didn&#39;t want to watch that movie because it looked absolutely awful.  It looked like some know-nothing british methhead Eminem clone gets hired by an illuminati MI6 goon (seems legit) .... so they can jerk themselves off by blowing things up ...  and for some reason samuel l jackson is there in his most throwaway character.  I think I vomited in my mouth when I saw the trailer.</p>

<p>But now I&#39;ll have to suffer through it to verify what you said, because that&#39;s even more interesting.  Like they want to show you what they <em>did</em> or the knife twist doesn&#39;t count.</p>

Didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings I was just being a smart ass, your initial thoughts weren&#39;t completely wrong. but still it was a decent movie and a good waste of two plus hours with someone sharing popcorn, sour patch kids, and a large coke icey.</p>

<p>For over 70 years it has been a common idea in psychology and social science that some occult practices work by natural means.</p>

<p>You really can kill with a hex. If your victim believes in it strongly enough, the belief induces non-voluntary autonomous bodily processes that will kill that person. The technical term is induced autosuggestion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that holds true, then that would explain why NWO/&quot;Illuminati&quot; imagery is so powerful in music aimed at kids. They need people who assume the mythology is true in order for the rise to power to work. Self-fulfilling prophecy. </p>

<p>Public: I can&#39;t do anything about it, so I embrace it.<br/>
Elite: And by your in/actions and energy, build it. </p>

I really don&#39;t care if they have this stuff as long as it is only used under the most extreme circumstance like a WW3 and is used to preserve the American population and our ally&#39;s and other people that&#39;s are innocent in the war. But fuck man this shit is crazy with tech like that nobody can control the organization that has that shit..  They will use it to make lots of money like the CIA already does.. They are like their own secretive army</p>
