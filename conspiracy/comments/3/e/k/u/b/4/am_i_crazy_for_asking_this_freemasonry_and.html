<p>I decided to post on the Freemasonry subreddit, just for fun, asking if they really control the world. </p>

<p>Obviously the answer they gave me was no, which is fine, but the problem is, they completely deny that there is any correlation between Freemasonry and 1/3 of our presidents being Freemason. </p>

<p>They say it&#39;s no different than if 1/3 of our presidents were dog owners or something.</p>

<p>Being a skeptic, I find that hard to believe, but they were adamant. </p>

<p>They called me a nut for even asking and insisted that I must also believe they are lizard aliens with magical powers or something, but that&#39;s not at all what I&#39;m saying. </p>

<p>They might not control the world, but they have had many top ranking members rise to positions of power where they control the country. That&#39;s simply a fact, but they say it&#39;s a coincidence at best. </p>

<p>I admit asking if they controlled the world on a random post isn&#39;t the best way to go about things... but what do you guys think? Am I a dick? A nut? Or do I have a pretty valid point?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the tread. Don&#39;t attack them or even post or vote anything.

<p>That&#39;s not how Freemasonry works. You can be Grand Master of Masons in your country (or state in the US) but there&#39;s no way to gain control of the Fraternity as a whole, very much by design. This is why we&#39;ve lasted so long. Organizations that consolidate power tend to succumb to long-term instability. We&#39;re a collection of autonomous, democratic institutions that operate through a system of mutual recognition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything is possible, but from the inside, I can tell you that the logistics just don&#39;t work. It would be easier to accomplish whatever goes some nefarious evildoer has <em>without the Fraternity</em> than with it. And what cause do we have to think that this logistical impossibility has happened? Really... nothing. Other than the fact that everyone loves to hate an organization that&#39;s dedicated to brotherly love and equality because they can&#39;t imagine that actually being the primary motivating goal of any organization, there&#39;s nothing all that interesting about Freemasonry from a conspiracy perspective.</p>

<p>Philosophically, intellectually, morally? Sure, the Fraternity is fascinating, but try getting 40 Masons together for dinner, and you&#39;ll immediately abandon any notion that they could be herded into some worldwide conspiracy...</p>

<p>See, but now lets try getting 40 top rank Masons together... </p>

<p>Freemasonry has been around since before the middle ages. Surely they must have picked up some knowledge in that time frame that maybe outsiders don&#39;t know about, and it&#39;s something only passed down top rank to top rank. </p>

<p>The fact that you said anything is possible, is really all I needed to hear. I believe being open minded is quite important, and I&#39;m glad you gave me your perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>First off, there&#39;s no &quot;top rank.&quot; The Grand Master of a jurisdiction might fit your idea of high ranking, but if you&#39;re a mover and shaker looking to run the world why would you want to spend decades tirelessly improving the Fraternity just to get elected Grand Master?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Freemasonry has been around since before the middle ages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just not true. We allegorically talk about ancient Freemasonry, but the reality is that Freemasonry probably grew out of the craft stonemasonry guilds of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Surely they must have picked up some knowledge in that time frame that maybe outsiders don&#39;t know about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You would have to fill me in on what you mean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you said anything is possible, is really all I needed to hear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course. The goldfish fanciers could secretly be running the UN. The military industrial complex could be a front for a worldwide network of underground slam poetry. But what you have to ask yourself is: what is likely?</p>

<p>And in that sense, when I look at powerful people who were Freemasons, like Truman, Churchill or Hoover, I find it more likely that they were powerful people who were attracted to the Fraternity, not the other way around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I see it, Freemasonry is a filtering system to find the people who are psychopathic enough to join the main sects of the top ranks. There are tens of millions of freemasons in the world, but only a few hundred of them actually matter in terms of geopolitics, I would guess.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a society based on not asking questions and silently obeying the orders of your superiors. If you make it to the top of that, it&#39;s obvious you&#39;re psychopathic enough to do evil things because someone above you told you to, and never tell a soul. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree man. Why is he the only whistleblower in modern history to receive that kind of media attention? Is it because you think the story was so big that the media couldn&#39;t possibly ignore it? You should know better than that. If they talk about something, they want you to hear a certain point of view. They demonized him but only in the same way that politicians demonize each other...it&#39;s all part of the show. You need the bad guy whistleblower, but you need him to be completely within your control or else you might get real information leaked like Bradley Manning with the Afghanistan videos and John Kiriakou who confirmed that the CIA was using waterboarding as a torture technique. Both of those people were jailed in special prisons. Meanwhile, Snowden is giving interviews to John Oliver. That doesn&#39;t make sense! That&#39;s not how they treat people who truly are a threat to the system. You know the concept of panopticon? Snowden&#39;s purpose was to implement the American panopticon. You start to change your behavior because you know you are being watched, you just can&#39;t see the person watching you. As you mentioned, a lot of the stuff he revealed was crazy, but ultimately, nothing huge has come of his leaks. He doesn&#39;t do the usual &quot;dump everything I have&quot; route that most whistleblowers take. To me, his actions just raise more questions than they answer and I see now that his revelations have only made regular people indifferent to surveillance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey we&#39;re all skeptics here right? </p>

<p>But right away, yes, it was so big the media couldn&#39;t possibly ignore it. </p>

<p>Imagine if a member of the FBI decided to leak thousands of documents that were undoubtable and 100% prove 9/11 was an inside job, down the every last detail. </p>

<p>This is the same level we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

<p>He had all the proof in the world. He leaked hundreds of thousands of files and put them up online for everyone to see.</p>

<p>He did indeed dump everything he has.</p>

<p>Direct, undeniable evidence, that the government spies on us. </p>

<p>If you believe he&#39;s some sort of government CIA experiment to test what the public thinks about the government lying and spying... I mean you do you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Disagree highly. If 9/11 was proven with documents to be 100% an inside job, the fallout would&#39;ve been magnitudes greater than what we saw with Snowden&#39;s revelations. Yeah, they were shocking at the time, but not enough to get anything to happen about it. They just go back and forth with it. &quot;A judge said they can&#39;t spy. Different judge okays renewal of spying. New judge says they&#39;re overstepping bounds. Next judge says everything&#39;s good.&quot; We had direct, undeniable evidence that the government was spying on us. We didn&#39;t need Snowden for that. Yeah, he brought international attention to the issue, but again, what other whistleblowers have brought the same level of international attention to their cause? Our government is not that inept that he would get away. Even if he managed to get away initially, he wouldn&#39;t be on the run for this long if he were truly a traitor like the government tried to make him seem. Yeah I understand that he knows about communication, but cmon, you&#39;ve evaded capture by the CIA for THIS long? No....not real. If the US government wants you dead or captured, you&#39;ll be dead or captured. You won&#39;t be giving interviews to John Fuckface Oliver.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright you&#39;re right 9/11 exposed would cause more of an uproar, but same principle. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the US doesn&#39;t want to kill or capture him, as that would definitely cause some major controversy. </p>

<p>They would not let him get away with it? But he already got it away with it. What&#39;s next? Throw him in jail or assassinate him? </p>

<p>They realize it&#39;s a touchy subject. That&#39;s why they&#39;re leaving him alone, let the controversy die.</p>

<p>Most Americans don&#39;t even know who Edward Snowden is. </p>

<p>John Oliver likes to talks about slightly controversial things, Edward Snowden is definitely up his alley in terms of his audience. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all the attention he&#39;ll get though, just enough so you won&#39;t be questioning a total media blackout, yet without putting him in the spotlight. </p>

<p>You really believe he&#39;s some sort of government CIA experiment to test what the public thinks about the government lying and spying? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my point: they don&#39;t let people get away with shit, so the fact that he did reveal so much and they aren&#39;t actively hunting him, that&#39;s highly suspicious to me. Do you remember Michael Hastings? Dead before he could say anything else. He happened to write <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/congressmen-seek-to-lift-propaganda-ban#.voR9XJeyj">an article for Buzzfeed</a> about the section of the NDAA that removed the ban against using propaganda on American soil. So it&#39;s a fact that they&#39;ve removed this limitation for themselves. So now we can ask ourselves, what kind of psychological operations are they conducting currently? What do you think? I could say a few things I think are part of directed psy ops, in addition to Snowden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You believe something as grand as the idea that we have all been brainwashed since birth but Snowden....that guy was real. He wasn&#39;t part of the deception they&#39;re foisting upon you? I asked you for examples of the types of psychological operations you&#39;d anticipate the government is running on American soil. It&#39;s an important question because if you live in America, you are likely being affected by it. So let&#39;s put Snowden to the side. You mentioned already something about ISIS. They&#39;re an excellent example. Just like Snowden, they are the boogeyman that was set up to implement changes in American behavior that wouldn&#39;t have been tolerated otherwise. Again, we see the government putting forth the idea that the government is too incompetent or that ISIS is too skilled as a network. When they convince you that ISIS is too skilled to be taken lightly, they get you to go along with increases in defense spending in order to feel safe. They create an event, tell you how to feel about it, and then get the bad guy when it&#39;s convenient for them (a la Bin Laden). Whether Snowden is a truly a whistleblower matters immensely because if he is controlled, then it&#39;s an obvious example of how far the government is willing to go to deceive us in order to change our political opinions. If he&#39;s a whistleblower, lucky for him he&#39;s not in jail. Another example of the psychological operations has been manipulation of the race relations between blacks and whites. When you remember that media is controlled, and you realize that they&#39;ve only just now started reporting on whites who kill blacks (even though more blacks kill blacks than whites kill blacks), you can suspect that they are trying to influence your perception of the event or the people involved. The Charleston shooting combined the race relations narrative with the gun control narrative. That&#39;s two birds with one stone for psy ops. In my opinion, that&#39;s worse. It&#39;s one thing to watch me and to listen to my communication, but it&#39;s another thing to actively shape people&#39;s opinion to be that of the state-sponsored view. It&#39;s wrong. If we as Americans want to disarm ourselves, we should have that conversation naturally, and as a nation. We shouldn&#39;t be manipulated by media messages into giving up our weapons. </p>

<p>Basically, in case you didn&#39;t know, 14 out of our 43 presidents were Freemasons. That&#39;s 32.55%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t shocking. Freemasonry stresses involvement in the community, charity and brotherly love. These are attributes that tend to make one inclined toward public service. I would expect Freemasons to be vastly more predisposed to public service in general for this reason.</p>

<p>Source: am a Freemason and conspiracy theorist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They say it&#39;s no different than if 1/3 of our presidents were dog owners or something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. I think it speaks to the powerful system of self improvement that Freemasonry brings to bear, long before the &quot;self help&quot; craze cheapened that idea into 3-hour seminars.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They might not control the world, but they have had many top ranking members rise to positions of power where they control the country. That&#39;s simply a fact, but they say it&#39;s a coincidence at best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, keep in mind that the last Freemason to be President was Ford (and even an older guy like me barely remembers Ford at this point). Clinton was in the Order of deMolay, but he never went on to join the Fraternity. Before Ford, you have to go back to Truman, who was Grand Master of Masons in Missouri.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that Freemasonry isn&#39;t a monolith. Yes, there are Freemasons who are powerful people (and Rotarians and so on) but they&#39;re all members of essentially stand-alone organizations that merely recognize each other&#39;s legitimacy. Freemasonry in Massachusetts does not answer to Freemasonry in Florida does not answer to Freemasonry in England and so on. So, it&#39;s kind of hard to build a conspiracy within the Fraternity (not impossible... just very rare and very limited in their ability to affect other parts of the Fraternity).</p>

<p>Not at all. I asked these very same questions when I first started looking into the Fraternity.</p>

<p>On a local (Grand Lodge) level, Freemasonry can be a force to be reckoned with at times, but there are several problems with trying to apply that to grand conspiracy theories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Men who come to the Fraternity do so for many reasons, and so there&#39;s no unifying political goals within the organization. We&#39;re every kind of man you can imagine. Young, old, conservative, liberal, gay, straight, rich, poor, every ethnicity, religion, etc. so what kind of goals would men like that agree on?!</li>
<li>If there&#39;s this need to keep everything secret from the rank and file, that makes doing <em>anything</em> extremely difficult.</li>
<li>Outside of the Fraternity, none of these restrictions exist, so if I wanted to manipulate, say, world governments, then the last thing I would do is try to involve Freemasonry. I&#39;d ignore the Fraternity entirely because it would only slow me down.</li>

<p>So here&#39;s the thing. When you accept that anything is possible, you have to decide how you&#39;re going to determine what to believe. There&#39;s going to be some filter of what&#39;s reasonable to believe, and how you configure that filter is going to determine how you interact with the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Having three presidents in Skull and Bones, and what the hell is going on at the Bohemian Grove. Have you looked into these things?</p>

<p>Sure. First off, though, it&#39;s important to understand that these aren&#39;t Masonic groups. They&#39;re also not, IMHO, terribly interesting. Yes, when you are rich and/or powerful, it gives you entre into some very exclusive gatherings like Bohemian Grove. Yes, rich kids have their own frat at Yale. But neither of those is surprising nor do we need to read them as indicative of monsters under the bed.</p>

<p>Not to me.</p>

<p>If there are aliens, why would Freemasons be more likely to know that they exist than Tai Chi schools or Catholic monks or Oxford University? All of those institutions are older than Freemasonry. Why do we want to believe that Freemasonry knows the deep, dark secrets of our id?</p>

<p>Yeah, I don&#39;t buy that. S&amp;B is purported to have a ritual that involves dealing with a human skull. I think that&#39;s kind of cute, but not really interesting. It&#39;s a school.

<p>As for BG, my impression is that they&#39;re focused on cool performance art. It&#39;s an opportunity for the movers and shakers to go off and enjoy themselves for a weekend without having to be in the public eye. I think that&#39;s kind of cool, and sort of wish I could go to one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re also exclusively for people with power and influence in our society, and no one else.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good for them. Why do I care if they have a weekend off or join a college frat?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To say Skull and Bones is just a fraternity for rich kids, would be incorrect. It&#39;s a secret society by definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said &quot;fraternity&quot; and then you said &quot;secret society.&quot; A fraternity is a secret society by definition. Unless they publicly disclose their initiation rituals, which no fraternity that I&#39;m aware of does...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Bush&#39;s aren&#39;t even allowed to admit they&#39;re a part of it</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So? Again, why does that matter? I don&#39;t really care what clubs a politician wants to belong to. I care about what they do and how they justify it. If I think that&#39;s problematic, I&#39;m going to give them hell for it, and you should too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>coming together to get naked...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, I wish! Do you know how hot it can get in an unairconditioned Lodge room?! If I were allowed to take my tuxedo off, you better believe I&#39;d be in my birthday suit in a heartbeat!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This would be more than just a little surprising to most.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most people would be surprised by the fact that I dress up in a tux to go to a meeting twice a month with people that I would trust as much as I&#39;d trust a family member, even though I met them all just a few years ago.</p>

<p>Surprise isn&#39;t an indicator of deep and troubling conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Man, this is all so much information in such a short amount of time. This time last year, if you told me the government lies to us, I&#39;d ask why on earth would they do that? </p>

<p>Now I see that we&#39;ve been lied to for a very long time. </p>

<p>I believe the powers that be realize they are losing control. The economy and the dollar is going to collapse within a decade, I can go into and prove this if you&#39;d like. </p>

<p>They realize this control system they&#39;ve created is coming to an end. There&#39;s not enough profitable jobs for every living person. The reason we have a billion people starving on this planet, is not due to some food shortage, we have plenty of food. It&#39;s due to a lack of access, due to a lack of money, due to a lack of profitable jobs.</p>

<p>Same thing with homeless people, they&#39;re not homeless due to a lack of homes. There&#39;s 3.5 million homeless in the US and 18.5 million vacant homes.</p>

<p>See while there is plenty of work to be done around the globe, the problem is, there is no profit in helping people in need. That&#39;s why we have donations, charities and fundraisers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU</a></p>

<p>Our world system today is backwards. Completely upside down to what the average person thinks it is. </p>

<p>We have the technology and the resources today, to house and feed every single person on this planet, many times over. Why are we not doing this? Money. </p>

<p>We also still mainly use fossil fuels, even though we know we have clean, safe, renewable alternatives. Why? Money. </p>

<p>The world has got to wake up and realize that money isn&#39;t real. It might be by far the biggest problem in most people&#39;s lives, but it doesn&#39;t actually exist in the physical world. </p>

<p>Money controls your life, money controls the world, and there are men who control money. </p>

<p>This is what my main focus is on, because this kind of information takes apart the world, without mentioning secret societies, God, or lizard aliens, so it&#39;s a lot easier to take in for the average person. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I watered down the truth for you, you wouldn&#39;t be getting the truth. The fact of the matter is this is a war between Christ and Satan at its core. We have a sin problem. Immorality and corruption are rampant. Our problem cannot be solved by anything other than a completely sinless population, which requires burning the weeds and collecting the fruits. This world must come to an end and we must start again; so shall it be.</p>

<p>There will not be spot, nor wrinkle, nor stain in the new earth. Every individual will be in harmony with God&#39;s law of love. He is selecting the choicest fruits to place in a brand new basket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are the regular &quot;joes&quot; that frequent the blue lodge once or twice a month to recite esoteric doctrine in which 99% of them have no clue of the meaning or true origins of the words they recite,  nor the ritual they perform. 
  There are a handful of masons that do  their studies with superficial effort and have a grasp of what the higher ups (elitist/existentialist) would have them perceive as to the true motives and efforts of the craft.<br/>
   Their are a select few that consume all freemasonry has to offer and walk through the many doors presented, in which he finds many other truths to be explored.  This becomes a life study in all the mystic teachings known to man, comparative religion,  theology,  theosophy, Gnostic,  Judaic,  buddhic, Taoism, Confucianism, lost gospels,  cults of Egypt, Sumerian texts,  pyramid studies,  Coptic research,  cuneiform research,  cults of Europe, magick, numerology/gematria, Roman history, Greek history,  mythology,  all major works of philosophy,  native american studies,  rituals, shamanism, Hebrew language in parallel with the Talmud,  cabala, zoaroastriansism and the Yahweh cult.  Studies then get into alchemy,  metaphysics,  energy,  laws of nature/universe etc..   </p>

<p>Most of the interest grows once a brother gets beyond the 3rd degree and  joins the Scottish rite or York rite.<br/>
There are clandestine Masonic organizations that are not recognized by the United Grand Lodge of England but may provide a more conducive atmosphere for education; as this is a major factor thst contributed to clandestine lodges forming in the states.  </p>

<p>There are politics at the highest levels of the craft.   I don&#39;t care to expound on at this point.   I am a 32° Scottish Rite Mason potentially in exile :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting, thanks for sharing. </p>

<p>See I believe the powers that be are realizing that they are losing control over the general public. </p>

<p>Their control system is failing. The economy and the dollar are on the brink of collapse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand because you have a false sense of what Freemasonry really is. Freemasonry is more of a social and charitable organization than anything political. In fact, politics are strictly forbidden from being discussed in a lodge meeting, as is religion.</p>

<p>When people think &quot;secrets&quot; they assume the worst. That said, the sole purpose of the secrets is to prevent people who aren&#39;t members from pretending to be one; these are called the Modes of Recognition. In fact, the Modes of Recognition are the only secrets in Freemasonry.</p>

<p>As for our meetings, these are more for social gatherings and lodge business. I like to think of Freemasonry as a great way to meet new people, challenge myself intellectually and continuously learn from others that work in all different kinds of professions.</p>

<p>My guess is that a high percentage of presidents were members because people in their social circles were. In addition, before television, the internet, radio, etc. it was another way to socialize and entertain yourself.</p>

<p>Sorry to spoil your thoughts of world domination, but until you&#39;ve become a member and seen brothers bicker over where to donate $25 you won&#39;t understand :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree man. Why is he the only whistleblower in modern history to receive that kind of media attention? Is it because you think the story was so big that the media couldn&#39;t possibly ignore it? You should know better than that. If they talk about something, they want you to hear a certain point of view. They demonized him but only in the same way that politicians demonize each other...it&#39;s all part of the show. You need the bad guy whistleblower, but you need him to be completely within your control or else you might get real information leaked like Bradley Manning with the Afghanistan videos and John Kiriakou who confirmed that the CIA was using waterboarding as a torture technique. Both of those people were jailed in special prisons. Meanwhile, Snowden is giving interviews to John Oliver. That doesn&#39;t make sense! That&#39;s not how they treat people who truly are a threat to the system. You know the concept of panopticon? Snowden&#39;s purpose was to implement the American panopticon. You start to change your behavior because you know you are being watched, you just can&#39;t see the person watching you. As you mentioned, a lot of the stuff he revealed was crazy, but ultimately, nothing huge has come of his leaks. He doesn&#39;t do the usual &quot;dump everything I have&quot; route that most whistleblowers take. To me, his actions just raise more questions than they answer and I see now that his revelations have only made regular people indifferent to surveillance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You believe something as grand as the idea that we have all been brainwashed since birth but Snowden....that guy was real. He wasn&#39;t part of the deception they&#39;re foisting upon you? I asked you for examples of the types of psychological operations you&#39;d anticipate the government is running on American soil. It&#39;s an important question because if you live in America, you are likely being affected by it. So let&#39;s put Snowden to the side. You mentioned already something about ISIS. They&#39;re an excellent example. Just like Snowden, they are the boogeyman that was set up to implement changes in American behavior that wouldn&#39;t have been tolerated otherwise. Again, we see the government putting forth the idea that the government is too incompetent or that ISIS is too skilled as a network. When they convince you that ISIS is too skilled to be taken lightly, they get you to go along with increases in defense spending in order to feel safe. They create an event, tell you how to feel about it, and then get the bad guy when it&#39;s convenient for them (a la Bin Laden). Whether Snowden is a truly a whistleblower matters immensely because if he is controlled, then it&#39;s an obvious example of how far the government is willing to go to deceive us in order to change our political opinions. If he&#39;s a whistleblower, lucky for him he&#39;s not in jail. Another example of the psychological operations has been manipulation of the race relations between blacks and whites. When you remember that media is controlled, and you realize that they&#39;ve only just now started reporting on whites who kill blacks (even though more blacks kill blacks than whites kill blacks), you can suspect that they are trying to influence your perception of the event or the people involved. The Charleston shooting combined the race relations narrative with the gun control narrative. That&#39;s two birds with one stone for psy ops. In my opinion, that&#39;s worse. It&#39;s one thing to watch me and to listen to my communication, but it&#39;s another thing to actively shape people&#39;s opinion to be that of the state-sponsored view. It&#39;s wrong. If we as Americans want to disarm ourselves, we should have that conversation naturally, and as a nation. We shouldn&#39;t be manipulated by media messages into giving up our weapons. </p>

<p>On a local (Grand Lodge) level, Freemasonry can be a force to be reckoned with at times, but there are several problems with trying to apply that to grand conspiracy theories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Men who come to the Fraternity do so for many reasons, and so there&#39;s no unifying political goals within the organization. We&#39;re every kind of man you can imagine. Young, old, conservative, liberal, gay, straight, rich, poor, every ethnicity, religion, etc. so what kind of goals would men like that agree on?!</li>
<li>If there&#39;s this need to keep everything secret from the rank and file, that makes doing <em>anything</em> extremely difficult.</li>
<li>Outside of the Fraternity, none of these restrictions exist, so if I wanted to manipulate, say, world governments, then the last thing I would do is try to involve Freemasonry. I&#39;d ignore the Fraternity entirely because it would only slow me down.</li>
