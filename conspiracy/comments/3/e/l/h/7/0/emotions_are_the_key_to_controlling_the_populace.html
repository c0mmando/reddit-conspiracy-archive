       For example, when we believe something that is told to us by the media, we have the emotion of trust toward that news agency and toward that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we don't believe that news source, we feel repulsion, disgust, etc, at the lies being put before us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fear of 9/11 is what drove people to tacitly support the war in Iraq that killed over 100,000 Iraqi civilians and cost over a trillion dollars, making some weapons manufacturers, banks, and building contractors extremely wealthy. This fear controlled us, it put us under a sort of temporary mass hypnotism, a spell of sorts, that made people scared to speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we feel strong emotions about things, this makes us easier to predict and thus control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of media is to rattle our cages so hard that our minds are pigeonholed in to certain emotional states, so we are easily manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       They make us fear cyberattacks, so they can pass cyberattack legislation that is really just a power grant to the NSA and other related organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they make us fear cops, so they can scare us in to submission as the military-industrial complex makes tons of cash selling military hardware to cops. And you'd better believe there's an incentive to federalize all police, which would effectively privatize them, creating a massive profit windfall for private military companies that would end up doing the policing. This isn't just talk either, Mexico federalized their police just 6 months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the fear of the NSA spying on the internet, that limits what we will say and creates this "chilling effect" that shuts lots of people up. What good is free speech if everyone is too afraid to say anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'll notice the trend in my real-world examples, the emotions are generally all negative. Positive emotions are harder to create, and do not linger as long as negative ones. This is just a consequence of human biology, the brain is wired to consider threats much more carefully than positive emotions, for survival purposes. A monkey that spends all day happily day-dreaming has a lower chance of survival than one that is worried about predators and planning ahead, so over time evolution selects the worried monkey. The people running the media know this fact of biology, and they use it to their advantage in very clever ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible to disconnect from this matrix of negative emotions that is used to control us and push and goad us in to certain beliefs that almost never work out in our favor. It is possible to stop caring about the things the elite want you to care about, the things the MSM wants us to all talk and think about. If you stop thinking about these things as much, stop letting their carefully-crafted communications enter your eyes and ears, you
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       stop having these emotions as much. You will stop being part of the herd of people emoting in one singular way at the same time, and thus stop being corralled in to these terrible beliefs that support decisions made by powerful people that only wish to exploit you for their own personal gain. Even when you think you are being clever by rebelling against a MSM story, you're often just falling in to another emotional trap on the opposing side. They play both sides of most stories in this way. It's often not the particular side that matters, but the fact that there's a dichotomy in the first place. The fact you're forced to "pick a side". This is a method of social control. The elimination of gray area, the limiting of opinions in to ready-made checkbox-friendly categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taking control of your emotions is the key to taking control of your mind and reclaiming it from the powers that be and from a broken society. In a society that lives off fear, being happy is the greatest rebellion. Seriously, think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not an easy task because emotions and thoughts have a sort of momentum to them, a perpetuation of the status quo, just by design. So to detach from bad habits and bad patterning can take a few weeks or months. The point is, be patient with yourself, detach from fear-mongering media (even
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ), and you will regain control of your emotions which will broaden your mental horizons and open up choices for decisions that you may not have even considered before alleviating this accumulated emotional stress. A calm mind is free to move in any direction, while a panicked mind is limited in behavior. I'm not saying be uninformed, not by any means. I'm saying to be extremely careful in how you let your emotions be manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why people say: To conquer the world you must first conquer yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most battles in life are not about guns and physical strength, but instead about minds, attitudes, beliefs, and emotions. These are indirectly manipulated through the manipulation of how information is presented, and what information is omitted. The people looking to control the "sheeple" know this technique by heart and use it to their advantage every day. The less we buy in to it, the less power they have. It's that simple. Free your emotions to free your mind.

       You can go a step further, by introducing certain thought-patterns with traumatic events. Thought-patterns are like believe-systems and prejudice. Because the trauma disables normal thinking, the thought-pattern can stay in the mind much longer. If done well, the person will not know that he/she is following a programmed pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to know the thought-patterns of a country (or area), you can learn a lot by studying the traumatic history of that area. As a reaction to these historical events many people in that area will have adapted certain patterns. Some repeat the trauma in a new context, and some follow the reaction to the trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       To steer the reaction in a certain way, the persons to program have to follow certain schooling (or brainwashing). Also rewarding helps. If well performed these people will think that they are free, because they don't follow the older patterns. But they are actually more stuck than before. Many of them will even try to push their programming on others in the form of schooling. They will see it as "helping".
      </p>
      <p>
       You won't read much about this in normal education.

       true enough but the manipulation has gotten pretty sophisticated look into neural linguistic programming they use it all the time. And short of tuning out the media en mass there's no escaping it.

       A period of tuning out followed by a period of re-adjustment is all that's needed, a detox of sorts. After you've been away from it for a while and you return to it, it's much easier to see through as the transparent propaganda it is.

       Don't forget about the behavior they exibit in thier 'arguments' as well as constant fallacy (sometimes multiple within one statement) that philosophically destroy their perspective, but yet stll, 'wins' over the minds pulling it in. &amp; the Ad Hominem, by the hammer of Oden.
      </p>

       It creates an environment where emotionally charged responses become the norm whenever any prevailing worldview appears challenged. &amp; then everyone else just difuses the situation or changes the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media very well may have changed the basic concept of an actual discusion where free speech should be fully allowed no matter who it may, 'offend' (or, challenges worldview).
