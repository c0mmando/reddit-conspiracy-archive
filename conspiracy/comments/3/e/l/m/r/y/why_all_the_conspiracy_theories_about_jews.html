<p>Or is it the more logical answer that success breeds envy and all you people who are unaccomplished and impotent seek to blame a group out performing you in every aspect and facet of society.  Do you even believe your own B.S., does it help you sleep at night to be anti-semitic?  Why not work on improving yourselves instead? </p>

<p>I&#39;m don&#39;t have personal issue with Zionist Rastafarians.  I&#39;m only zionist because I believe Jewish people need a homeland for safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you maybe show me a link of one discussing the conspiracy though? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/niglets/">https://www.reddit.com/r/niglets/</a> 
Just a little place to sit down and enjoy some good ol&#39; nigger bashing.</p>

<p>Tons of subreddits that are just as bad against all races and groups. I just would stay away from those that offend you. I definitely wouldn&#39;t go searching for it or try to manifest that type of behavior everywhere else. And if you reread what you wrote, you are basically showing the same type of hateful, racist behavior. </p>

<p>Conspiracy theories are just theories. I&#39;m pretty sure that conspiracy theories aren&#39;t put together with the intention of being hateful. There are reasons for the existence of those conspiracy theories, usually based off some connection or evidence. Your words are just hateful with no explanation other than you feeling that everyone hates Jews that are successful and that&#39;s the reason for any conspiracy theory involving them. I guess it could be your own conspiracy theory though. </p>

<p>But whenever I see posts started to discuss these Jewish conspiracies, they usually don&#39;t just hate on Jews by talking down to them. They would lay out the theory along with the information as to why they believe it to be true. That&#39;s just my observation, which is why I wanted to compare with a link that you could show me. </p>

<p>Then I woke up hungover and posted.  Never a good move.</p>

<p>So the link I posted was just first one I found.  It goes into the whole Khazar myth which is a slippery slope.  Next people claim that Jews are not a religion but illuminati and Satanic cult from Babylon times.  It&#39;s a crazy downward spiral from there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see, I see. </p>

<p>Did you ever research into the book to see what was actually being said and what proof they actually had? Do you know how the Khazar myth was started? </p>

<p>So far, this theory doesn&#39;t seem like it is based off of any type of hatred towards Jews, but it might actually be from some evidence. I&#39;m wondering if you would know. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just going by what he&#39;s saying from the book. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s true. Relax.</p>

<p>The basis of your post was that there was this popular hatred towards Jews because of their success. All you have shown me is a post from a person that is basically just posting information from a book which claims to have evidence, but it doesn&#39;t seem like you know anything about that. If your hate is based off that and can be brought out from a hangover and a single night of rants, I don&#39;t understand you, your post, or your hatred.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you google debunking the Khazar myth you will find several resources studies on the topic.</p>

<p>It is a myth started to dehumanize Jews into people who are barbaric and secretly maintained ancient Babylon traditions of Satanic worship, child sacrifice, and plot to overthrow the world through subversion and secrecy.  This leads to links with illuminati, world finance, the federal reserve, Jewish control of media, the fact that 4 US Supreme court justices are Jewish, AIPAC lobby, yada, yada, yada.  Thus you see the slippery slope.</p>

<p>I was in a bad state when I posted thus I apologized for my choice of words however, I am angry on a daily basis when I see so much of society believes this about me and my family/friends and there is really nothing I can do about it.  My only hatred is for people who believe this kind of stuff without questioning and keeping a rational open mind.  </p>

<p>Thank you for your genuine interest in trying to understand where I&#39;m coming from - it starts with empathy and that&#39;s all we can hope for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know why this myth was started? I don&#39;t know about this theory much, so I can&#39;t really say what&#39;s going on. I&#39;m not sure if there is evidence for what they are saying or not. I would have to look at the origin first, which may be this book, I&#39;m not sure. Googling debunking from the start doesn&#39;t do anything if I don&#39;t know exactly what is said from the source. </p>

<p>As for the money/banking/usury theory, there is a lot of evidence for what they were trying to and did do. Their system could be seen as anti-anti-semetic. If you only charge interest for non-Jews, don&#39;t you think that&#39;s so?</p>

<p>Yes, there is a lot of hate towards what a lot of Jews have done and because many Jews have been involved in setting these practices up, many conspiracy theories have arisen because of it. Throughout history, we can see that people all over the world disliked the Jews mostly because of usury. In the more recent history, they dislike them because of their settlements and violence in Palestine. </p>

<p>Now, I see it like this, America has done a lot of bad things in the past and in the present. I don&#39;t mind if other countries hate on America. I admit that America has been and is wrong a lot. As long as they don&#39;t come up to me personally and hurt me physically, I don&#39;t really let it affect me personally. However, I am still affected, but only by what America has been and is doing. Anyways, it&#39;s not really you that they hate. It&#39;s what has been done in the Jews name that they hate. </p>

<p>Sorry if it has gotten to you though, but putting more hate and division up between the two sides isn&#39;t going to make things better for you. The approach I would have is to not let it get to you and just really understand the history and why those theories exist, but if you don&#39;t feel like you can do that, you should definitely find a different approach.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Technically it is and you don&#39;t have to be snarky about it. We ARE the &quot;Chosen People.&quot; This is even clearly pointed out in your New Testament. So yes, we do have special privilege but no one talks about the special burden which we have to endure as well. You&#39;re cool with one part but not the other - that&#39;s hypocrisy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These kind of racist comments don&#39;t help your cause either. Unless your cause is to keep the hate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, let me assure you that I hate religious people. Christians, Muslims, &amp; Jews are all equally disgusting to me. Anyone stupid enough to dedicate their life to the false god of Abraham should be lobotomized. I&#39;ve spent my life pointing out the contradictions, hypocrisies, and idiocies of the Christian faith and it wouldn&#39;t be fair if I spared Jews my wrath.</p>

<p>That said, the reason Jews are implicated in conspiracies is because they allow their violent, extremist, and cult radicals to get away with illegal and immoral activities. Engage in nepotism and cronyism. They make Scientologists look like amateur con-artists. They are also involved in countless clandestine operations in the Middle East, wage war against their neighbors, and support a rogue nuclear terrorist state that haven&#39;t signed the NPT.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hate organized religion myself but do feel I&#39;m spiritual in my own way.  All religions do suck when they defend radicals and immoral activities but I don&#39;t believe that Jews do it any more than any other faith.

    <div class="md"><p>OI&#39;m sure they tell themselves the same thing. Fact is, Israel is a rogue nuclear state that hasn&#39;t signed the NPT. They were guilty of an attack on the U.S. and they have given nuclear secrets to other countries. The very nature of a &#39;jewish&#39; state is in stark contradiction to the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and whether you like it or not there are Jewish people who are prime suspects in numerous investigations into 9/11.</p>

<p>Most Jews (and this is a made up figure) 99% aren&#39;t even Hebrew and don&#39;t have a drop Hebrew blood in them. When Israel signs the NPT then maybe I might reconsider my distrust for that radical terrorism sponsoring suspect state. Until then, nations like Iran are NPT members and have abided by their commitment to that treaty as far as I can tell. As much as I hate Islam and would like to see it wiped from the face of the Earth (as well as Judaism and Christianity), Iran hasn&#39;t been passing along nuclear technology, slamming planes into the WTC, attacking ships like the USS Liberty, or using backdoor channels to funnel money to US politicians.</p>

<p>The foreign policy of small nations is to manipulate larger nations to do their dirty work. Israel is very good at this, they are also an ungrateful little hell hole country that lives under the delusion that their land and books are &quot;holy&quot; and that &quot;segregation&quot; of the Jewish population is somehow beneficial. Modern orthodox judaism is nothing more than an invention of the Roman Empire. It&#39;s entire supposed history is nothing more than myths ripped off from other cultures and it&#39;s unlikely that Moses ever even existed.</p>

<p>The simple matter is, any human being dumb enough to lower themselves to the label of Jew, Christian, or Muslim is a fucking idiot. There is only one label that appropriately fits a person with an Abrahamic faith of any shade - <em>fool.</em> Jews? Fuck&#39;em. If I can renounce my parent&#39;s religion than so can they. Judaism isn&#39;t some race or culture - it&#39;s a book club of deluded morons. It&#39;s not even a good book. Have you ever read it? It fucking sucks.</p>

You at least have the balls to say it (albeit behind the privacy of your keyboard) but it is all over society and people act like it&#39;s not there.  It&#39;s utter B.S.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-Semitism has nothing to do with it. Most Jews aren&#39;t even semites. What people are is anti-stupid and Judaism is as stupid a religion as Christianity and Islam. Arrogant, self obsessed little shit heads, who think they&#39;re special. Just like Christians who think they&#39;re going to heaven and everyone else is going to hell. Like Christianity and Islam, Judaism is a mental disorder leading its believers to become pathologically insane supporters of cold blooded killers and murderers. Like Christianity it is built on superstition and fairy tale, you have to be a fucking moron to call yourself a Jew, Christian, or Muslim - consider for instance the man who for sake of necessity decides to make a house out of one material, let&#39;s say straw, because he doesn&#39;t have any wood. by some means of sci-fi, he is ported to a thousand years later where a society with abundant wood makes their homes out of straw because that&#39;s what he did... he looks around and asks; &quot;you people are stupid, if I had wood I would have used the wood&quot;</p>

<p>That is what Judaism is today - a bunch of impractical morons imitating people who if they were alive today would just sit there and /facepalm the whole lot of them. Jews, Christians, and Muslims today are an embarrassment to the human species. If Abraham or Moses or Jesus or Mohammed could see the stupidity of their followers today I doubt they would have ever wasted their time with this garbage.</p>

I don&#39;t think it is anti-semetic to say that an outsized number of politicians, philosophers, scientists, etc. are Tribe members in the West, Russia, the Middle East and Latin America. If 1% of the people of every nation are &quot;bad guys,&quot; lets say, if 30% of Jews end up in jobs where they hold some financial or political authority over other races, that puts those 1% of &quot;bad jews&quot; in a pretty good position to take advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not at all ... that Jews were not allowed to own land, therefore they had to make money in commerce.</p>

<p>Usury was generally regarded as a sin, yet it somehow was okay to lend between religions, so being Jewish became associated with money-lending, which lead to various kinds of genocide, just like the Knights Templar ... lending money is lucrative, but having someone you owe money to dead is highly convenient.</p>

Yes, this is exactly correct and is the standard historical account.  However, it get&#39;s twisted into conspiracies of all sorts.  Thanks.</p>

<p>The Us war in the Mid east was promulgated by the oil companies aren&#39;t they owned by texans? And was justified with the bible belt crusade red states. I have never heard anyone say Jews wanted war in the middle east they work daily for peace.</p>

<p>Media? WTF the whole media is Jewish that is been debunked for ages. </p>

<p>Do you have any legitimate Jewish conspiracies? Or are you going to just spread more disinformation like everyone else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, debunked but people still don&#39;t seem to care. I agree with you on other disinformation to discredit real conspiracies of Govt. etc.  Just don&#39;t get the focus on Jews unless neo-nazi&#39;s never went away and hydra is still strong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you have a point. Maybe the conspircay that jews run the conspiracy is the real conspiracy. The oligarchs who as we both know are from every race creed and religion. They see the jewish people as a unified community that is difficult to join without marriage or familial invitiation. this makes placing blame very effective. People who are <em>Jews</em> are hated for no other reason. Shit I think we need to attack class and not a simple ethnic minortity. Yeah he is a jewish banker but lets hate the banker part. </p>

<p>I honestly have&#39;t spent much time on the subject. I just find race as a easy tool for divide and conqure. My only answer could be the sgructure of the Jewish community. They have a unique language and are not quite christian. I honestly think it is ignorant racism is the easy answer for a week mind. It is like people who blame blacks for crime when it is far more complicated history than just blackpeople are criminals and jews are sinister.  </p>

<p>I am from the south and I know more racists from NY city. I think it is a vocal minority who makes the Neo Nazi party look larger than it actually is. You will get people to type BS and hate all over the internet. but when the actually are met with real people on the street they will be normal. I know it is a dangerous idea but it is best to just ignore the rascist idiots. they will realize one day the fault in their ideology. Tryint to point out their bias only makes them hate more. The only cure for ignorance is education. If you have patianece feel free to educate them. But, I would just let it be. I mean, the only thing people gain by arguing with racists is making them look foolish. But arguing with them sucks because it gives them a platform to spread hate. That is why i just ignore the race baiting and focus on the real issues facing humainty. Thanks for reading this I hope I actually helped your perspectuve on the situaton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also hate how the Jewish religion is so closed not to excuse it but I think it historically comes from being a persecuted people and therefore scared of &quot;outsiders.&quot;  However, in this day and age it&#39;s retarded and you may be onto something that this closed off nature is what breeds some of the suspicion which snowballs into conspiritard land.  In this regard wish we had someone like the pope that would reach out and be an ambassador (not that I&#39;m for any religion, just that it shouldn&#39;t be the cause of hate).  </p>

<p>I do agree education is the key but there&#39;s plenty in our classrooms, television etc.  It&#39;s the education that starts in the home and hate groups like the recently banned <a href="/r/gasthekikes">/r/gasthekikes</a> - yes that did exist.</p>

<p>Appreciate your post.  Thank you.</p>
