       I submitted a highly relevant post about Pope Francis' favorite book which he often encourages others to read, called
       <em>
        Lord of The World
       </em>
       , and the mods on that sub won't approve it for some reason. Does anyone know why that might be the case?

       I bet if it was reposted with 'Pope's favourite book disproves religion' it'd go right up. I'm not Christian or particularly religious but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be allowed to post ffs.

       Indeed, I really doubt they'd care though if it appealed to their atheism, and by the time they'd read it it'd be too late.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to his biographer, Fr. Cyril Martindale, Mgr. Benson's depiction of the future was in many ways an inversion of the science fiction novels of H. G. Wells. In particular, Benson was sickened by Wells' belief that Atheism, Marxism, World Government, and Eugenics would lead to an earthly utopia. Due to his depiction of a Wellsian future as a global police state, Benson's novel has been called one of the first modern works of dystopian fiction.

       rule changes work like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The mods discuss proposed changes to the rules.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They create a modpost to
         <a href="/r/books">
          /r/books
         </a>
         outlining the proposed rule changes, inviting comment and feedback.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Feedback is collated and digested, and the rule changes are discarded or amended based on feedback.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Rule changes are implemented, usually with another modpost.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So, changes are raised by the moderators and revised and implemented through consultation with the sub's readers.

       I think of it more like a restaurant's dress code.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course people should be able to wear denim shorts and bikini tops when they walk around in the street. But a high class restaurant should also be able to tell people wearing that that they're not allowed to come in.

       It depends on the reason. If you are trying to silence speech for selfish gain or to make people less free then Id have to disagree with you. But if someone is hurting someone by threatening another person then Id agree with you.
What you're talking about is selecting what is and instead acceptable speech simpley because you don't want to hear what is going on. I think the better approach would be if you specifically don't like to hear what is being said they you're more than happy to hide that post and move on. Other people come to a channel to learn more about their world, and I don't think its anybody's call to take that away from them. Conflict is a part of life. Obviously there should be some limits if its getting abusive, but the core of the issue should remain and maybe the people need to be dealt with in a polite but firm manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule sounds more like they want to silence speech than deal with drama for obvious reasons because you can deal with people who are getting abusive while keeping the discussion intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you try to make choices for people they will resent you, I have found that you have to let people decide for themselves what is an isnt good for them to hear.

       'This amazing book is relevant on so many levels!!
Written in 1907, it includes prescient descriptions of 20th/21st Century technology. I find it fascinating how H.G. Wells' dystopian works get so much credit when they (and the predictions they contain) were written AFTER Benson's Lord of The World. Perhaps most alarming are its descriptions of defacto nuclear weapons, commercial intercontinental air travel, and instant, ubiquitous communications.
Also fascinating is how Benson predicts other modern non-technological happenings which have come to pass, including a great "falling away" from religion, and other controversial topics, such as the mainstreaming of euthanasia! No wonder it's Pope Francis' favorite book!
Has anyone read it? Any thoughts?'
