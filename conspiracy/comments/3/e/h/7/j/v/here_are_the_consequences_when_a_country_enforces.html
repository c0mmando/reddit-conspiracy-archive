        <p>
         In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves against their ethnic-cleansing government, were arrested and exterminated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1929, the former Soviet Union established gun control as a means of controlling the “more difficult” of their citizens. From 1929 to the death of Stalin, 40 million Soviets met an untimely end at the hand of various governmental agencies as they were arrested and exterminated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After the rise of the Nazi’s, Germany established their version of gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, the mentally ill, and others, who were unable to defend themselves against the “Brown Shirts”, were arrested and exterminated. Interestingly, the Brown Shirts were eventually targeted for extermination themselves following their blind acts of allegiance to Hitler. Any American military and police would be wise to grasp the historical significance of the Brown Shirts’ fate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After Communist China established gun control in 1935, an estimated 50 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves against their fascist leaders, were arrested and exterminated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Closer to home, Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayans, unable to defend themselves against their ruthless dictatorship, were arrested and exterminated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves from their dictatorial government, were arrested and exterminated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one million of the “educated” people, unable to defend themselves against their fascist government, were arrested and exterminated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1994, Rwanda disarmed the Tutsi people and being unable to defend themselves from their totalitarian government, nearly one million were summarily executed.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The total numbers of victims who lost their lives because of gun control is approximately 70 million people in the 20th century. The historical voices from 70 million corpses speak loudly and clearly to those Americans who are advocating for a de facto gun ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments murdered four times as many civilians as were killed in all the international and domestic wars combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments murdered millions more people than were killed by common criminals and it all followed gun control.

       Chicago here. Some of the toughest, if not THE toughest, gun control laws in the nation and there are 6 murders per day...all by gangbangers with illegal guns that most of trace back to Mississippi 25 years ago. In fact, as in CT, we have the toughest gun laws but the most gun violence. Study after study shows that when law abiding people have access to guns firearm violence drops...dramatically. See Kennesaw GA for more on this...you are basically required to own a firearm to live there by law...and the amount of gun violence in the last 25 years? Zero. Does a little kid get ahold of a gun and shoot themselves occasionally? Not really with the police giving out gun safes and trigger locks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Law abiding people who wish only to defend themselves are the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       ones hindered by these retarded laws. For the criminals in Chicago, a gun is $200 and a pair of Beats headphones away. No checks required, no hindrance whatsoever by 'gun control.'
      </p>
      <p>
       We need 'Gang Control' but the Chicago pigs are all pussies and have been paid off by the gangs.

       There are still firearms in the UK but controls are quite severe, if you take a long walk out in the country it's easy enough to see a farmer with a shotgun or even a hunting rifle occasionally though. We're generally happy with the arrangement too, the armed police units deal with armed criminals, but this is pretty rare too.

       They helped us not get shot by a moronic neighbour over an argument about a hedge, or shot by a partner because it appeared we might be having an affair. The fact is criminals very rarely go armed with firearms as the sentencing would be doubly brutal, and the police would turn up with H&amp;Ks.

       No, not that I'm aware, the existing controls were strenghened a few years back and the arrangement seems to work well already. I'm happy to know if I'm rude to a pig I'll get hit with a baton, not murdered.

       I believe the argument would be, if your government made a play at genocide or mass incarceration now, people in the US would not put up with
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       restrictions on their guns. The long-term plan would fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at OP's examples, none of the genocided peoples were Anglo-Saxon. Americans in the main will be able to distance themselves enough from these peoples not to put two and two together.

       And this is a good argument, too.  The second amendment is not a policy, it's a fail-safe.  Pro-gun-control people like to assume the government is all saintly and good and warm and fuzzy, but that's just delusion.

       They can pretend the government is a warm fuzzy all they want.  We'll keep the fail-safe, just in case.

       OK, I'm going to give it to you straight, because you need to be told. You're all here, Americans, on a conspiracy sub, complaining that your government is fucking you up the ass, while simultaneously you seem to believe that guns are protecting you from the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get it through your head that they aren't. If your government was enforcing an armed presence, which regularly bullied and shot people, like say for example in the occupied territories, then guns are going to prove very useful. But it is not guns which are used to control modern western societies except as a last resort. If any western government used guns to shoot an organised movement of unarmed civilians it would be the end of that government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in the information age and it is through information that people are manipulated, controlled and enslaved. This is not the 18th century any more. Things have evolved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the real world result of the "protection of guns" in your country right now. 30,000 gun-related deaths a year, one of the world's highest prison populations, and a government which is fucking you harder than ever before in the ass. It isn't corrupt government officials who are dying in gunfights: it's poor, underprivileged kids from the most impoverished and neglected areas. Guns are hurting the very sections of society you seem to think they are protecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need education, not guns. For fuck's sake, am I the only one who sees this?

       Total, utter, jaw-dropping nonsense. Guns are the opposite of freedom. What freedom is there from being worried about getting shot on your way to the 7/11? What freedom is there in having to have bullet proof glass on your store windows?

       You're wasting your time, because I will literally rip to pieces any single argument you're going to make in defence of guns. You all use exactly the same generic everything-in-a-can arguments which, if you had any common sense, you would realise is a big fucking clue that they are fallacies.

       You must abuse the purpose of a knife or a car to use them as weapons. The purpose of a gun
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       to use it as a weapon. It's literally like trying to compare a brick to a nuclear submarine and saying you have to make the sub legal because the brick is legal. It's such a ridiculously stupid thing to say it borders on the outright insane.

      <p>
       You're absolutely right that the purpose of a gun
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       to use it as a weapon, but if it
       <em>
        is not
       </em>
       used, and only possessed, it is merely a deterrent.  The mere fact that there are countless firearms possessed as weapons, but not used as such, by millions of Americans is a strength in and of itself.  They do not need to be utilized in order for them to be an effective deterrent of whatever perceived oppression certain conspiracy theorists believe.  It is not the object itself that directly harms, but rather, it is the application with which the user has employed the object that does the harm.

        You're absolutely right that the purpose of a gun is to use it as a weapon, but if it is not used, and only possessed, it is merely a deterrent.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can't fault that logic. However, there is some research which suggests that merely owning a gun increases the likelihood of you both shooting someone, and
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       shot yourself. One possible explanation for that is that it becomes a matter of ownership psychology (i.e. if the purpose of a gun is to use it as a weapon, and you're not using it as a weapon, then what is the purpose of owning the gun?)

        The mere fact that there are countless firearms possessed as weapons, but not used as such, by millions of Americans is a strength in and of itself.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, I agree that it's a strength, but I think it's just human nature that a lot of people have no desire to kill or hurt others. Look at it this way: if you aren't prepared to use your gun as anything more than a deterrent, then what happens when you get into an argument with someone who is? Whichever way you approach the problem, saturating your society with guns negatively affects the moral intellectuals and benefits the rapists, the backwoods serial killers and the robbers, because they are the people to whom guns are most useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine two 22 year olds who both go into the gun shop on the same day and both purchase guns. One of them is like you. He only wants the weapon in case of an emergency. The other is dreaming of raping you at gunpoint. Who do you think is most likely to be in trouble? You see what I'm saying?
      </p>

      <p>
       I agree with everything you've said, but my conclusions are different. Yes, it is true that both the person and the weapon are needed to shoot someone, but you can't ban people. Hence you only really have two options left:-
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Put up with gun violence. Or
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Ban guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that society should be making it as difficult as possible -- within reason, of course -- to hurt each other. Saturating a society with guns does the complete opposite. And, on top of that, the economic system is ruthless. Factors such as these work in tandem to encourage violence in America.

       I upvoted your post because I thought it was fair and very intelligently written. I'm pretty impressed tbh. I don't often find it easy to converse with people who challenge my thinking. Not so with you.

       Common sense shows that no it doesn't. The "research" you think you are referring to is industry-sponsored propaganda, not research. Even flat-Earthers claim to have research to support their case. We live in a world where convincing people of things which aren't true has become a multi-billion dollar business.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Britain, there are around 100 gun deaths a year. In America, there are around 30,000. Hence, how stupid do you think it sounds to me, when you say you have "research" which "shows gun regulation makes us less safe"? You have never had a countrywide ban on guns in America, so how could you possibly "research" the effect of a countrywide ban on guns?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to have become commonplace in America -- and this is largely the fault of politicians -- that when your argument is flat out ridiculous but you don't want to give it up, you find some "research" which "proves" your case.

       Maybe you need to read a dictionary imstead of assuming definitions based off of use. Dogmatic means "inclined to lay down principles as incontrovertibly true," which you continue to do in pushing your brand of "common sense."

       Guess what? There are almost exactly five times as many people in the US as in the UK – 314 million vs. 63 million. Guess what else? The violent crime rate in the UK is 3,100 per 100,000, and in the US it is 380 per 100,000 population.

        Can you explain to me in small words how gun regulation protects law abiding citizens?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure. Once you make guns illegal, anybody who owns one is no longer a law-abiding citizen. Hence, they are criminals and need to be dealt with accordingly. Make examples of the first ten cases which come through the court system. Then, even the criminals won't want guns because gun possession is giving them more time in jail than the crime they used the gun for in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty soon your gun problem goes away. There will always be gun violence, of course, but the clear point is that we should be working to reduce it, not actively encouraging it by selling every Tom, Dick and Harry weapons which could take out an entire bus queue.

       Honestly though why dont you just pack up and get the fuck out. If it really bothers you that much go move to the UK. The right to bear arms is second only to the right to free speech in the US and if you cant accept that Americans have a thriving gun culture and a long standing history of gun ownership then grab your shit and  go. Otherwise stop trying to trample on the rights of others as afforded to them by the US constitution.

       The US constitution was written 250 years ago, when the best quality weapon was a single-shot musket which took nearly a full minute to reload. Your "right" to own a gun is cancelled out by the "right" of other people to stay alive. Your selfish failure to accept that is why kids die in horror shootings every other week.

       Why is it that whenever you are faced with any reasons about why guns are bad for society, you always want to change the subject to cars? What the fuck do cars have to do with guns? Just why on fucking Earth do you think something invented to get you to work in the morning is the same as something invented to kill you?

       I've even explained why such a comparison is a fallacy, several times throughout the thread, but you just don't listen. It goes into one ear and out of the other ear.

      <p>
       Using precisely the same logic you have just used, I could defend rape. I could rape you in the mouth, and when you started crying about it, I could just say, "Well, should we ban sex?" People who have sex often end up with dicks in their mouths, so does that mean we should ban it?

       Not to mention if you take guns away from law abiding citizens you leave them in the hands of no one but criminals and the police.

       Your literally using the same argument in relation to guns. Do you not agree that in the wrong hands whether by incompetence or malevolence vehicles are also a weapon? Also guns are not designed solely for the reason of killing your fellow human being. They can be used as a deterrent, as a tool for hunting/pest control or as a piece of sporting equipment. Lastly yes they can be used for the purpose of home defense.

       I see nothing wrong with that and neither does the law in the majority of the United States. Once again eat your fucking heart out.

       You strike me as one of those liberals who is so soft and incapable of responsibly making it through life without being told what to do, that you wear your water wings while eating your cereal in the morning for fear of drowning haha. You also strike me as a pathetic victim.

       So you make an argument, I make an analogy of the argument, and then you claim the analogy applies to me, not you? That isn't reasoned debate. You're basically just saying, "I know you are, you said you are, but what am I?" That's something I'd expect to hear in a playground.

       We have discussed this point at length and I have explained why the comparison between guns and cars is an unjust one. I have no desire to keep going around in a circle. Cars can be used as a weapons, but Guns
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       weapons. It is like trying to compare a fork to a nuclear bomb and saying that, because the fork is legal, the nuclear bomb should be legal, because they can both be used as weapons.

       You are refusing to see anything wrong with it because you aren't acknowledging the arguments I make which explain what is wrong with it. You simply make an argument, I refute it, you ignore the refutation, and several posts later repeat the same argument again.

       Of course I would be prepared to use my gun against someone who was willing to use violence against me that is the point of a deterrent.

       I'm not sure where your from but  hunting within the boundaries of the law is typically beneficial to the eco system involved. Not to mention a lot of the funds acquired from the purchase of hunting licenses and tags go towards conservation efforts. Keep in mind I'm talking about hunting for the meat not for the trophy aspect.

       But your logic breaks down at the point where you decide what someone else intends to do. Many innocent people have -- and continue to -- die that way. Flip it around. Let's say you're acting aggressive and someone shoots you in the face. That fair?

       Well, it isn't beneficial to the animals you're killing, is it? How about you let the animal live and sacrifice yourself, instead? You, know, for the "benefit of the eco-system". Interested in that?

       Cool. This is the third time in one post you've confused the contraction of "you are" with the possessive pronoun, "your". This causes me to question whether you do actually understand my arguments, as you claim.

       Yes, If I am going to act aggressively and threaten/inflict violence on another person then I damn well better be prepared to potentially suffer the consequences of my actions. How is that complicated? Who gives a shit about individual animals? We are the apex predator in this eco system. Do you get mad at a lion because he takes down a gazelle? Thank you for the lesson, but don't be a grammar nazi just because you're beginning to understand your arguments are pathetic and  nonsensical.

       Nah. This sounds like you think reality works like a movie, where bad people are always punished and the good guys always ride off into the sunset. As the world discovered with the Zimmerman case, once you kill the other guy, as long as there are no other credible witnesses nearby then you can pretty much get away with murder.

       In fact, flip it around entirely. Say I have a gun and you catch me doing something illegal. I
       <em>
        don't

       want to face the consequences of my actions, hence I pull the trigger and end you.

       Bro, I fully understand that you've got some batshit maniac cops over there, but the reason they are
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       dangerous is...
      </p>
      <p>
       Wait for it...
      </p>
      <p>
       Because they've all got guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The self-defence argument is a circular fallacy. The reason you feel like you need a gun to protect yourself, is because everybody is walking around with a fucking gun. You can't arm good citizens without also arming the bad ones. It's impossible. And which group do you think is going to be the group using the guns?

       It's not what I think. It's what evidence shows. Evidence shows that gun regulation prevents good citzens from being armed which in turn promotes their exploitation by criminals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you'd have good people surrender their weapons because bad people own guns? Your logic is sorely lacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already have guns. If we didn't, it'd be different, but it isn't. In fact, plenty of America doesn't have guns. In the places where fun control is tight, criminals and cops are the only ones armed and go figure if they don't exploit the fuck out of unarmed good people.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other end of the spectrum is places like Keneesaw, GA where gun ownership is practically mandatory and they went over 25 years without a homicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops aren't dangerous because they have guns. They're dangerous because they're indoctrinated to see civilians as dangerous criminals. They're dangerous because they're unaccountable for their crimes. They're dangerous because power such as theirs primes them for corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're not dangerous because they have guns. Millions of people own guns who aren't dangerous. The danger doesn't reside in the tool. It resides in the mindset that uses the tool for evil.

       Pretty simple, in the USA... gun ownership is part of the contract we have with the federal government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wish to break that contract, you may.  But taxes are part of the contract too... as well as free speech and the right to not have your home searched.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't get to pick and choose which parts of the contract are going to be dropped.  It's a contract, all one big contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take guns and Americans will correctly say "the contract is broken" and then there goes all your taxes that fund your pet projects (and keep politicians living in mansions) .

       Your opinion is shit.

       God didn't make every man equal, Samuel Colt did. Guns are the equalizer of force. Education is important. So important that I urge we pull our kids out of the defunct propagandized state systems in favor of more progressive and egalitarian opportunities for learning.
      </p>
      <p>
       But education alone is powerless without the force to weild that knowledge in the face of overwhelming stupidity. Research shows gun control makes the public less safe. Research probably also shows educational regulation makes the public dumber.

       Can you link to this research about gun control making people less safe?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to know as a person who lives in a country with strict gun control laws (background checks, interviews with the police, checks on your mental health, courses on gun safety, and a whole bunch of other things) and no real fears over my safety in even the sketchiest parts of the country. If anyone gets shot it makes the news here.

       Paraphrased conclusion: despite our preconceptions and comment sense telling us that gun regulation means less guns means less violence, the evidence shows this not to be the case.

       People get shot here all the time. Armed civilians seem to have a lower incidence of accidentally shooting the wrong person than armed police though. And yet we still have lower rates of violent crime than states like England that outlawed handguns.

       I'm afraid you're gonna have to demonstrate that these particular statistics were inaccurately cited before making such an implication of fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bias and agendas abound on this issue. My most recent pet theory revolves around a pro-gun agenda disguised as an anti-gun agenda. Nobody has sold more guns to civilians than fear mongering liberals. Load up the powderkeg till it's overflowing then light the fuse and run.

       One of the few things that the US has going for it is the resistance to gun control.  I seriously think that if the government were able to ban the guns they would,  but they cannot do that without an armed resistance potentially destroying the government.  As a thought exercise, let's say that the government banned guns in 2000.  What would the US look like today?  I know I would not feel as safe, and the people's fear would increase.  I don't think we would be in a better place.  Our guns may be the only thing that stands in the way of government totally enslaving the population.

       Your comment caused me to think about the jade helm operation and what it's true purpose is.  Bringing the military right into the states with high numbers of gun owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that if the government made a move that a militia would form faster than you think.  If a major event brought people together like 9/11 did in the days afterwards, I think the government would shit it's pants.

       I did not say that I think jade helm is about gun confiscation, but I do think it will be used as a tool of control and also the acclimatization of the population to a military prescence in their backyards.  This is a huge operation that has many facets,  I don't think we can trust a corrupt government  and say that every facet is benign.  We should keep our eyes and minds open

       There's actually a conspiracy going on right now in the South and country-side of the U.S. that a lot of unfamiliar faces are asking the locals to buy up their guns and are paying top dollar, pretty much over what they are worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't myself investigated this, however if I think about it critically, it is exactly what a perfectly designed government program to get rid of guns would consist of:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. Buy up all the most popular guns and ammo so that the prices become prohibited to key demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. Have the major Ammo/Gun manufacturers buy out everyone else and put Gov't cronies into management
      </p>
      <p>
       C. Start a secret gun buy back program funded with tax payer dollars like might already be happening

       There is a documentary on Netflix called "America's Book of Secrets" and one of the episodes is in regards to the 'drug war'. This episode covered quite a bit about the Fast and Furious gun running operation and had a brief note about people involved buying up guns and ammo at gun shows and then smuggling them to the Mexican cartels. The show stated that guns could be sold for 5 times as much value to the cartels.

       Just thought I would add that bit of info.

        I don't translate the current events and shootings to a sign that the US is preparing to aggressively confiscate guns nationwide or even in any particular state. I need more evidence to believe that than a string of mass shootings and Obama soapboxing on the issue. I'm from CT and we have some of the toughest laws on the books an, of course, home to the Sandy Hook tragedy. So I feel very close to what a lot of other people feel.

       one thing about this whole theory is that even if some people have guns if the government wants to kill you or arrest you it is not going to be a real issue. I mean, they will just burn down your compound (as we have witnessed) or bomb you or something. What good is a gun against a military force? I do think guns are useful for self-protection, but protection from the state? Nah.

       Millions of armed citizens fighting the good fight for their freedom would be taken very seriously by the government and they should.  Millions of unarmed citizens? Not as much.  The government is not an immortal omnipotent force.  And do you think every soldier in the governments army would be willing to kill American citizens?  I'm thinking many would fight for our side.

       Where did I say that it's the beginning of martial law? Do you just make up stuff and get angry at your own figment of imagination? And then congratulate yourself on being so much smarter than everyone because the figment that you made up can be easily refuted?  That's weird.  Anyway I've discussed jade helm and I've never heard people say it will be martial law.

       Sure, if you are talking a complete insurrection. I don't believe that could or would ever happen. People who talk about gun rights talk like they and a few friends are going to stand up to the cops or something. If millions of people were actively fighting the government they would get guns easily enough, and even without them they would probably win eventually.

       Asymmetric warfare. If you hypothetically were planning on killing some high-ranking "enemy of the people" within some existing power structure, you wouldn't announce to the world "HEY GUYS! I'M GONNA START KILLING PEOPLE, JUST LETTING YOU KNOW!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You're already part of a large, anonymous crowd of millions of people who possess guns. A true tactician would maintain their anonymity prior to carrying out any "decisive actions".
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the only way for TPTB to neutralize all potential "insurrectionists" would be by bombing the entire fucking country. I suppose that that is a remote possibility-- but if you're gonna worry about that you might as well worry about an asteroid precipitating an epochal cataclysm as well.

       Have you ever looked into that one?  I used to buy the trope that it was a civil conflict generated by hate between the "tribalism" of hutus and tutsis.  However, when you dig into it, there was a concerted effort to foment this genocide by western powers.

They do this all day everyday, and yet it never registers to them that they are nothing more than tools, components for a machine that has no need for human compassion, only blood to feed it's bowels.

       I like to think I have both but the nature of the conversation about gun control, volience, mental health, the ease of access to a deadly weapons, attitudes to blacks. The list just goes on and on. So what do we see outside of the States? Nine people dead, let's get rid of a flag!
      </p>
      <p>
       WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       In Australia we had a couple of massacres back to back. So the Government did something. Gun control. People drank and drove and lots of people died. The government did something, RBT and heavy fines. Cyber stalking was causing problems so the government did something. Jail time and fines.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America, you guys just don't care. It's all about what happened 200 years ago, why? It's about laws you seem unwilling to change, it borders on a regilous zeal. So why should I care? Four Serving Presidents are dead, chuck in a few Congress men, a few mayors and it just highlights the will of the people means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please explain why I should care if in the next 40 days another massacre happens?

       I don't care about your excuses to withdraw from society and selfishly keep your knowledge of the truth hidden away in your mind. We need to be doing the good work of awakening people out of the matrix.  And yes it is frustrating and exhausting work and sometimes you can only try to plant a seed and even people that you can't reach no matter how much you try.  If we are to resist we need numbers.  And I don't care how futile you perceive it to be because it is the right thing to do.

       What truth? I haven't withdrawn, I'm active in public life and community. So I'm not sure what your thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you truly believe that innocent people praying in a house of worship or kids younger than ten years old in a school or a President elected by common vote is more important than your single right to bear arms, well, you are part of the reason America is on this terrible decline.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no matrix, it's far far worse. It's life. It's mean cruel and totally ruthless and worst of all random in nature.  If you draw comfort from the idea the Government or some unnamed force or group is responsible, words leave me. America stuffed up Iran in the 50's, most of South America in the 60's. Balls up Vietnam, Loas, Thailand. Went back to Iran in the 70's &amp; 80. Also lets chuck in Iraq, Indonsiea &amp; Australia. Yes, you guys got Whitlam chucked out. And you think the Governemnt is smart enough to create this terrible cancer in your community!
      </p>
      <p>
       So please, point to racial law changes that have stripped your rights? Meaning you can't travel, can't vote, can't do what ever you want. There are no men black snatching up citizens. No towns been blocked off. No stripping of guns. But you could go to Africa to see that or parts of Asia. It's a real everyday event there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead the young, the old and just in the wrong place at the wrong time are dying at around 30,000 to 50,000 a year due to guns. And you seem ok with that!? I thought America was about community, clearly it's become all for one and one for one.

       Yes. I've mulled over your list and feel there is a fatal flaw to the argument. All the countries listed were never a Democratic country at the time of the massacres. Meaning citizens were never given the chance to purchase or stock pile guns. Also, all lacked major small arms manufacters that sold to their citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, all countries listed had moved from the feudal system to autocratic rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, most of the population were farmers, uneducated, widely spread over the country. They were in short the lowest of third world countries. Russia while a naval power house was never a centre of excellence in any other field. Very little of the wealth left the hands of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you want to discuss what happens to a country and its neighbours when guns are removed just look to Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain. 
Thoughts.

       Paraphrasing the words of the hilarious Bill Burr yes owning guns increasing your chances of accidental shooting. Just like owning a pool increases the chance of drowning in your backyard simply because you couldn't do that before haha

       I truly do understand your reasoning, and appreciate the time you took to respond to my comment.  Your passion on the issue shines through in the arguments you make, and that is something to be admired, not dismissed.  I don't tend to respond to comments as I'm sure you have seen first-hand that they tend to devolve into name-calling and righteous pronouncements, but your well-thought out analyses challenged my own viewpoints and I figured, hell, I could have a good conversation with this individual.  All the best brother, cheers!

        Does that also mean that because one person drinks, gets behind the wheel and kills someone that we ban all cars?

      <p>
       Why is it that whenever you are faced with any reasons about why guns are bad for society, you always want to change the subject to cars? What the fuck do cars have to do with guns? Just why on fucking Earth do you think something invented to get you to work in the morning is the same as something invented to kill you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've even explained why such a comparison is a fallacy, several times throughout the thread, but you just don't listen. It goes into one ear and out of the other ear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using precisely the same logic you have just used, I could defend rape. I could rape you in the mouth, and when you started crying about it, I could just say, "Well, should we ban sex?" People who have sex often end up with dicks in their mouths, so does that mean we should ban it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The arguments you are trying to use are just insane.
