       I'm sure all the regulars see the changes around here. These race baiting posts have gotten ridiculous. They have unrealistic up votes and comment support. The one on the front page actually has a comment linking to coontown and that comment has many up votes. These are not the regular community.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the same old trick. There is a conspiracy (again) to purposely push racism on this sub to make it look like a racist sub when before this effort it was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be a great way to justify shutting the sub down.

       I have been on conspiracy boards since the internet began and it was never racially inclined in any way. If anything it was seen as a rallying cause for all the races to fight against. If you want to conquer, you have to divide first. That is why someone gets neo-nazis and racists to flood these boards... someone with money and programs designed to destabilize communities.

       This won't be the it. If you notice they have gone after those "free speech subs". They will merge more people here. Once this sub is large enough. They will pull off their own version of Internet false flag. R/conspiracy will be to blame. Giving them the green light to delete the sub, causing everyone to scatter. Check my post history. I have been calling this for the past 6 months. It's been long coming. They won't do it until they know they can swing public views with added help of the usual brigade of comments to go with it.

       It's pretty easy to combat, but need two things to happen:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Users need to report rule violations;
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       And
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Mods need to remove the posts and consider banning the offending user.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There are more users than mods, so they need our help letting them know when we find trolls, shill, whatever. And then it's up to them.

       I can see a few posts now and then that have a racial conspiracy being ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the case of one user posting nothing but racially motivated posts on a regular basis, I agree with you. It can be interpreted as violating one or more of the rules..... They do have specific subs for that, he can go there.

       Speaking of race baiting, has anyone noticed that's almost all The Alex Jones Show has become? It feels like that show has shifted dramatically since I first started listening about a dozen years ago. I know many in the conspiracy community don't like him, but I have to credit him for being the first place where I was able to get information that I otherwise may have never been able to find (especially his films) but it feels like all the good info that may have once existed is now a thing of the past.

       Or maybe racists exist and they often rely on conspiracy theories to justify their hateful views? Naturally there will be some overlap.

       If your concern is regarding the overlap between racist and conspiratorial views,
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">
        here is a good example
       </a>
       . For further proof, hop on to stormfront for a little while, or watch some interviews with skinheads. Certainly not all conspiracy inclined folk are racist, but racists will often hold conspiratorial views in some way or another.

       I've specifically chosen my language in both comments as to not associate the two. The fact that you and most other conspiracy theorists are not racist does not mean that racists cant be conspiracy theorists or that some conspiracy theories cant be racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just pointing out that given the behaviour of racist individuals, it really isnt that surprising some might spend some time on conspiracy forums as well
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: my first example is proof there are racists here, even in the mod staff. Non racists don't put Hitler in the sidebar. The second example was a racist conspiracy theory. Its been a proven hoax for nearly 100 years and you can still see it cited by racists as some form of proof of some evil Jewish plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit2: Didn't respond to your shameless mining of my comment history or accusation as these amount to nothing more than off topic personal attacks. My position on Holocaust denial or a joking post I made are irrelevant to the discussion. Why not just discuss the Topic at hand rather than resorting to cheap little jabs?

       Yep, i could see that happening, but that doesnt mean every racist, or even a large percentage of them are stormfronters raiding the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: if anything, it proves that people looking to spread racist ideals see the value of conspiratorial thinking for recruiting into their group. In order to be a racist, you kind of need conspiracy theories of some sort to justify your views.

       Absolutely, I would never say otherwise. I would even go as far as to say I don't think all Holocaust deniers are racist (although if there were ever a conspiracy theory more adored by racists I haven't seen it).

       I guess its a bit subjective, but I'd the worst was when the "Hitler did nothing" documentary was stickied and his face was put in the sidebar. Alot of antisemitic attitudes then. There was also the time around the charlie Hebdo attacks, when users here had decided the Jews did it within ten minutes. Its debatable which was worse, and honestly not that important.

       I can see where you're coming from. This is exactly the reason I quit frequenting Godlike Productions, it turned into racists theorizing on race wars while practicing the same race-baiting bullshit they claim to be aware of, using their theories as an excuse to shout out the N word any time they could find an opportunity.

       I had a brief exchange with one of the mods of the sub about this, and although he/she was receptive and acknowledged this issue, I don't expect anything to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my sentiment that we should expose the race-war in general, but should not allow ourselves to fall prey to race-baiting by singling out individual instances of racially-motivated crimes in a way that would encourage race-baiting. If it were up to me, what that would mean is any post which does single out an instance of racial crime would be required to have a tag of "race war" and further, if the title of the post in any way put a racially biased spin on the information, it would be deleted and the posting user reprimanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, regarding posts specifically targeting Jews, I realize that there are those who tout the line that "Zionsts run everything" and thus use this as justification for posting such content, but I and others prove that there is no Jewish-Zionist conspiracy and that it was only the Jesuit-controlled Labor Zionists who collaborated with the likewise Jesuit-controlled Third Reich to establish the State of Israel, which is nothing more than Rome's revived Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, being ruled by contemporary hofjuden for the benefit of Rome. Thus, while criticism of the Israeli government is acceptable and warranted, any and all explicit anti-Jewish fury posts would be banned.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This group [Labor Zionism] really originated with leader Jacob Frank and were in league with the Jesuit Order’s Bavarian Illuminati. With the King of Poland serving as his sponsor, Frank was baptized into the Roman Catholic institution as were all of his Hebrew followers. Shortly after this time the Order imported the French Revolution from Bavaria into France, later giving way to the rise of Napoleon and his Consulate. On this three-man triumvirate were First Consul Napoleon himself, Second Consul Jesuit Abby Sieyes and Third Consul Roger Ducos. Napoleon was guided by Sieyes in all his campaigns, especially during his campaign in North Africa and in Palestine. For Napoleon, the Great Jesuit Avenger, on the advice of his Jesuit master sought to make Palestine “a homeland for the Jews.” Thus, Napoleon was really the first Masonic Labor Zionist leading the movement for Jews to repopulate their promised land for the benefit of the Jesuit Papacy yet to be restored in 1814. During the 19th century, after the Order had completely gained control of both the British Crown and Parliament, the Company’s socialist-communist British Fabian Socialists gave birth to the socialist-communist British Labor Party and hence to the socialist-communist Jewish Labor Party of the historic Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists. The leader of the Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists was Theodor Herzl, the Jew who led the fight to found a new Jewish State in historic Palestine after the Jesuit-concocted Dreyfus Affair, it to be a rebirth of the historic nation of Israel. The real purpose for the establishment of a Jewish homeland was to revive the Knights Templars’ Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (AD 1099-1291)—for the benefit of the pope, the pope overseen and captive to the Jesuit Superior General, the Grand Master of the New Knights Templars. These Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists rule Israel for the benefit of Rome, not for the benefit of the Lord’s beloved racial Hebrew/Jewish/Israelite people in Israel. The Labor Zionists are completely in the arms of the Jesuit Papacy and are in fact Jesuit Temporal Coadjutors.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In addition, Labor Zionism was the only type of Zionism allowed under Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zionism itself is not a bad thing, either:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This Son of God/Son of Man/Seed of David is the Great ZIONIST Himself. For it is He that will one day restore a lasting peace to Jerusalem—then to be the “city of the great king”—after his Second Coming (Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 2:1-3). Messiah will be the world lawgiver, ruling restored Israel and the Gentile nations from his Fourth Hebrew Temple in Jerusalem—from Zion! He is That Prophet, the Hope of Israel, the One yet to restore the Kingdom of David during which his repentant and born-again Nation of Israel will be the “Head of all Nations” (Deuteronomy 28:12-13).
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Moreover, most of the city of Jerusalem and all of its holy sites are legally owned by the Vatican; this started in 1993 when the Jesuit-trained, Masonic court Jew President of Israel, Shimon Peres gave away 60% of the city in a hidden clause of the Oslo Accords. The Jesuits control all high-level, Illuminized Freemasonry as they hijacked what was originally Scottish-rite Masonry in 1754 by writing the first 25 rites of what would become known as the "Ancient and Accepted Right of Scottish Freemasonry" at their Jesuit College of Clermont in Paris. Then later the Jesuits would author the last 8 rites in the 1780's when Frederick II of Prussia gave them refuge during the Order's suppression by the Papacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Jews who are in positions of power are Masonic/Papal Knights and Jews are purposely put into governmental positions to divert attention away from the real controllers like the Professed Jesuit of the 4th Vow who has been a presider over the CFR, was a former President of Jesuit Fordham University, and former longtime Chairman of the New York City Campaign Finance Board (who was later succeeded by another Jesuit, Joseph P. Parkes), Joseph O'Hare, S.J.
      </p>
      <p>
       In particular the Sabbatean-Frankist Rothschilds are often touted as being at the top of the global power structure, yet hold the title "Guardians of the Papal treasure" and are Papal/Masonic Knights of the Order of Malta and the British Empire to name a couple. They are merely contemporary court Jews who move money for the Jesuits and the Order's intelligence agencies and operations. Yes, the intelligence agencies are controlled through the Jesuits, as you had Knights of Malta running all of the intelligence agencies during WWII and today it's the same story with a plethora of Roman Catholic/Jesuit-trained/Papal Knights heading up the CIA, DHS and FBI. The Israeli Mossad was created by a Knight of Malta, Hitler's chief Nazi SS intelligence officer, Reinhard Gehlen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relating to my original post, much of the anti-Jewish fury literature of the past has been secretly authored by Jesuits and attributed to others. This was the case with "Mein Kampf" (attributed to Hitler, but really written by Jesuit Priest Bernhardt Staempfle), the "Protocols of Zion" (written by certain Jesuits behind the Dreyfus Affair), and "On the Jews and Their Lies" (attributed posthumously to the the Great Reformer Martin Luther but bears zero resemblance to the language or theology of Martin Luther; it was written as propaganda by agents of the counter-reformation - likely early Jesuit Knights of the Virgin Mary) among other instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always Roman Catholics/Papal Knights/Jesuit-alumni who serve Rome involved in high political positions. Both Houses of the US Congress are headed by Jesuit alumni (Biden has degrees from multiple Jesuit/Catholic Universities and Boehner is an alumnus of Jesuit Xavier University). If they're not Jesuit alumni then they are probably Yale Skull-and-Bonesmen or from another Ivy League university that uses its own version of the Jesuitical Skull and Bones secret fraternity. Skull and bones rituals involve desecrating the supposed remains of Madame Pompadour, a tremendous enemy of the Jesuits for being instrumental in getting the Order expelled from France. International politics are no different - heads of the European Union and European Central bank are also gentile Jesuit-trained/Roman Catholic/Papal Knights like Herman Van Rompuy and Mario Draghi.

        <p>
         <strong>
          Nationalist Zionism
         </strong>
         originated from the
         <strong>
          Revisionist Zionists led by Jabotinsky
         </strong>
         . The Revisionists left the World Zionist Organization in 1935 because it refused to state that the creation of a Jewish state was an objective of Zionism. The revisionists advocated the formation of a Jewish Army in Palestine to force the Arab population to accept mass Jewish migration.
         <strong>
          Revisionist Zionism evolved into the Likud Party in Israel, which has dominated most governments since 1977.
         </strong>
         It advocates that Israel maintain control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and takes a hard-line approach in the Israeli-Arab conflict. In 2005 the Likud split over the issue of creation of a Palestinian state on the occupied territories, and party members advocating peace talks helped form the Kadima party.[citation needed]

       Historically, revisionist Zionism was a Hebrew Patriot movement. Presently, those running Israel regardless of party association are Masonic court Jews. The Labor Zionists were the only Zionists involved in the pretext for establishing Israel whereas the revisionist Zionists were "led by Vladimir Jabotinsky (“the Lone Wolf”) , a Polish Hebrew patriot who genuinely sought to establish a Hebrew/Jewish nation for the benefit of the Jews living therein. He had the courage to attempt to save the Jews of Poland from their approaching fate at the hands of Jesuit coadjutors Hitler and Stalin, but was resisted by Masonic Jewish Labor Zionist David Ben-Gurion who insisted that millions of Polish Jews must perish if Israel was ever to be re-established. Hence “the Lone Wolf” was murdered in Hunter, New York, given the Order’s “poison cup” for his disobedience to the pope’s Labor Zionists. Jabo’s truly patriotic Irgun would be betrayed by the pope’s Labor Zionists and merged into Ben Gurion’s Haganah, later the Mossad created by the pope’s pro-Nazi American CIA and German BND in 1951. For daring to fight against the pope’s Masonic Jewish Labor Zionists, the Revisionist Zionists were terminated. See Ben Hecht’s Perfidy for the entire, heart-breaking story."

       Revisionist Jews used England to get a foothold in Palestine, and then turned on England with overt, and covert terrorists acts to drive them out.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In its early years, and under Jabotinsky's leadership, Revisionist Zionism was focused on gaining British aid for settlement. Later, Revisionist groups independent of Jabotinsky's leadership conducted campaigns of violence against the British authorities in Palestine to drive them out and establish a Jewish state.

       Revisionists under Jabotinsky engaged in diplomacy and desired to work with Britain; they thought this method would best serve the Zionist cause. Revisionists had nothing to do with Hitler's Third Reich or the Jesuit Papacy, unlike the Labor Zionists. Again though, the Israeli political system is controlled through high-level freemasonry controlled by the Jesuits.

       That was really sharp, i'm glad someone else sees the obvious power structure in place. The Zionists are just gophers for the Illuminati-Jesuit-Freemasonic Vatican and their royal bloodlines they serve. Always knew the Brits and the Nazis were working together. Between the Queen and her cousins doing nazi salutes and marching at Nazi funerals in Nazi regalia and the British aristocracy having a huge stake in German affairs it was always really obvious. Another thing, if you look at the facial structure of all the top Jesuit stooges, Zionist British aristocrats, the Windsors and the top level Jewish bankers they all share fairly similar facial structures with each other. Even certain nazis like Eichmann have this. I suspect they are all from similar inbred bloodlines and thats one of the reasons they all think and act the same. Just a theory but Bush senior looks like Prince Philip as does John Kerry.

       Zionist is not a racist term. It's not about the Protocols of Zion either. It is a political worldview holding that the Jews should return to their supposed homeland and establish a nation there once more, something that is fundamentally against the principles of true Judaism. God is supposed to have banned the Jews from returning to Israel until the end days. So, to even speak of the idea that Jews should go back or that they have the right to take that land "back" from the people living there is blasphemy according to the traditional Jewish books. Also, Jews are not an ethnicity, they are a religion. So here we have the Jewish State of Israel gearing up for war with the so called Islamic State. Who has more of a right to exist? The Israelis invented terrorism, so you can't argue that IS's use of such tactics discounts their right to exists as a state. Their religious book speaks of the creation of an Islamic World State/Caliphate. But we are allowed to point out the dangers of such an ideology when it comes to radical Muslims, or with crazy Christians, just not with anyone related to Judaism because that's racist.

       Look at all your bullets.

       Again, you fail to see the racist overtones of your statements, again you use thought terminating cliches, again you are spouting some ludicrous race-baiting nonsense.

       Can you even

       Now that I've pointed out that out to you, will you continue to engage in this wedge, proving that you are aware of the divide it causes; or will you stop using killwords?

       Really?   So did you just confirm my point?

       The Zionist-Jew owned media is specifically pushing stories, and narratives that will only portray Blacks as only victims of White crimes.  While they simultaneously, and intentionally keeping race out of stories where Blacks are the criminals against Whites?

This is exactly the reason I quit frequenting Godlike Productions, it turned into racists theorizing on race wars while practicing the same race-baiting bullshit they claim to be aware of, using their theories as an excuse to shout out the N word any time they could find an opportunity.
