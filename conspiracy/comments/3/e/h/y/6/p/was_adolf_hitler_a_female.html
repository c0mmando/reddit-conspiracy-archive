       So recently the historians released evidence that the skull of Hitler they have been studying was that of a woman. The recent Guardian Article source is
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/27/adolf-hitler-suicide-skull-fragment">
        here
       </a>
       .  Is it possible that Hitler was actually a very masculine looking and manly behaving woman, with a massive inferiority complex? This fact would explain why she/he kept enlisting into battle in WW1. If she/he wanted to prove something to the other men. This would also explain the weird facial hair setup. The mustache truly looks odd and could be a tape on or nose-clipped. If Hitler was a female this would also explain why Hitler kept her wife hidden away, because it was a lesbian relationship, which was very taboo at the time. All of this situation could also explain a lot of the self-hatred issues Hitler had and the drug issue. If you have ever seen some of the female stand-up comedians around the world today, they look very very convincing. Some you can not tell they are women. There have been people through the history of man that assumed the other gender roles, and were never discovered or published. Just look at some of the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, until this day we don't know for sure.

       I mean the theory is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       that crazy. What is crazier is people say 6,000,000 people were killed in 4 years. It's actually illegal to argue about holocaust numbers in many countries. That is crazy too. So for your to say yeah "the skulls were switched" well that requires another layer of conspiracy amongst multiple people. If Hitler was a woman, he alone would carry that lie to his grave, and it would technically be less of a conspiracy.

       You can go by height, but there are a lot more factors, like hip/should proportions, which were always stifled on him by the chub-and-tuck uniform setup.

       It's refreshing to see that people are actually connecting with this theory and thinking outside the box, and I don't know why people think it's so terribly hard to fathom that Hitler may have been transgender. It's not the craziest theory out there.

       Adolf Hitler was most certainly not a female.

      <p>
       I am honestly astonished you would even entertain such a notion.
      </p>

       I think it's more plausible that the supposed "Hitlers"  skull is obviously not his.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a ton of information on the Internet, as well as declassified documents, illustrating how Hitler fled, as well as many other Nazis, to South America.

       Perhaps you should look in that direction.

       Oh I'm sorry, were you there in the 50's performing Hitler's physicals? I'm glad you are telling me you are honest. Thanks. Also I am glad my long post "astonished" you... It astonished you I am thinking outside the box? Scientists are saying the skull was female. Is it that huge of a jump to speculate Hitler may have been female? I am not entertaining a notion, I am asking to engage in open discussion of the possibility.

       Ask a question, collect evidence, build a hypothesis. This is a good one. Image search hitler with women. We would need to look at his medical records to determine chromosomes. You can't disprove this, but the evidence isn't sold to prove it either. Good theory.

       Thanks for the support. Many of the "users" comments were right away a barage of hatred, so it sounded like a lot of users were really uncomfortable with shifting their thinking or world views to even consider this. Or they were pro-white power shills and were very offended by this suggestion.

       I got blocked by someone like this online earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was a flat earth guy on Instagram that I tried talking to about how I don't know it's round. But he doesn't know just like I don't know 100 percent that it's flat. Wanted to talk about it and he attacked me about being close minded and blocked me before we could even have a debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even told him. I'm with him on I don't know it's a sphere. But we don't know 100 percent that it's flat. Really stupid guy.

      <p>
       People thing they are open minded yet they don't have any real thoughts of their own still. Just subscribe to a different view that is handed to them. Sad really and hard to deal with.

       While I disagree with the unnecessary barrage of hateful comments you've received, aren't you also doing the same thing with the above comment?

       I mean the theory is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       that crazy. What is crazier is people say 6,000,000 people were killed in 4 years. It's actually illegal to argue about holocaust numbers in many countries. That is crazy too. So for your to say yeah "the skulls were switched" well that requires another layer of conspiracy amongst multiple people. If Hitler was a woman, he alone would carry that lie to his grave, and it would technically be less of a conspiracy.
