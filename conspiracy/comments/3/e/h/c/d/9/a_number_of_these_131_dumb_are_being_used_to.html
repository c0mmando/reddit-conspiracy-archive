       Philip Schneider was a former US Government Geologist and Engineer, who was involved in producing the underground explosions which were required to facilitate the building of various underground military bases, as well as submarine bases for the United States Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claimed to be one of only three people who survived the infamous Alien/Human War at Dulce and Los Alamos, where 66 Government Agents and Workers supposedly lost their lives in August of 1979.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the last two years of his life he gave lectures about supposed classified information, including UFO's to the media and general public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Philip Schneider was found dead in his apartment on January 17, 1996.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all 20 years ago! (meaning think of what has been done since then) Phil had nothing to gain from doing his lectures on these topics and he was shot for it (though he managed to survive throughout 1995). I highly recommend watching these old videos and see what he had to say. To me, this starts to tie in all kinds of conspiracy threads into making more and more sense of what is really going on...

       I am now going deeper and deeper into information about this man and what he was connected to... Very interesting.

       I can't form an opinion beyond the obvious conclusion, he's extremely nervous and he's also telling the truth.
