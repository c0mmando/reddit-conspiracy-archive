<blockquote>
<p>The news led Ben-Gurion to make the only statement by an Israeli Prime Minister about Dimona. On December 21 he announced to the Knesset that the government was building a 24 megawatt reactor &quot;which will serve the needs of industry, agriculture, health, and science&quot;, and that it &quot;is designed exclusively for peaceful purposes&quot;. Bergmann, who was chairman of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission from 1954 to 1966, however said that &quot;There is no distinction between nuclear energy for peaceful purposes or warlike ones&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This image says it all: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xUXqrNm.png">http://i.imgur.com/xUXqrNm.png</a></p>

<p>The &quot;Iranian peace deal&quot; is just a setup. It&#39;s impossibly strict and being forced on Iran, and when Iran inevitably violates one of the rules, the US/Israel will go &quot;See? They can&#39;t even act in good faith, they ruined this peace treaty!&quot; and that will give justification in the eyes of the public, through the media, that Iran is worthy of being attacked because they can&#39;t even honor a simple peace treaty. </p>

<p>How can they let Iran have nukes when they&#39;ve threatened to attack Israel?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the story that will be sold to us over the coming months. Don&#39;t buy it.  They want you to ignore the other side of the story, that Israel has hundreds of nukes, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3ella9/this_has_made_the_rounds_before_but_apparently/">threatens Iran constantly.</a></p>

<p>That&#39;ll sway the crucial 20-40% of the public&#39;s opinion needed to support an actual physical war against Iran, which is what Israel wants because Iran is the only other developed country in that region and Israel doesn&#39;t like competition. </p>

<p>No, of course not. I abhor Israel&#39;s theft of the West Bank and Gaza, and how they have governed those territories like apartheid states. </p>

<p>Oh, okay. Then I see why you are so thankful that I corrected your error calling Israel&#39;s nukes &quot;illegal.&quot; If you&#39;re concerned with accuracy, you will stop saying those weapons are illegal, right?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what &quot;media&quot; you&#39;re referring to. The media really isn&#39;t a singular entity, a monolith with a single voice. Sure, the media favored by conservatives, libertarians, Republicans, Tea Party types, &quot;patriots,&quot; and the rest of the extreme right is very biased against Iran and in favor of Israel. This includes Fox News and 99% of talk radio. But the rest of the media has been pretty fair on the subject and has shown a fairly accurate picture of the current state of relations and the treaty.</p>

<p>Given your position, I imagine you must be very happy about Obama&#39;s handling of Iran relations an the treaty he is trying to get passed. Is that right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Geneva Conventions are a series of treaties on the treatment of civilians, prisoners of war (POWs) and soldiers who are otherwise rendered hors de combat, or incapable of fighting.</p>

<p>The Geneva Conventions and other international tractates recognize that land a) conquered in the course of a war; and b) the disposition of which is unresolved through subsequent peace treaties is &quot;occupied&quot; and subject to international laws of war and international humanitarian law. This includes special protection of individuals in those territories, limitations on the use of land in those territories, and access by international relief agencies. 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law_and_the_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict</a>)</p>

<p>Recognizing the controversial nature of sovereignty over Jerusalem, UNSCOP recommended that the city be placed under United Nations administration in the partition plan. This was approved by the General Assembly in November, 1947, accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. However, the 1948-1949 war resulted in Israel occupying the western portion of the city. Israel made Jerusalem its capital in 1950, establishing governmental offices in areas it controlled. Soon afterwards in 1950 Jordan annexed the eastern part along with the remainder of the West Bank.</p>

<p>How does it apply? We were talking about documents that Israel did or didn&#39;t sign, that they did or didn&#39;t abide by. Does their signature really matter? Lmfao.</p>

<p>RE: The West Bank</p>

<p>At various locations, the selected route of the barrier required the demolition of homes and the expulsion of the residents of those homes, in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>

<p>RE: War Crimes</p>

<p>The barrier and Israel&#39;s series of checkpoints have made life nearly impossible for residents of the West Bank, constituting collective punishment. Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention categorize collective punishment in occupied territories as a war crime.</p>

<p>The barrier is constructed inside of the West Bank, making it completely in violation of international law.</p>

<p>In the international court of justice the vote was 150 nations in favor of resolution of these problems, 7 against, and 10 abstained.</p>

<p>150-7.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iran signed the NPT, Israel did not. Technically, Israel can build as many nukes as they want as they aren&#39;t violated any international law. Iran, on the other hand, must submit to IAEA oversite which the recent treaty is forcing them to do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Iran via their Quds Force is the largest Middle East provider of weapons to foreign violent groups. Virtually every conflict in the Mid East has Iranian weapons on one side or another. Assad&#39;s Syrian army, Hamas, the Houthi insurgency in Yemen, Hezbollah, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan are all being supported in some way or another by Persian guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK, the meth-head nut=job virtually everybody in Lyndonian America hates all day each and every day at any and all times with no exceptions or possibility of relief, was against Israeli nukes. The Israeli bag-man LBJ, whose corpse has a real-time zombie control of America that goes virtually unquestioned, favored what will remain the status quo.  Nuclear proliferation is a problem that made a better pretext for the neocon Iraq attack than alternatives.  The &quot;yellow cake&quot; turned out to be Duncan Hines baked by some cat named Curveball.  The cowardly un-American leaders of the US Military need to watch out for the brave Israelis itching for war with Iran; there is no way hubris would work out even as &quot;well&quot; as Gulf War 2.</p>
