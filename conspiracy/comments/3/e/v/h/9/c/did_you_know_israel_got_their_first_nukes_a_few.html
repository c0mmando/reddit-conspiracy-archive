      <blockquote>

        The news led Ben-Gurion to make the only statement by an Israeli Prime Minister about Dimona. On December 21 he announced to the Knesset that the government was building a 24 megawatt reactor "which will serve the needs of industry, agriculture, health, and science", and that it "is designed exclusively for peaceful purposes". Bergmann, who was chairman of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission from 1954 to 1966, however said that "There is no distinction between nuclear energy for peaceful purposes or warlike ones"

       The "Iranian peace deal" is just a setup. It's impossibly strict and being forced on Iran, and when Iran inevitably violates one of the rules, the US/Israel will go "See? They can't even act in good faith, they ruined this peace treaty!" and that will give justification in the eyes of the public, through the media, that Iran is worthy of being attacked because they can't even honor a simple peace treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can they let Iran have nukes when they've threatened to attack Israel?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the story that will be sold to us over the coming months. Don't buy it.  They want you to ignore the other side of the story, that Israel has hundreds of nukes, and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3ella9/this_has_made_the_rounds_before_but_apparently/">
        threatens Iran constantly.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That'll sway the crucial 20-40% of the public's opinion needed to support an actual physical war against Iran, which is what Israel wants because Iran is the only other developed country in that region and Israel doesn't like competition.

       That's what I thought too... but the mods here are generally good so I just decided to repost it this way, and they seem to have left it alone, so it's all good I guess. Did kinda kill a bit of the momentum though, and it's not as visually catchy this way.

       Exactly. Textbook psychological projection, but they do it on a scale across millions of people using the media. An entire nation projecting it's failures on another entire nation. It's so weird when you step back and look at it.

       Because they signed a treaty (the NPT) saying they wouldn't. That said, they're sovereign as well. They can back out of the treaty and build nukes if they want to. That's why we're trying to make a new treaty with them: so they don't. And if they do, as is their right, other sovereign nations may react unfavorably. Does this help?

       There is no global government. There are no global laws that all countries must obey. That's what sovereignty means. So, yes, nations can do what they please. (Unless they have signed treaties stating otherwise.)

       I don't know what "media" you're referring to. The media really isn't a singular entity, a monolith with a single voice. Sure, the media favored by conservatives, libertarians, Republicans, Tea Party types, "patriots," and the rest of the extreme right is very biased against Iran and in favor of Israel. This includes Fox News and 99% of talk radio. But the rest of the media has been pretty fair on the subject and has shown a fairly accurate picture of the current state of relations and the treaty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given your position, I imagine you must be very happy about Obama's handling of Iran relations an the treaty he is trying to get passed. Is that right?

       A common feature of the psychopath is accusing all others of the very thing the psychopath does. Because psychopaths are generally good liars, this can considerably muddy practical situations. Also, a psychopath will often create dissent by playing parties against each other by presenting to each a completely different story.

       The Geneva Conventions are a series of treaties on the treatment of civilians, prisoners of war (POWs) and soldiers who are otherwise rendered hors de combat, or incapable of fighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Geneva Conventions and other international tractates recognize that land a) conquered in the course of a war; and b) the disposition of which is unresolved through subsequent peace treaties is "occupied" and subject to international laws of war and international humanitarian law. This includes special protection of individuals in those territories, limitations on the use of land in those territories, and access by international relief agencies.

       Recognizing the controversial nature of sovereignty over Jerusalem, UNSCOP recommended that the city be placed under United Nations administration in the partition plan. This was approved by the General Assembly in November, 1947, accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. However, the 1948-1949 war resulted in Israel occupying the western portion of the city. Israel made Jerusalem its capital in 1950, establishing governmental offices in areas it controlled. Soon afterwards in 1950 Jordan annexed the eastern part along with the remainder of the West Bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does it apply? We were talking about documents that Israel did or didn't sign, that they did or didn't abide by. Does their signature really matter? Lmfao.

      <p>
       RE: The West Bank
      </p>
      <p>
       At various locations, the selected route of the barrier required the demolition of homes and the expulsion of the residents of those homes, in violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
      </p>
      <p>
       RE: War Crimes
      </p>
      <p>
       The barrier and Israel's series of checkpoints have made life nearly impossible for residents of the West Bank, constituting collective punishment. Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention categorize collective punishment in occupied territories as a war crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The barrier is constructed inside of the West Bank, making it completely in violation of international law.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the international court of justice the vote was 150 nations in favor of resolution of these problems, 7 against, and 10 abstained.

       Israel is breaking it constantly, and it never seems to matter. Israel didn't sign the NPT because they knew they were going to go rogue and develop nukes... you see non-allegiance to a anti-nuclear peace treaty as a reasonable option? Who is the rogue state again?

       Iran signed the NPT, Israel did not. Technically, Israel can build as many nukes as they want as they aren't violated any international law. Iran, on the other hand, must submit to IAEA oversite which the recent treaty is forcing them to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, Iran via their Quds Force is the largest Middle East provider of weapons to foreign violent groups. Virtually every conflict in the Mid East has Iranian weapons on one side or another. Assad's Syrian army, Hamas, the Houthi insurgency in Yemen, Hezbollah, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan are all being supported in some way or another by Persian guns.

       JFK, the meth-head nut=job virtually everybody in Lyndonian America hates all day each and every day at any and all times with no exceptions or possibility of relief, was against Israeli nukes. The Israeli bag-man LBJ, whose corpse has a real-time zombie control of America that goes virtually unquestioned, favored what will remain the status quo.  Nuclear proliferation is a problem that made a better pretext for the neocon Iraq attack than alternatives.  The "yellow cake" turned out to be Duncan Hines baked by some cat named Curveball.  The cowardly un-American leaders of the US Military need to watch out for the brave Israelis itching for war with Iran; there is no way hubris would work out even as "well" as Gulf War 2.

       Take it with a grain of salt to be sure but it's certainly an interesting idea if you haven't come across it before.

       Concept of nukes. I haven't looked further into it due to time constraints. But nukes = tools to instill fear. It is a very useful tool for governments!

       There is literally nothing you can't call a hoax and get a lot of people to believe. Evidence literally means nothing. There will always be some percentage of the population that is totally impervious to reality.

       Give the guy a break.  After all, most people here think 9/11 was an inside job or that we never landed on the moon.  Lets put things into perspective.  Why couldn't nukes be just one big hoax?  It's more plausible than some other things I've seen around here.

       People could see the nuclear tests from hotels in. Las Vegas. But it's ok to question every angle. Pretty sure Israel has the same number of nukes as the US and Russia... I guess when people attack half your rave you get to claim fear to kill your neighbors. They need to teach the American Indians how to make America pay for your existence...

       Israel has more than that. They are on most American military bases around the world with nuclear capabilities and they have war ships and submarines with them. They are ranked as the second most technologically advanced military. I was told they have a treaty with America that we will protect them at all cost, so they have access to all our nukes.

       Because they signed a treaty (the NPT) saying they wouldn't. That said, they're sovereign as well. They can back out of the treaty and build nukes if they want to. That's why we're trying to make a new treaty with them: so they don't. And if they do, as is their right, other sovereign nations may react unfavorably. Does this help?
