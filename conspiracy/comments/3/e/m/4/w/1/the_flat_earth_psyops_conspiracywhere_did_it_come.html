        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I really thought this flat earth stuff was some kind of troll or something but I&#39;m starting to notice some truth-seekers in my social circles taking this more seriously and falling for its lies and I&#39;m beginning to think that something more ominous is going on.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that I have a perfect BS meter, but I&#39;ve been in and out of enough cults and secret societies to know psy-op manipulation tactics when I encounter them.</p>

<p>Something is really fishy about the FE stuff.  It seems like some kind of scheme designed to lure in truth seekers to distract and break down critical thinking skills.  It feels very cult-like.  </p>

<p>I wasted enough time debunking these guys to where I feel like I got manipulated into playing the role of a debunker, which diverted my attention away from other more important things.  I think that this is also part of the psy-op, to distract critical thinkers into debating these guys.</p>

<p>I guess the more unrealistic the lie is the more fervently people will buy into it, and the more likely that the masses will discredit truth-seeking entirely.  This takes the tinfoil hat meme to another level entirely.</p>

<p>How do we snap someone out of this cult?  It seems like once someone believes the earth is flat they&#39;ve crossed over into a subjective view of reality where there are no universal truths so even basic science and math are somehow big conspiracies.  Ultimately it seems like a sales pitch for solipsism. </p>

<p>How about you just read up on what is of interest to you,  and skip over what offends you. </p>

<p>Censorship I  any way shape or form just plain sucks,  you want to believe in those (obviously fake)  NASA animated pictures of  a perfect sphere spinning with no cloud movements? </p>

<p>Just skip over those posts you find offending.  Others on this sub have  come to realize how phony that governmental organization referred to as NASA is (myself included). </p>

<p>You have not debunked anything friend,  extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof and many scientists have failed proving we are on a ball spinning at 1000km/hour going around the sun at 30km per second. </p>

<p>Come on dude.  Use your damn brain and ponder over the Implications of the above claims long and hard. </p>

<p>If you read and research the topic long enough,  you too will come to realize some aspects of science are no better than religion: complete bullshit held up with blind faith by a bunch of whackos that get offended by those who dare question their holy truth. </p>

<p>I already arrived at that conclusion, but it didn&#39;t lead me to a flat earth model of reality.  It led me to <a href="http://www.simulation-argument.com/">the simulation argument</a>.  That makes logical sense to me; flat earth does not.  </p>

<p>If your hypothesis is so true then explain to yourself how Buenos Aires to Cape Town is 3x further distance than Boston to Rome on your subjective reality map when they&#39;re roughly equidistant in the real world.  You don&#39;t need to explain to me what hoops you&#39;re jumping through to arrive at erroneous conclusions, do it for your own edification.</p>

<p>Anyway you&#39;ll can have fun arguing semantics, I have more important things to do than debunk you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Come on.  You went off in a totally different tangent,  and we can look into that one after if you want. Please tell me,  do you really believe earth is spinning on itself 1000km / hour,  and going around the sun at 30 km / sec. ..   66 000 an hour? </p>

<p>I am not right out saying the earth is flat...  I am saying those NASA pictures are faked and that the heliocentric model we are all brainwashed into blindly believing is far from being proven scientifically. 
As a matter of fact,  many scientists have spent their whole careers to prove this obvious tidbit and... failed. </p>

<p>See Airy&#39;s failure,  Michelson / Morley experiments among many others.</p>

<p>They need to have earth moving for special relativity to work. Tesla had it figured out over one hundred years ago and had called out Einstein on many anomalies in relativity.  Special relativity was brought out to take in Consideration the fact that no one was able to detect that earth is moving. </p>

<p>I will look into the points you brought up, I do know no commercial flights go from South America to Australia  or Africa to Australia... In other words,  navigation routes in the southern hemisphere seem to all transit into northern hemisphere before going to their destination.  Maybe there is  link between your observation and this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the current education system needs an overhaul.  I learned trigonomy first before taking a geometry class and my teacher got pissed off at me for using trigonomy to solve geometry problems, but I told him that it was easier and I didn&#39;t feel like wasting time doing geometry proofs.  Shortly thereafter I was advanced a grade in school because I was being too disruptive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trigonometry is useful, understandable and fairly mechanical.
Algebra and Calculus are in that same group... but Trig breaks a lot of people.</p>

<p>The problem with Geometry is that it is not STRICTLY as useful as any other branch of math. It wasn&#39;t taught to be useful... it was taught to teach logic in the ancient world.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not supposed to &quot;learn geometry&quot;, and the place they put it... in advanced math near the teenage years, is TOTALLY messed up.</p>

<p>Geometry should be taught around the first grade, at a time where kids actually find it easier, and at a time where the USEFUL part of geometry, the logical rigor, spacial reasoning aspect, methodological structure could help drive a life of learning and rational analysis.</p>

<p>In sudbury, democratic and montessori schools, children around the age of 7 routinely learn master high school geometry, from a simple book... I tried to help some people in Geometry who were A students (I was more of a C student - school sucks), and the A students were always fine in Trig, even though they had to study really hard... but there were some 4.0&#39;s that got RUINED in our Geometry Class, and it was pretty devastating to a couple people... and I remember thinking how lucky I was that I learned it from my older brother before I started the class.</p>

I can walk just about anyone through a statistical debunking... but when you tell people, &quot;Those two shadow cannot logically be parallel&quot;... if they&#39;re good at geometry, they&#39;ll think for a moment and either say, &quot;Eureka!&quot; or &quot;You are full of sh** because you can&#39;t assume the verticals are parallel.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say to ignore them unless you are good at Geometry, and unless you understand, from first principles, why it is impossible for the earth to be flat. There are a dozen proofs, but those who wish to debunk this should take it seriously.</p>

<p>More people believe in a flat Earth now than in 500bc or 1900ad, because it is refuted by Geometry, and people in the current day are suck at geometry.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve been banning anyone who disagrees and posts information against the flat earth theory, so you won&#39;t even find any opposition! It&#39;s honestly an insult to the intelligence of its subs there, as the two mods apparently don&#39;t believe it&#39;s users can handle the math and science that gets thrown at them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if I offended you, but I&#39;m not slinging insults, just stating my opinion. </p>

<p>If you took what I said as a personal attack then that&#39;s on you.  I meant no disrespect.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m unable to accept Scientology as truth, too.  A Scientologist may fervently believe that their worldview is correct, but that doesn&#39;t make it factually accurate.</p>

<p>One of the first signs of being sucked into a cult is developing a persecution complex.  You start to believe so strongly that you&#39;re right that you form the false belief that anyone who disagrees with you must be part of some great evil whose intention is to destroy you. </p>

<p>That is part of how cults work.  You&#39;re falling victim to manipulation tactics.</p>

<p>But hey I could be wrong.  I&#39;m willing to admit that.  </p>

<p>The difference between someone who genuinely seeks truth and someone who is in a cult is that a person in a cult is absolutely convinced that they&#39;re right and stops looking for answers.  Whereas a genuine truth seeker is perfectly willing to replace their current model of reality with one that makes more sense if it comes along.  </p>

<p>Flat earth does not make more sense than spherical earth.  It rejects 400+ years of modern math, science, and mountains of empirical evidence.  In essence you&#39;re throwing out your ability to trust anything at all.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not telling you what to believe.  Believe what you want.  I don&#39;t have all the answers.  But I certainly am not going to put blind faith into some dark ages philosophy that makes no logical sense.  Don&#39;t take it personally.</p>
