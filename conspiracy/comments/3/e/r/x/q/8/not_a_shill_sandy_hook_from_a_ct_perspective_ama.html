        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>EDIT:  Please try to remember that I came here to do an AMA.  I&#39;m not here to discredit or support any of your various theories or bits of evidence.  I am hoping people will ask me questions that are relevant to what it&#39;s like to be this close to Newtown when it happened.  Also what the CT mentality is like on the subject.  I seem to be getting a lot of people throwing stuff at me and are like &quot;Yeah, well what do you think about this!&quot;  Also, it seems to prove my point that it&#39;s very very hard for anyone to talk about Sandy Hook in this sub unless they are in 100% agreement to all conspiracy theories.  I&#39;ve come here to do a respectful AMA and I got a LOT of downvotes and hate right out of the box. This sub should be better than that.</em>  </p>

<p>OK.  I know this is a sensitive subject for a lot of people. And by that I mean sensitive on both sides.  A lot of people believe in a conspiracy, and I understand that, and a lot of people are strongly opposed to the idea of a conspiracy and I respect that too.  I am a CT resident who lives about 30 minutes from Newtown.  I was not involved in the Sandy Hook tragedy first-hand, meaning I wasn&#39;t involved with the responders, the the media, the morgue, the hospital, or really anything other than my location.  I did however go to work with a person who allegedly lost a daughter there.  I&#39;d like to take an opportunity to do an AMA if anyone is interested in what the local CT perspective is like.  My purpose here isn&#39;t to attempt to debunk anyone else&#39;s theories, but to simply state a few facts of what I know and experienced during that time.  I took an interest in doing this because I think the CT perspective is very different from other parts of the world.  I thought a more local perspective might help add to the information.  I have nothing to gain by doing this and if history repeats itself, I will just be downvoted to shit before anyone has had a chance to ask a real question.  So, there it is.  AMA.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ve been a redditor for like a month, with no post history prior to today. Nobody here knows you, and there&#39;s not really any way for you to reasonably verify your story without doxxing yourself (which you SHOULD NOT do, because it&#39;s against reddit&#39;s rules and a very foolish thing). The only thing we know about you is that you made a post about shills earlier. Which many would argue serves   only to prime the forum for this post. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re trying to accomplish by making this post; whether you&#39;re being genuine or whether you&#39;re intentionally trying to set up a &quot;look, we caught a shill!&quot; scenario with a very poorly done strawman (of sorts). </p>

<p>Either way, I don&#39;t think this is going to be productive. </p>

<p>As in 9/11 truth,  or JFK assassination,  bad faith distortions by the responsible authorities and their chosen agents  and highly intelligent analysis of scientific and professional databases are the low hanging fruit for sincere investigators to begin their basic testing of whether there is anything fishy or conspiratorial about the matter.</p>

<p>What you are bringing to the table is not the kind of information that can add much to such an investigation.     Within a particular company that you left before you could get to know the parent of the child who is now considered deceased,  you are aware that the company participated in the informing of its employees.    Got it.   That&#39;s interesting.    But not really in itself definitive of anything.    </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>it depends a lot on what conspiracy theory you may or may not adopt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This subreddit may come up with conspiracy theories from time to time,  but that is not the same as investigating the official or the common narrative to see if it holds water or not.    If the primary narrative(s) have little political charge,  little political value,   for example,  a narrative about what has now become verified by numerous sources and verified by extensive review,  and even admitted to by the participants:  the drugging scandals of various sports events,   that had an outcome where the facts surpassed most of the imaginings.</p>

<p>So,  there are several parts,  the key of which is that the official version at some point did not add up,  and that more disclosure would be necessary before heads or tails could be made of it.   There was another part where possible alternative scenarios to the official lie were considered,  but this was a passing phase,  and not all that important in the long run.   And finally,  we have the stage where  historians add further research the add to the nuances.</p>

<p>Yet we know now that for certain conversations,   the historians are steering clear.    We know what the consequences have been for those who did voice their lack of confidence in certain narratives.   Its is not without consequences.</p>

<p>No, no conflict at all. Wat?</p>

<p>This is what I was afraid of here. Circular BS. You claim ignorance when it suits you but then cite your own &quot;media reports that came out shortly afterwards&quot;.  You are not even aware of the glaring MSM inconsistencies that have been relevant here for a long time.</p>

<p>The one statement DOES NOT conflict with the other -- not even close. They are seperate matters. The witnesses could have obviously seen the shooter alive <em>prior</em> to him &quot;committing suicide&quot;, right? Just because the police show up and he&#39;s dead on the floor does not negate the fact that custodian Rick Thorne was cited as the witness who saw Adam Lanza running through the halls. Come on man.</p>

<p>Claiming ignorance on the points without first doing some research and responding to my original question is classic and predictable. &quot;Oh, I have no idea what you are talking about, can you provide me sources..&quot;</p>

<p>Totally false. The rifle he used at the school was a Bushmaster XM15, which is in fact an AR-15 .223 Remington/5.56 NATO derivative. He also carried two handguns, one of which he never fired. The gun he used to kill his <em>mother</em> was a different firearm from the XM15, which is probably where you got confused.</p>

<p>Technically true. He used a .225 Bushmaster, described as an AR-15 &quot;type&quot; weapon. A Saiga 12 shot gun was retrieved from the trunk of his car. The rifle was used for the assault. The handgun was used for the self inflicted wound.</p>

<p>Not true. One female staffer received a gunshot wound to the foot or ankle. According to this <a href="http://www.ct.gov/csao/lib/csao/Sandy_Hook_Final_Report.pdf">state police report</a>, 2 people were transported to Danbury hospital with injures.  Of those who died, several had multiple GSW&#39;s and those who didnt die instantly bled out before the scene could be made secure for EMS.</p>

<p>I listened to the event on the scanner. I thought I remembered 3 transports to Danbury, but my memory must be wrong.</p>

<p>I guess its fair to question official narratives, but the idea that several families&#39; tragedy is someones else&#39;s entertainment, I find hard to deal with. I also think its dangerous to conclude from inaccurate media hysteria reporting that a conspiracy exists.</p>

<p>I have family that knows victims families, and I know emergency personnel who were deeply affected by this incident.  </p>

<p>If this was a false flag to push gun control, it wasnt very successful.</p>

<p>The law was literally rammed through during the night without any form of public debate. CT &quot;due process&quot; at work.</p>

<p>The only dialog about the 2nd Amendment that is relevant is the part that says: &quot;shall NOT be infringed&quot;</p>

<p>Change = Infringement</p>

<p>It&#39;s the only Constitutional Right that <em>specifically</em> mentions that it can&#39;t be infringed upon. </p>

<p>Well, Ingraham  did say shootings (people shot), not murders. And FBI data can be inaccurate, partially due to GIGO from UCR data, and the fact that they dont even track police shootings. </p>

<p>I did like this, and agree:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Curbing gang violence is important, and it could be done pretty simply: stop enforcing the laws or legalize drugs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no question that our unsuccessful war on drugs skews the gun violence statistics.</p>

<p>However there are a lot of innocent victims of gang violence, and many neighborhoods are terrorized by this gun violence, just that they are not white affluent neighborhoods.</p>
