       Woke up this morning to a message saying I've been banned from the TopMindsOfReddit sub. I've never even posted there. In fact, until I got that message, I didn't even know the sub existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any clues?
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is I must have pwnd one of their mods last night in a debate. I was responding to a lot of disinformation from that nutter, Judy Wood.

       Why should you care if you are banned from a sub nobody knows exist? If a drooling retard is picking on you, you quietly walk away...you don't give him the attention he desires or he'll continue his actions.

       Buddy, this is unparalleled wisdom. Walking away from retards has always been my problem. I think that somewhere along the line I've been subconsciously indoctrinated into the notion that all people can be reasoned with if you can just find the correct way to make your point. However, my conscious mind knows that isn't true.

       How is Reddit going to keep "us" (them) safe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some users are more equal than others. How would you determine level of equality? I'm now banned from r/documentaries for posting Defamation upon a user recommendation and TIL won't allow me to post content based on direct quotes from links to government websites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somewhere, I've got some demerit points and some people get to make use of them. An assessment could be made to determine this and if shown to be correct, a full chart could be made showing which action warrants how many demerit points which then gets you censored from which subs.

       Interesting. It's amazing how fallible most humans are when it comes to fairness and neutrality. Once you challenge their beliefs, whether rightly or wrongly, many use unfair actions like trying to prevent you from speaking further. IMO everybody should be permitted to post their own opinion, but with one golden rule: if it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that you are trying to bolster your case by being dishonest or by using fallacy of any description, you should be removed from that particular debate. I'm not talking about a ban from the sub, but you should be prevented from participating in the specific debate.

       You will accomplish a lot more if there is a ban on deliberate dishonesty. The fact that it is permissible to come to forums and lie your tits off is why debate doesn't work in the first place as a solution to anything. Diplomacy simply cannot work unless deception and dishonesty are rooted out at the very beginning. I'm not talking about kicking someone out of a thread for exaggerating something, but the people whose primary purpose is dishonesty are not difficult to spot. They will be the consistent offenders.

       Hard to fight censorship with censorship, but verifying claims help with the long-term stability and development of this sub. It also helps season minds all around.

       No it isn't. I emphatically disagree with that claim. Censorship does not apply to deliberate propaganda.

       No it isn't. Propaganda is the distortion of, omission of, or rewriting of facts. Since facts are objective, propaganda is also objective.

       No, not in the same sense. But it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt. Like I said, when people repeatedly offend or attempt to change their arguments as the debate progresses.

       I think "deliberate" is how they are banning you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your sources or the strength of your argument don't matter, it's the reoccurring subject matter which allows them to say this guy is biased, or a deliberate propagandist. And then allows them to ban subjectively.
