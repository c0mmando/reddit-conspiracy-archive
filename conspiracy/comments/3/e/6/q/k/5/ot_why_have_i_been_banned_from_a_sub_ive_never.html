<p>My guess is I must have pwnd one of their mods last night in a debate. I was responding to a lot of disinformation from that nutter, Judy Wood.</p>

<p>Buddy, this is unparalleled wisdom. Walking away from retards has always been my problem. I think that somewhere along the line I&#39;ve been subconsciously indoctrinated into the notion that all people can be reasoned with if you can just find the correct way to make your point. However, my conscious mind knows that isn&#39;t true.</p>

<p>Show me proof that there were burned out cars surrounding the buildings, and then show me proof that they were burned out because the WTC buildings were zapped with something out of Star Wars.</p>

<p>Some users are more equal than others. How would you determine level of equality? I&#39;m now banned from r/documentaries for posting Defamation upon a user recommendation and TIL won&#39;t allow me to post content based on direct quotes from links to government websites.</p>

<p>Somewhere, I&#39;ve got some demerit points and some people get to make use of them. An assessment could be made to determine this and if shown to be correct, a full chart could be made showing which action warrants how many demerit points which then gets you censored from which subs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. It&#39;s amazing how fallible most humans are when it comes to fairness and neutrality. Once you challenge their beliefs, whether rightly or wrongly, many use unfair actions like trying to prevent you from speaking further. IMO everybody should be permitted to post their own opinion, but with one golden rule: if it can be proven beyond reasonable doubt that you are trying to bolster your case by being dishonest or by using fallacy of any description, you should be removed from that particular debate. I&#39;m not talking about a ban from the sub, but you should be prevented from participating in the specific debate.</p>

<p>You will accomplish a lot more if there is a ban on deliberate dishonesty. The fact that it is permissible to come to forums and lie your tits off is why debate doesn&#39;t work in the first place as a solution to anything. Diplomacy simply cannot work unless deception and dishonesty are rooted out at the very beginning. I&#39;m not talking about kicking someone out of a thread for exaggerating something, but the people whose primary purpose is dishonesty are not difficult to spot. They will be the consistent offenders.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. Propaganda is the distortion of, omission of, or rewriting of facts. Since facts are objective, propaganda is also objective.</p>
