<p>Gotta appreciate <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> mods for such a great job they are doing by keeping irrelevant posts of their sub.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3e8ipw/israel_declares_rock_throwing_as_terrorism_kids/">someone posted it again to worldnews</a> and this time nobody took it down (we did it <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>!) are we done here? maybe. maybe not.</p>

<p>Jeez. I can now see how you&#39;re totally misconstruing this but the mental gymnastics required are baffling... His statement is a reference to censorship ... not physical location. Claiming something is &quot;local news&quot; is a basis for censorship on <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>. That&#39;s where the reference comes from. By saying something like, &quot;negative press about Israel is &#39;local news&#39; on <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> too&quot; - he&#39;s not saying that <a href="/r/pics">/r/pics</a> mods literally live in Israel - but that they also have a pro-Israel bias...</p>

<p>What does that say about reddit if all of the moderation is controlled by Jews, as you&#39;re implying?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know why you would think that <strong>all</strong> of Reddit&#39;s moderation would need to be &quot;under the influence&quot;, as your strawman suggests. </p>

<p>However, it is well documented that Israel and her international Zionist support network are heavily involved in recruiting agents - <em>both volunteer and  paid</em> - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3cnq0x/hamas_has_been_holding_an_israeli_citizen_captive/csxrxx2">to vote and comment on Israel-related issues on social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit.</a> </p>

<p>Clearly Israel and her supporters see paying cash to <em>forum participants</em> as a &quot;good investment&quot;, as it helps to build their coordinated propaganda network. </p>

<p>Considering this, would in not be <em>far more cost effective</em> to build &quot;relationships&quot; with select groups of <strong>moderators</strong> in highly trafficked and influential forums? After all, these have the power to actively delete unfavorable comments and news articles, don&#39;t they?</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not saying that this is actually happening (god forbid!), but you have to ask, where could they get the most &quot;bang for their bucks&quot;?</p>

<p>From a strictly business perspective, <a href="http://www.canadianbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/c40cd2c24ec2908a36d325e671e2.jpeg">it would seem like a no-brainer.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Then he took his staff in his hand, chose five smooth stones from the stream, put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag and, with his sling in his hand, approached the Philistine.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Reaching into his bag and taking out a stone, he slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground.</p>

<p>So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him.</p>

<p>now lets take a deep look on that.</p>

<p>INCITING A RIOT - because you trowed a rock at a cop. Do you know what a riot is?</p>

<p>INCITING VIOLENCE AGAINST AN OFFICER - you are not INCITING violence. You are acting violently. You incite violence by calling an urge against something. You trowed a rock, just that.</p>

<p>ASSAULTING AN OFFICER - ok.</p>

<p>ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON - yeah... questionable.</p>

<p>ATTEMPTED MURDER OF A PEACE OFFICER - yeah... extremely questionable.</p>

<p>But nice try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. It is true the only thing that has hit my windshield were a few rocks off a construction truck, so perhaps my personal experience is limited.   But consider the following scenario...</p>

<p>You have a Palestinian family, who have had to relocate 3 times due to violence and unrest.  Prior to this they had a plot of Olive trees that has been in their family for at least 4 generations, but one day a bulldozer shows up and plows right through the middle of their land, and a fence is put up preventing the family from accessing their land like before.<br/>
Now the Father has to go a checkpoint and ask for permission to access the land. Sometimes access is granted, sometimes it isn&#39;t.  When access is granted he has to travel an extra 2 miles around 3 villages and double back just to get to his land.<br/>
The Father is extremely upset, he feels at the end of his rope, because that olive grove that his family has worked so hard to cultivate, and depend on so much is now being taken away, albeit directly.  The Father feels desperate and wants to do something to change his situation but he has no other viable options and does not encourage armed resistance because he has already lost 3 family members to resistance causes. 
The Father tells his Son to just help him cultivate the farm and learn from him. He would love to send his son to school, and there is an excellent school with a nice playground, and good food at a nearby settlement.  But because his son is Palestinian, he can not attend that school.  He has to travel 3 miles, getting on buses that are arbitrarily stopped and searched, in addition to walking through 5 checkpoints and hopping over the wall in several places, so sometimes he simply doesn&#39;t go because the family can&#39;t afford his bus fares. 
His son sees his father&#39;s anger, and wants to fight back, but his father tells him to NEVER use violence to fight and do not accompany the kids who throw rocks at the military.  One day his son is walking back home and is stopped by the IDF.  Earlier 4 kids threw rocks at the soldiers but got away running in the opposite direction of where the son is coming from.  The soliders are frustrated with the kids constantly throwing rocks and so arrest the son even though he never threw a rock at all.  He is arrested, questioned, force to sign a false confession statement, and under the new classification of law is considered to be a terrorist. He is sentenced to 9 years in jail.  </p>

<p>Now, his Father was already at the end of his role and full of anger and frustration.  So he reasons that he would rather die fighting, than to live his life being pushed around and abused and because he has lost his means of sustenance and his son, he joins a local resistance faction and sells a deed to his olive grove to someone using the money to purchase a rocket launcher, which he intends on using to strike against whomever he thinks locked up his son.  </p>

<hr/>

<p>Your comment was that such an extreme law would be good because it would be less rocks being thrown.  So perhaps it would be LESS rocks, but would it not perhaps create MORE missiles?!  </p>

<p>Laws like these are EXACTLY what contribute to terrorist acts (and don&#39;t confuse the term cause and contribute, as I didn&#39;t confuse the use of).  Obviously not every situation can be represented by that hypothetical situation.  But considering the events that ARE documented, and that HAVE been reported, one has to see the connection between excessive laws and more violent acts of resistance!<br/>
For goodness sakes.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I hear you.  I simply feel it is an act of terrorism, based on the definition.  Will they get 20 years in prison? no.  Will it fix the problem? no.  Will people ever actually look at the history of the region to see that Jews were kicked out of their ancestral homes and forced to move to Israel by all the arab countries? no.  Will people look and see how much aid that Israelis give to Palestinians despite the fact that the leaders constantly undermine a peaceful agenda? no.  Will people open up their eyes and see it is corrupt leadership tactics by terrorist organizations that brainwash Palestinians to hate the only people who could help them? No, but I hope people will open their eyes, and that day is coming soon.  The reason rockets are fired into israel in the first place is corrupt leadership.  The Palestinians need to fight against their leaders that are screwing them.  Information needs to be spread about putting away weapons.  Rocks included.  If you were the average Israeli citizen and you had to deal with the threat of being pelted with rocks every day, that is considered terrorism from a political perspective.  Until they learn to stop barbaric acts and stand up to their leaders like civilized men, they will continue to have problems and G-d will continue to make it harder for them.  I wish for peace in the entire region and pray for it 3 times a day.  Rocks hider progress.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well my implication is not that Israel alone is at fault.  There are VERY corrupt and twisted elements in the Palestinian community as well, not just limited to Hamas.<br/>
My illustration was just to emphasis how those laws will not hinder those acts, it will increase them.  There is NO doubt that the Jews have faced harsh persecution in many places of the world.  But realistically the idea that Israel is the &quot;only&quot; safe place for Jews on Earth is rather diluted and fictitious to me.  Perhaps Jews may feel safer in Israel, but it&#39;s not like Jews are being dismantled all over the Earth.  American Jews are doing just fine, the own businesses, are heads of banks, the make movies and pharmaceuticals etc.  They don&#39;t live in constant fear of reprisals because people here dislike them.  Your average person here could care less about who is a Jew and who isn&#39;t.  Because of the vast mixture of people here, outside of the Orthodox Jews who wear the traditional garb, there is literally NO physical indication that identifies who is a Jewish person.  Now that is not to say that there are no anti-Semites in existence in America because there are.  But a person who disagrees with Zionism, a person who dislikes certain Jewish people and a group of powerful people who wants to destroy the entire Jewish population are three different things.  I do agree that historically there is a direct connection between the Biblical history of Isreal and Jerusalem and its modern day implications of desired inheritance.  However, what is the difference between a Muslim who says, &quot;my holy book says drive out the infidels&quot;, and a Jewish person who says, &quot;my holy book says clear the land of alien residents and take possession of the land of your forefathers?&quot;.  On the surface there is NO difference.<br/>
Obviously it is a wider issue than that. But the idea that the Jewish people MUST go to Israel because it&#39;s the only &quot;safe&quot; place to go is simply not true.  Not only that but the reasoning is actually very detrimental. Look at Israel now. Is it &quot;safe&quot;? Well not really.  So if the idea is that Israel is the only safe place for the Jews but yet it still isn&#39;t safe, that concept will inevitably lead to more war because the cause of any attack will always be attribute to and OUTSIDE force.<br/>
My personal opinion is that the Jewish people have been manipulated and conditioned to thinking that 1) A Jewish state is the ONLY hope for peace. 2) Israel (the greater) is the ONLY safe place for Jews to exist. And 3) anti-semitism can be equated to any and all forms of criticism against the policies and practices of the Israeli government.  Furthermore, I&#39;m surprised that there isn&#39;t more critical talk of Israeli government in the political sense.<br/>
If a Jewish person came to let&#39;s say Wetumpka, Alabama back in the 1950&#39;s they would have very likely received persecution and discrimination from extremist organizations like the KKK simple because they would have been viewed as not part of a &quot;pure&quot; race.  This same cruel philosophy was practiced against Black people.  Now fast forward to the year 2015.  There are currently Sudanese refugees who are running to escape the harsh violence in Darfur, and they come to Israel to seek refuge.  However, they are not welcomed, and in fact there are efforts being made to drive them out, because they are not Jewish.  If an Israeli Jewish person came to the U.S.  right now and tried to find suitable living in say, Wetumpka Alabama but was denied because a religious leader told the people to not rent houses to Jewish people, the ADL would go absolutely bananas and the cries of anti-semitism would be heard far and wide and a 20 minute special would be on CNN the same day.<br/>
How can that be justified? How can some people so effortlessly recall the Holocaust when it comes to the justification of Israel living in fear and having their own &quot;safe&quot; place to live, but yet so quickly forget that they were ALSO refugees and were accepted into other countries?  The Israel government wants a pure Jewish state based on democracy, but also want other people in America to support it.  But could a Black American also settle in Israel? Could a Mexican American? To my knowledge, no, because they are not Jewish.  But if a Mexican American community rejected an Israeli person looking for a place to go because he wasn&#39;t Mexican American it would be anti-semitism. 
Perhaps I&#39;m missing something, but that just doesn&#39;t add up to me.  </p>

<p>I want to finish reading your reply but I&#39;m super busy right now. I made it up to the Biblical part that you mentioned. One main issue I have always dealt with is the idea that Muslims are supposed to drive out the infidels.  The problem with that even if it was true, is that Jerusalem is never mentioned in the Koran, not once.  It is only considered a holy site because it is where Muhammed ascended to heaven.  I know that sounds a little harsh, but it is fact.  Jerusalem isn&#39;t mentioned, it&#39;s just where someone died.  America is nice to jews, but unfortunately it is the modern day Egypt, as mor ethan half the jews have assimilate into america society and are no longer recmotely observant or religious.  Heritage gone.  G-d&#39;s will is just being kicked around by most unfortunately.  It is unfortunately what happens to Jews when they stop learning and keeping mitzvot (commandments).  It says Jews are not supposed to adopt the lifestyles of our neighbors in the Torah, and it the only thing that allowed the nation to leave egypt in the first place.  4/5 of all the Hebrews died during the plague of darkness in Egypt (most people arent aware of this).  These are people that were so heavily assimilated that they would not turn back to G-d&#39;s laws.  America has been a nice haven for Jews, but we are nearing the End of Days, and it is time to return Home.  they allow nonjews to live there and always have.  The common person, including settlers just want peace.  They need to move where it is afforable.  Nobody is kicking anybody out, just moving in.  It happens in the US all the time.  People come into a place and the scene changes,  that isn&#39;t bad, that is just life.  I know it&#39;s over simplified, but these are just people.  If it was really such a problem and not more of a political propaganda issue, then the actual palestinian state (JORDAN) should be taking care of all these people.  Jews take care of other jews, of all kinds, black white, yemenite, iranian, american, south african...it&#39;s just what they do.  If the muslims really cared about peace and their brothers, they would show it by not killing eachother.   I will gldly discuss this less bluntly when i havemore time, cuz i am curious to the other side, and i know life isnt fair for everybody.  I want to end this with some base info on the start if islam: <a href="http://kenspiro.com/article/history-crash-course-42-rise-of-islam/">http://kenspiro.com/article/history-crash-course-42-rise-of-islam/</a></p>
