        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">69</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-07-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/lucycohen.html">lucycohen</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>They are causing a form of Cancer known as a <a href="http://www.webmd.com/cancer/sarcoma">Sarcoma</a>, in felines they have been named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine-associated_sarcoma">vaccine-associated sarcomas</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.wsava.org/">World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA)</a> now argues against needless vaccination and supports  in support of <strong>&quot;the development and use of simple in-practice tests for determination of seroconversion (antibody) following vaccination.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_vaccination">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_vaccination</a></p>

<p>That would be great if they could develop the same test for humans to take away the risk of needless &#39;booster&#39; vaccines.  Also sometimes a person is born with antibodies, so the vaccine is a completely unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>Professional bodies are now recommending that cats are vaccinated less to reduce the risk of Cancer.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;In recent years, vaccination has become a controversial topic among veterinarians and pet owners. Studies citing specific adverse reactions and general consequences for long-term health and immunity are both causing professional bodies to recommend reduced frequency in feline vaccination.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_vaccination">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_vaccination</a></p>

<p><strong>&quot;For the last several years, veterinarians have noticed an increase in the incidence of sarcoma formation at commonly used feline vaccine sites.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.avma.org/About/AlliedOrganizations/Pages/sitercmnd.aspx?utm_source=prettyurl&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=redirect&amp;utm_term=vafstf-sitercmnd-asp">https://www.avma.org/About/AlliedOrganizations/Pages/sitercmnd.aspx?utm_source=prettyurl&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=redirect&amp;utm_term=vafstf-sitercmnd-asp</a></p>

<p>They suspect it&#39;s the Aluminum in vaccines which is causing Cancer, oh dear, it&#39;s in human vaccines too!</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Two possible factors for the increase of VAS at this time were the introduction in 1985 of vaccines for rabies and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) that contained aluminum adjuvant, and a law in 1987 requiring rabies vaccination in cats in Pennsylvania.[3] In 1993, a causal relationship between VAS and administration of aluminum adjuvanted rabies and FeLV vaccines was established through epidemiologic methods, and in 1996 the Vaccine-Associated Feline Sarcoma Task Force was formed to address the problem&quot;</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine-associated_sarcoma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine-associated_sarcoma</a></p>

<p>Researchers are already voicing their concerns about the dangers of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCzdliixnmI">Aluminum in human Vaccines</a>, but the CDC have been shown to be far too corrupt, in bed with Big Pharma money, so they will only ever push more human vaccines, not less, and will never admit to the dangers.  Fortunately we have whistleblowers coming out, <a href="http://www.morganverkamp.com/august-27-2014-press-release-statement-of-william-w-thompson-ph-d-regarding-the-2004-article-examining-the-possibility-of-a-relationship-between-mmr-vaccine-and-autism/">like this doctor</a> who admitted that he was part of the CDC vaccine/Autism cover-up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to be technical, the inflammatory response in cats is very different. Cats are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC340241/">&quot;uniquely&quot;</a> susceptible to oxidative stressors, which is probably the foundation of these sarcomas. It&#39;s the same reason they&#39;re allergic to acetaminophen and humans aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>I no longer vaccinate my cats according to the recommended schedule, but these causal factors definitely aren&#39;t 1:1 across mammals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My vet told me 20 years ago that he doesnt vacc his own pets. But when i pressed him for answers as to why he said he keeps people on the program because he at least gets to give animals their yearly checkup. He said he hates seeing animals coming in on deaths door with a disease that could have been treated easily if he had caught it earlier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I no longer vaccinate any of my animals. They are inside dogs and a cat; one dog is 18, the other is 8 and I have a new kitten that&#39;s a year. All are very healthy other than my old dog having some hearing and vision loss. My 8 year old dog is highly allergic to the rabies shot, the first time she got it she almost died and that&#39;s what sparked me to stop. </p>

<p>I had a cat many years ago die from a cancerous tumor that developed on his hip. He was one that was always up to date on his vet visits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great to see someone who&#39;s worked this out!  The unvaccinated pets live a lot longer, I remember someone gave one of my cats 4 vaccines in one go without asking permission, the cat went into a deep sleep with unusual breathing, when they work up their personality was changed forever, very nervous and unhappy, after previously being such a happy and care-free animal.</p>
