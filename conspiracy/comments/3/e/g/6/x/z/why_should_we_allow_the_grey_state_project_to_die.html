    <div class="md"><p>Do you mean Mitch Heil, his ex-business partner? This <a href="http://www.twincities.com/crime/ci_27343442/three-bodies-found-apple-valley-home">TwinCities news article</a> says they broke off their business partnership 3 months before David Crowley&#39;s death. Mitch claims David was the brains, and he was merely an assistant. In whichever case, if there is a script, and a last will and testament, then there&#39;s a way. Something to do with copyrights and lawyers. Hello, Mitch Heil, are you reading??? </p>

<p>Or have we misinterpreted, and OP is actually looking for screenplay writers to conspire on a new script?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A realistic film or tv show would call for lots of modern military and police props, which the Pentagon and police would naturally 86 after reading that they are the bad guys or losers. This alone seems the most formidable obstacle to reaching actual production, no matter how good the script, and most especially if it&#39;s genuinely compelling. Rather, it appears that sparsely populated, military &amp; police conflict-free, end_of_times films like <em>The Road</em> or <em>Book of Eli</em> or <em>Mad Max</em> seem more likely to reach fruition. </p>

<p>Otherwise, maybe an illustrated series might sell best, first, eg, like <em>Walking Dead</em>? </p>

<p>In whichever case, one can only wonder what David Crowley actually finished.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having read <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/02/06/shades-of-gray-tragic-deaths-of-gray-state-filmmaker-david-crowley-family-still-a-mystery/">a bit of backstory</a>, the most troubling question is why his parents or brother didn&#39;t call police at some point during the 2 weeks that Raniya, Komel and David Crowley lay dead in their home during the Christmas  / New Year holidays? Further, the brother claims he left Christmas packages on the front porch sometime <strong>after</strong> Christmas Day, but only saw their dog, Paleo, in the front window, although the neighbor who eventually found the bodies was able to spot them through the front window. I mean, that&#39;s a sketchy enough stretch right there. There was allegedly a back door ajar, though I doubt there were any traceable footprints after two weeks.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t strike you weird that the names of the 3 principal talents involved with &quot;Gray State&quot; are:</p>

<p>David CROWLEY - Director &amp; Writer</p>

<p>Mitch HEIL - Director of Photography</p>

<p>Danny MASON - Lead Actor</p>

<p>Is that not a triumvirate of suspicious monickers? Almost like a joke, in fact? </p>

<p>Google &quot;Gray State&quot; and &quot;Psy-Op.&quot; You&#39;ll get this: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html">http://www.activistpost.com/2013/01/is-gray-state-psy-op.html</a></p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to agree with it, but the writer makes some good points. 1st time I watched the trailer, frankly, I didn&#39;t even watch it to the end. It was so dark, oppressive and needlessly violent. Didn&#39;t sit right with me, didn&#39;t seem like a smart investment for any filmmaker -- without hope, it&#39;s just a snuff film. Nobody&#39;s going to pay to see that movie, &amp; it sure as hell looked expensive.</p>

<p>Just my hypothesis, but I&#39;m sticking with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone realize that some of the dichotomy the film purports are incorrect?</p>

<p>The part where the film addresses market capitalism and then champions it are terribly misinformed.  Market capitalism is NOT your path to freedom just the same as socialism is not the way.  Market capitalism absolutely is a direct route to the existence of elitism and absolutely creates an environment where the division of rich vs. poor grows.  </p>

<p>One cannot say that innovation, creativity and gumption allows the poor man to ascend to the commanding heights.  It isn&#39;t true when one considers momentum and inertia as applied to existing history.</p>

<p>Yeah, the current control apparatus is fatally flawed, but opening a &quot;free market&quot; as opposed to &quot;status quo&quot; as defined in the film is an incomplete analysis of the problem.</p>

<p>Cultural mollification has happened/continues to happen.</p>

<p>So what? Smart people know this and smarter people have tried, try, and will try to slow that part down.</p>

<p>Saying the free market will defeat socialism is as misguided as believing in a red vs. blue political philosophy here in the USA.</p>

<p>Personal agency and responsibility needs to be encouraged in future political figures who can then operate as social architects to staff a government that can install the right people in positions that help the people steamrolled by political inertia and also reign in those who have designs on elitism.</p>

<p>I agree with the statement that people shouldn&#39;t unthinkingly surrender their personal thoughts and opinions to the &quot;experts&quot; because the &quot;experts know better.&quot;  </p>

<p>However, there needs to be significant house-cleaning to define what knowing better even is, and what an expert suggests.  Critical thinking on a macro level actually IS improved by sending qualified people with a correctly dialed moral compass to places where they can acquire more specialized knowledge to continue the momentum of socially responsible progress.  </p>

<p>And, just a final note, &quot;socially responsible&quot; does not mean that everyone succeeds, but it also does not mean that the markets alone dictate who should either.</p>

So I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a hopeless cause.</p>
