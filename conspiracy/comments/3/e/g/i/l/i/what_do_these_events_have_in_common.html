<p>What do these events have in common?</p>

<p>9/11 World Trade Center, Pentagon</p>

<p>London Subway Bombing (7/7/05)</p>

<p>Oklahoma City Bombing</p>

<p>The Estonia Catastrophe (852 dead)</p>

<p>Norway Oslo Shootings (77 dead)</p>

<p>Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting</p>

<p>Aurora Colorado Theater Shooting</p>

<p>Taft Union High School (January 10, 2013)</p>

<p>Boston Marathon Bombing (April 15, 2013)</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

<p>Live &quot;terror&quot; drills were conducted same day, same scenario. They were on location or very close to the event. </p>

<p><strong>MSM ignores these facts completely</strong></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Well this is a coincidence - <a href="http://www.wmur.com/news/emergency-drill-held-in-portsmouth/34342260">Emergency Terror drill held in Portsmouth, NH (TODAY)</a> in the video within the article, they show the crisis actors, they call them &quot;Actors&quot; and they explain and show what these actors are doing. Nice.</p>

<p>Bullshit, this is a totally fabricated claim.</p>

<p>In the case of Sandy Hook for instance there was no <em>live terror drill</em> being carried out anywhere near Sandy Hook, as people in this subreddit love to claim.</p>

<p>In reality a <em>class</em> was being held in Bridgeport, CT: over 100 miles away from Sandy Hook. At the class participates sat at desks and learned how to respond to mass casualty events. </p>

<p>These events are also totally meaningless because these types of classes happen in virtually every state at least once a week. Wherever you are right now I can guarantee there is a class like this happening within 100 miles of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up active shooter training. It&#39;s every where. Going live is when they train the media to be a part of it. So the media practices conveying these stories. It&#39;s easy to experiment and say it&#39;s real while blocking all real physical evidence. Open caskets? Also, in a world full of surveillance, not having info is a lie. How did no one record events on phones and how did the nsa not steal it? They have camera that cover the majority of motor ways and street intersections. It&#39;s obvious its conditioning experiments to see if you can create a fake scenario real. Maybe you have to kill some children, but it&#39;s for the greater good. They can turn your camera on remotely. They can listen as a high percent of phones and devices are in active record mode 24/7. So Ruhr lack of physical evidence in a surveillance state proves the drills are no different than the NCIS show...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That video was taken very early into the Sandy Hook response - its likely police went to every school in the area to make sure the gunman had not moved to a different school or had an accomplice given how close the schools are. Initial media reports suggested that Lanza attended middle school there, so there was concern that he would target them as well. </p>

<p>Of course this was probably explained by the reporters when the video was shown, but whoever uploaded that video muted the sound on purpose to cover that up. </p>

<p>What do you think that video proves anyway? If Sandy Hook was a staged drill why have officers rushing to a <em>different school?</em> Wouldn&#39;t that be blatantly obvious? </p>

<p>The distance between Sandy Hook and Bridgeport is irrelevant, they are separate cities separated by rural towns. Like I sad the initial claim that a <em>live terror drill</em> was being held there is a totally fabricated and untrue claim. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. The cover is very important - particularly because it means that any information discovered which shows prior knowledge can be rationalised away. This is not possible without the drill excuse.</p>

<p>I think the way it works is that the drill is genuine, 99% of participants are just doing their job. However, there is a sneaky add-on to the drill (aka &quot;the real purpose&quot;) that only 1% know about. Most people will therefore be genuinely dumbfounded (and defensive afterwards) when the drill goes live.</p>

<p>I wonder what &quot;the Great Randi&quot; would say about the odds of this happening purely by chance?</p>

<p>All I&#39;d bet is that Zionist Snopes would swear they were all purely coincidence, of course.</p>
