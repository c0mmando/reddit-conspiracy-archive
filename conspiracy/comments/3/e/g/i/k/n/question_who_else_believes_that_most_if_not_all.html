    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  If you have a couple of hundred million people and give them a free pass to buy guns and ammo.  Then make their lives fucking intolerable, it doesn&#39;t take too much for one of these to &#39;lose his grip&#39; and blow people away.  In fact, with just how miserable life is for millions of U.S. citizens it&#39;s a miracle these aren&#39;t happening every day.  The more the screws are turned on your lives, the more these things will happen.  I&#39;ll tell you how you can stop all of these mass shootings.  Reduce the working week to 30 hours, increase the min wage to $20 per hour, if there is a jobs shortage the Gvt should just invent really easy, pleasant jobs that pay lots of cash, invest in the arts and entertainment massively, plant flowers in every City, make everywhere fucking beautiful.  Throw big free parties for everyone to go to, organize special events that are inclusive for all.  Put positive TV programs on and outlaw violence on TV.  Make every citizen feel they are an asset to the nation and to the world, make sure nobody is friendless, that every person is cared for.  Increase the happiness of every person, once this is achieved you&#39;ll have zero mass murders.</p>

<p>U.S. Society is the polar opposite of this.  Everyone is made to feel they are a liability - global warming, it&#39;s all your fault!  Racism - all your fault!  Banking crisis because you borrowed too much!  Lack of food because you eat too much!  Lack of water because you use too much!  Etc.  Then the TV bombards you with images of murder, rape, pedophiles, gluttony, greed, selfishness &#39;greed is good&#39;, lust etc.  Then you are told &#39;you have a problem - go to your doctor and let him find what it is&#39; and you&#39;ll be told you&#39;re bipolar, depressed, anxious, stressed, or one of the other five billion disorders you can have.  Whilst anyone who can&#39;t find a job is given food stamps and treated like fucking shit!  Having celebrities rubbed in your face every second of every day all screaming at you that &quot;you don&#39;t count, your pointless, worthless life means nothing&quot;!  And you wonder why someone shoots people?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s almost a pattern to a lot of these shootings, it was more obvious around the time of the Virginia shipyard shooting. But a story like that seems to break out about every six weeks. Adam Curry and John C Dvorak call it the &quot;six week cycle&quot; on their podcast. They hypothesize that it&#39;s the FBI&#39;s way of staying relevant so their budget doesn&#39;t get cut. You&#39;ll notice that the gunman almost never makes it out alive, and that the number 33 is prevalent in the stories. I don&#39;t know the significance of 33, but it keeps showing up. 
Dvorak and Curry also touch a little bit on pharmaceuticals. The gunman is always diagnosed as troubled or disturbed, but only after the fact, and they never mention what drugs he&#39;s on. I personally think it&#39;s the antidepressants. I mean, one of the side effects for Abilify is schizophrenic tendencies. They never mention the drugs on the news, but then they go to commercials and what&#39;s the only thing being advertised? Anti depressants and boner pills. In conclusion, it might be the FBI trying to maintain their budget, or it&#39;s just people going crazy from too many pharmaceutical drugs, or maybe a mixture of both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it takes like 5 minutes of research to see that something is amiss in these events.</p>

<p>There are way too many things to keep track of when it comes to false flags (or hoaxes), but if you haven&#39;t been following the Sandy Hook Saga lately, look up Wolfgang Halbig&#39;s Sandy Hook Foia request. These happened in the last few months. There&#39;s a part 1, part 2, and closing arguements on the youtube channel Mert Melfa.</p>

<p>I recommend watching all of it but some highlights:
We learned that there are no permission slips on record for the 26 students from the sandy hook choir who went to sing at the 2013 superbowl.</p>

<p>Also, several of the witnesses were instructed not to attend by defense attorney Monte E. Frank.</p>

<p>22 units were sent to Sandy Hook even though the 911 call was classified as medium priority.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s blatantly obvious to anyone who isn&#39;t comatose, as far as I am concerned.  The reference to Sandy Hook in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> wasn&#39;t exactly subtle.  Then again, I instinctively realised that 9/11 was bullshit pretty much as it was happening.</p>

<p>The psychopaths don&#39;t really need to care about anyone knowing that these things are false flags, because they know that the majority of the population (who are psychologically incapable of tolerating the idea that their supposedly loving parents within the government could actually be such monsters) will keep those few of us who aren&#39;t cowards in line.</p>

<p>That is the single biggest problem; the fact that the majority are willfully naive adult children, who insist on believing that politicians are actually good people, rather than the sort of literally inhuman psychopaths that the rest of us know them to be.  I suspect that that is the main thing which people like David Cameron are really terrified of; the idea that someone out there knows what he truly is.  Some of us know who the real terrorists are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that David cameron is saying ct&#39;s are just as dangerous as terrorists really shows you where this is heading. I&#39;m actually really surprised that people HERE are still arguing about whether or not these are actual false flags. I mean fuck, it&#39;s at the point where if you bring up crisis actors people call you a retard. IMO whenever there are lone gunman massacres it should be treated as a false flag until proven otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is any conspiracy, it&#39;s about getting the National Guard armed so that we become desensitized to seeing armed soldiers in our communities. It&#39;s not just recruiting offices. For a number of the state Guards who are arming, it applies to all National Guard facilities. This includes armories, training centers, recruiting offices, and HQ camps. While not all states have armed their Guards, <a href="http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/56/a5/af984ac34e358b548ea5b6eca478/140818dataguardmap-graphic.25.53%20PM.png">here is a map</a> of the National Guard&#39;s footprint in the US.</p>
