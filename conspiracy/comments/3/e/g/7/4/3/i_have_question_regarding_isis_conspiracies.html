<p>I just think that if the CIA or something of that nature was truly behind this, then they would have to be pretty knowledgeable in regards as to how to pretend to be Islamic.

<p>Either way these CIA/Mossad trained fanatics are <a href="https://twitter.com/rezaaslan/status/515171747562541057/photo/1">disobeying their own caliph.</a>. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a broader plan to balkanize oil rich regions for Eretz Israel and keep them under perpetual state of conflict by providing them with weapons created by USA and west.</p>

<p>Goal is to convince enough right wing fanatics in the west to support this war on phoney terror. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is not an actual Salah/Salat prayer (depending on the country - pronunciation) where facing towards Mecca is requirement in order to perform it correctly </p>

<p>It is an act after something happens and you are thankfull to God - maybe not a best example but you will see this in sport often , after a fighter wins a fight or a player scores a goal (football/soccer) and similar , they do not face Mecca (unless by accident in most cases) but just drop down to the ground and express their gratitude to Allah/God</p>

<p>as far as I know of course , others may add or correct my post</p>

<p>Really? Are you aware that in the bin Laden &quot;confession&quot; video, and pretty much every subsequent video thereafter, he wears rings on his fingers? The wearing of jewellery is expressly forbidden in Wahhabist Islam, and at no point prior to the &quot;confession&quot; video did bin Laden ever wear any form of jewellery.</p>

<p>I think you mistake the intent behind false flag actions. Their perpetrators do not need them to be perfect. They just need them to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a fairly interesting question. According to the hadith reported by Ahmad 5/45, al-Haakim 4/291. Muhammad(pbuh) would prostrate <strong>facing the Qiblah</strong> when performing Sajdat ash-Shukr(translates as prayer of gratitude/thankfulness).</p>

<p>As muslims are ought to live a life exemplary to that of Muhammad(pbuh), we are <strong>obliged</strong> to face the Qiblah when performing this prayer. Seeing these &quot;muslims&quot; prostrate like that, is extremely counter-intuitive. As we muslims are reminded <strong>every time</strong> in the Mosque to make sure we are all facing the same direction in a near-perfect line. To even think that whatever these &quot;muslims&quot; are doing is acceptable is blasphemous, and absolutely not a trivial mistake.</p>

<p>Back to the context at hand. If you wish to read more about ISIS, please feel free to read this thread I started a month ago. It may offer you some insight.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bpn04/regarding_isis_by_a_muslim/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3bpn04/regarding_isis_by_a_muslim/</a></p>

<p>For others having a general interest in the <em>islamic</em> way of how wars are waged, feel free to read the Book of War, which describes the binding etiquette of how muslims must behave during wartimes. By having knowledge about this matter, you can quickly discern what behavior is islamic, and what behavior is unislamic. This will help you reveal which parties are driven by islamic interests, and which parties are not. Parties which are funded and aided by Western purpose <em>never</em> adhere to Islamic principles of warfare, and are thus easily unmasked. Stopping these forces of evil is however an entirely different matter, as asymetrical guerilla forces are tenacious to deal with when world-leaders conspire against you in secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;ISIS&quot; will blow your brains out on the spot for dropping your arms during prayer or kneeling the incorrect number of times. Facing the wrong fucking direction during prayer is certainly suspicious, but then so was their collaborating with IDF in the Golan, using Israeli drones and medical help and targeting Sunni Muslims in occupied Palestine before the Jews subjugating them.</p>

<p>The name &quot;ISIS&quot; alone goes against all they allegedly stand for.</p>

<p>Not really.  The CIA/Mossad is/are sloppy.  (Just look at 9/11 or Charlie Hedbo.)  It&#39;s much more likely that poor CIA/Mossad mismanage people than an actual Muslim would face the wrong way during prayer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a Muslim myself and you can only perform any sajda facing towards the qibla. You cannot perform a sajda towards another person or living thing with the intention you are doing it to them, if you understand what I mean. Any sajidas are for Allah only. </p>

<p>There was a story circulating around my friends on whatsapp about a woman claiming to have escaped from isis. She said she was made to pray 6 times a day and made to read a full Quran every day and if she didn&#39;t she would be raped. We laughed at this because we only pray 5 times a day, and to finish an entire Quran in a day is really hard - you&#39;d have to be really proficient at reading the Arabic to do this. There are 30 chapters in the Quran and my husband can pray one chapter in about 45mins.. X30 = 1,350 mins /60= 22hours and 30mins. Haha. I suppose a hafiz(someone who has memorised the entire Quran by heart) could read a chapter in around 25-30mins. It&#39;s almost as if the cia or the people responsible for Isis are mocking Muslims. They know we know they&#39;re making t up so obviously but the people that listen to MSM take these stories as truthful. </p>

<p>To me Isis are a funny group.. Muslims that follow the right path (Sunnis of a particular belief that we follow the Quran AND the teachings of our prophet Muhammad s.aw AND of the Sahabas (followers)) don&#39;t consider Isis as Muslims. We don&#39;t know what they are but based upton their beliefs they cannot be Muslims. It is not okay to rape. It is not okay to murder innocent people regardless of religion they follow. You can&#39;t blow yourself up and expect jannah (heaven). You can only kill someone if they attack you first. Our prophet s.a.w tried to stay away from violence against his oppressors as much as he could, and we must follow this example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have two options that I can see.  The videos are legitimate, and these people just somehow forgot which direction to face after a lifetime of always praying in the exact same way (this seems impossible).  Or the videos are fake, and whoever organized them forgot this little detail or purposely had them face opposite ways for some reason (this seems very probable).</p>
