    <div class="md"><p>From the research I&#39;ve done, id say Directed Energy is the future technology that will change everything. From weather mod, to voice to skull, to efficient healing, it can literally do almost anything. These kinds of technology are being developed leaps and bounds without that info being transferred to the public sector. </p>

<p>Think about HAARP. Its an amazing accomplishment that we should all be teaching our children about. We should be explaining directed energy to kids and getting them excited about it. Instead, if anyone brings up HAARP, you&#39;re labeled a crazy person. You&#39;d think with a culture obsessed with new tech, everyone would be interested (in a positive way) in these new inventions.  For some reason (disinfo), people are not interested.</p>

<p>Also, the book Project Soul Catcher by Robert Duncan is an amazing book on the subject of suppressed technology breakthroughs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A similar perhaps more easily answerable (and useful) question is (in my opinion):  </p>

<p>How advanced do you think hidden knowledge is?  </p>

<p>A subset of this question would be: how much disinformation is out there which shields hidden knowledge or redirects individuals away from available knowledge.  </p>

<p>Because, in the end, with hidden knowledge emerges hidden technology and classified weapons.</p>

<p>It goes past personal beliefs to make the statement &quot;We don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know.&quot;  I always get into pointless arguments about this statement, but if you come to see it as a truth, then these questions are unanswerable, at least to any useful certainty.    </p>

<p>My only advice would be to look back in history and determine how much hidden knowledge/technology was then revealed.  Even then, we don&#39;t know if our present situation will mirror that of the past without good reason (other than &quot;history is bound to repeat itself,&quot; which is in no way a guarantee.)  </p>

<p>As for my opinion, I think there is a good amount of hidden technology which is completely out of the sphere of the world wide internet.  Individuals with hidden technology would know better than to risk their most prized possession:  Hidden knowledge, which as established, leads to hidden technology.    </p>

<p>I also think there is an inordinate amount of false knowledge espoused as truth, which is keeping the truth from reaching critical mass in public spheres.  In a more controversial vane, I believe many of the modern theistic religions (emphasis on Abrahamic ones) are examples of these.  Anything that answers questions will quell the human need to seek a better more truthful answer (knowledge.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascinating insight.  But I don&#39;t necessarily believe that &quot;there would be enough for all of us,&quot; is a universal truth.  So I&#39;ll pick an example which can easily disprove it.</p>

<p>Suppose a team of N top secret scientists (whatever that means) figures out extracting energy from the cosmos in a previously unknown way.  Details about the invention are not necessary for the discussion, except that <strong>it appears to be infinite based on all available estimates</strong>.  In my mind, this <em>is</em> the infinite energy invention, since I do believe in basic conservation laws, but that is just a side note to the discussion.  </p>

<p>Three things come to mind, given such an invention was born by our lovely human brethren:  </p>

<p><strong>Q1)</strong> What would the effect on existing businesses and societal paradigms be?  Would they reduce the power/control of those whom already have most of it?   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Tremendous effect, almost guaranteed negative on businesses and governmental control, with an almost guaranteed positive effect on the (currently blind) general populous... as for power/control reduction of those who have it?  A resounding Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Q2)</strong> How much money would it take to recreate the invention in the places necessary for the global, or some subset of the population?    </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> In the early stages, perhaps an inordinate amount of money and time, whereas if the secret if kept and harnessed while cost is brought down, the technology can be released, say, 50 years from now, with much greater ease and understanding.  The &quot;understanding&quot; part brings us to my final point.    </p>

<p><strong>Q3)</strong> What would happen if 7 billion at once started tapping this energy source?  Perhaps its not &quot;unlimited&quot; since the scientists are tampering with a partially unknown secret of the universe.    </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Who knows, unless complete knowledge of the technology and repercussions of it are known; think fracking as a modern example.  </p>

<p>So after getting through those 3 points (and there are certainly more obvious and complex/hidden ramifications to discuss) it&#39;s my opinion there might be a real reason to hide such an invention from the populous <strong>if you had great power and control</strong> to lose.  Would you generally agree or disagree?  And if you&#39;d like, you can also respond to each of the three points separately.</p>

<p>Matthew 10:26 for anyone interested</p>

<p>I like how you used the Bible here.  I think there are very valuable gems to be found in religious texts.  But I also am enraptured by Alan Watts description in The Book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Yet when you get in on the inside of almost any standard-brand religion, you wonder what on earth the hush was about. Surely The Book I have in mind wouldn&#39;t be the Bible, &quot;the Good Book&quot;—that fascinating anthology of ancient wisdom, history, and fable which has for so long been treated as a Sacred Cow that it might well be locked up for a century or two so that men could hear it again with clean ears. There are indeed secrets in the Bible, and some very subversive ones, but they are all so muffled up in complications, in archaic symbols and ways of thinking, that Christianity has become incredibly difficult to explain to a modern person. That is, unless you are content to water it down to being good and trying to imitate Jesus, but no one ever explains just how to do that.  To do it you must have a particular power from God known as &quot;grace,&quot; but all that we really know about grace is that some get it, and some don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The standard-brand religions, whether Jewish, Christian, Mohammedan, Hindu, or Buddhist, are—as now practiced—like exhausted mines: very hard to dig. With some exceptions not too easily found, their ideas about man and the world, their imagery, their rites, and their notions of the good life don&#39;t seem to fit in with the universe as we now know it, or with a human world that is changing so rapidly that much of what one learns in school is already obsolete on graduation day.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on your other posts, you seem religious, or at least quite learned of it based on your very relevant cited passage (please correct me if i&#39;m wrong.)  I am highly curious how you respond to his argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>AI comment software sounds intriguing ... especially that the 2005 presentation date was already 10 years ago.  Crazy.  If you read my other posts, I am quite on board with the sentiment &quot;We don&#39;t know what we don&#39;t know,&quot; so...who knows?</p>

<p>And yea, that Hound demo, although appearing impressive to the lay person, it&#39;s doing little (depending on your personal definition) to nothing with regards to creativity and generation of novel ideas ... so those demos won&#39;t be too impressive to someone who understands the basics of natural language parsing, objectifying and data scraping ( and simple application of formulas, mostly calendar in the above link ) from encyclopedic resources.  Complex, but not &quot;revolutionary&quot; knowledge in my honest opinion.</p>

<p>P.S Your pun goes noted and is appreciated. (unless your phone auto correct did that ... haha)</p>

I believe in other forms of intelligent life for sure though.
