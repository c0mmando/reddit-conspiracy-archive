<p>Within an hour of the shooting they had state, local and city police, FBI, DHS, District Attorneys Office, ATF, and both the Mayor and Governor all on the scene?</p>

<p>Two witnesses on CNN who were in the theater next to the theater where the shooting occurred reported hearing NO gunshots, but heard the people screaming next door and then the fire alarm went off?</p>

<p>Edit: The amount of trolls showing up to this post is even more suspicious. If you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a conspiracy, then why are you even here? To voice your belief in the official story? Great, then go join the conversation over at <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a></p>

<p>The thing that ties these things together, in my opinion, is an effort to obfuscate issues and drag down discussion. </p>

<p>What the individual posters&#39; motivations are for doing so isn&#39;t my point. Just that strategies are recognizable. </p>

<p>Of course, sometimes it isn&#39;t a strategy. Some people are just not as smart as they think they are and have a tendency to be obsequious. </p>

<p>The fallacy requires, by definition, a universal truth to be hidden by the claim (e.g. a person from Scotland is a Scotsman, regardless of belief or statements they make.)</p>

<p>A person who holds a specific belief, may or may not be a member of a social group or community that holds those beliefs and therefore their position as a member of that group or community can fluctuate based on actions or beliefs they hold.</p>

The shooting started and the gov wasn&#39;t here until almost 2 hours later. If you want to see a play by play I posted a live thread here last night and posted updates as they happen. Similarly, the FBI office downtown is about 2 minutes away, the same building also houses Homeland Security. Geographically the city is wide, but the population is centered around that theater l. It&#39;s basically the most travelled rode in the city, and that spot especially is really trafficked. </p>

<p>See? Both of our points are arguably correct, but that doesn&#39;t add anything to the conversation. If you don&#39;t think it was a conspiracy, then how about you get out of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ?</p>

<p>It&#39;ll probably only be a suprise to anyone who doesn&#39;t follow international affairs and even then they won&#39;t care at all until it effects grocery store and gas station prices. Then things will really start to fall apart. I can imagine the US hanging on for a good 7 months after losing reserve currency status before riots start getting violent. Next Summer should be interesting to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats my point. it seems everyone is a shill when it comes to this story. how could anything other than what the news says be true?</p>

<p>like why are these people even here. why are you tryna tell me i believe in reptilians because i don&#39;t believe james holmes pried an emergency exit door open by himself without anyone noticing.</p>

<p>attacking character for a pretty basic and straight forward belief is suspect at best.</p>

<p>Because you clearly are uninformed. Within minutes of the shooting we had numerous reports from people in the theater who watched him &quot;answer a phone, walk out the exit door, and then return because he had propped the door open.&quot;</p>

She described a man about 6&#39; tall kicked through the door in a riot helmet and bulletproof vest. He was completely covered in all black, with goggles. After that, she and her boyfriend dropped to the floor. They got up, ran through the emergency exit. Shooter made his way up the stairs and started shooting people with the shotgun.</p>

<p>Those are all less than 12 hours after the event.</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/numinit/ba85564e14fc8f6b142b">This is an incredibly ignored resource</a> that shows how initial reports get blown out of proportion (like the usual &quot;multiple gunman&quot; claim - because how else could people in two theaters get shot that are separated by sheetrock and insulation that isn&#39;t bulletproof!?</p>

<p>To not alarm people in the theater as he makes his exit to his car to gather his weapons?</p>

<p>That makes no sense to you?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, I tell you that initial reports of a second shooter are common in almost every single mass shooting ever - and in this case came from people being injured in both theater 8 and 9 - but some of those injuries were caused by pieces of wood from the wall separating the two theaters ending up as shrapnel and you still won&#39;t accept the fact that it did not require two people to cause those wounds in both theaters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being that whatever happened happened today, I don&#39;t think you can really expect rational minds to have already come up with some sort of conspiracy theory yet, even if it really is one. It takes time to assess the incident and determine whether it is even believable or not. In the first 12 or 24 hrs of an incident like this there is an avalanche of information and misinformation/disinformation. Why would you expect people on the internet to instantaneously solve this question? (By that I mean whether or not a conspiracy exists, or in other words whether or not the &quot;official story&quot; is to be believed) It takes time; for minds to meet, for inconsistencies to be noticed/pointed out to others, and for conclusions to build from those. If someone had a fully thought out conspiracy theory the same day as an incident occurred, and didn&#39;t have some sort of &quot;inside knowledge&quot; of the event, I would be calling BS right away. If you weren&#39;t there you&#39;re limited to what you can see from TV and the internet. </p>

<p>TLDR: Have patience, there is no use in jumping the gun and going off on the wrong trail just because you&#39;re in a hurry to &quot;solve the mystery&quot;</p>
