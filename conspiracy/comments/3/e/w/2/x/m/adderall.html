       If a child is somewhat hyper active in the eyes of the medical establishment they believe that a hyperactivity pill will make them sit still.
      </p>
      <p>
       When did it become a medical disorder for kids to not pay attention 100% in school? Hell, when i was in college, you probably could've diagnosed half the class with adhd. To
       <a href="/u/mynameissam182">

       point, we've all been put into positions where we spend the majority of our time in chairs, which is the opposite of what is natural for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I believe that this monopolized, fda-approved meth/speed is simply a way for big pharma to get customers for life (addy is super addictive)
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't know where these "medical professionals" get off writing prescriptions of meth to children, with the intent of keeping them on the drug indefinitely, when we have no clue what years and years of taking the drug will do to the chemical and neural makeup of the brain.

       My nephew has been on Ritalin since age 5. It just doesn't seem to make sense. I know the main reasons he's hyperactive: 1. He eats nothing but junk food. 2. He has to stay inside all the time for school. 3. His parents are not together so he's lashing out in order to get attention 4. He's a child he needs to be 'hyperactive'
      </p>
      <p>
       The list goes on. Just because the meth is made in a FDA inspected lab doesn't make it any better than meth made in a coke can. It sickens me. I used to take it and yeah I felt great on it, but it's addictive and it turned me into a person I am not. It made my heart start hurting. Never again.

       I believe what is termed "adhd" is an evolutionary perk in the grand scheme of things. I know with my "add" that I would definitely be a better hunter due to the "inattentive" symptoms which are actually in my experience hyper focus on the task at hand. If I had to watch for game all day it would definitely be an asset in tracking and spotting prey in order to feed myself and my family.

       This isn't ADD at all. There is no such thing as hyperfocus. ADD is literally the exact opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       My boyfriend has ADD and I watch him bounce focuses around, forget errands, items and tasks constantly, and lose attention on all manner of things. He has had to go out of his way to come up with methods to help him retain any manner of focus on important tasks at hand. Adderall helps him focus, but he rarely uses it because it also affects his personality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hunting frequently requires sitting still for hours. Yeah, sorry, but ADD peeps are not going to make the best hunters, unless they are on Adderall. Adderall does help them achieve hyper focus.

       That is sort of incorrect; "hyperfocus" is a known trait of ADD, although it may be a slight mislabel. The reality is that people with ADD/ADHD can often "hyperfocus" on things they really love to do; things like school, errands, and work often don't fall on that list.

       For example, they may be able to play video games with a high degree of focus and skill for hours and hours with no breaks.

       SNIP
It is typical for individuals with ADHD to say they 1), can not focus on boring things and 2), can only focus on stimulating things,[7] and that focus is often extreme. Thus it is both a concentration deficit and over-concentration, or generically: "hyperfocus." More concisely, some types of ADHD (particularly ADD) are a difficulty in directing one's attention, (an executive function of the frontal lobe), not a lack of attention.[8][9][10]

      <p>
       Approximately 11% of children 4-17 years of age (6.4 million) have been diagnosed with ADHD as of 2011.
The percentage of children with an ADHD diagnosis continues to increase, from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2007 and to 11.0% in 2011.

       There are different subtypes of ADHD. Mainly hyperactive, Mixed, and mainly inattentive. Your boyfriend seems to have mainly hyperactive whereas I have mainly inattentive so I cant speak to his experience. Also my ideas on the origin of adhd could be complete shit so don't let my comment make you think I am challenging the validity of your boyfriends or anyone else's experiences.

       we're not talking about heart disease here...we're talking about a behavioral issue. behavioral issues have to be fixed by discipline, worldview and maturity--not FDA-approved meth

       Your sniveling opposition to the improved quality of life for people struggling with ADD after beginning treatment is abhorent. Literally despicable. It isn't meth and many ADD sufferers take breaks, adjust doses, and try multiple medications to find the right treatment. Just sit there and stew in your misguided ignorance.

       My opposition is not sniveling nor am I a despicable person. If I am ignorant than that is something that can be fixed with proper education on the matter. You're the one who claimed the condition ran in the family, I was just curious as to how you got to that conclusion. Is this something that in fact runs in the bloodline? Or are these people just unlucky as fuck. It's been a few days, have you inquired about all 4 grandparents yet?

       Eh. Idk. I'm an adult with ADHD-pi (formally ADD but I doubt most of you noticed). And honestly it's just helped me get my life together and my shit done. I used to not be able to lead my own life until I got prescribed this (age 23). And also I'm as big a conspiracy theorist as ever.

       If a child is somewhat hyper active in the eyes of the medical establishment they believe that a hyperactivity pill will make them sit still. When in reality our problem is our kids are sitting inside all day long staying seated which what is causing a lot of hyperactivity. Kids were not meant to be seated for 8 hours a day. Yes heavy metals and other toxins can cause certain hyper activity, but a lot of problems IMO is the lack of movement causing these kids to be hyperactive. As well as diet. Most processed foods have been linked to hyperactivity and I can see why. Also our gut microbiome has a lot to do with it as well.

       I get high as shit a lot. It makes me kinda lazy. Being a pot head in an engineering program doesn't mix well. Adderall re-energizes me for all-nighter study sessions, cures hangovers, and keeps me off the munchies with a curbed appetite. Fuck big pharma, fuck the government, fuck corporations, fuck the orderly lifestyle we are forced to live but god damn does this pill of legalized coke really help me grind through the bullshit that is so necessary in our daily lives
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: however, if you give it to anyone under the age of like 16 that's really fucked up, little kids don't need coke I've seen too many people try their brains on adderall

       however, i would say that using adderall as a way to "get your shit done" and "keep off the munchies" is indicative of a problem-
      </p>
      <p>
       A) This society sucks so bad that one has to go to extreme measures to "get their shit done"
B) you need to sack up and get your shit done without being a pill head. I knew several people when I was in college that do exactly as you do...and it didn't end well for them.

       I appreciate your concern. Like I said, I've seen my fair share of people burn out on addys. Usually I sell half my script since I'm broke most of the time and use the rest supplementally. Just have to limit yourself to a low dosage. At least I'm not railing bumps of it off of my coffee table like other kids in my fraternity....
