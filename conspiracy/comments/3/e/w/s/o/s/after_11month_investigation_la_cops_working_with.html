<blockquote>
<p>The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff&#39;s Office Narcotics Task Force, Houma Police Department, State Police Narcotics Division and the DEA working in cahoots for eleven months succeeded in busting a couple of teenagers for a few grams of marijuana, or as they call it, &quot;high-grade marijuana,&quot; and a couple pills of ecstasy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20150724/articles/150729819?tc=ar">Houma Today reports</a>:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Five teens were arrested today and one man is wanted after an 11-month investigation ended in police seizing marijuana and other drugs from the suspects&#39; homes and vehicles.</p>

<p>Spencer Savoy, 20, 216 Malibou Drive, Houma, is wanted on two counts of marijuana distribution and one of principal to marijuana distribution, Sheriff Jerry Larpenter said. Agents found 8.9 grams of synthetic MDMA, a digital scale and a box of sandwich bags in his bedroom and 9.5 grams of high-grade marijuana in his vehicle.</p>

<p>Larpenter said the following were arrested on warrants for the following charges:</p>

<p>Austin Ferrill, 19, 104 Angelle Circle, Houma, two counts of marijuana distribution, two counts of principal to marijuana distribution, possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was charged with obstruction of justice and a turn signal violation.</p>

<p>Agents found .80 grams of marijuana, 10 capsules of synthetic MDMA and 11 hydrocodone pills in Ferrill&#39;s bedroom. His bond is $205,000.</p>

<p>Cameron Clement, 19, 221 Lake Mechant Court, Houma, one count of marijuana distribution. His bond is $35,000.</p>

<p>Jude Boudreaux, 19, 109 McAllen Drive, Houma, one count of marijuana distribution. Agents found 20 grams of high-grade marijuana in his vehicle. His bond is $50,000.</p>

<p>Gage Fontana, 19, 207 Malibou Drive, Houma, distribution and possession with intent to distribute marijuana. His bond is $60,000.</p>

<p>Dylan Brewer, 17, 200 South Ellendale, Houma, principal to marijuana. He was apprehended at 3902 Southdown Mandalay Road, and his bond is $35,000.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.informationliberation.com/files/hardenedcriminals.jpg">Here&#39;s a picture of the hardened criminals they busted</a>.</p>

<p>Clearly, the faces of killers.</p>

<p>Notice they say they seized &quot;high-grade&quot; marijuana -- most marijuana these days is &quot;high-grade,&quot; that means nothing.</p>

<p>Fact of the matter is &quot;high-grade&quot; marijuana is said to be safer for people than &quot;low-grade&quot; marijuana as you smoke less of it to get the same high and therefor inhale less smoke into your lungs. Nonetheless, the DEA loves to use such inflated terms to make their actions seem less petty.</p>

<p>These cops working together with the feds spent almost an entire year spying on these kids and this is all they could come up with, a few grams of pot, a few pills of MDMA and &quot;a turn signal violation.&quot;</p>

<p>How much taxpayer money were these cops paid over this past year? In terms of value to taxpayers, this has produced nothing. In fact, it&#39;s a net drag on the economy as taxpayers will have to pay for their prosecution and potential imprisonment, the &quot;investigation&quot; which led to their arrests, and lose any tax money and value the kids would have created through work if they got real jobs -- all this because they dared to partake in the same drug admittedly used by the current President of the United States. </p>

<p>From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Five teens were arrested today and one man is wanted after an 11-month investigation ended in police seizing marijuana and other drugs <strong>from the suspects&#39; homes and vehicles</strong>.</p>

<p>Homes and vehicles (probably belonging to their parents) that will no doubt be SEIZED and sold under Asset Forfeiture Laws. </p>

<p><strong>PROFIT!!!</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think grown men who harass teenage kids, kidnap them, spy on them, put them into dungeons, put handcuffs on them, and take them away from their homes and families - are criminals, or terrorists who are terrorizing the youth of their own communities - and they should be put in prison by the actual authorities (who don&#39;t harass or kidnap children) and charged with treason of some kind.</p>

<p>They say it themselves, that they are waging war on american citizens - american children no less - they call it &quot;the war on drugs&quot; - so they are committing treason and everyone involved in that monolithic and ruthless conspiracy should be charged with their crimes.</p>

<p>Those criminals and terrorist gang members who call themselves cops who are stalking children are the scariest gang I know of in america.</p>

<p>Not to mention that once you get busted for a what in reality is a very minor infraction (not like they were....killing people for profit or stealing their resources....), the odds are you turn your back on &quot;the system&quot; and realize that everything is indeed shit. </p>

<p>You want these &quot;criminals&quot; to live a better life? Yeah, fucking put them in debt for their entire lives, lock them in a cage with other &quot;criminals&quot; and show them how just a little bit of drugs can turn into a lifetime of headaches. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll buck up and become great contributions to society. Not like any of those awful drug doing scientists, inventors, musicians, and artists. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>eh... take the trees out of this equation and you have a group of molly slingers.</p>

<p>i am not defending the cops, i am not saying these kids deserve this punishment, i am not saying anything of the sorts.</p>

<p>but a scale, baggies, pre-weighed pills, mdma, and hydrocodones are enough to put someone away.</p>

<p>honestly, the weed is just icing on the cake.  the mdma/pain killers and distributing material is what put these kids away.</p>

<p>in case anyone was wondering, with a medical marijuana licence in the state of california, you can legally have up to 2 ounces of trees on you.</p>

<p>if i got a ticket for possession, and did not have my licence, but went and got my licence before my court date, the weed charges will be dropped.</p>

<p>however intent to distribute and being caught with baggies and a scale.... that&#39;s an ENTIRELY different ball game.</p>

<p>so let&#39;s be clear... the issue in this isnt weed, its the intent to distribute along with the mdma and painkillers.</p>

<p>lesson to you youngsters reading this.... just use the drugs, dont sell them.</p>

<p>Are you trying to make a point by saying house hold items are not illegal (and are ignoring the drugs found with them)?</p>

<p>Are you assuming that I claiming that these people got in trouble for having household items?</p>

<p>Or do you not understand the concept of intent to distribute and paraphernalia?</p>
