        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://naturalsociety.com/university-professor-says-ebola-is-a-genetically-modified-lab-made-virus/">Source</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a recently released report titled “Estimating Ebola Treatment Needs, United States,” the CDC is still <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/7/15-0286_article">playing down its latest round</a> of fear-mongering for the virus which was “meant to infect every man, woman, and child in the US.” To date, and by their own admission there have been only 10 cases in the entire U.S.</p>

<p>How disappointing for the makers of the Ebola vaccine. Especially when publications like the Liberian Observer, in a piece by Dr. Cyril Broderick, expose how its “likely manufactured by Big Pharma.”</p>

<p>Dr. Cyril Broderick is a former professor of plant pathology at the University of Liberia’s College of Agriculture and Forestry, and is on tenure as an associate at Delaware University.</p>

<p>Broderick claims that the Ebola virus which <a href="http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-8-july-2015">recently ran rampant</a> in Western Africa was genetically modified, made in a lab by Western pharmaceutical companies, and administered to unsuspecting civilians through United Nations vaccination programs. </p>

<p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/26/delaware-state-wont-interfere-with-free-speech-of-professor-spreading-ebola-conspiracy-theories/">called it a wild conspiracy theory</a>, but is there actually truth to these <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/26/delaware-state-wont-interfere-with-free-speech-of-professor-spreading-ebola-conspiracy-theories/">shocking allegations</a>?</p>

<p>The truth may be in this video. Dr. Broderick references Dr. Leonard Horowitz in the Liberian Observer article. He presents substantial evidence which explains this tidbit:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“[Horowitz] unearthed and reprinted stunning scientific documents and National Institutes of Health contracts proving that chimpanzees, contaminated with numerous viruses, were used to produce hundreds of hepatitis B vaccine doses administered to central African Blacks along with homosexual men in New York City at precisely the time Dr. Myers and colleagues claim the origin of HIV ‘punctuated event’ occurred.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some are saying that not only was the HIV virus likely man-made, but so was Ebola. Who knows which other pandemic diseases are created so the mainstream medical system can profit from them.</p>

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/47918671">Take the time to watch this video</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea dude and when they force us to take vaccines, what are they really giving us? They&#39;re administering vaccines or &quot;western medicine&quot; to all the poor nations in Africa because (in a sarcastic tone) &quot;they need our lab made medicine and it doesnt compare to anything those idiots have made, they live in dirt, how filthy and uncivilized&quot; and now all of a sudden everyone over there has Ebola and HIV? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well actually I remember readi somewhere that the strain of Ebola going around Africa was &quot;new&quot; and if you watch the four corners documentary about it the African people say that &quot;the white men come and give you a shot that makes you have Ebola&quot; of course at the start I thought it wa rubbish but there is definitely truth hidden somewhere in this. Shits like utopia yall </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be a lot of things they were looking for in the release of the virus, social reactions across the world, how different social groups react, etc. I think the amount of things I could think of that they are trying to understand is beyond my thinking. Africa is also a country the global elite need to seize control of at some point, water aquifers and resources, could be a form of degeneration of their society/health. </p>
