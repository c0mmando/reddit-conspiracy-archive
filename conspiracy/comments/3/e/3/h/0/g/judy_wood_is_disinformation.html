       I think the outright hostility and dismissal she receives from "9/11 Truth" says more about them than it does about her.  If you notice, they pretty much just say she's crazy and an idiot but they never address any of her claims or the evidence she raises in her book.  I haven't read it personally but from everything I've heard about it she raises some interesting points and it's full of evidence and photos and various other things that have never been adequately explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is that if you haven't read her book you have no business stating she's disinfo as if it's a certainty, especially when you haven't justified that position in any way with evidence of your own.

       . She lays it all out power point style and she does a great job given who she did it in front of. She is being discriminated on. If she was a model or a male she wouldn't be getting the heat she is. She would probably be dead though.

       There is an active coordinated campaign to mock, misquote, and discredit her across social media (including anyone who would dare support her).  After watching her videos it is quiet obvious she is on to something.
It is useful to watch the 4 hour Dimitri Khalezov video on youtube too.

       Directed Energy Weapons exist. Some are classified. Your posts will never make me change my mind. The more you post about her the more popular she will get too so keep posting. Her degrees are real and you can deny it but you're a nobody lol.

       That isn't how this works my friend.  You made this thread stating that she's disinformation, it's on you to explain why you think so.  So far you haven't even demonstrated that you have the slightest clue about what she's said or claimed so how could you possibly know she's disinfo?

       What the hell are you talking about?  You created this thread stating Judy Wood is disinformation.  You have provided nothing to back that statement up.  I'm pointing this very simple fact out, I'm not defending anyone.  There's this thing called "burden of proof", you should look it up sometime.

       Again, I'm not defending her.  This is like arguing with a 10 year old.

       Since you clearly don't know what burden of proof is or how it works, let me hold your hand and walk you through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden of proof is on the person making the claim.  In this thread,
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are the person making the claim and your claim is that Judy Wood is disinformation.  Therefore,
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       need to defend that claim.  You haven't done so.  Do you understand now or should I go slower?

       So the answer then is no, you don't understand what burden of proof means?  Got it.  Let's try again, and I'll go
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       slow this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is your OP: "Judy Wood is disinformation."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this sentence constitutes a "claim".
      </p>
      <p>
       "Claim" is a noun, it means "an assertion of the truth of something, typically one that is disputed or in doubt".
      </p>
      <p>
       So in this case, you're the one making the
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       that she is disinfo, therefore the burden of proof falls on you to prove or support this
       <em>
        claim
       </em>
       with evidence or at least the reason you think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have provided literally nothing to support this claim,
       <em>
        your claim
       </em>
       , therefore you fail the burden of proof, and you can be easily disregarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, on the other hand, haven't made any claims at all but have simply disputed yours, therefore the burden of proof isn't on me.
       <em>
        Now
       </em>
       do you understand?  I don't think I can dumb it down anymore than that for you, so if you still don't understand then I don't know what to tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the final time, I'll ask you the
       <em>
        very, very
       </em>
       simple question: why do you think she's disinfo?  Be as specific as you can.

       You claim people don't refute judys book (pay to play). It's a disingenuous attempt to act as though Judy speaks truth without Explaining said truth.

       You didn't ask for an explanation in your OP, you made a statement.  Do you want me to explain the difference between asking for something and stating something?  It's quite simple: they're what's called "opposites".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted an explanation of her theories, ask for an explanation of her theories.  Instead you made a statement and now, 70+ comments in and after being asked multiple times, you've still provided nothing in support of your statement.

        For the fifth time: what has she said specifically that's disinfo and why is it disinfo?

       Do you even have a reason to think she is or did you just pull the idea out of your ass?

       And you fail again to understand how burden of proof works.  Here you're asking me to prove a negative, which is impossible.  You're the one claiming she
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       disinformation, so you need to provide evidence that she is.  You're really bad at this.

       Why do you insist on avoiding every question you're asked?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I repeat myself a sixth time?  Why do you think she is disinformation, specifically?
      </p>
      <p>
       She definitely could be, I don't deny that, but so far you've provided literally nothing to show me or anyone else that she is.  In fact, this post has done nothing but convince me that I need to buy her book and read it since so many (like yourself) are ready to dismiss her without even knowing what she's said.

       Judy supporters have the burden of proof. It's so pitiful the top minds have to cling to fallacy arguments.  Back the disinformation up with facts, don't argue semantics. This is a pitiful debate. I meant to bring to light the fact that every Judy wood supporter is full of shit.

       She's a nutbag, bro. She was thrown out of the 9/11 truth movement for refusing to follow the evidence and for making up wild stories with no evidential support.

       Since you keep ignoring me when I tell you what evidence is not, let me repeat: evidence is not linking a book review. If you want to debate show some evidence. If you do not, then fuck off.

       So how about the seismic evidence she shows.. how about the steel beams that show the same effects as the Hutchinson effect.. how about the fact that the towers did not penetrate the parking garage... and that the bathtub structure of the towers were not damaged... how about the fact that the rubble pile was miniscule after the towers went down... even reporters on thes cene stated this... they said it all went in the hole yet Woods proof shows this was not the case. How about the hurricane off the coast of New York during 9-11 yet the media barely reported it in days prior... it goes on and on...

       Any explosion near the ground is going to cause seismic activity. It is a giant leap from there to the theory that a mass energy weapon was used to destroy the WTC buildings. The evidence she cherry-picks in defence of her own case is all consistent with conventional explosives, but the real problem is she does not include any of the stronger evidence for explosives because it disproves her own case.

       No, her evidence is that the seismic evidence is NOT what you would find in an explosion or buildings collapsing.. the evidence showed that the buildings never actually hit the ground - because they turned to dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       She doesn't cherry-pick the evidence at all.. it's the total opposite. she shows ALL the evidence. Becuase all the evidence shows the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       She doesn't say that a mass energy weapon was used.. she shows that there s evidence of mass energy at the site. She shows that the government HAS mass energy weapons we know of even in the public domain.

       Directed Energy Weapons exist. They don't leave anything behind genius. They just turn certain types of matter into dust including humans. Keep your head in the sand though. It makes no difference to me.

       So your evidence that a DEW was used is that there is no evidence that a DEW was used. That's what you're going with?

       I'm not convinced of anything besides the fact that you made this OP without anything to back your opinion up.  I haven't read her book as I've stated elsewhere in this thread and it's obvious you haven't either, the difference is you're in here stating she's disinfo when it's clear you don't even know what she's said.

       You make an OP claiming a person is disinfo.  You get asked to back this claim up and explain why you think this and you have nothing to offer, don't even know what the person you're accusing has said, have never read any of their work, and yet I'm the one bluffing?

        In a court of law videos and photographs get accepted as evidence.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In order for a photograph or video to be accepted as evidence in a courtroom, there needs to be proof the photo or video was taken when it was claimed to be taken, represents what it was claimed it represents, has not been tampered with and is not open to interpretation.

      <p>
       Posting Youtube videos of yourself rambling and linking random photographs which could be of literally anything is not evidence and no court of law would accept it as such.

       Do you have the slightest iota of evidence that the scientists who authored the paper I linked manipulated their data? No, you do not, you idiotic wanker. When you are given a peer-reviewed scientific paper to read, you do not ignore it and assume that it is fraudulent simply because it does not reach a conclusion you like. You do not do that unless you are a retard. Understand?

Examination of four of these samples, collected from separate sites, is reported in this paper. These red/gray chips show marked similarities in all four samples. One sample was collected by a Manhattan resident about ten minutes after the collapse of the second WTC Tower, two the next day, and a fourth about a week later."

You are literally making up your own information, providing no evidential support for it, and trying to use it to argue against accredited scientific research conducted by industry professionals and analysed by their own scientific peers.

       Here's the thing, you moronic twat. Explosives tend to create a lot of dust. Said dust then flies outward from the centre of the explosion.

       A) No it isn't. If nano-thermite charges were placed on the structural support columns -- the columns providing resistance throughout the buildings -- gravity would have brought them straight down, exactly like we all saw. Exploding dust clouds are then a by-product of thousands of tons of concrete smashing through thousands of tons of concrete.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) Pretending for a moment that your statement isn't just your own unqualified and incorrect opinion -- which it is -- then just how the hell do you go from "naïve to think only nano-thermite was used" to "energy beam weapon"? That's like leaping off a cliff and just believing something completely random on the basis that conventional explosives may also have been present in the WTC buildings.

       In sum, you're either a wacko or you're here to spread disinformation and to discredit the real researchers. Whichever it is, I'm not interested. Fuck off.

      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it, the 9/11 truth movement is the collective term for the conglomerate of scientists and industry professionals who, after realising the official story is false, set about researching what actually occurred. Since all of these people follow the scientific method, they have mostly all arrived at the same conclusions. Judy Wood does not follow the scientific method -- at least not regarding 9/11 research -- and that is why she is not part of the movement. She isn't conducting genuine research.

      <p>
       Look, I do see your point, but IMO the movement is not comprised of every singe individual who understands 9/11 was an inside job. The reason for that is that most of them are powerless to do anything in terms of obtaining the truth. Hence, they are not part of the movement ("movement" being a choice word) which is working (i.e. "moving" towards) that truth.

       Now you're simply making information up which has zero factual basis. I'm quite annoyed that I initially thought you were genuine and so I wrote you a genuine response. What qualifies you to sarcastically put the term "scientists" in quotation marks? Are you a scientist? What evidence do you have that Professor Harrit has not been a doctor of chemistry for the last 30 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       Snorting in derision at the professional research of teams of scientists, which you have not read, and could not understand even if you wanted to, is typical of a narcissistic imbecile who does not have the capacity to reason before he makes a decision.

       Maybe you should consider actually looking at her work before dismissing it out of hand and insulting anonymous people on the internet?  Just a thought.

      <p>
       In order for a photograph or video to be accepted as evidence in a courtroom, there needs to be proof the photo or video was taken when it was claimed to be taken, represents what it was claimed it represents, has not been tampered with and is not open to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posting Youtube videos of yourself rambling and linking random photographs which could be of literally anything is not evidence and no court of law would accept it as such.

       And you fail again to understand how burden of proof works.  Here you're asking me to prove a negative, which is impossible.  You're the one claiming she
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       disinformation, so you need to provide evidence that she is.  You're really bad at this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you insist on avoiding every question you're asked?
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I repeat myself a sixth time?  Why do you think she is disinformation, specifically?
      </p>
      <p>
       She definitely could be, I don't deny that, but so far you've provided literally nothing to show me or anyone else that she is.  In fact, this post has done nothing but convince me that I need to buy her book and read it since so many (like yourself) are ready to dismiss her without even knowing what she's said.

Examination of four of these samples, collected from separate sites, is reported in this paper. These red/gray chips show marked similarities in all four samples. One sample was collected by a Manhattan resident about ten minutes after the collapse of the second WTC Tower, two the next day, and a fourth about a week later."

       I've watched the YouTube video. i know the disinformation agent is such by their insistence of dustification to steel framed structures with one video of a spire taken from 1 angle.

       It's rather dull that you insist her pay to play book is the only way to understand that Judy wood is disinformation.

      <p>
       Judy didn't offer proof. You won't pay for her bullshit book. I have to prove she is wrong by buying a book when I know her premise doesn't change the fact that a controlled demolition brought down both towers...
