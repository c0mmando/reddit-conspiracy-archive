    <div class="md"><p>I think the outright hostility and dismissal she receives from &quot;9/11 Truth&quot; says more about them than it does about her.  If you notice, they pretty much just say she&#39;s crazy and an idiot but they never address any of her claims or the evidence she raises in her book.  I haven&#39;t read it personally but from everything I&#39;ve heard about it she raises some interesting points and it&#39;s full of evidence and photos and various other things that have never been adequately explained.</p>

<p>Bottom line is that if you haven&#39;t read her book you have no business stating she&#39;s disinfo as if it&#39;s a certainty, especially when you haven&#39;t justified that position in any way with evidence of your own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Judy Wood earned a Ph.D. Degree from Virginia Tech and is a former professor of mechanical engineering. She has research expertise in experimental stress analysis, structural mechanics, deformation analysis, materials characterization and materials engineering science. Her research has involved testing materials, including complex-material systems, in the area of photomechanics, or the use of optical and image-analysis methods to determine physical properties of materials and measure how materials respond to forces placed on them. Her area of expertise involves interferometry in forensic science. She taught graduate and undergraduate engineering classes and has authored or co-authored over 60 peer-reviewed papers and journal publications in her areas of expertise.</p>

<p>Dr. Wood received her</p>

<p>B.S. (Civil Engineering, 1981) (Structural Engineering),
M.S. (Engineering Mechanics (Applied Physics), 1983), and
Ph.D. (Materials Engineering Science, 1992) from the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t how this works my friend.  You made this thread stating that she&#39;s disinformation, it&#39;s on you to explain why you think so.

<p>The burden of proof is on the person making the claim.  In this thread, <em>you</em> are the person making the claim and your claim is that Judy Wood is disinformation.  Therefore, <em>you</em> need to defend that claim.  You haven&#39;t done so.  Do you understand now or should I go slower?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the answer then is no, you don&#39;t understand what burden of proof means?  Got it.  Let&#39;s try again, and I&#39;ll go <em>really</em> slow this time.</p>

<p>Here is your OP: &quot;Judy Wood is disinformation.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, this sentence constitutes a &quot;claim&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Claim&quot; is a noun, it means &quot;an assertion of the truth of something, typically one that is disputed or in doubt&quot;.</p>

<p>So in this case, you&#39;re the one making the <em>claim</em> that she is disinfo, therefore the burden of proof falls on you to prove or support this <em>claim</em> with evidence or at least the reason you think so.</p>

<p>You have provided literally nothing to support this claim, <em>your claim</em>, therefore you fail the burden of proof, and you can be easily disregarded.</p>

<p>I, on the other hand, haven&#39;t made any claims at all but have simply disputed yours, therefore the burden of proof isn&#39;t on me.  <em>Now</em> do you understand?  I don&#39;t think I can dumb it down anymore than that for you, so if you still don&#39;t understand then I don&#39;t know what to tell you.</p>

<p>So for the final time, I&#39;ll ask you the <em>very, very</em> simple question: why do you think she&#39;s disinfo?  Be as specific as you can.</p>

<p>70 something comments and 0 explanations based on fact.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t ask for an explanation in your OP, you made a statement.  Do you want me to explain the difference between asking for something and stating something?  It&#39;s quite simple: they&#39;re what&#39;s called &quot;opposites&quot;.</p>

<p>If you wanted an explanation of her theories, ask for an explanation of her theories.  Instead you made a statement and now, 70+ comments in and after being asked multiple times, you&#39;ve still provided nothing in support of your statement.</p>

<p>You are either very young, very confused, very dishonest, very full of shit, very wrong, very dumb, or some combination of the above.</p>

<p><strong>For the fifth time: what has she said specifically that&#39;s disinfo and why is it disinfo?</strong></p>

<p>And you fail again to understand how burden of proof works.  Here you&#39;re asking me to prove a negative, which is impossible.  You&#39;re the one claiming she <em>is</em> disinformation, so you need to provide evidence that she is.  You&#39;re really bad at this.</p>

<p>Why do you insist on avoiding every question you&#39;re asked?</p>

<p>Should I repeat myself a sixth time?  Why do you think she is disinformation, specifically?</p>

<p>She definitely could be, I don&#39;t deny that, but so far you&#39;ve provided literally nothing to show me or anyone else that she is.  In fact, this post has done nothing but convince me that I need to buy her book and read it since so many (like yourself) are ready to dismiss her without even knowing what she&#39;s said.</p>

<p>Any explosion near the ground is going to cause seismic activity. It is a giant leap from there to the theory that a mass energy weapon was used to destroy the WTC buildings. The evidence she cherry-picks in defence of her own case is all consistent with conventional explosives, but the real problem is she does not include any of the stronger evidence for explosives because it disproves her own case.</p>

<p>Do you have the slightest iota of evidence that the scientists who authored the paper I linked manipulated their data? No, you do not, you idiotic wanker. When you are given a peer-reviewed scientific paper to read, you do not ignore it and assume that it is fraudulent simply because it does not reach a conclusion you like.

One sample was collected by a Manhattan resident about ten minutes after the collapse of the second WTC Tower, two the next day, and a fourth about a week later.&quot;</p>

<p>A) No it isn&#39;t. If nano-thermite charges were placed on the structural support columns -- the columns providing resistance throughout the buildings -- gravity would have brought them straight down, exactly like we all saw. Exploding dust clouds are then a by-product of thousands of tons of concrete smashing through thousands of tons of concrete.</p>

<p>B) Pretending for a moment that your statement isn&#39;t just your own unqualified and incorrect opinion -- which it is -- then just how the hell do you go from &quot;naïve to think only nano-thermite was used&quot; to &quot;energy beam weapon&quot;? That&#39;s like leaping off a cliff and just believing something completely random on the basis that conventional explosives may also have been present in the WTC buildings.</p>

<p>In sum, you&#39;re either a wacko or you&#39;re here to spread disinformation and to discredit the real researchers. Whichever it is, I&#39;m not interested. Fuck off.</p>

<p>You visit the Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth website and sign the petition.</p>

<p>As I understand it, the 9/11 truth movement is the collective term for the conglomerate of scientists and industry professionals who, after realising the official story is false, set about researching what actually occurred. Since all of these people follow the scientific method, they have mostly all arrived at the same conclusions. Judy Wood does not follow the scientific method -- at least not regarding 9/11 research -- and that is why she is not part of the movement. She isn&#39;t conducting genuine research.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Look, I do see your point, but IMO the movement is not comprised of every singe individual who understands 9/11 was an inside job. The reason for that is that most of them are powerless to do anything in terms of obtaining the truth. Hence, they are not part of the movement (&quot;movement&quot; being a choice word) which is working (i.e. &quot;moving&quot; towards) that truth.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;re simply making information up which has zero factual basis. I&#39;m quite annoyed that I initially thought you were genuine and so I wrote you a genuine response. What qualifies you to sarcastically put the term &quot;scientists&quot; in quotation marks? Are you a scientist? What evidence do you have that Professor Harrit has not been a doctor of chemistry for the last 30 years?</p>

<p>Snorting in derision at the professional research of teams of scientists, which you have not read, and could not understand even if you wanted to, is typical of a narcissistic imbecile who does not have the capacity to reason before he makes a decision.</p>
