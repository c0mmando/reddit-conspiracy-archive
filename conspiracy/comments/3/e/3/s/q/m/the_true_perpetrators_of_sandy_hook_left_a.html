        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have spent a long time looking into the Sandy Hook &quot;school shooting&quot;, and I am convinced that it was a carefully planned event that had nothing to do with a &quot;disturbed loner (Adam Lanza) running amok&quot;. It was almost certainly perpetrated and covered-up by powerful individuals within government and the media, probably linked by membership of secret societies/freemasonry.</p>

<p>I believe that the Hollywood elite released a number of warnings or signposts to this event. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dkc5a/james_tracy_ama/ct62fe7">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3dkc5a/james_tracy_ama/ct62fe7</a></p>

<p>But the perpetrators also left a signature - deliberately. </p>

<p>If you have Google Earth, you can check all this for yourself - I promise there is no trickery. It could be a monumental coincidence, but equally it could be a deliberate, but hidden <strong>admission of a link between individuals in the US government and Freemasonry who planned and executed the Sandy Hook hoax</strong>.</p>

<p>As you know, the Georgia Guidestones are a set of engraved stones which are allegedly associated with the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians and the New World Order. They can be located in Google Earth by pasting in the following grid reference: 34.231984, -82.894506. I&#39;ve put down a marker, and when you zoom in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/U3Nkhek.jpg?1">this is what you see</a>. The red line which I have added (of which more in a minute) goes all the way to the next site.</p>

<p>The second site is the Sandy Hook Elementary School, grid coordinates: 41.42, -73.278611. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9BdimsL.jpg?1">I&#39;ve put another marker here</a>. The school has since been demolished so you will just see an empty plot now in Google Earth, but this is the image I screenshotted at the time.</p>

<p>I then used the Google Earth ruler function to draw a straight line between these two precise points (a distance 722 miles). The line appears to go <a href="http://i.imgur.com/4YyNtE9.jpg?1">quite close to Washington DC</a>. Hmmm, so what?</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s much more than just &quot;close&quot;. When you zoom in to the following grid coordinates 38°53&#39;20.28&quot;N, 77° 0&#39;33.48&quot;W  and press enter, you will be looking at... </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Xxd65bB.jpg">THIS</a>. </p>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives">US House of Representatives</a> on Capitol Hill, and the red line (from the Georgia Guidestones to Sandy Hook) goes straight through the middle of it. </p>

<p>The skeptic in you may immediately rationalise this to be a meaningless coincidence, but I want you to think about it. If Sandy Hook was a freemasonic/government hoax, then this incredibly precise, direct geographic link between the three, over such a long distance, is pretty remarkable, particularly bearing in mind the attention that freemasons pay to location and orientation.</p>

<p>No doubt there will be plenty of nutjob &quot;coincidence theorists&quot; trying to dismiss this connection, but this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. We should understand that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia">apophenia</a> and patternicity exist, but at the same time we should have the nous to realise that some things are not just coincidence. Only a truly dim individual attributes everything to coincidence.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There are three explanations for the fact that the Guidestones, The Capitol and SHES line up exactly.</p>

<p>(1) The Sandy Hook event was planned at least 33 years in advance, and the Guidestones were deliberately situated on a line extending from SHES through the Capitol - like a geometric marker.</p>

<p>(2) Sandy Hook Elementary School was chosen to be the site (from many possible sites) of an &quot;event&quot; AFTER the erection of the Guidestones, because it was situated on the extension of the line which goes from the Guidestones to the Capitol. </p>

<p>(3) Coincidence</p>

<p>I think option (2) is the most likely, with option (3) the least likely. Anybody who still believes the absurd notion that Sandy Hook was a &quot;school shooting carried out by a crazed teenager&quot; will obviously not be able to see past option (3).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just used google maps to measure the distance between two points using your coordinates and the seemingly straight line it generated went through the Georgetown and Adams Morgan neighborhoods of DC after coming through Rosslyn (Arlington neighborhood) and crossing the river next to the Francis Scott Key Memorial Brige - it did not go through Capital Hill and ultimately the house of representatives.  Seems like they would have skipped a good chance to align with the George Washington Masonic Temple in Alexandria which is a very significant building in the area if somebody was really trying to connect things somehow.</p>

<p>I think it is a bit of a stretch to pick an arbitrary &quot;point of significance&quot; and start drawing lines between things and attaching significance to it.  Without some reason why guidestones in Georgia would be relevant they are a meaningless point.  There are TONS of buildings and places/items that have some sort of masonic significance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Masonic_National_Memorial">masonic temple in Alexandria</a> example I gave being one of many.  If you start drawing lines between all of them to places where significant events (no matter whether you believe it happened or not, it is still an &quot;event&quot; of social significance) happened you are bound to find a lot of coincidences.  That doesn&#39;t automatically make them significant.</p>

The engraved stones are &quot;allegedly&quot; associated with the free masons. You also said it yourself it could &quot;equally&quot; be a coincidence or deliberate.  Also, what motive would the freemasons have to leave any &#39;clue&#39; to what happened.<br/>
Also, anything associated with the freemasons could cause another line to be drawn and the line may go through a state capitol or a church which im sure the line did.  There&#39;s coincidence and then there is blowing things out of proportion.<br/>

<p>Indeed. </p>

<p>We may think that things like patterns, symbolism, numerology etc. are meaningless and silly - but the master plan Washington DC was undoubtedly laid out using symbolism of great importance to the adherents of Freemasonry.</p>

<p>One example is the &quot;Owl&quot; figure that encompasses the US Capitol complex - and the line connecting the Guidestones to Sandy Hook <strong><a href="http://i.imgur.com/bVTjrU9.png">(approximated here in blue)</a></strong> would cross the precise location where the &quot;mouth&quot; of the owl would be.</p>

<p>Unless of course there is no &quot;owl&quot;, and there is no Masonic symbology in the layout of Washington DC...</p>

<p>Coincidences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are numerous problems, but the most glaringly obvious is that these points are arbitrary. What you&#39;ve essentially done is demonstrated that some tourist attraction that has significance to conspiracy theorists (there are probably thousands) lines up with another such in pointing to Sandy Hook, but how many schools do <em>not</em> line up in this way?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s try it out. I drew a line from Area 51 in NV to the Scottish Rite Temple in Guthrie OK, and found that it crossed several schools including the one in Canton, OK. Given that the fully connected graph of all possible conspiracy theory sites (a graph with an unimaginably large number of lines, due to combinatorics) probably crosses nearly every school ever built, I would expect that any school shooting could be dismissed via this logic... along with every other tragic event in human history...</p>

<p>Hey! You&#39;ve hit on the mono-theory of all conspiracies! We&#39;re done, here. Can someone shut the lights out in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> on our way out? ;-)</p>
