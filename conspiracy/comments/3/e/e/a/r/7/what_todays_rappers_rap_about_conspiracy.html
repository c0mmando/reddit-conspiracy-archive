       Think about it..
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the early rap (Chuck D, Tupac, BDP, many more) were very political. They did not aquisse to establishement norms, money and excess. Rather, they desired to fight the system. Nowadays, no rappers speak about anything political, instead, the content is almost 'shill' like, completing conforming to societal norms and worshipping money and excess (Drake, French Montana, YG, etc). Rappers are often leaders and icons within the black community, why aren't they representing the community via political stance and expression like they did not too long ago...?
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, one might argue that today there is more of a need for political messages within art, and counter culture references against institutional racism than ever before... Yet references and activist communication is glaringly absent from the picture. How convenient for those in power trying to reinforce the status quote.

       It is out there... Just not to the extent it was ten years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, ten years ago sociopolitical music WAS mainstream rap music.

       Today...  Moloch references and the reinforcement of the current social norms is to be expected...  Worship the golden calf (materialism), and YOLO - so make the most of the moment (consumerism).  These are wonderful control mechanisms.

       No doubt materialism has always been a part of rap.  It is just an ever expanding vein.  And no doubt political activism has always been a part of rap.  It has just been an ever diminishing vein.

       Maybe a decade ago, but when rap music first broke to the mainstream, it was far more political and "awake." There has no doubt been a concentrated effort to make it more materialistic, sex-obsessed and shallow.

       Whether this is by Satanic design or simple lowest-common-denominator appeals to greed, we cannot fully say. But I think it's probably Satanic.

       Post #777 (original text)
      </p>
      <p>
       Prediction: We don't see much activist ideology in this dialogue either. Rather, the top submission point will be opposed, or working to sweep the issue aside. Further, my response to that post will be downvoted.  Why?  This is not something users are interested in; instead, they desire the material. By design? No way to really tell; however, a populace instilled with virulent consumerism is easier to control than a free thinking activist populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       *There are now 77 posts on this submission... Hey look!  The first placed text about the topic is dismissing it... Saying that it's not a big deal, it's an issue with all music.  Fascinating :D

       Good point.  Though I don't know if profit is simply the basic economic result of users being interested in buying the music, therefore the artists profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather, there may be some layers of filtration, whereby socially charged, political messages are dismantled and diminished, regardless of interest in the profit/public sphere.  Or at least it seems that way, considering the extreme change of direction rap has taken.

       Agreed, labels are a large part of the problem too, they exist to profit from talent and strangle anything that might upset that balance.

       Excellent elucidation of industry dynamics...  Yes, I imagine many of these forces are at play, "guiding" the rap industry so to speak...
      </p>
      <p>
       With todays current socioeconomic situation, as well as the institutional racism we see in criminal enforcement, to have no members of the rap community speaking about this is deplorable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rap changed from brave activist self expression to shills, working for pay.

       I do notice a change, but there may be other factors in play. I'm not going to downplay the conspiracy theory part of it, but there may be other things. The age demographics may have changed, things like music streaming and the death of CDs may have changed how you have to target the music in order to maximize profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may be a political reason, but there may be some underlying economic changes here as well. Maybe they discovered marketing towards a younger crowd (political statements probably wouldn't resonate too well with them?) would be a better profit in a new market.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's an interesting topic, and I'm sure you could even write a serious report on it given enough research.

       I agree... Often change is a constellation of various elements.  However, generally... When speaking of quick, aggressive change (which we are in the case of the rap industry's alteration of primary message) that generally is provoked from a singular source.  Or if not singular, than at the least, principle.

       It's definitely possible, but there's so many moving parts. Let's remember that the entire music model basically changed in that short time frame as well due to the rapid technological change of apple products/streaming/ etc. I'm guessing consumer tastes changed rapidly, a couple of the newer "Party yolo" types may have hit big with a changing demographic and more recent rappers copied in hopes of having similar success.

       I think 'streaming' effected the rap industry indubitably.  However, wouldn't it stand to reason that it's effect would be primarily economic and not content oriented?  Though they are related, they are not related enough to explain the marked shift we see in mainstream rap content, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would even stand to reason that streaming made the industry less controllable.  Which, would then do the opposite of what we observe currently.  We are are seeing a centralization of the industry message, as opposed to a fracturing of the rap community into many different uncontrollable subsets...
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the fact that streaming could be debated to lessen institutional control on the music industry, I think we can see demonstrable effects that would point to the opposite...  Was rap purchased by elite interest to maintain status quote?  Are mainstream rap artists watering down their message, veering away from politically active ideology?  Seems likely.

       I think kids nowadays are getting into music at an earlier age just because of its ubiquity and ease of getting said music, as opposed to when you had to buy CDs. Couple this with the media infatuation with glitz and glam starlets that kids/teens are so into these days, and I see a natural reason that the rappers themselves would say "hey look what the kids are really into, we should emulate this".
      </p>
      <p>
       The media could certainly be pushing this shift, but it's always possible that the rap game itself is just responding to changing ideologies from the population. But, the fact that I know the radio game itself is HEAVILY played means that there's always a good chance of some kind of next level games being played. I just think it's good to look at every side of the story.

       Reasonable.  This marked shift in rap message content could be occurring due to changing demographics and market dynamics.  If this is the case, it is very convenient for any established power interest.

       I'll never doubt that, if the people don't care about dissenting the government, I find it logical that the record labels wouldn't push that content.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's always going to be the question in a situation like this, are the rappers responding to an apparent lack of interest in that kind of content from the population? Or are there nefarious higher ups pushing that kind of content to be squelched? It's almost like a chicken or egg question.

       Good question.

       While I went through this internally, in a thought experiment, I reached the same question.
      </p>
      <p>
       This clear shift in content is favorable to those in power, those interested in enforcing the status quote.   Further, this change in content has been done very quickly.  A manifestation such as this occurring organically in the timespan is a low probability.

       I have slight pause to come to that same conclusion just for the reason that technology exploded in such a short time frame during the same time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter, Facebook, myspace, TMZ, instagram, pandora, apple, itunes, etc, all came to the forefront at the same time. I staunchly believe that social media has made us dumber, more narcissistic, and dangerously, more apathetic towards serious issues. We get bombarded with information about our friends, celebrities, artists, that it can feel almost like that's what "seems" important to everyone because they see it so often on the net.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though we can now look into conspiracies and government wrongdoing deeper than ever before, people care less than ever before. And I really think it's because of things like social media. Almost paradoxically, giving people an open arena would seemingly allow for even more dissenting ideas to hit the forefront, but it seems like open arenas devolve into the lowest common denominator.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, I'm rambling now, but I think alot of it has to do with the fact that artists and record labels can see more of what listeners are into and what they share amongst each other than ever before. And, it seems that most people just like to talk about stupid crap like celebs and cat pictures and glitz, and labels could be tapping into that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world where we can hear more and more about political wrongdoings, the population seems more and more like it just wants to close its ears and shelter itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for that rambling. I was almost just trying to get my thoughts together there.

       I love this interaction... You are wise and intelligent.  But please, in any preceding posts, work to extrapolate and provide a better synopsis of your idea... This boarders on TL;DR...
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I did read.  Neat theory.  It is plausible that streaming and the technology era changed demographics and the zeitgeist so quickly and so drastically as to reduce humanity to the 'lowest common denominator' as you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my counter to that would be... In the not too distant past, the leaders of the black community whom became famous (some of them rappers) were leaders who spoke for the community's plight, for their suffering.  This is not so anymore.  I don't believe the change in technology is enough for this to be the case, as it represents human viewpoints.  But it is possible.  Similar to a pair of aces losing on a poker table. :)

       Definitely was TL;DR. I was rambling for sure, it's not an issue I think about often so I was trying to get the writing on the wall so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I definitely agree that there's been a shift so to speak on how issues are fought for. It's possible that today's younger black generation is far enough removed that they no longer really care about their plight as much as their forefathers once did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought about something, and maybe you can shed light on it. It might even contradict myself. Tupac was considered one of the largest "dissenter" rappers, but his most famous song (arguably anyway) is California Love, which is almost a precursor to the kind of music today. Is it possible that aspiring rappers looked at California Love and said to themselves "Wow, tupac's biggest song wasn't deep, but shallow party music...maybe he was on to something".

       Yes it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe one of Tupac's song's is responsible for the entire pop rap industry today being pro establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if that is the reason, but there is definitely an impetuous, a REASON.  Because an entire music industry doesn't change it's core message in a decade without some doing.

       Most rappers now-a-days are faggots who sell them selves out to an audience which further continues the cycle of materialism and barbarism. Get money, fuck bitches. Buy the newest car, buy the newest kicks, fucking party and do stupid shit. It's not just rap, but popular culture as a whole. YOLO nigga, and fuck you if you aint doin you. Doin you means, make money, buy worthless shit and claim "status" (even though it's worthless). It's a never ending cycle and is genius, these CEO's of these record labels know. It's a never ending consumer base, who buy the shit. Rinse and repeat.

       That is very true, yet it wasn't always the case.  At least not to this extent.  I'm wondering why that shift in consciousness occurred?  Was it natural, as you say, just a result of economics and selling out.  Or, was there some hidden work at play, allowing the rap industry to change so quickly, and so favorably for established power interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, let's be honest.  In raps early years, and on through its continued development, it was the most anti establishment music out there.

       There was definitely a control mechanism behind it, you see it in the 90's and after the West/East coast feud. It was getting deep and political, so you had faggots like Sisco and others. Made it more about partying and happy go lucky (materialism/partying). Not saying it wasn't there before, but after tupac and biggie died, shit started to change. Look at puff daddy and master P, lulz. I think it was done on purpose and once these two influence figures were gone, they changed the game and the rest sold out. If you didn't you went indie.

       The song has many levels...  One great thing about art is that it can simultaneously speak to multiple levels of thinking, as well as lifestyles.  Tupac was a master of this, as are most high level poets and wordsmiths.

       Well, the main point of the song is. He had gotten to a level where many people were listening. Looking at the world through the rear view, means that you are always worried someone is coming from behind to attack you. He knew he was being targeted and lived a life of justified paranoia, of someone being after him, hence "staring at the world through the rear view". Which is why I mentioned it. You can say all you want, once you get the attention of others, you better be looking at life through the rear view. That is my point.

       The black community or people in general? You are missing his point. Poverty/outlaws/"hoodlums"/etc are not just Black, there are also Whites, Hispanics and others. This is why his message resonated amongst all racial lines and why he was so popular. Hence, what happened to him. You should open your mind a little to what Tupac was saying.

       I believe that it was a shift in orders and direction from the owners. I believe that Death Row Records was owned by all African Americans and I think most of the popular labels are now owned by Caucasian or Jewish men. I could be wrong. I haven't researched much into it, but I remember making those observations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's interesting to see all the bad things that happened to most of the owners of Death Row Records.

       I'm not sure about the details... Though they are interesting to conjecture over.  I do see something clear.  A veering.  I see the entire mainstream rap industry coalescing to the same message, Obey.  And it is fairly recent, and unmentioned.

       I think that the music can be good because it's catchy, but I don't know if I've heard anything incredible that comes from mainstream. Can you show me some?

      <p>
       Ya know, that song is pretty intense. I don't know how to describe it, but it felt like a pattern of relaxing sounds followed by adrenaline/anxiety sounds. I don't know if that makes sense lol. Pretty good though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does the message matter to you? It may just be easier to have others relate to them by conveying a message that is more common and simple to rap about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still feel it's because they are controlled now and because there are few left that aren't threatened or scared or are willing to pass up the money and fame. Tupac, Biggie, and DMX might have been served as warnings.

       It's not catchy or dope, the music today is all auto-tuned, recycled, remixed and sucks. This shows the dumbing down of people. That link you linked to was honestly the dumbest song I've heard. I'm not a fan of rap, but that shit was horrendous.

       The bigger picture is, dumbing down people who think that is a good tune. There is nothing of substance, literally nothing. If people in the US think this is music, fuck off, I'm moving to Iceland and good riddance. Soon the US will be filling a theatre laughing at a 1 hour film of an ass and farts, idiocracy much?

       All music has. Listen to all types of genres. You seem to be small minded, all music has changed. Rock, Rap, Punk, Country, etc all have changed. It's all pop, and they fill a genre void. Wanna hear a music industry that has been untouched for the most part?

       the US counter parts have been but there are many artists across the world that haven't been and some in the US, indie artists. Pop culture is shit and has always been, I'm just not sure where you are going with this.

       Honestly, you seem to be fairly confrontational.  With that being said, I think your recent posited stance diminishes and debases my proposed idea, pointing to some larger (amorphous) issue... Which in my view is not all that productive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come across you in completely unaffiliated posts, and you have opposed me there as well.  I'm not sure why you enjoy this, but it is a real thing.  Potentially you have had some success in doing this, therefore look to work this strategy in every post, regardless of it's premise.  I don't know...  But, ultimately I think it's cool.  Because your devil's advocate approach often elicits powerful and lasting ideas.

       I do agree to disagree. But, that is not the point of what I'm saying. There is a bigger agenda, and I'm simply asking you to observe it. It's not just rap. All music has changed, because
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       want a specific agenda to be displayed/propagandized to the public. I agree with everything that you have said, I'm just saying it's bigger than just "rap". I'll move on though, nice discussing this issue with you and cheers!

       *First of all, in one of the previous discussions, we had a great back and forth about art and it's affect on people en masse.  It was powerful and profound.  We should congratulate both of ourselves (patting myself on back :D  )
      </p>
      <p>
       ...continuing forward with this new line of thinking...

       Fair enough... All music has changed.  But you must admit, there is a spectrum in influential music on the masses.  Mozart is not going to affect the populace as much as rage against the machine.  :)
      </p>
      <p>
       After accepting this, we can look at rap specifically.  Rap, as opposed to most other music (country, rock, jazz, classical) has been stubbornly anti establishment (that is until recently, hence the point of my submission.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, It should be noted that the most anti establishment music, is now pro establishment. Disguised under sophisticated and artistic beats and lyrics.

       Rap is not the only anti-establishment music. Punk, rock and hell even Folk have always been. Look at the 60's music and now. It's a concerted effort to stomp out all anti-establishment music. Listen to some Bob Marley, some Bob Dylan, some Sex Pistols, some Nirvana. It's all catchy and retarded these days. Rock is about being drunk and owning a mansion, Country is about being poor but loving the Country (no matter what). Well, WTF is this country? Rap is about popping bottles and fucking hoes. Pop music is all about being you, drink, be gay, be a tranny, YOLO. It's a mass agenda, realize this. EDM is catchy, why do you think rap is mostly EDM? It's a electro beat. What is EDM, and listen to it while you research that culture. Dig deeper, is all I"m saying.

       I completely agree, punk is also very anti establishment.  So is heavy metal...  Good point about Marley... Though the current state of reggae has digressed, like rap.  Reggae WAS very anti establishment at one point, no more :).

       I know, it sucks. You have to suck the CEO's dick to get a check. You have people selling out, because they need to live/eat/survive. There isn't much money in signing against the man, when that man will pay you. If you do, well, how will you pay that credit card or that mortgage? They have us by the bawls.  I do not blame artists, I understand, I just wished we lived in a world that was different. Which it could be, if they stopped sucking the dick. But then they are poor, see the vicious cycle?

       "Suck the CEO's dick" does go against the other proffered perspectives under the umbrella that is this submission, stating that 'streaming' and new tech has created an environ where CEO's have less power.

       I believe this to be a reductionist opinion that needs a vigilant and complex eye... Which I have attempted to provide in other inserted dialogues under this submission. :)

       I'm all for tipping the artist themselves and supporting them. Fuck, I'm a web developer and will develop this. I believe the CEO's can suck my dick and the artist deserves all the profits. The internet is changing things. As long as there isn't WW3, I will participate and give them a platform. I'd like to see a bitcoin option here.

       There are plenty indie artists foaming at the mouth wanting a platform. Will it top a youtube video, talking about drank and cough syrup on Tuesday? No, but it's a foot in the door. Fuck youtube and fuck public propaganda. Baby steps, people will catch on and the Callie know, how a wildfire grows ;). Have faith. 1 million donate a dollar, well now that artist has a million dollars...... Think about that, 6+ billion people in the world. Most of us are pissed off.

       This submission is not referring to fringe indie artists. though they may change the rap industry landscape in the future...  Rather, this submission is about the current state of the Rap industry.  Further, how the central message of the rap industry has changed from  'fight the man' to 'obey and consume'.

       Rap, like all is a fad. Everything is a fad until something
       <strong>
        better
       </strong>
       comes along. Sometimes it's unknown, sometimes it's suppressed. Think about that. Do people still listen to britanny Spears or Nikki Minaj? They are fed this, this is what they will listen to, this is cool. I suggest reading Edward Bernays, not trying to be critical, or anything, but, you seem to not know  TPTB's tactics. Are you new to conspiracy theory, if so, cool, I can give you some good resources. Lemme know. If you aren't, my bad, just seems curious.

       This kind of proves point man... We have this video, which is pretty cutting edge (even activist). However, it's been around since 2011 and has under a million views.  Can anyone say underfunded and out of the public sphere?
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, Drakes videos telling users you only live once (so do whatever you can to live in the moment, hedonistic materialism)  They have over 10 million views, and they are not alone...  The most popular rap voices are not antagonistic to the system.  They perpetuate it.  This WAS NOT THE CASE even ten years ago.

       I agree, but I feel like that's true for pretty much all music. There's a ton of classic rock songs that were very political. Nowadays all you hear on the radio is pop rock. And now I want some Pop Rocks

       Rock/Metal are the only genres that regularly speaks out against stuff like this. It is considered a "rebel" genre, so it's no surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a song from Disturbed, their new one in fact:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nW-IPrzM1g">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nW-IPrzM1g
       </a>
       (watch the video itself)
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every band I listen to has a very very anti system message in a lot of their songs, Disturbed, Lamb of God, Metallica (used to anyway), Trivium, Five Finger Death Punch, Megadeth, etc etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Rock/Metal is so demonized by TPTB/MSM that it is no surprise that these bands generally go unnoticed by a lot of people, but it's certainly there, and very very powerful/popular for never being "promoted" like the other genres of music.

       Good point, about making a living...  You are right, a lot of rappers are making a living.  I was speaking more about the specific rap which was being viewed most by the public today, and how that rap has changed from the rap that was most popular in the public sphere ten and twenty years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is about the affects and influences of rap music on the masses.  And that the content oriented with said message can change the populace, which may not be a good thing.

       Maybe your mockery is just.  Potentially you are correct, and this change in rap content is just the result of the populace's needs and ideology changing over time.  Maybe the populace doesn't feel as much tension and social strain as it did back in the 90's when mainstream rap spoke of this plight.  Maybe :)

       So be clear....  You are saying that the reason we are hearing about members of the black community being shot today is because we (who is we?) are using the same outlets rappers are using to spread the word about violence perpetrated on the black community?  (confused)

       Calling bullshit on that...  But you are correct, Moore's law is obviously having an effect.  A lot has changed in the world in 15 years.  However, I am commenting on one particular change, which was drastic.  So drastic that it would be hard to occur naturally during that time span...
      </p>
      <p>
       The drastic change was for the world's foremost political and anti establishment music to be co opted and transformed into music that reinforces the current societal norm.

       The reason why rap has strayed so far from what it was is because the rich bastards realized that it was the perfect vessel to get the message across to the masses.  It's roots were real and genuine.  The early rappers were pissed the hell off.  People could tell, and more importantly, people listened.  So the powerful elite highjacked the system.  They started injecting ungodly amounts of money into it to change everyone's views, to change the message that was being sent.  Their plan worked flawlessly.  Now the masses are so far gone it's pathetic.

       I know they aren't as big as Tupac, but Prince Ea is amazing and Hopsin is decent sometimes too. Lupe Fiasco used to be around.

       Nice!
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the point of this submission is to highlight the aggressive change of course we have seen from mainstream rap in a small historical period.
      </p>
      <p>
       In  my humble opinion, the movement has changed to favor vested power interests, which is either convenient for them, or speaks to inorganic effects intentionally implemented to alter the rap industry.  Which would be fucking terrifying.

       Definitely agree with you on all points! It's amazing how quickly things changed and were mostly put under control.

       Sorry for getting off point though! I guess I just wanted to show that there are still a few that either will not or are trying their best to not play the game.

       It's scary... Very scary to see the entire industry subverted.  Thank the lord we have brave rappers still out there, I just wonder why they are being diminished and cast to the fringe, whilst rap infused with status quote is being idolized.

       Definitely agree with you on all points! It's amazing how quickly things changed and were mostly put under control.

       Sorry for getting off point though! I guess I just wanted to show that there are still a few that either will not or are trying their best to not play the game.

       I'm not sure about the details... Though they are interesting to conjecture over.  I do see something clear.  A veering.  I see the entire mainstream rap industry coalescing to the same message, Obey.  And it is fairly recent, and unmentioned.

       *and here is the most fascinating thing... The new music is incredible, it's some of the best.  It's so good I like it, even though I see the message.

       Drake track... (exactly what I'm talking about)

       Immoral technique. Im surprised anyone has yet to mention him. Im all about metal, classic rock, &amp; blues/jazz but this guy hits on some serious issues and you would be impressed with what he has to say.

       Rap is not the only anti-establishment music. Punk, rock and hell even Folk have always been. Look at the 60's music and now. It's a concerted effort to stomp out all anti-establishment music. Listen to some Bob Marley, some Bob Dylan, some Sex Pistols, some Nirvana. It's all catchy and retarded these days. Rock is about being drunk and owning a mansion, Country is about being poor but loving the Country (no matter what). Well, WTF is this country? Rap is about popping bottles and fucking hoes. Pop music is all about being you, drink, be gay, be a tranny, YOLO. It's a mass agenda, realize this. EDM is catchy, why do you think rap is mostly EDM? It's a electro beat. What is EDM, and listen to it while you research that culture. Dig deeper, is all I"m saying.
