       All this stuff coming out of the news...  total made up BS.  Stop listening.   Stop thinking about the news you are "hearing" from inside this bubble.  It's pretty much all being used to control you to make a choice.  In the end, you'll have acted out in the manner of which your true character will not long have the ability to hide itself.  The chips will fall, and everyone will have a time to be examined, judged, and treated for their fears.  Some, will have more treatment time than others.  Some will see it as the most painful time of their lives. But for a very few, and I'm talking a rare set all over the world, it will be their awakening to a long happy life filled with others who are happy.  Sexy time for life for them.  They will age slower, be healthier, and their ability to make others want to screw them, will never fade.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't be funny if a rich man was determined by how often he smiled, how often he got effortlessly laid?  Would it be nice if people wanted to just be taught about the human potentional for happiness and money was just thrown at these truely happy people?
      </p>
      <p>
       To be rich will be a very rare thing.  Those people who act for the betterment of others and focus less on themselves in spite of their fears.  That's the type of rich fucker I've always wanted to be and I know it might be possible that I could fall and become a biff.  But what a fuck'n ride huh?   Down with fear!  Down with hate!  Lets go party like is 1988!!!

       Don't have fun for yourself.  Look into other people, see their lives, life out their fears and pains in your mind.  It's the last ever chance to prove to yourself that you are truly good and should be valued.  If you live only for yourself and only want to gain for yourself...  You'll probably just put a bullet in your head shortly after the version of the world shifts into something completely different....  I know I won't...

       I like your thinking, to me, being rich isn't just physical.  You can be physically rich, mentally rich, spiritually rich, and emotionally rich.  It's really up to you to decide where you want to be rich, but sadly enough you can't have all 4.  If I'm reading your post right, (which is quite possible I'm not, it's 3 a.m. here) then you appear to be emotionally and perhaps spiritually rich.  You seem to understand that we are all connected in an emotional, deep, way.  I've dreamed that one day we will all be like this, and I hope that it happens soon.  Perhaps one day we will learn to love everyone and all be happy.  No fighting over religion, no fighting over race, no policing needed, just everyone being happy.  It might just be some half-awake hippy thinking I'm doing right now, but that seems like a damn good life to live.  To really love others, you must learn to love yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       To OP and to anyone else who cares to read this, I love you.  Here's to a better life, and hopefully we all become rich in our own, magnificent way.

       It's pretty simple concept.  If you need a streamlined version of this...  watch, read, listen to the ...... (ssshhhh...)  Secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty simple, the more you give, the more you shall see in kind a selfless return.  Basically the harder you work for your own success you will eventually be given back more energy.  We're like power generators for the universe.  We can generate negative voltage or positive voltage.
