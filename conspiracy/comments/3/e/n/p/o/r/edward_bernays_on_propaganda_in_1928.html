        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>THE conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.</strong></p>

<p><strong>We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society</strong></p>

<p><strong>So the question naturally arose: If we understand the mechanism and motives of the group mind, is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to our will without their knowing it?</strong></p>

<p><strong>The recent practice of propaganda has proved that it is possible, at least up to a certain point and within certain limits. Mass psychology is as yet far from being an exact science and the mysteries of human motivation are by no means all revealed. But at least theory and practice have combined with sufficient success to permit us to know that in certain cases we can effect some change in public opinion with a fair degree of accuracy by operating a certain mechanism, just as the motorist can regulate the speed of his car by manipulating the flow of gasoline. Propaganda is not a science in the laboratory sense, but it is no longer entirely the empirical affair that it was before the advent of the study of mass psychology. It is now scientific in the sense that it seeks to base its operations upon definite knowledge drawn from direct observation of the group mind, and upon the application of principles which have been demonstrated to be consistent and relatively constant.</strong></p>

<p><strong>No serious sociologist any longer believes that the voice of the people expresses any divine or specially wise and lofty idea. The voice of the people expresses the mind of the people, and that mind is made up for it by the group leaders in whom it believes and by those persons who understand the manipulation of public opinion.</strong></p>

<p>Stormcloudsgathering has a video called &#39;Rule from the Shadows&#39;, a very interesting short film that goes into this. Very enlightening.</p>

<p>Yeah, I read quite a bit from people like Bernays and Lippman back when I was in uni. As you can see from the quote, by 1928 propaganda was in the process of a transition from a (usually reactionary) hit and miss affair, to a social science.</p>

<p>I think the more we know about the mind games played, the more we will be able to recognize the propaganda as it is being spread.</p>

<p>My sentiments exactly, my friend. Knowledge is power.</p>

<p>It is simple if you just know a few of the techniques used.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lost the links now, but there are some brilliant posts online which explain many of the specific fallacies propagandists use and their names.</p>
