        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The more I look into the flat earth theory, the more it seems like disinfo. I have looked into the subject extensively and can completely understand why people buy into it. Flat earth will suck you in. If its true, it would be the mother of all conspiracies. But thats the point. Its designed to consume the energy behind the truth movement. It also acts as a blanket conspiracy. Once you start to question the legitimacy of certain subjects, (i.e. NASA, Global Warming, Holocaust, ect.), YouTube is there to point you in the direction of a flat earth. When actually looking into the arguments of FE, you will find it&#39;s mostly based on denial of existing evidence. Most of the theories on the subject come from YouTubers that just figued out how to use windows movie maker.</p>

<p>Flat Earth is a double edged sword.
It corrupts veateran truthers and truns new truthers away.</p>

<p>If you buy into it, it will most likely divert all of your attention away from any and all other conspiracy theories. This is what happend to my open minded friend. Flat Earth has turned him into a conspiritard. And now he brings absolutly nothing to the table.</p>

<p>Based on evrything i&#39;ve seen:
Flat Earth is textbook cointelpro.</p>

<p>Neither did I. </p>

<p>Just I think that if someone is a veteran, that holds a degree of respectability and knowledge. Whereas anyone that believes in the flat earth is an imbecile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They should know how to use Google (or rather other search engines like duckduckgo.com) and common reason. </p>

<p>Also, people should just curb their paranoia a bit. I can understand being skeptical towards the gorevnment&#39;s actions, I can even understand skepticism towards NASA, the moon landing etc., but spherical earth theory has been around for a couple of thousands of years, it has been proven by the ancient Greeks, and by various, countless experiments, so falling for Flat Earth basically means that the person is an ignorant and has some degree of stupitidy.</p>

<p>The sole reason Flat Earth bullshit exists only to paint conspiracy theorists as fools that fall for anything, and to clump it with other more &#39;valid&#39; conspiracies.</p>

<p>Having said that, though I will get downvoted, I also believe that the anti-vaxxers are also COINTELPRO. While I understand that some vaccines may be a hazard to health, they could even elevate the risk of getting autism (but that could also be linked to all the shit that is in our food, in the water, etc.), you cannot overstate the benefit we get from them. Plus, I&#39;ve seen the same people that push Flat Earth also being advocates of the anti-vaccine movement and posting a lot of stuff with regards to this conspiracy.</p>

<p>IMHO one of the reasons for the anti-vaccines movement might actually be to harm the people that believe in it. By not vaccinating their children and themselves, they increase the chance of losing the offspring/getting sick and dying, thus decreasing the numbers of conspiracy theorists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does pique the interest, but only briefly. </p>

<p>The problem is it can&#39;t be modelled based on verifiable observation. At first, the sun would be in constant flux. When in its northernmost (central path by flat earth theory) it would need to maintain the same rate as in its southern much greater path. There is no explanation for this conitinual and constantly accelerating and decelerating path.</p>

<p>Next, since the southern path is larger, the Southern Hemisphere should have shorter days. The paths radius is longer and therefore it would illuminate less of the area around its circumference. But this isn&#39;t the case. Tierra Del Fuego has a 17:19:53 day. This is clearly impossible. There is no explanation for it. If the earth is flat and TDF has a 17:19:53 day, then the sun must be viewable from the same distance elsewhere. It isn&#39;t, if it were, night would never come to the northern hemisphere and rarely come to the Southern Hemisphere. </p>

<p>Anyone can confirm this. On mobile, please forgive any weirdness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;flat earth&quot; myth was concocted by enlightenment thinkers to disparage the church. It was used particularly to mock church views on evolution and was subsequently taken on as cultish basis for satirical societies aimed at showing the methods used by pseudo scientific ideologues.</p>

<p>Somehow, the myth has prevailed that hundreds of years ago, scientists didn&#39;t know the earth was round. It&#39;s used to showthat science is constantly advancing and that conservatives get left behind. You are taught in school that the violent colonist columbus was a brave forward thinker who PROVED the earth was round. It&#39;s all an outgrowth of the same &quot;pro science&quot; myth. It&#39;s like someone in 100 years arguing that the flying spaghetti monster is real.</p>

<p>There is no reason not to claim to believe in a Flat Earth. It&#39;s possible someone, somewhere might fall for it, but if they do, so what? It&#39;s not like you&#39;re telling people to mix bleach with ammonia.</p>

<p>It&#39;s something one can claim with seemingly the utmost sincerity and not feel the need to give a wink and nod to the truth. Say you were &quot;just kidding&quot;? Why bother? So what if people think you believe something absolutely ridiculous? You know the Earth is round, they know the Earth is round. How long can you keep up the charade? Forever.</p>

<p>Oh, sorry. What I meant to say was: Your friend is neither a shill nor stupid. There&#39;s a whole world of evidence if you only open your eyes. If you dig deep enough you&#39;ll come to find that this &quot;round Earth&quot; business is built upon lie after lie for generations. Even if you disagree as to whether the Earth is flat, it&#39;s clear enough that it&#39;s certainly not spherical.</p>
