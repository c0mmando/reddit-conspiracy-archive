        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I’ve been visiting r/conspiracy for almost a year now, and in the spirit of resisting David Cameron’s announced crackdown on ‘conspiracy theories,’ I’d like to increase the volume on our side. Here are my beliefs. Hopefully they will spark some interesting discussion. Starting with the most certain hoaxes to least: </p>

<p>Boston Bombing: This is just obvious. Look at any pictures or videos of the immediate aftermath and you will clearly see that there aren’t hundreds of victims as reported. Not going to even spend any more time on this, as the footage is just stupid. </p>

<p>9/11: WTC7. I could move on after writing those four characters, but for the sake of completeness, there was NORAD’s stand down, Norman Mineta’s testimony to Congress, John Farmer’s disillusionment with the 9/11 commission, testimony of ‘explosions’ at the WTC buildings from multiple sources, explosive ‘squibs’ captured on video, dancing Israelis detained... I&#39;m not sure what hit the Pentagon -- the entry hole suggests a missile while Norman Mineta’s testimony suggests a plane. Regardless, this is another open and shut case for a false flag, and the second part of Zeitgeist sums it all up clearly. </p>

<p>JFK Assassination: Not quite as ‘open and shut’ as 9/11, but still pretty damn obvious that Lee Harvey Oswald was not a ‘lone gunman.’ The Zapruder film showed Kennedy’s head jerking backwards. The Parkland doctors and nurses initially drew a large ‘exit wound’ in the back of Kennedy’s head. The crowd on the grassy knoll moved towards the location of the gunshots. The detained ‘hoboes’ who were immediately released. The fact that Kennedy&#39;s body was transferred to a military hospital and treated by a doctor -- James Humes -- who burned all of his notes. Dark Legacy is a great documentary. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook: Wolfgang Halbig has done some good work here. The dashcam footage showing no kids exiting the school. The videos of police first responders running in the wrong parking lot. The lack of any footage of Adam Lanza, despite the school’s reported recent security upgrades. No bodies.</p>

<p>Moon landing: Unlikely, and I am not so familiar with some of the arguments about the ‘lack of stars in the window.’ Mostly, I just think it’s odd we haven’t been back in 40 years. There’s a Mythbuster’s episode that concludes some of the photos that are often deemed dubious may indeed be plausible (re: strange shadow angles, flag waviness). What makes me skeptical is Werner Von Braun’s claim in 1953 that the fuel needed for a trip to the moon would necessitate a rocket the size of the Empire State Building. Also, the Van Allen radiation belts. How did the lunar lander launch from the moon and dock with an orbiting spaceship? The fact we haven’t ever seen a photo of the lunar landers on the moon...seems like our telescopes would have been pointed there by now, right?</p>

<p>Religion: Sun worship, ‘Sun’ of god. Winter solstice as ‘death’ for three days then the sun ‘rises again.’ Detailed very well in the first part of Zeitgeist. Not going to spend any more words on this. </p>

<p>Petrodollars: Kissinger’s greatest coup for America that lasts to this day. Quadaffi’s overthrow as a result of his announced transition to the gold Dinar. Saddam’s overthrow after his 2000 announcement that he would no longer sell oil in US dollars. I’m sure Iran/Russia/China/Syria/Venezuela all want to move away from US dollars. Not sure how much the current media ‘heat’ on Iran has to do with this, anyone know?</p>

<p>God/Aliens: I want to believe. I really do. Some of the more impressive crop circles definitely help, such as the ‘binary message’ one. Also the Phoenix lights were seen by many. The governor’s response to the Phoenix lights showed just how easy it would be to laughingly dismiss a sighting with many witnesses.  Lots of credible assertions and witnesses, but no good footage or videos, in my opinion. If you have unturned a convincing rock, please post below. </p>

<p>Vaccines: I believe vaccines have done humanity a great service. Eradicated smallpox and have almost eradicated polio. Measles is almost a thing of the past in America, and when we don’t vaccinate, disease like Pertussis have sprouted back up on the West Coast where ‘hippie parents’ vaccinate at lower rates. We probably get more mercury from eating fish than from vaccines. However, the recent ‘CDC whistleblower’ did suggest that any negative information about vaccines will be silenced/ignored...for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>Would like to learn about: 7/7, Allende’s overthrow and installation of Pinochet, El Salvador, Iran/Contras, CIA weapons &amp; drugs, the Iran hostage crisis and Reagan’s election...Gulf of Tonkin, Pearl Harbor, MLK assassination. Other Kennedy assassinations/jet crashes. Michael Hastings.  ...others?</p>

<p>Again, I’m posting this in hopes that we won’t be fooled into jumping in another futile war and directly or indirectly killing 500,000 Iraqi kids (Lancet and other medical journal studies). Please stay loud, spread the message, and don’t let the media have two inches when it comes to the elites&#39; warmongering. Let them go to war. We won&#39;t miss them. Regards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As to your last paragraph i highly recommend reading Legacy of Ashes: A history of the CIA by timothy weiner. It is a highly informative book that details the organizations beginnings from the oss to the last bush administration. Its incredibly well sourced and an eye opening read. Killing Hope is another excellent book, by William Blum who is another excellent critic of our militaristic foreign policy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for scratching the surface in the mountains of evil government cover-ups and all, but you should figure out who LBJ was to understand this Lyndonian age in which we live; Roger Stone, Barr McClellan, and Douglas are modern but my favorite is J.

The government-sponsored murder of MLK is being covered up today and every day by the Lyndonian real-time klansman-in-chief, who also continues the cover-up of the Lincoln assassination in matters which are still as &quot;classified&quot; as Oswald&#39;s tax returns. </p>

<p>Moon Landings - I was skeptical of this until I watched the Press Conference following the Apollo 11 mission. If you watch it, and you frankly you only need to watch 5-10 minutes, do this first. Think about how you would expect someone to be acting after just going to the moon, landing, walking around, and returning. Think about what they would look like; body language, behavior, facial expressions. Now fire up the press conference; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKl_oXxsQiA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKl_oXxsQiA</a>

    <div class="md"><p>Read over and all seems somewhat on track.  The one topic I really can&#39;t agree with is moon landing.  There is really no reason to fake that and I&#39;m of the impression it happened 100% </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t launch that rocket in a sound studio and half the population of FL saw them taking off.  The quote from Von Braun was made a decade before the initiative was started to go to the moon so I&#39;d have to assume advances had been made in fuel and requirements.  Also the SatV rocket is 1/3 the height of the Empire State Building so it&#39;s not &quot;small&quot;.  </p>

<p>EDIT:  The Saturn V was also designed under the direction of Von Braun himself. </p>

<p>The presence of lunar retro-reflectors are not in themselves proof that NASA put <strong>men</strong> on the moon, because the UNMANNED Russian Lunokhod missions also put retro-reflectors on the moon (and the Lunokhod 2 rover/retro-reflector is still working to this day). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you need to look closer. You will see people who supposedly had severe injuries up moving around right after the blast. Acting totally normal then later getting wheeled off as if they are death&#39;s door. Jeff Baumann is the most obvious impossibility and ridiculous story, but most of the people at that site are clearly not injured in a way consistent with a shrapnel bomb, if in fact they are injured at all.</p>

<p>There is footage of a fireman ripping up Hulkman&#39;s pants to make them look better after he walks around aimlessly with supposed traumatic leg damage. He doesn&#39;t treat Hulkman, he just rips his pants more and then goes about other business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The dashcam footage showing no kids exiting the school. The videos of police first responders running in the wrong parking lot.    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As I very clearly explained, the dashcams were not pointed at the exit in question. It doesn&#39;t show an evacuation for the same reason it doesn&#39;t show the area behind the camera. Dashcams showing the mass evacuation have been redacted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The videos of police first responders running in the wrong parking lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The videos of St. Rose of Lima show police at St. Rose of Lima. What are they supposed to show? Be specific and clear in forming rational thoughts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lack of any footage of Adam Lanza, despite the school’s reported recent security upgrades. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no security camera with the ability to record, anywhere in the school. Only a closed-circuit showing the front entrance. If they had footage of Lanza at the school, THAT would be suspicious. I have no idea why you&#39;ve decided to believe otherwise, but you&#39;re 100% wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No bodies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be illegal. The children&#39;s bodies cannot legally be shown under CT law. Period. Someday I&#39;m sure they will release a photo of the shooter, and your fellow stupidity cult members will immediately declare it a fake no matter what it shows, demonstrating why there is absolutely no point in releasing it to you.</p>

<p>Smallpox and polio were <em>not</em> eradicated because of the vaccine.</p>

<p>In both cases, the vaccines <em>increased</em> the number of reported cases of these disease.</p>

<p>I think you&#39;re spot on with all your assessments, for what it&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>I agree vaccines and modern medicine generally have transformed our world, very much for the better. However, Big Pharma is a profit-driven industry like any other, and they pretend to couch themselves in &quot;science&quot; whilst cleverly subverting the scientific process - like only publishing trial results that suit their bottom line. And &quot;peer review&quot; - this would be great if your peers weren&#39;t also in the pay of Big Pharma.</p>

<p>Big Pharma don&#39;t want to cure cancer - they don&#39;t want to cure anything if they can make billions by keeping sick people &quot;alive&quot; and paying for medicines which alleviate the symptoms of disease. </p>

<p>So vaccines, whilst scientifically sound in principle, would make more financial sense for Big Pharma if they had long term negative side-effects built in, if you get my drift.</p>

<p>Ask yourself how Bill Gates&#39; driving passion for global population reduction can possibly be compatible with spending billions of dollars on vaccinating people in the third world. Unless these vaccines, whilst preventing disease, are part of a covert sterilisation programme...</p>

<p>My mind is not made up on 9/11 or JFK, but if there is one thing I&#39;m sure about, it is that Sandy Hook was dead real.</p>

<p>I graduated from Joel Barlow High School in Redding, Connecticut. It is the 2nd closest high school to Sandy Hook Elementary, after Newtown High School.

Did you know these Newtown folks you lived near and have you checked the real estate crud there?</p>

<p>Specifically connecticut? I hear this everywhere.</p>

<p>This one &quot;conspiracy&quot; really ticks me off because people use it to push their own narrative, and I know people on town over who were severely affected by this tragedy.
