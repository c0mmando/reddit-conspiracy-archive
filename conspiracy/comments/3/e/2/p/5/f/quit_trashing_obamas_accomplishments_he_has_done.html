       Its more then just him. Why does he do things like this? For his own gain? I for one doubt that its better to try to figure out who he is working for.

       He was president 7 years ago and during that time he took more vacation than our black president. But conveniently you focus on the shortcomings of our black president and ignore the shortcomings of his white predecessors, seemingly holding one to a different set of values than another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, misdirection would be if I tried to shift the conversation to an unrelated topic. Given your previous statement that human beings can't alter the environment, I don't think this fits as I was refuting that specific point. That said of you don't want me to send you free shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico that's fine I understand, but to stand behind your point you ought to demonstrate the validity of your comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I propose you post a YouTube video of
You taking a family road trip to the Gulf of Mexico and eating a plate of fresh shrimp from the coast, and then head north to Ohio/Pennsylvania and post a second video of you drinking the tap water of some of these places affected by fracking. Specifically the stuff that lights on fire when you hold a flame to it. Then I will have a more full understanding that human actions can't affect the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Bill Clinton totally inhaled pot. And George W Bush did cocaine, but you only want to focus on the black guy. But I'm sure race has nothing to do with it!

       Black president? It isn't about his skin color. Its about his incompetence as a leader. You need not bring race to this cause I beloved shit would change for the better when he was elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its got worse. Now there is a race war. It won't get any better. He refuses to even lower the flag for dead marines killed in a recruiting station till 4 days. That's just respect and should have been done any fucking way.

       The climate change I was responding to a question that was asked.

       Lastly the dug thing do you have photographic proof they did or hearsay? We have a photo. I don't feel that someone who is in power should be in office when they didn't uphold the laws at any time in their life. That's me. Its a conflict of interests.

       How the hell can he support a drug war when he himself has done drugs?

       Oh and about the fracking bullshit I live in pa. Where they are fracking. I don't have any problems with my water. I have a well too. So your argument is invalid. You believe what you see on TV cause well that's just easy to believe cause movie pictures makes it real huh?

       I find it one the most blatant forms of disrespect. It isn't legal for one. He is to be held to a higher standard. I don't care that everyone does it. If you are president you shouldn't have until that shit is legal thruout all facets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shows he doesn't respect the laws others have been jailed for. Same thing with anyone else. How the fuck can he be a man that stands there and says war on drugs yet did drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems deceitful and immoral to me. But yeah sure blah blah weed is good and numerous other amounts of bullshit. I don't care it still against the law.

       First off no matter what anyone posts as proof its biased and will be called out as such because either they don't like the author or cause of the color of the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are all real facts you as well as many others claim you want sources well look for it. Isn't that the whole idea behind this sub is to find shit out for yourself and not take the OP word for it?

       Now about coal you say its bad for the snails and whales. Yeah know what its also bad for? Entire communities that this is all they know how to do is mine coal. It can be cleaner with modifications to plants but no you want new shiney shit cause its more eye pleasing. Fuck that modify the old shit I say. Its so stupid to just trash it when we have ways to fix the problem

      <p>
       The auto pen thing is a deal of repect. He wants to make a life changing laws he can at least be there to scribble his name on it in person. No he is busy. Doing presidential shit.

       I have a suggestion to fix this:  Property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now, if a corporation pollutes, the government determines if it's a "critical" corporation (like oil or textiles) or not.  If it's critical, they're allowed to pollute, with a small fine in the media to placate environmentalists like you.  Then you think something is being done and vote democrat or green and then say "I made a difference."
      </p>
      <p>
       How about we set it up so if someone pollutes another person's property, the people who are impacted get their property rights protected and can sue like the wind?  Imagine the results of the BP oil spill after they dropped oil on the whole shoreline of the gulf of Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under a property rights system, BP wouldn't even exist any more, they'd have been sued into oblivion.  Same for a textile company that utterly fucks a whole river.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under a big central management government system, they're protected... cuz they're so "important."
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the downside of the property rights method is there's not much opportunity for graft and selling of favors.

       That's due to over population I think. Maybe a bit to do with industry but more so that the population is driving the fall of air quality.

       Maybe you should be less to throw accusations and a bit more to pose a problem and I will counter with my theory. That's the problem in here is that you want to be a asshole because that makes you feel you have the high ground.

       This subreddit is about ideas and thinking about things. We all have different views. Like some believe we have lizard people others say flat earth. Many call them names because a label makes you feel more secure in your position cause now they are categorized. Really all that is to me is that you are weak and can't accept alternate ideas cause your construct of the world is so limited that if those were possible your mind would fracture.

       Another misdirection in an attempt to undermine my validity. Actually what I am doing is an acoustic  emissions test on a verslift deicer for a major airport. I tend to take my job very seriously since my ability to do an inspection properly is what will save lives when this piece of equipment is in service 3 or 4 months from now.

       You wouldn't know that cause you didn't ask instead you wanted to try and be funny so you felt better about your position. Yet you are still wrong. So stop with the random accusations and I won't take any further action. I wanted to have a civil conversation with you, but for some reason you want to keep attacking me. So I am asking you to stop.

       No... The list said he was the FIRST President to violate the WPA. I'm not opposed to the list and if Obama were arrested, tried, and executed for treason I'd be squarely in the camp advocating the guillotine. However, he was not the first to violate the WPA.

       I don't see why you need to separate it to party lines. I for one don't align with either I would rather shit just be right. You should be the same instead of being of the idea that either party is going to serve your best interests before their own.

       I saw that it had citations. I didn't ad them to my post cause I feel you should be diligent in finding your own sources and not be lazy. I realize its easier to click shit cause its so much simpler to mentally digest.
      </p>

       I took the time to type it all out I figured some wouldn't be so lazy to just dismiss it as hate mongering. Which it isn't. Its to raise awareness. So many people know of a few of these. Not all of them.

       75% of the comments here have been centered around a label put on me. One asked if I was intoxicated. Another something else. See this is the problem here too many have become reliant upon the ability to click something and be instantly satisfied.

       You're not funny or witty.  This is a shitpost pushing a partisan agenda by blaming one person.  The entire system is the problem.  Cynically bitching about one person makes the issue worse by focusing others on what doesn't fucking matter.  Fix the system that the man controls and the man will be fixed.

       Obama is in office and needs to be gone before next year. Yet we don't want to see that. Its better to just misdirect.

       It's just a list of unsourced and dubious Obama-rants.  Even if they were all accurate, it isn't really saying anything except "Obama bad!" It's more like what I'd expect to see on my mom's Facebook feed than here.

       Then move along. If your moms facebook has it then I am sure she has filled you in about everything.

       I don't see why so many have to be negative about everything in this subreddit. Its a growing trend that so many just want to be rude and have so much hate in their lives. Lol I feel pity for you having to mention your mother in reddit.

       You probably ought to look up the definition of conspiracy or just check the sidebar. It's annoying to come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       and see people blaming Obama when they know damn well the entire system is corrupt, that or they are just ignorant to the facts. Our elected representatives will continue to be self-serving scum until the people stand up and demand change. Lobbyists and donors write policy and form opinions in this country, ignorant people follow the script.

       You are singling out an individual in the sea of the self-serving, but then again I'm singling out your post in a sea of Obama bashing posts that continue to litter the internet.

       It would have been better if everything on your list was an actual link instead of an unsourced list that seems more like a partisan rant than anything else.

       Destroy the planet? Ha I bet you think that something as insignificant as man can impact this planet in a way that it won't heal from.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize this planet was here long before we as a species were and will be here long after we leave.
      </p>
      <p>
       For you to think that corporations are destroying this planet tells me you watch whale wars and don't stop to think about the amount of oil and diesel fuel that ship they use to save the oceans dumps back into the damn thing.
