<blockquote>
<p>The TTP, What it really is. (en.wikipedia.org) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and here&#39;s my reply...</p>

<p>Is the TPP treason? </p>

<p>In plain English, maybe. According to the definition, it&#39;s when someone from one country acts in a way that helps another country/government act against their own. </p>

<p>But is signing/enacting the TPP working with another government? Not really. The TPP (as I understand it) is something that benefits transnational corporations.</p>

<p>On the other hand, agreeing to this treaty does have implications that are potentially harmful to a country. Every country has it&#39;s own laws. These laws didn&#39;t just get put into place in a random fashion. Things like environmental and health laws are usually voted into place for protective reasons. </p>

<p>The laws in a different country might not be so beneficial or protective. Now a lot of people think that these transnational corps will use the TPP in a way that allows them to override the laws in one country... <em>if those laws are interfering with the way they do business</em>.</p>

<p>In plain English, <strong>the TPP (in certain circumstances) puts multinational corporations above the law</strong>. Allowing this to happen may or may not be treason. In either case, people should be very wary of this.</p>

<p>All the secrecy around the deal starts to make a lot more sense when you think about it this way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a solid comment and It&#39;s unfortunate that the page was deleted. You raise a good point about treason.</p>

<p>The TPP is less of a law for America and more of a law for the corporations. It grants corporations the right to act as worldwide entities, immune to the specific laws of any single nation. If this is indeed the next big step towards a One World Government, then, eventually the concept of treason will become a thing of the past. </p>
