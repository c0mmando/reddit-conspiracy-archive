       Judy Wood  talks about the controlled demolition of the trade center, so apparently she isn't steering anyone away from it. She just sees it as being done by a different weapon than the one you believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, thermite isn't that proven.
Both thermite and  thermate  make a lot of fire. I didn't see that much fire so I'm open to better explanations if any.

       Judy Wood is one of the few out there that address what caused the foundry of molten metal that was under the debris for literally
       <em>
        months

       after 9/11 and also addresses some of the lesser known stuff like

       Why do you put words in the mouth of people you don't know? What sort of disinformation campaign are you running?
      </p>
      <p>
       The disinformation campaigns rolled out by Judy Wood is a distraction from the controlled demolitions. It doesn't matter what type of incendiary was used as long as the point is made over and over again that controlled demos brought down WTC1, WTC2 and WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       The method doesn't matter. Don't waste your time discussing pointless topics as if they change the fact that controlled demolitions brought down all 3 skyscrapers. You're playing into their hands.

       How exactly does her theory about what brought the buildings down  distract from the issue of the buildings being brought down by controlled demolition?

      <p>
       Thermite /  Thermate is the presiding theory of the  weapon used to demolish the buildings   and no one shall dare deny it, but I didn't see any huge flaring of fire as the buildings  collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch thermite burn and decide if you really saw it take down the towers.

       I'm not one who thinks we have to prove what weapon they used in the first place.  I'm open to discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of verifiable proof of weaponry other than a weapon was indeed used and   where none is really needed anyway,  Judy Woods has as much validity as any other theory

       She talks about what cars on the ground look like, which is a huge distraction from the controlled demolitions. I'm not surprised you can't see that. But then again, your whole post is defending a disinformation agent, so I'm not surprised by your continued disinformation campaign.

       It's the same tactic with JFK...everyone is obsessed with
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       shot him and
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they shot him and while all that went on the
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       goes unanswered.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still, the science Dr. Judy Wood is talking about is not talked about anywhere else in any serious manner...as is the Hutchinson fellow who supposedly discovered some of this stuff. So I don't think she is a distraction but her ideas certainluy are far out enough to warrant the accusation.

       Lots of things can't be said to the truth movement that I'm part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if i should hypothetically mention the  growing heat  caused by  the friction  as all of that steel struck the accumulating pile of beams as they hit the ground? Doesn't steel sliding on steel under pressure cause heat from friction? The entire pile must have caused fresh bouts of friction as each beam hit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't each beam add heat as it slid against many others on the ground? What if that red hot friction heated pile was buried under numerous other pieces of  debris?
      </p>
      <p>
       There hasn't been another case of such an amount of steel hitting the ground before. Then the problem would again be , what caused the steel to become  disassembled all at once. That takes a weapon and it doesn't absolutely have to be thermate.There was in fact no huge flash of fire during the collapses o to indicate a thermittic reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since there is no known mechanism for the complete  disassembly of the structure  that matches the result seen, it has to have been a weapon and the government is the only entity who could have both caused it, destroyed the evidence and covered up the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree which weapon is the distraction but it is essential for our discussions that more options be looked at.

       I agree...Personally I believe in the energy weapons...it was a live test in public that had all the benefits that came along with it. Deception of the public in broad daylight, instant war economy, more rights and freedoms curtailed in the name of
       <em>
        safety
       </em>
       , cognitive dissonance (gaslighting the public), Silverstein's insurance payout, not to mention the elimination of undesirable people, information, and god knows what else.

        Judy Wood talks about the controlled demolition of the trade center, so apparently she isn't steering anyone away from it. She just sees it as being done by a different weapon than the one you believe in. To me, thermite isn't that proven. Both thermite and thermate make a lot of fire. I didn't see that much fire so I'm open to better explanations if any.

       a truth is best hidden between 2 lies. judy dustification wood and mininukes are obvious giant stinking turds in the punchbowl. if however you can spend more than a few hours digging into it without seeing zionists everywhere you are simply blind.
