<p>No there wasnt. The only security at the door was a intercom buzzer installed in 2006. If it had video, like an <a href="http://www.at-fairfax.com/images/products/Video-Intercoms/Aiphone/Gallery/JA-DAC.jpg">Aiphone</a> intercom, it would have only shown the outer doorway. Lanza shot his way though a window next to the door.</p>

<p>Watch the video:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And here we see the typical Sandy Hoaxer at work. Make a claim, then when that is thoroughly debunked, never acknowledge you were wrong, just move on to the next spurious allegation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where is the video of Adam Lanza walking in? You know there was security video, correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="/u/treerat">/u/treerat</a> has already pointed out, no, there was no security video. The sole video capability was an entryphone which had no recording capability. </p>

<p>How do I know this? <a href="http://www.ct.gov/csao/lib/csao/Sandy_Hook_Final_Report.pdf">From the files</a> (see p.17)  you claimed were sealed!  You might as we claim the Revolutionary War didn&#39;t happen because &quot;Sofia Smallstorm&quot; doesn&#39;&#39;t have video footage of it in her crappy YouTube videos. </p>

<p>Moving on.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and full body gear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20121227/newtown-shooter-adam-lanza-was-not-wearing-body-armor-during-massacre-5">Except he wasn&#39;t</a>: &quot;Adam Lanza went into the Sandy Hook Elementary School wearing a utility vest, not a bullet proof vest, state police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance said Thursday. &quot;It was a fishing type vest, a jacket with a lot of pockets; it was not a bullet-proof vest,&quot; Vance said.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s also demolish his home and the school, because that is normal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it is normal for notorious crime scenes to be demolished: John Wayne Gacy&#39;s house, Ted Dahmer&#39;s house, the Heaven&#39;s Gate mass suicide building, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/06/19/houses-horror-what-happens-after-crime.html">all were torn down</a>. So too was Ariel Castro&#39;s house. Even among school massacres, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/13/us/13amish.html?_r=0">this wasn&#39;t a first</a>, and that article explains why: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition to concern for the victims’ families, those considering the school’s fate “realized it could be very traumatic for the children, that it might just be too hard for the children who were in there to go back,” said Herman Bontrager, a businessman who is a friend of some Amish church leaders in the area. The experience of last weekend, when tourists and well-wishers clogged roads trying to get a glimpse of the schoolhouse, made the decision all the easier. “This past Sunday it was just bumper-to-bumper out there,” said David Nissley, a Mennonite pastor. “They’d like to reduce the tourism it creates.”&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the house, they demolished it <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/school-shooter-adam-lanzas-newtown-house-demolished/story?id=29877154">more than two years</a> after the event. Not exactly in a rush to cover things up, were they?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What hazmat team cleaned the school up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clean Harbors, Inc cleaned Sandy Hook as listed in Book 2, file 198991.pdt.</p>

<p>Aftermath Specialists did Yogananda.  See Book 2, file 198985.pdf</p>

<p>You can also see <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/00198991-pdf.7627/">this PDF</a> for more specifics. </p>

<p>Funnily, enough, all this information is also to be found in the files you wrongly claim were &quot;sealed&quot;. I guess &quot;reading&quot; isn&#39;t high on the list of skills for Sandy Hoaxers. </p>

<p>Now, are you going to continue digging yourself a deeper hole with additional false claims? Or maybe better just cut your losses here? For there was literally not a word of truth in your last post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve only got half of the definition! False flags are &quot;covert operations designed to deceive in such a way that the operations appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them&quot;. You are oversimplifying what a false flag is. The term means something very specific, and you are trying to use it as a catch all term for any shadowy event. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me spell it out for you: If the American government directed a CIA/FBI/NSA/DHS employee to carry out an attack dressed as a muslim, and the agent carried out the attack screaming &quot;Allah Ackbar&quot; and &quot;Death to America&quot;, and then the American government releases a statement that ISIS carried out the attack. THAT would be a false flag. </p>

<p>The term comes from naval warfare. Think of how an old pirate ship could fly the flag of France, disguising itself as a French merchant vessel, to get close enough to fire on another French vessel without raising suspicion. At the last moment, the pirate ship lowers the FALSE FLAG of France and raises the Jolly Roger flag while also running out their guns. THAT is LITERALLY the source of the term. It has nothing to do with hoaxes or MKULTRA. It is a very specific kind of shady operation with a very specific cause and effect. You keep using the term to describe any kind of hoax or black op. That is not the definition of the term however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of information on Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>First, watch the documentary, &quot;we need to talk about sandy hook&quot;. </p>

<p>memoryholeblog.com has a good article on a lot of witnesses, and first responders who either died mysteriously or have retired after the event.</p>

<p>Also, watch Wolfgang Halbig&#39;s foia hearings on the youtube channel &quot;Mert Melfa&quot;. The Newtown police department and school district&#39;s inability to answer basic questions about the school and the police response shows that these institutions are corrupt and are likely involved in some aspect of perpetrating or covering up the event. </p>

<p>And, yes, some people know the alleged victim&#39;s parents. They are real people who probably lived in the town for a few years to add credibility to the story.</p>

<p>While there are people who don&#39;t believe the story because they knew a family member of a victim, there are also people who claim to know a victim&#39;s family member that believe(or are open to the idea that) that the event was a hoax.</p>

What the &#39;Elite&#39; want to accomplish involves disarming the American people so there can be absolutely no opposition when shit eventually hits the fan. Sandy Hook was one of the many gun &quot;tragedies&quot; that were meant to sway the public&#39;s opinion on the topic of gun control. It&#39;s easier to strip the gun owners of their right to own a firearm when guns are easily accessible to these supposed &quot;mass shooters.&quot; Only problem is there are major discrepancies in Sandy Hook, Aurora theater shooting, ect. and people with half a brain are starting to catch on. Now whether or not these discrepancies are intentional to weed out the enlightened is yet to be determined, but that&#39;s the gist of it.</p>
