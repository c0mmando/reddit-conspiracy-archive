<p>Why isn&#39;t anything being spoken about this online, or on tv, or between some serious and scientifically important people???</p>

<p>It&#39;s expensive/impossible/difficult/unfeasible to make here on earth. And it&#39;s floating off to the edges of our atmosphere, and then off to space.</p>

<p>We can potentially get more helium from mining asteroids (Yeh... I know... far in the future), and that&#39;s pretty much it.</p>

<p>So yeh, any one else freaking out?</p>

<p>And no, I&#39;m not worried about going to parties where the balloons don&#39;t float to the ceiling. Though I WILL miss that ;)  I&#39;m more concerned about all the medical, technical and non-entertainment purposes that helium serves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait... This sounds important. Tell me more. Because as far as I know, we have infinite oil!? lol I know that&#39;s not true, but we seem to be able to keep pumping it out of more and more dangerous areas. If the infrastructure of the US and other countries has been shifted to green energy, like Iceland has for instance, we will be fine. Correct? Seems like we will have enough resources to get there or close to it. I&#39;d like to hear your opinion on the subject though, holocauster-ride. </p>

<p>If the infrastructure of the US and other countries has been shifted to green energy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s really not that easy. Plastics come from oil(or corn or soy, which is wasteful as fuck and still depends on gas anyway). Ore is extracted and processed using primarily hydrocarbons. Our food is farmed with gasoline machines and transported to warehouses to the store to our house with cars and trucks. Asphalt is also a byproduct of oil. Green energy cannot efficiently move those gigantic ships that say MAERSK or HANJIN on the side. No other currently widely available energy source is nearly as energy dense as hydrocarbons. We should be transitioning way harder than we are now, and we should have been doing it since the 70s instead of using oil for a cheap way to boost the consumption party. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems like we will have enough resources to get there</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible, but it can only happen if we globally reduce our standard of living and/or our expectations for future standards of living. Even if the US tones it down, we have so thoroughly exported consumer mania to the rest of the world that developing or recently developed nations will all too happily pick up the slack. So I&#39;m not betting that we solve the gasoline problem. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very easy to assume that we&#39;ll tech our way out of this, but currently there is very little political, economic or cultural will to make the changes. By the time the average person starts stirring, it will be too late, and the kinds of hypermodern post-natural resources solutions we&#39;ll be seeking are hard as hell (and probably impossible) to bootstrap. </p>

<p>I was joking. haha</p>

<p>Thorium? It&#39;s as abundant as coal I hear and extremely safe. I personally think the solutions are already out there but are being suppressed until as much power and money has been milked from oil. No reason to move forward if they have their power structure in place that is safely controlled by a finite resource.</p>

<p>I pretty much agree with this but I believe the answers are there, just in exactly all the places people are currently unwilling to look. </p>

Anyway, I didn&#39;t say it was completely worthless, I said it isn&#39;t there yet and it&#39;s not a perfect, complete solution. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying we should give up, but I&#39;m not saying we should assume the future is rosy either. The changes we really should be making(or should have already made) to avoid the worst of the worst are simply unpopular and not profitable. If existing power structures tried to aggressively encourage proactivity people would scream about agenda 21 or socialism or whatever the fuck. So it&#39;s grassroots or nothin, and at the moment not enough people care enough to actually make any real changes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty to do, but trying to find ways of extending business as usual is foolish at best. If we find any, the answers aren&#39;t going to look like a replacement for oil and &quot;green&quot; plastic and slightly more recycling, they are going to be an entirely new paradigm.</p>

<p>The US isn&#39;t in the worst of it, but the situation on the west coast isn&#39;t exactly nontrivial either.

<p>Desalinization is energy intensive. Rainwater is alright if you&#39;re allowed to collect it and can filter it, but it doesn&#39;t really allow for much industrial or commercial use. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drinking the ocean requires energy intensive desalinization plants, and what do you do with the left over salt?

<p>Clouds aren&#39;t exactly something we can just harvest when we need water unless you <em>want</em> cloud seeding.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure with today&#39;s technology, we could have a hydrogen-based blimp without it being dangerous. I saw some documentary where they tried to ignite a replica, and it&#39;s actually really difficult. Even with incendiary gunfire, it took a lot to get it burning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is the problem,</p>

<p>The USA had a virtual Monopoly on Helium in that they recognized its strategic importance early on. They created the strategic Helium Reserves. It is a shitton of Helium that is stored in Bedrock in Texas.</p>

<p>The Reason for this is that Helium is a product of Oil Fields. The extensive fields were in texas and they set up an extraction system there.</p>

<p>We were the only country to do this early on. This is why the Hindenburg exploded as we would not give Germany Helium.</p>

<p>The thing is that after WWII Helium was no longer considered strategic and they slowly stopped adding to the reserves and started selling it off.  This caused Helium prices to be very low so no one invested in new Helium Plants.</p>

<p>Helium Plants? Yes Helium is extracted during Oil extraction. It is produced in the earth by radioactive decay of heavier elements by Alpha Particle Emission. </p>

<p>So a few years ago Congress got the bright Idea to totally sell off the entire Helium Supply, this created an artificial spike in price.</p>

<p>But since Helium is being made in the earth right now  it is a mater of creating new extraction plants and bringing them online when they become affordable. Countries like Quatar are ramping up to extract Helium from their oil Fields.</p>

<p>So we are not running out of Helium. The Politicians in the move to privatize everything has taken and jeopardized the USA supply of Helium which was the world supply and sold off at below production values so no others produced it. Now that prices have jumped, Private companies are looking to put in extraction plants.</p>

<p>If we had infinite oil why would we bother fracking? We&#39;re going after the low quality, inefficient dirty stuff because we&#39;re already peaked production for the good stuff.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was joking. haha</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Green energy cannot efficiently move those gigantic ships that say MAERSK or HANJIN on the side. No other currently widely available energy source is nearly as energy dense as hydrocarbons. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thorium? It&#39;s as abundant as coal I hear and extremely safe. I personally think the solutions are already out there but are being suppressed until as much power and money has been milked from oil. No reason to move forward if they have their power structure in place that is safely controlled by a finite resource.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s very easy to assume that we&#39;ll tech our way out of this, but currently there is very little political, economic or cultural will to make the changes. By the time the average person starts stirring, it will be too late, and the kinds of hypermodern post-natural resources solutions we&#39;ll be seeking are hard as hell (and probably impossible) to bootstrap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pretty much agree with this but I believe the answers are there, just in exactly all the places people are currently unwilling to look. </p>
