<blockquote>
<p>But family and friends question why police hogtied Goode in their efforts to subdue him. It was this, family and friends believe, that led to Goode’s death at Baptist Memorial Hospital-DeSoto a few hours later.</p>

<p>“The first question that ought to be asked of them is, how do they know the cause of death without an autopsy?” family attorney Tim Edwards said. “And if he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, why did they hogtie him? It is a known risk of positional asphyxiation to do that.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One witness, attorney David McLaughlin, said the incident concerned him.</p>

<p>&quot;At one point in time, you can hear people gasp,&quot; McLaughlin said, referring to video his family members took of the incident. &quot;From my vantage point,  you can see he was convulsing and that&#39;s what had people scared.&quot;</p>

<p>McLaughlin added that what he saw before the video was shot had him most concerned. He said he saw Goode moving about erratically in the parking lot, but did not think he was a danger to anyone around him.</p>

<p>&quot;The police officer at some point in time took him down to the ground and was on his back,&quot; McLaughlin recalled. &quot;I thought that was odd.&quot;</p>

<p>McLaughlin said he told police that he was a lawyer and the methods they were using were extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>&quot;He explained to me the paramedic was with him and didn&#39;t seem too concerned,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>McLaughlin said that not long after he watched Goode calm down in the stretcher, he died at the hospital. Now he has a lot of questions.</p>

<p>According to investigators, Goode stopped breathing and died about two hours after arriving at the hospital.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know who was in charge of monitoring his respiration,&quot; said McLaughlin. &quot;At one point in the video, you can see no one is looking at his face.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The attorney for the family, Tim Edwards, told local station WREG that a witness to the incident has reportedly stated that Goode was heard screaming that he couldn’t breathe.  <strong>Goode was asthmatic.</strong></p>

<p>“They showed up in force and subdued him,” Edwards said. <strong>“They hogtied and put his face down on the stretcher.”</strong></p>

<p>By 11 PM, Goode’s mother was notified that he had died.  <strong>His wife had believed that he had just been taken to jail and was not even aware that he was taken to a hospital.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Less than a handful of human deaths have been tied in the medical literature to the pharmacological effects of LSD, and none of these deaths have been unquestionably attributable to LSD&#39;s actions. The clearest case was documented by Fysh et al. in 1985; however, they fail to explain the circumstances of the death, only discussing the toxicological assessment, casting some doubt that the only explanation for the death was LSD.</p>

<p>Estimates of lethal doses of LSD are higher than 10 mg (10,000 ug) administered orally, more than 100 times a normal moderate dose of LSD (100 ug). The administration of this amount would require the ingestion of more than 200 units of street blotter, which typically contain about 50 ug of LSD (as of late 2010). LSD has been used by tens of millions of people over the last 50 years and has been administered to tens of thousands of patients in psychotherapeutic settings (mostly prior to 1960).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, the LD-50 in mice for lsd is 65mg per kiliogram. If it were the same for humans( it would be much more than that, it is estimated as high as 300mg per kilogram) a 75 kg male would need 4,875 mg to overdose, which is almost 50 thousand times the average dose of 100 micrograms.  He didnt die from lsd. Sent from phone</p>

<p>Never mix LSD (or any substance) with LAW ENFORCEMENT. </p>

If it was real LSD then it is a lie.
