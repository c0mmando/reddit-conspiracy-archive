       It would really be helpful to get an idea of what the big picture is. I'm saying that we should connect all the pieces and finish the puzzle, because it seems to me that this sub provides separate conspiracy theories that often appear to contradict each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's what most of us consider to be factual:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Corporations have certain control over governments
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         (Some) Governments have unconstitutional power over peoples (NSA spying and surveillance, US Patriot Act, coercive power through police and three-letter agencies)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The media controls the masses
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The end goal of the conspirators is probably world domination in the form of a totalitarian government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both politicians and powerful businessmen are involved.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This isn't a political left-or-right issue; refer to numbers 1 and 2. Bigger government may not be the solution to the overbearing influence of capitalists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The global economy is being systematically run into the ground by the conspirators through debt and fractional reserve banking.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Middle Eastern (ISIS, etc.) conflicts are being engineered by the CIA but the incentives for doing so are not clear.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia and China, for some reason, seem to be united against NATO and the US.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       With this information, we should make a written hypothesis that unites everything. For example: The bankers, politicians, and corporate elites are working together to bring forth a world government, or New World Order, by manufacturing the prerequisite conditions, specifically through economic manipulation, infiltration of the government, and the conditioning of the common people. The communist/socialist governments appear to be hostile to the democratic governments because the conspiracy involves the culmination of this tension into a global war/conflict that will lead to a need for world government. The collapse of the economy due to neoclassical economics will also create a need for world government as a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, of course, there is still one thing missing from the equation: the motives of the conspirators. Why would anyone want to establish a totalitarian world government? We should be asking this question more. A conspiracy is only a means to an end. What is the end?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <p>
       Contradictions in this sub:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         fascism or communism? or neither?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         capitalism or socialism
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         east vs. west
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nazis or Zionists
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         left vs. right
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I have offered some resolutions above in the hypothesis, but I'd like to hear some different opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: This post is for those who have already come to the conclusion that the aforementioned list of points is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 3: I recognize that Number 4 is controversial. If you have an alternate view, please state what it is and provide your own hypothesis.

       Reposting my screed for great justice.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       You would think they're sworn enemies from the way story is told in school, but the Marxist vision of a centrally planned economic, social, and political order was not at all incompatible with elite plans for world government. It just needed some case-specific alterations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The international banking cartels and industrial robber-barons that had amassed great fortunes (especially during wartime) would often find their plans for the reorganization and modernization of society (on their terms) frustrated by the same "oppressive" monarchies, aristocracies, religions, nationalisms, tribalisms, and traditions that Marxism promised to overturn. By financing Marxism, global elites could co-opt its message and steer its direction, thereby covertly recruiting their seeming opposition as a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYCBfmIcHM">
        powerful new ally in their schemes
       </a>
       . Controlled opposition is, after all, the best kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, in globalists' home countries, the Marxist victim-oppressor dialectic was reoriented from the axis of economic class to axes of biological identity (i.e. race, gender, and sexual orientation). This alteration secured much-needed cover for financial elites and their supra-national "non-governing" bodies by diverting leftist academic scrutiny from economic inequalities to natural ones. It also had the effect of agitating and exacerbating those same divisions among the citizenry, rendering them incapable of unifying around a coherent political platform. Divide and rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The global elite understood that the way to sell slavery to a Western, capitalist democracy was to brand it as a form of liberation. This necessitated a revolution in education that would dispense with individual virtues, traditional values, and objective truth. Instead they would institute an ersatz system founded upon a moral and intellectual relativism that stressed socialization, consensus, and collectivism. The subsequent leftward slide of the masses effectively arrested the development of any ethno-nationalist movements which pose perhaps the only serious ideological challenge to globalist rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, for the past century or more, our schools and universities have been socially re-engineered by a professional cabal of progressive educators, utopian crusaders, marxist agitators, leftist academics, communist zealots, and other so-called "school reformers" and "change agents" laboring under the generous patronage of such esteemed names as Ford, Carnegie, and Rockefeller (through their tax-exempt foundations, of course) to, often by their own admissions, produce a collectivist, obedient, and technocratically manageable society of credulous, helpless imbeciles incapable of independent thought and political agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand how all this came about, it is necessary to study the genesis and history of our educational system outside the narrative parameters of that same educational system.

       It's very clear, war is the biggest debt generator imaginable. The neocon elite use crises to profit so they can use the money earned to further their authoritarian agenda of consolidating power amongst themselves. Whether this is done with deliberate intent or is just a byproduct of profit seeking doesn't matter, as the end result is exactly the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the destruction and relocation of natural and financial resources, scientific, engineering, manufacturing, and educational knowledge and man power into such endeavors serves exactly the same purpose as the building of the pyramids. It not only symbolizes hierarchy and authoritarianism, but the destruction of resources to support the few. It is a celebration of the spectacle of power and the authority of the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a means of control, it's sole purpose to condition the public with a permanent display of power which also serves to destroy and divert resources that would otherwise potentially be used to empower the people and give them autonomy.

       Keep in mind all of what I have to say is opinion and speculation, from which I have gathered though research and mediation.

      <p>
       The he end goal is total control over human consciousness. 
To think that material assets are what they are striving for is naive. 
They already own most of the world and it's money systems, which are creations of man, ie, not natural.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that being said, I think that soul control is what they lust. If they can control every human mind on the planet they open themselves up to the possibility of literally beings Gods  ,and then steps further.

      <p>
       Russia, China, Iran, and the US and it's allied forces are all in this. The separation is an illusion, if you cannot see through the illusion, what you are able to comprehend is very little. 
A lot of people cannot do this because they have been indoctrinated into believing this sort of this is fiction.

       Sorry in advance for hijacking this thread and turning the topic on its head but if you look into this from a religious point of view, it all makes sense. The new world order, the zionists, the control over the people.. Why does it make sense to Muslims like me? It's satans job to take as many people to hell with him. all the people at the top of the pyramid know about God, but the devil makes them chase after worldly things like money and power. Look at how our governments are. They want to be all-seeing like god. They spy on us and invade our privacy, they take and keep records of our personal lives. They want to control everything. They want to police the world. But they can't do it.. They want to give and take life like god. They kill because they can. If you think I'm crazy then fine.. But at least look into the religion of Islam as deeply as you do any other conspiracy theories. The more you look into and learn about the religion the more it makes sense. It makes sense to us why our name is always smeared all over the news. There's a reason why Isis are Muslims and not any other religion. They're targeting the people that are right.. they want us to have a bad name. Look how well Libia was doing before they destroyed ghadafi.. We are a peaceful group

       Excellent point. There is a reason why Muslims are constantly dehumanised by TPTB. Why is the corporate media so against Islam/Muslims? Why are Muslims the scapegoats in all situations, why do the elites want you to hate their religion? A few questions you probably never thought about but should.

       It is sad they demonize islam bc Islam brought a great enlightenment with it. The Muslim citizens have great legacies in math, science, and arts. Most religions have a positive respect life message. I feel religion is a personal government where people set their own limits and it scares man government. I believe religion was shaped to govern a big planet without surveillance. So much positive energy and thought has made religion a concrete reality. The stories don't really matter in that they all promote good if you read it with a good healthy attitude. The financiers that shape life want it gone so they can write that role.  Make the religions fight to kill them off. Internal peace and soul-nature connection are crucial in setting the good and sharing it. Celebrate all religions arts thoughts in a positive growing way and we will not be able to be seperated and free to our beliefs.

       Islam is a war mongering slave religion that demands that the whole world converts to your death cult. Islam is traceable back to the original Kings of the Middle East and Israel, Islam was supported by the elite of the Levant and benefitted them greatly (caliphates are theocracies which are really just religious oligarchies). Islam is responsible for the burning of the Library in Alexandria and the Trans-Saharan slave trade (which killed more Sub-Saharan Africans than the trans-Atlantic slave trade). Literally every perversion you can think of, Harems, Pedophilia and Pederasty, Genocide, Book Burnings, Public executions, slavery are all endorsed and correlate strongly with Islamic government. If anything is a tool of the New World Order it is The Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, Islam)

       Biblical Christianity is the truth my friend. Christians aren't polytheists as you've been told. We believe God is one, but has revealed himself in three persons (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). You can't have love on your own that's why they have all existed as one in unity of love from the beginning. The Father reveals the Son and the Son reveals the Father. All non-biblical religions teach earning your way to heaven through works. The Bible teaches God the Son died for our sins to redeem us and reconcile us to the Father. Eternal life is a gift of God freely given to us through no merit of our own.

       As a Muslim I HAVE to believe that Moses, jesus, Noah etc existed. I believe in the Torah (unchanged) and the bible (unchanged). I don't follow these books because each books' rules superseded the next.. Leaving only the Quran as the correct book until the day of judgement. In the unchanged, original bible that wasn't changed by man, it never says that Jesus is the son of God. Jesus is a messenger. To believe that God has a son is what we call "shirk" and is the worst sin you can commit. You can't attribute any partners with God. He has no family. He doesn't need a family to exist. When Christians say that "jesus is everywhere" and "pray to Jesus that your sins be forgiven" you are sinning. Only God can forgive you. Only God can be omnipresent. Christians wear the cross as a religious symbol But consider this: if your mother was murdered with a hammer, would you wear a necklace with a hammer on it as a symbol of remembrance? No you wouldn't. Besides, Jesus was never crucified and was never resurrected. How can our sins be forgiven through Jesus? We are accountable for our own sins and nobody else's. so does this mean that Christians can sin freely because Jesus apparently died for your sins? No. Christians are bound by the same rules Muslims are but you either don't know about it or chose to ignore it. Jews Muslims and Christians have to eat only blessed meat (halal, kosher). None of us can drink alcohol or eat pork. None of us can have sex before marriage. I employ you to watch this video:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't believe or trust me then I respect that. But if you want to know the truth then ask God for it. Pray to him and ask. Don't ask Jesus, ask God. 
May God guide you to the correct path. Ameen

       I appreciate your ongoing communications here. As a Christian, I often wonder if putting Jesus at the center of my prayers is not supplementing the first Commandment, "Put no other gods before me." [Aside: personally, I feel like MONEY is the bigger fake-out, becoming a god to so many]  But if Jesus and God are One, then that's how we get around it. Or that's what I've told myself so far, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to address the cross worn as jewelry point you make. The difference between the murdered mom and wearing a hammer and Christians wearing a cross is that the mom wasn't resurrected. It's just a murder. The cross Christians wear, is empty, signifying the resurrection. People who wear crucifixes....well, I feel differently about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, not saying you have to buy any of this, just want to point out the inconsistency in your comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do pray, every day, and ask for guidance. I know God hears me. So far S/He wants me to be a Christian, and I do my best to be Christ-like and not judgmental or full of anger and hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Islam is certainly something I would like to learn more about, and have been considering doing so. Your reasonable, fair-minded and compassionate comments here have done more to push me in that direction. Thank you.

       The most peaceful religion by far is Buddhism, they don't even believe in a god and the primary virtue they try and spread is unconditional compassion. Just look up some videos on their teachings, they literally try to cause zero harm, they often don't even kill insects (the Dalai Lama refuses to kill mosquitoes for example) . Have you heard of any religious wars involving Buddhists? 
I haven't and I don't think any exist. 
And this just shows their tremendous desire for peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to be honest I would say this applies to all eastern religions,  including Hinduism and Taoism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And btw I have nothing against Muslims, you guys are awesome, but if the cabal wanted to target the most peaceful religions as scapegoats they would start in the east.

       What a load of nonsense. Buddhists were historically the most violent 'religion' (in the eastern sense) in East Asia, and was in constant conflict with Daoism on which will be the dominant religion. Even today, the Buddhists are the aggressors in the religious and racist conflicts in Burma, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people, just for being of other religions.

       Alas I must admit my mistake - after researching it I've found that even crazy Buddhists have resorted to numerous acts of violence in the past. Despite this Buddhism remains one of the least violent religions.  The main teachings of the Buddha are of course based on total non-violence, yet the core teachings of most other religions are as well. Despite this, the eastern religions are responsible for far less violence and war than Christianity or the Muslim religion.

       You are right about Jainism however.

       The problem starts imo with over population. When there isnt enough to go around problems and ideas stem in order to rectify the issue. Make em slower, make em dumber, then make em yours to kill or control.

       Everything you see/said here is but a means to an end, and I believe that end is a restart button for those who can afford it. Imagine if the whole world looked like Dubai, but with only a few hundred thousand people to occupy it. I honestly believe this is the goal.

       We're definitely not over populated. There's a few essential things needed to support life, and we have them in such abundance, the world could quite literally support ten times it's current population. I'm talking about minerals for agriculture, fresh water, and renewable energy. We currently have the technology to turn the driest of deserts into the greenest of edens.

       I feel over population is a term that a group would make. It's more of an opinion as humans are able to manage things well. It's just idealism. The purge is about to begin.

       It is possible that Western democratic countries are the ones that are trying to dominate the world, and Russia and China are demonized by the West because they're the only ones resisting the West. This is the only other alternative I can think of.

       I loved R.A. Wilson's "illuminatus!" trilogy because it asked the same question, but while I enjoyed the realism of his answer, it is unsatisfying. He posited that there are many conspiracies happening simultaneously, and that many of them involve the same powerful actors, but because many of them are aware that they and other agents have overlapping memberships, and have overlapping and contradictory goals, it's almost impossible for anyone, those actors included, to know who is doing anything or why. Throw in some honest random luck to the equation and it becomes even harder for anyone conspiring to know if things are not going their way due to the machinations of others or for no reason at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this to be the most cohesive theory possible. Many forces are conspiring for their own interest, but due to the nature of conspiracy, are never sure if they are seeing the full picture, as it's entirely possible the people they are conspiring with have multiple agendas, as they themselves have.

      <p>
       Police officers are the most obese of any profession and are on pace to kill 1100 people in the USA this year (wayyyy more than the terrorists they cant shut up about)
      </p>

       People want glory eternally. They want to be in history books and have things named for them. To take to a globally controlled system, cement your name in history. If you create money and fund ideas that shape humanity, you might want some recognition. It is also the philosophy of shaping life like God. Most people don't get that leaders usually have very flawed psyche but are driven to completion so much, they get history gold and are idealized for all their pros and very few cons. It's just a matter of time before people set big deals into actions just for history's sake. We are all truly able to change history, shaping the future takes time to mentally move an entire species. Other wise its kill off the competition social Darwinism. Or we are just a super computer. Beep boop

       Where can I find them? How do I affiliate with them? I want to be part of this battle; I have run up against the dark occultists at least once in my life that I know of, and two other times that I suspect. In none of them was I able to be part of a positive outcome at the time, but things I did at the time later came back to have influence over a positive development.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have studies the occult, though been completely hands-off activity wise, throughout my life. I don't want to be fooled, drawn in by dark forces, and it seems like that can be a serious problem even with the best of intentions. Do you have any suggestions or experience?

       7 is wrong, debt and fractional reserve banking have existed for millenia, they are not the problem, a completely unregulated financial market is the cause of the recent crisis.

       also this "new world order" stuff has been around for a while, yet I fail to see it coming. All it does is remind me of alex jones on new years eve of the year 2000 yelling into the mic that the world had ended.

       It is how man learned to tame man. The reward system has a top. It's just human nature having parents to guide you as your brain forms. Banks have the money to fund your life. They make the money, they lead the development of your reality with it. True freedom is collectively doing better with others to overcome problems. reward is life use. Their is no need for money if the reward is use. People would collectively strive to offer and necessity would drive academia and technology. Banking was one personality style creating an entrapment system for personal gain, not for collective use.

       Nope, it's simply how finance works if you don't want to be too restricted by paper. Seeing this as the problem simply means that those who want to redirect your attention away from the real problems have done a good job.
