<ol>
<li><p>The Israeli DEA Groups were spying on the Drug Enforcement Agency and thus upon the United States. The DEA itself has concluded that they were probably engaged in organized intelligence gathering on our soil.</p></li>
<li><p>A highly regarded American journal knowledgeable about Israeli affairs, has concluded (a) based on its own sources, that the Israeli DEA Groups were spying on radical Islamic networks suspected of links to Middle East terrorism, and (b) based on the representations of a former American intelligence official regularly briefed on these matters by law enforcement officials, that (i) at least two members of the Israeli New Jersey Group were Mossad operatives, (ii) Urban Moving, the company used by the Israeli New Jersey Group, was a front for Mossad and its operatives, and (iii) the Israeli New Jersey Group was spying on local Arabs.</p></li>
<li><p>The intelligence sources of a substantial American television network report that the Israeli DEA Groups may have gathered information about the September 11 attacks in advance, and not shared it with the United States. One investigator said that evidence linking the Israeli DEA Groups to such intelligence gathering was classified and could not be disclosed.</p></li>
<li><p>The Israeli DEA Groups were comprised of 125 or more Israelis operating on our soil. Their leaders and apparent associates included military commanders and experts with military backgrounds in intelligence, electronic intercepts and telecommunications.</p></li>
<li><p>The wiretapping and intelligence expertise of members of both Israeli Groups, and the use of vans in local neighborhoods where the future hijackers were planning the attacks, and the extensive use by the hijackers of cell phones and land lines, made the Israeli Groups ideally suited to gather information regarding the hijackers’ plans.</p></li>
<li><p>The principal operation of the Israeli DEA Groups was located in and around Hollywood, Florida, the central training and staging ground for the hijacking of North and South Tower Planes and the Pennsylvania Plane. The addresses and places of residence of the members of the Israeli DEA Groups in Hollywood itself were within hundreds of yards those of the future hijackers.</p></li>
<li><p>The operations of both the Israeli New Jersey Group and the hijackers of the Pentagon Plane were centered in Hudson and Bergen Counties in New Jersey, within a common radius of about six miles.</p></li>
<li><p>All five celebrating members of the Israeli New Jersey Group arrested on September 11 were aware, when the North Tower Plane struck the World Trade Center, based on their immediate reaction to the attack and the information said to be contained in their van, that the attack had been planned and carried out by Arab terrorists.</p></li>
<li><p>After being questioned by the FBI on September 11, the leader of the Israeli New Jersey Group immediately fled the United States to Israel. His name and aliases appear, along with those of the hijackers and other FBI suspects, on the May 2002 FBI Suspect list.</p></li>
<li><p>Israeli intelligence officials have reported that two senior officials of Mossad warned the United States in August 2001 that as many as 200 terrorists on American soil were planning an imminent large-scale attack on high visibility targets on the American mainland. One press report states that in August Mossad provided the CIA with the names of future hijackers Khaled al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi.</p></li>
<li><p>The CIA’s explanation of how Mihdhar’s and Hazmi’s names were placed on the Watchlist through the spontaneous efforts of CIA and FBI agents is not only difficult to follow but, as the sole reason for the Watchlisting, hardly credible.</p></li>
<li><p>Mossad’s own information appears to have come from its sources inside the United States. All of the facts and circumstances set forth in this memorandum appear to show that Mossad’s two likely sources of information were: (a) the Israeli DEA Groups, comparable in number to that of the Arab suspects and who appear to have tracked the future hijackers in their central places of operation and in other states, and (b) the Israeli New Jersey Group, operating through their Mossad front in another principal locus of operations of the future hijackers, two of whom were Mossad agents, and five of whom appeared immediately aware of the origin of the attacks on September 11.</p></li>
<li><p>While little direct evidence supports the contention that the CIA was aware of or condoned the Israeli Groups’ tracking of Arab terrorist groups in the United States prior to September 11, the CIA’s pressing for the expulsion of members of the Israeli DEA Groups when they were detained before September 11, their failure to cooperate with the FBI, their circuitous explanation of how the above two hijackers were placed on the Watchlist, and other relevant considerations require that the issue be taken up as a part of the public inquiry into these painful events.  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So, in other words, Israel did not only NOT carry out 9/11 - as certain people allege - it did a better job of investigating the attackers than American authorities, and also provided specific and detailed warnings in regard to the impending attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately the overwhelming evidence is that the WTC demolition could not have taken place without Israeli involvement and Jews in high places. Period. The lack of Israeli casualties on 9/11 (except for a guy in a plane who was &#39;disappeared&#39;) is direct proof. Statistically there should have been 4000 Israelis killed in the WTC demolitions. How many actually died? Three. The other 3,997 have their sayanim friends and Odgio to thank for their lives.</p>

<p>Gomel Chesed Cemetery Incident anyone? This proves that this was ISRAELIS and the Goy they control and not &quot;Jews&quot; that perpetrated 9/11...a Jew heard and saw Israeli nationals talking of the impeding attack months before and went straight to the FBI, three times, only to be dismissed as a crackpot. If he were able a Jew could have prevented 9/11! He certainly tried his hardest. This is huge proof that there is no &quot;Jewish conspiracy.&quot; It&#39;s the same as always, the guys at the top knew exactly what was up... the Jewish population of NY had no idea and couldn&#39;t have had an idea.</p>

<p>And before anyone gets cute there were MANY Jews who died in the demolitions. I personally knew two of them and they are probably rolling in their graves over what Israel helped to do that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t like this conversation we are having, and I feel like a dick for participating, but for the sake of keeping facts straight, there are over 2 million Jews in NYC alone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_urban_areas">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_population_by_urban_areas</a></p>

<p>That isn&#39;t to say they are all Israelis, however. I would assume that the majority of them are &quot;loyal to Israel,&quot; (nothing wrong with that) though, making the distinction a bit pointless. Tel Aviv is the only city which has more Jews in the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were also a lot more than 3 Jews killed at the WTC. <a href="http://majorityrights.com/weblog/comments/how_many_jews_died_at_the_world_trade_center_on_911">This is an interesting piece</a>, which covers a number of methods, and comes out with a figure of between 12% and 18% of the victims being Jewish. </p>

<p>With the population of the NYC metropolitan area - the scope of your two million figure - being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area">about 23.6 million</a>, that gives about a 9% Jewish population rate. If 12-18% of victims were Jewish, there seems no credible evidence apparently indicating Jews were &quot;warned&quot; or stayed away on the day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The link at the bottom that that page is broken, so I can&#39;t verify this for myself (not sure why I even care, to be honest). </p>

<p>To clarify: I don&#39;t understand why a &quot;skeptic&quot; wouldn&#39;t apply the same skepticism towards their own arguments. I was given a totally unverifiable claim. It would be extremely easy to write a blog and pretend that I used some database for information. Anyone who comes across that blog will assume the writer originally did do an analysis of the data, and trust his opinion even though we no longer have access to it. It could easily be a bluff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t really the writer&#39;s fault if, after he wrote his piece, a reorganization or other change of a website leads to links going &quot;bad&quot;. This happens all the time: if you&#39;ve ever run a website, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s virtually impossible to avoid that kind of thing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly a lot more data than the <strong>zero</strong> which has been provided by &quot;davidtoni&quot; for his claim that &quot;Statistically there should have been 4000 Israelis killed.&quot; Perhaps you should be nagging him about his lack of response to a request for evidence. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve done my own research. And the conclusion I&#39;ve reached is that those blaming Jews for 9/11 are almost inevitably found to be peddling a nasty, neo-Nazi agenda. For the evidence simply does not back them up. </p>
