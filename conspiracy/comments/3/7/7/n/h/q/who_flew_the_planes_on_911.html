       I assume we all agree they were flown remotely? Unless we had some suicidal ace pilots... I mean, someone had to fly the planes, right? You couldn't have hijacked them remotely with the pilots sitting right there. They would, like, complain over the radio that they lost control of the planes.

       An auto-pilot program could bring them into extremely close proximity, if not taking them all the way to a pinpoint spot on each building.

       Just set it and forget it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the passengers, carbon monoxide (odorless, colorless) or a similar gas could have put everyone on each plane to sleep (or made them dead) in short order.

       This is quite possible as well. With Operation Northwoods they intended on doing swaps mid flight and actually feigning the deaths with passenger-less drones. As for what they would do with the people, you got me.

       no passengers, there was a switch made... apparently.  the speeds exceed the vmo(?) and would have shredded the wings and probably destroyed the plain before impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       the vmo is vehicle maximum .. something..  anyway it is a cruising altitude speed... these planes exceded the vmo at sea level... not possible...
      </p>
      <p>
       air is thin at cruising altitudes, not so much at sea level...

       that is all in the video '9-11 the new pearl harbor' (youtube search it)  long video and definative that it was not the planes claimed that hit the tower..

       According to Rebekah the flight termination system turns off the responder and ceases communications from the plane.

       you mean planes with wings that make cartoon cutouts in steel frame buildings?  ones that fly faster than the amount of thrust can provide at altitude?   the ones that Northwoods says are switched out?

       The planes were switched at Stewart air base (where the flight path logs "cross") for prepped military versions of the planes made to lookalike. Flown by joystick by persons unknown to termination.

       That's the thing that gets me. I believe the planes could've been swapped out with reinforced military planes and flown as drones. But, what the hell happened to the passengers if this was the case? What do you think? Did they go undercover, paid off, witness protection, or killed?

       Others have done fact based work on the "passengers" - I would direct you to find and read/watch that first. Then your conclusion will probably be similar to mine.

       You forgot to destroy 3 buildings with 2 planes from office fire!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also forgot to talk about the missile that hit the pentagon
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about tjhe satanic ritual?
      </p>
      <p>
       1 dent into the pentagon,
      </p>
      <p>
       3 planes
      </p>
      <p>
       2 planes crash, 1 miss, yet pull hte trigger or the ritual would fail..
      </p>
      <p>
       basicly the ritual failed but somehow completed.

       They were certainly remote controlled. (i think its implausible to suggest they had a volunteer).
      </p>
      <p>
       The planes were flown with such knife edge precision that only a remote control explains the maneuvres involved. No amateur-couldnt-land-a-cessna person could have done it.
      </p>
      <p>
       the way the 767 that hit the south tower flew is simple proof of this.

       Flying on a knife edge exactly on planes max safe speed limit takes unbelievable skill. More than an amateur who couldn't land a cessna.

       No. But it does mean you're on risky territory.

       Upto that speed (vd+20%) you know you wont get flutter and crash.

       Above it..you might. Flying on the knife edge gave them maximum speed and zero crash risk . ( dont want any embarrassing wreckage and old mine pits for planes to disappear into arent just anywhere).

       the entire dive...i forget the timing.

       (they went a little over here and there for seconds/minute at a time: nothing risky. By that i mean vd+20% =

       No, that Wikipedia article says "It is estimated that Flight 175 was hijacked between 08:42 and 08:46".  So the hijackers had it for at least 12 minutes, maybe as many as 19 minutes, before diving.

       What "no evidence" ?  Passengers made phone calls saying there were hijackers.  The hijackers had plane tickets, probably were on video in the airports, records of entering the country and staying in hotels etc, taking flight lessons, etc.

       Seemingly harmless question:
      </p>
      <p>
       Is flying that plane
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       that hard? Isn't that another fact we should research?
For example, I found that
       <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_certification_in_the_United_States">
        it only takes 1500 hours of pilot time logged to fly airlines
       </a>
       . This would infer that they'd been capable of flying in that first hour, having survived to complete the commercial qualifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taken a step further, in 2001 humans had been sharpening their skills in flight simulators for at least a decade as video games. My school had them in 1994, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure I could have flown the damn thing at 13 years old, having already been in the air and not needing to land...

       Just steering a plane already in flight is pretty easy, according to pilots.  The hard stuff is takeoff and landing, following flight rules, using instruments, understanding weather, etc.  None of which the 9/11 hijackers had to do.

       Saudi agents, working for alqeida, and trained by the CIA seized the planes and rammed them into towers. Because why fake it? You know how to cover it up easy? Actually crash the plane with the passengers. That's why they shot down that one flight. Not because the terrorists, but the passengers regrained control. And once they saw that those operatives would be reveiled, the order was given to fire for the first time that day. Not to stop the planes into the wtcs or pentagon, nope, just one they claim was heading for the White House, maybe... lol it's just a bs story, but you guys let the aluminium come in here and tell ya about holographic planes, and no one takes the topic seriously. I'll give ya jet fuel don't melt dank memes, now explain to me the corperate and norad responses the day before, during, and after, all while telling me, 'oh W42W, it's just a bunch of muslims that hate our freedoms', then one of us has their head up their ass and in the sand at the same time, and it ain't me.

       Excellent post. However, my latest youtube viewing, "September 11: The New Pearl Harbor," has made clear to me that the kinds of maneuvers the pilots Executed were nary possible for their skill levels, and perhaps even physically impossible for the planes supposedly used, sans modification. This is also the hypothesis of Pilots for 9/11 Truth.

       It's more than possible they droid flew the planes, but i doubt the terrorists were any more or less aware. They were just following orders and getting ready to kick it with Allah after hitting the Great Satan harder than anyone ever had, and they did.

       Reality: The cabal’s feats did not require in-depth technical knowledge or a high degree of skill.  The attackers, as private pilots, were completely out of their league in the cockpits of those 757s and 767s; however they were not setting out to perform single-engine missed approaches or Category-3 instrument landings with a failed hydraulic system – or to land at all.  They were setting out to steer an already airborne jetliner, in perfect weather, into the side of a building.  Though, for good measure, Mohammed Atta and at least one other member of his group did buy several hours of simulator training on a Boeing 727 (this was not the same type of jet used in the attacks, but it didn’t need to be).  Additionally they obtained manuals and instructional videos for the 757 and 767, available from aviation supply shops.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hani Hanjour’s flying was exceptional only in its recklessness.  If anything, his loops and spirals above the nation’s capital revealed him to be exactly the shitty pilot he by all accounts was.  To hit the Pentagon squarely he needed only a bit of luck, and he got it.  Striking a stationary object — even a large one with five beckoning sides — at high speed and from a steep angle is very difficult.  To make the job easier, he came in obliquely, tearing down light poles as he roared across the Pentagon’s lawn.  If he’d flown the same profile ten times, seven of them he’d probably have tumbled short of the target or overflown it entirely.
As for those partisan pilots known to chime in on websites, take them with a grain of salt.  As somebody who flies 757 and 767s for a living, I think my testimony carries some weight.  Ask around and you’ll discover that the majority of professional pilots feel the way I do.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Air Blackwater,” previously known as Aviation Worldwide Services, formed in early 2001, just when the 911 hijackers were in the final stages of training. Public statements said they were to provide “military training operations and aviation transport” for the U.S. government. AWS was then acquired by Blackwater in 2003, as the Iraqi occupation was getting under way... Evergreen International, an aviation company whose board includes the former head of the CIA’s air operations, has taken over management of Pinal
        <br/>
        operation confirmed that Evergreen had a close working relationship with the firm PTech, a firm with connections to the Saudi royal family and Israel’s Mossad and which had contracts to provide computer software support to the Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Justice, FBI, and the Secret Service from 1997 until 9/11. The firm continues to provide software support for classified U.S. military projects.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Anyways, there's no direct evidence of the CIA training them but they were funded directly by Saud officials who had connections to officials in the US. Also I once read long ago that the hijackers lived across the street from the CIA or something, not to mention that they were frequently given information that Al-Qaeda members were getting training... So it's more than fair to say that the CIA heavily facilitated the training

       That's is not evidence. That link was not evidence, is was just a bullshit blog. What you later stated is just anectodal hearsay. Where the fuck is your mind changing legitimate evidence?

       it was mossad agents living across the street in florida
      </p>
      <p>
       i personally think all of the dirty work was handled by the mossad, disappearing the original flights, wiring the buildings, piloting with joysticks, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       but saudi arabia was responsible for providing the patsies, and bush sr. and murdoch controlled the cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       this same alliance is obviously behind isis, as well as the recent revolts in arab countries, terrorism in iran, and who knows what else.
      </p>
      <p>
       but the plan was to strengthen israel and saudi arabia and keep the oil and weapons flowing, and to recreate all their least favorite regimes with client states like egypt where followers of islam can be controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       if they hadnt done 911 and these things, isis would still have happened but they wouldnt be in control.

       are you a pilot because reading this if you arent a pilot doesnt mean  anything... ?

      <p>
       and another ex cia secret pilot claim he have pilot the planes that hit the twi towers on many missions
      </p>
      <p>
       cant find the source anymore, all i see is the no plane testimony
      </p>
      <p>
       Here you have pilots with unarmed jetfighters who wanted to crash into the hijacked planes when passengers got control back on the plane? why crash a plane not hijacked anymore?, to not leave any trace, instead, crashing the jetfighter into the no longer hijacked plane wasnt needed because the innexperienced passenger pilots crashed it into the ground leaving no trace of the plane whatsoever beacuse of the angle it flew into the ground, almost vertical, the plane desintegrated, sources claims...

       Nah. If they were really remotely controlling the planes which they probably were it would be impossible to retake any of them. This is because the planes had specific anti hijacker tech as all planes nowdays do. Retaking is out of the question. The point of flight 93 was entirely about inspiring patriotism.

       This video shows an explosion a split second before the impact of the first plane.  A remote control device was used to tractor in the aircraft and was blown up just before the impact to make sure there was no evidence.

       I don't agree the planes were flown remotely.  Where's the evidence to support that claim ?  Didn't some passengers call on cell-phones to their spouses and say "there are guys in the aisles with box-cutters saying they're hijacking us" ?  Didn't passengers on that flight that crashed in PA rush the hijackers and try to get into the cockpit ?

       This is why I'm asking. I went on a flight about a month ago, couldn't get service and all of my texts came when i landed. I know it's possible today, although I'm not sure how common...2001 is a different story.

       People all around me in the plane make calls while we're on the ground.  Don't know how long the range is while airborne.  Probably have a more direct line of sight to the cell-tower up there.  And GSM versus 3G or whatever is a factor.  I'm not a phone guy; don't even have a phone.

       Yea ground is different. I'm pretty sure most phones don't work that high up but I know the technology wasnt around in 2001( possibly in development, but not available to the General public) and I don't believe its common yet today. I have a new phone and it won't even connect on a flight.  I'm sure it depends on the area and the altitude.

       says "Flight attendant Robert Fangman, as well as two passengers (Peter Hanson and Brian David Sweeney), made phone calls from GTE airphones in the rear of the aircraft."  So the technology did exist then, and was on at least one of the planes.

       No, I think it's more like "you were wrong".  The technology for the passengers to call did exist, and they did make calls saying they'd been hijacked by terrorists.  The remote-control scenario is a fantasy.

       I think you are the one in denial.  There is evidence of hijackers taking control of the planes and flying the planes.  Which refutes the "remote control" theory.  And there is no solid evidence, no evidence of any kind, to support the remote control theory.

       What? When did this become about remote control? I was talking about the cell calls, which are different from airphone calls... Remote control is a possibility, I'm open to pondering it but don't believe it entirely... What do you want right now? Do you just want to feel like you're right and you beat me or do you w want to consider possibilities? This is why I hate these conversations. People just want to feel good about themselves. I feel like you just searched "911 cell phone calls debunk" and parroted whatever came up without really considering if it makes sense to what I was talking about... either that or you don't know the difference between a cell phone and an airphone. Alright man, peace out. This is dumb. I am confident in my knowledge and thoughts because I've read many different sources and differing sources. Think what you want, I hope some passerby see's the things I've mentioned and actually looks into them more than just searching for a debunk and stopping there because the debunks leave out quite a bit. Good luck to you.

       OP's posting was about remote control.  That's how we got onto the whole thing about cell calls; they are part of the evidence that there were hijackers aboard and piloting the planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the whole thing about "considering possibilities" is the wrong approach.  You should be considering EVIDENCE.

       Well my opinion is that they are part of the evidence that some parts of 911 were staged or allowed to happen... The remote control thing is one possibility. I personally think they were probably the real passengers but that the calls weren't made in the air. IMO those people are either dead or living in witness protection. There a many things can be evidence for modded planes or drones. Honestly, I could even disregard all of that. The simple thing is that buildings don't fall through themselves like that. The insider trading, the saudis selling airline stock a week ahead of time, the insurance policies, the calls, the failure of air defense, the excercises happening that day, the FBI and CIA disregarding warnings... all of that is just a distraction in the long run. Buildings don't collapse like that without something getting rid of the resistance in the floors below. At the very least we should have seen people fired for the absolute failure of 911, but no, we saw the promoted if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW I would take your own advice. I've been researching 911 since I was 12 and I've changed my opinion a few times. I remember everything about that day and I look at all evidence, for and against my current opinion. I am always trying to learn. I determine what is true and what is not...what makes sense, what doesn't. Whats possible and what isn't. I'm done with this you're honestly pissing me off. You're pretentious and just assume that I am unread and uneducated. When I mention things you don't really even look into it and you try to find one sentence out of it all to dissect and discredit. If you really care to know, then look into it. If you don't then it's not worth my time.

       You're saying "possibilities" are "part of the evidence" ?  I don't think that is what the words mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you've been forming opinions not based on evidence, but on wishful thinking or something.  That is a bad way to think.  It's essentially a religious way to think.  You want there to be a conspiracy, or you want the govt to be guilty.  You have no evidence, just want to justify your conclusion somehow.

       The records have many inconsistencies, the records themselves, and in some cases the records compared to official record, etc... Calls made from air phones when it was said they were cell phones, call times, Calls that ran much longer than they should have been able to, the details in the Calls, etc.

       If I have time I'll find it, but you could find it on your own. There's not just one source, read a few, read differing opinions and go with what makes sense. I think the Calls themselves are iffy. There's also a flight attendent that wrote a book about all of the things that make no sense about the Calls, procedures, stuardesses calling the front desk instead of correct numbers. Reporting that hijackers are upstairs when there are no stairs, etc.... There's tons of stuff apart from that,. the speed of the planes for example, insider ttrading, Saudis selling American airline stock 5 days before, highjackers missing from all but one security camera....tons of oddities.
