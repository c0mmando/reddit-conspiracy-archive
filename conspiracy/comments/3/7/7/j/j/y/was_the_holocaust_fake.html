       Holocaust deniers have yet to disprove film and pictures of Concentration Camps taken by Nazis and Allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, my grandfather was among the American soldiers who liberated Dachau. My grandfather and his colleagues were not prepared for the horrors.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the camp prisoners were released.  Some were allowed to turn on the Nazis.  Also, some American soldiers snapped and killed Nazis whether they had surrendered or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       The U.S. military briefly considered court martialing the soldiers including my grandfather.  Instead, Patton covered up the incident because it would have been very bad press if the world discovered that American soldiers behaved in that manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a conspiracy of silence prevented my grandfather from being court martialed for his involvement in something erroneously cast as fake.

       The three main claims of the holocaust---(1) 6,000,000 jews were killed (2) mainly in gas chambers (3) due to an order by Hitler---are questionable, due to a complete lack of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your grandfather did not count 6,000,000 dead jewish people.  Your grandfather never saw a functional gas chamber in a concentration camp.  Your grandfather never saw or heard an order by Hitler to "kill all jews".

       My grandfather once saw a starving Indian boy, and suggested that there was a real issue of poverty in the country in certain regions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he didn't count the millions of impoverished, he never saw a slum in a city, and he never saw or heard an order by the Indian government to "take all money."
      </p>
      <p>
       So I told him that, he said something about fucking off and prick. I didn't realize he was gay, but I'm sure he really rethought his ideas after my convincing argument.

       You don't mean you googled for pics with lurid captions I am sure. You sat down in libraries from Schleswig to Saarland and from Berchtesgaden to Zeeland and read German source texts and chronicles of what happened? Please tell me you did.

       The only point that you make is the 6 million figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never personally looked at the studies that rose the official Red Cross figure from 850,000 - 1,000,000 Jewish people killed in the 50's, which then went up to 3,000,000 after the 1967 war, and then the 80's to present day saw the Jewish numbers jump to 6,000,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Zionist scholars make claims of 6,000,000+.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe in a few decades the Jewish number will be 10 - 12 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just want to add that when I say this I mean the number that "Hitler killed six million Jews." There are studies that show the amount of Jews before and after WWII being 6 million, but how does this account for those who died in fighting, from disease, or who fled Europe? What study was done that documented 6 million Jewish people imprisoned and slaughtered in concentration camps?

       How do you have doubts? There are bodies whose cause of death can be identified, documents, pictures and videos of it actually happening, thousands and thousands of eye witnesses and survivors. Where are your doubts? Also, why the fuck would you "want to believe it's real" if anything you should believe it but want it to believe it's fake because of how fucked up it is. Jesus fucking Christ

       You know, I have problems with a lot of liberal counterculture that I believe to be subversive to white countries specifically, but I'm no natsoc. I think you may have taken too many bites from the old shit sandwich if you believe the hours of film and countless documented cases of murder and abuse were simply
       <em>
        constructed
       </em>
       by the Allies to "pin something" on Germany (as if WW2 hadn't already started). All of these different accounts of systematic murder by one group, from camps spread around different countries of conquered Europe oddly all share very key details. These details also corroborate film
       <em>
        shot by the Nazis themselves
       </em>
       prior to any allied invasion, but yeah, I'm sure it will go away if we just shout our magic word:
       <strong>
        <em>
         CONSPIRACY CONSPIRACY CONSPIRACY
        </em>
       </strong>
       !! It worked! I don't remember the Holocaust anymore!

       You seem so defensive about your argument. I'm not sure why. You seem so desperate to prove that it did happen, like you're offended I actually dared to look into the details.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not denying that the Nazis didn't murder or kill people - that would be completely bullshit. I understand that. Yes, they did have prison camps. But I refuse to believe that the Nazis manage to kill 6 million Jews through gas chambers alone. It simply isn't possible.

       Calling me

       insinuates that I feel like I need to defend the hundreds of thousands of examples of Nazi murder available to you at your fingertips. I'm not defensive, I'm scoffing. I'm scoffing at how ridiculous it is to call into question the eyewitness accounts of systematic murder from victims around completely different parts of Europe. Naw, you're right though.

       Hm, I've heard of eyewitness accounts too, but I question their plausibility. Many of these people have lied about their "testimonies" for publicity and to keep selling the story to their audience. I've tried to find solid evidence and validity of the photographs taken during the Holocaust, but so far, have not found any.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it strange that many of the Holocaust memorial sites have been reconstructed after the war. In the Auschwitz concentration camp, the Zyklon B holes were put into the gas chamber rooms AFTER the war. Why would they feel the need to do that? There is also no blue residue on the gas chamber walls, which should be there if Zyklon B was supposedly used in the massacre, according to Wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its also strange that they never mentioned there was a theatre and public swimming pool for entertainment within these camps. This information alone doesn't disprove that there was a Holocaust, but it sure seems like a relevant piece of information for people visiting the camp. If you go on a tour on this camp, they don't show you that. As for the source, its from the David Cole series on the Holocaust.

       Maybe they're not the original gas chambers. The Nazis destroyed a lot of evidence of their genocide, including accounts of blowing up gas chambers, burning documents, and also mass incineration of victims corpses (the allies were closing in and the furnaces couldn't burn individual corpses fast enough).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad the allies specifically documented conditions of/in the camps upon their arrival specifically so that the Nazis couldn't simply say "it never happened". Of course, there will always be the few random outliers that are going to say anything and everything to discount the evidence, including that it was fabricated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe the US had a bone to pick with Nazism specifically. Counter to that is the fact that Nazi Germany and the US shared a
       <strong>
        <em>
         LOT
        </em>
       </strong>
       of culture, including the study of eugenics. With that being the case, I don't see any reason that the allies would just make it up. For what? We were already balls deep in Europe by the time we found these camps. What did we have to gain? Where is the motivation? You think Eisenhower just hated the Nazis so much that on top of being a General ordering men to kill them, he also needed to construct elaborate stages in which to film fake starving prisoners, fake corpses, fake gas chambers, fake barracks, fake rail yards, fake admin buildings, etc? Killing them wasn't enough for Eisenhower so he ordered hisbmen to construct some elaborate hoax to what,
       <em>

       There's way better subreddits to do that, though. u/ramen-empire 's accusation of you wanting an echo chamber isn't completely unjustified... you didn't go to r/askhistorians (where there's already several threads with plenty of material on the topic), you went to a subreddit called "conspiracy".

       I have a hard time understanding why people choose to ingore this so often. More than one sixth of the Holocaust's victims died without seeing a concentration camp, they were murdered by the Einsatzgruppen with guns or even knives.
       <em>
        In
       </em>
       the camps, hundreds of thousands more died due to mistreatment by the guards, freezing, shootings, being worked to death, malnutrition and sickness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning the gas chambers, many of the camps
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       Germany used exhaust gasses or even just CO2, methods of killing that were pretty low-maintenance and inexpensive. Zyklon B was the main instrument of murder only in the extermination camps in Poland.

       Once you go beyond a certain point, I don't think it matters how many Jews were killed. Two million, four million, six million? We'll never know for sure. But this doesn't mean it was "fake". We don't know how many people were killed overall in World War II either - estimates vary by a far bigger range, up to 25 million - but this doesn't make the war any less real.

       It matters because in many European countries, people are jailed for suggesting a lesser number.  Also here in America, our school children are all taught the "six million" lie in History classes.  And there is a Holocaust Museum on the banks of the Potomac in our capital---paid for by We The People---that extols this lie.

       Can you provide an example of someone jailed for "suggesting a lesser number"? Because from what I've read, those convicted of holocaust denial are almost inevitably saying an

       The law and current moral climate makes it perfectly possible and reasonable to fire someone from their job, fine them, or put them in prison for "holocaust revisionism". This does not apply for any other genocide. The Jewish genocide of WW2 is literally enshrined in law as being off limits for historical questioning as if it is somehow more important than, for example, that of the Native Americans or the Armenians.

       Sorry, you're flat out wrong there. A number of countries have laws that also apply equally to other genocides. For example,
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#Czech_Republic">
        in the Czech Republic
       </a>
       , the law is perfectly clear:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The person who publicly denies, puts in doubt, approves or tries to justify nazi
        <strong>
         or communist genocide
        </strong>
        or other crimes of nazis
        <strong>
         or communists
        </strong>
        will be punished by prison of 6 months to 3 years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Similar laws, not limited to the Nazis, are on the books in quite a number of other countries, particularly those where the Soviets had their own atrocities. Your claim is baseless.

       Why should it be illegal to be a Nazi apologist? Hell, why should it be illegal to be a straight up Nazi? What is this, the Third Reich? It is a very dangerous precedent to set, that if your opinion is sufficiently disliked, you can be legally punished for it.

       Well as long as you are cherry-picking my comment, you should take the time to look into it yourself.  Ernst Zundel, Germar Rudolf, Sylvia Stolz, Horst Mahler, Robert Faurisson, Gerald Toben, and David Irving come to mind initially, as they are the most prominent, but there are others.  Or you can close your eyes, and put your fingers in your ears, and say "lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala..." and pretend it doesn't happen.

       So you're right.  Even though you've provided no evidence, you've proven to me that (a) six million jews were killed (b) mainly by gas chambers (c) due to an order by Hitler.  You can sleep easy tonight knowing that you've saved the world from someone who had the audacity to question the unvarnished ultimate truth of your wonderful and illustrious leaders.

       0-for-4. Here's the law. No sidebar at all: "The person who publicly denies, puts in doubt, approves or tries to justify nazi or communist genocide or other crimes of nazis or communists will be punished by prison of 6 months to 3 years."

       the dogma of the Holocaust is kept deliberately vague, so that it can't be challenged effectively. How do you investigate a moving, shifting target? What is the Holocaust? Six million dead in War? Six million dead by deliberate extermination? Six million dead in the concentration camps? Six million dead in the gas chambers? Six million dead at Hitler's explicit (but secret) order?

       ANY "vagueness" is either deliberate denial or your ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       numbers are as exact as a chaotic state of war allows: 6 million Jews, 3+ million polish citizens, 3 million Ukrainians, somewhere between 220,000 to 1.5 million gypsies , (they are migratory, so numbers are difficult in this case), disabled people, gay people, Russians under German occupation.
      </p>
      <p>
       this "Gas chambers" deal is just another weak attempt to cast doubt. Death marches, executions, hangings or just being beaten to death. The evidence is THERE.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most telling fact is- that no one in 50's, 60's, 70's or 80's ever doubted the events- Holocaust Denial is purely a 90's and on thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because we have a better more accurate view of the times? or because most of the people who lived then and can give LIVE testimony are dead? anyone with an ounce of brain can answer that...

       The three main claims of the holocaust---(1) 6,000,000 jews were killed (2) mainly in gas chambers (3) due to an order by Hitler---are questionable, due to a complete lack of proof.  We have the internet now, and rather than blindly believe what we've been told, we can double-check these things, looking for proof, and logically determine if what we've been told is true.

       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=auschwitz+plaque&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;hs=qMz&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;channel=sb&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=S4GgU7LiJtSuyAS4-4LABg&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=789#imgdii=_">
        the plaque at Auschwitz
       </a>
       had been drastically changed, from 4 million, down to "one and a half million...mainly jews."  And I got to thinking about the number.  I did the math---you can too, anyone can, we have calculators right here on our computers---and found out it was ridiculous.  We're expected to believe (and we do accept it, unless we investigate) that from the time of the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942 (the alleged date of the order to "exterminate jews") until Auschwitz was liberated by Russia on January 27, 1945, that Germans killed an average of 5440 jews, every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       That means we're supposed to believe that every single day, without fail, on average, 5,440 jews were killed---that's 227 killed each and every hour, 24 hours each and every day, non-stop, day after day, for over three years---mainly from gas chambers, from the day after the Wannsee Conference to the day of the liberation of Auschwitz. And we're supposed to believe that the efficient Germans felt it was more important to purchase many tons of Zyklon-B (with no receipt) to gas them with, then bought many, many tons of coke (with no receipt) to incinerate the bodies, than to use these people for labor. And just how many Germans were pulled off the front lines to kill 6,000,000 jews and dispose of all the evidence...6,000,000 people they could've been using in the work-camps to help their war effort? And this all supposedly occurred while Germany was fighting a war on two fronts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why bring 6,000,000 people into a camp by trains to spend even more money to gas them, incinerate them, and dispose of them when they could've easily put a single bullet to the base of the skull back in the Warsaw ghetto?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if "the holocaust" lasted for 5 years, the numbers still don't work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't mistake what I am saying.  I have no affinity for Hitler, I am not a skin-head nor a neo-nazi, nor a supremacist of any type.  I despise all sorts of superiority, whether it's kkk, aryan nations, muslim brotherhood, zionism, new black panthers, whatever.  Thinking that any one race is better than any other race is bee ess.  This has nothing to do with hating anyone.  It has to do with hating a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying that no jews were killed.  There may have been camps set up specifically to kill jews and others.  But I'm pretty sure the primary killer in Auschwitz was not Zyklon-B showers, but typhus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Germans were expedient and efficient, and they documented everything, including the number of bullets expended in the camps.  And though there is no documentation of extravagant purchases of Zyklon-B for "gas chambers" nor coke for cremation, there is significant documentation for the typhus outbreak.  Typhus had been brought in from the ghetto denizens, and due to the lack of medicine, the sanitation problems created when you house that many people, and the bombing of Germany's infrastructure, they had a difficult time getting a handle on it.  At one point, there were 30,000 dead in one month due to this horrific disease.  Typhus causes vomiting, diarrhea, and body temps up to 108F.  People boil to death in their skin over a period of weeks.  It is a slow and terrifying way to die.  In an effort to halt the spread of this escalating horror, new inmates were shaved, and their clothes were deloused with Zyklon-B.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google "Wannsee Conference".  Check the wording used.  Hitler did not order genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the 6,000,000, it has been very well documented that the "6,000,000" figure was used for money-making "humanitarian efforts" well before WWII.  In fact, there is a shocking book (at least it was shocking to me!) called
       <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheFirstHolocaust2003149P..pdfheddesheimerDon-TheFirstHolocaust2">
        "The First Holocaust" by Don Heddesheime
       </a>
       r, where he has photocopied many such newspaper articles claiming that "6,000,000 jews" were in danger of various horrors, and that money needed to be raised to save them, dating back to 40 years before the war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the Zyklon-B "gas chambers", I urge you to read
       <a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/16-tlr.pdf">
        the Leuchter Report
       </a>

      </p>
      <p>
       Or don't.  You're free to believe whatever you want, as am I.  You can ignore any and all facts in order to make the story fit what you've been told.

       You are not expected to believe that. The holocaust neither began with the Wannsee Conference, nor did it end with the liberation of Auschwitz - Oswiecim is in Poland, and many of the camps operating
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       Germany were only freed in March or April.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning Wannsee: there were concentration camps as early as 1933. They weren't extermination camps, but still camps in which the guards had widely unchecked authority, living conditions were terrible and people started dying here more than ten years before the Wannsee Conference. If you want a later starting point, try 1939, with Germany occupying Poland, a country with a Jewish population of over 3 million.

         Six million is the approximative number of overall deaths in the Holocaust, not the number of people who died in gas chambers and not even the number of people who died in camps (although a majority did).

       <li>
        <p>
         Look up "Einsatzgruppen". These mobile shooting squads alone account for around 1.3 million victims, none of which ever had to be put on a train or driven into a camp. Just "bullets to the base of the skull", as you so charmingly put it.

       <li>
        <p>
         Out of the many facilities used in the holocaust, only six (eight if you count Maly Trostinets and Sajmiste) were actual Extermination camps. They're all in Poland and were constructed for the sole purpose of killing people as quickly and efficiently as possible, to the point where they didn't even bother with beds or baracks because those who were brought there (mostly Jews from the occupied territories in Eastern Europe and the SU) would mostly be dead something like four hours after getting off the train anyway. Together, these camps, including as the biggest and most notorious one Auschwitz-Birkenau, account for more than 3 million deaths.

       And while you're at it, OP, please take literally five minutes to google Leuchter Report, and you'll find out that his methodology (going to Auschwitz, bringing back a few bricks, having them analyzed chemically and, upon not finding certain types of residue on them, claiming that the gassings never took place or were just a way of delousing inmates) and his results are easily criticised and disproved. And maybe don't only read the two obscure reports every holocaust denier has been citing non-stop since they came out, completely ignoring all evidence brought up against them, but also this much more sound

       Did... did you even read what I wrote? The comment you "stand by" cites three sources: the Leuchter Report, which isn't taken seriously for a reason, the Richter Report which I admittedly didn't comment on, and your own calculations about how it's impossible to kill this and that many people in a given time.
      </p>

       I just told you very clearly why your calculations
       <em>
        do not make sense

       as you got the time wrong, you got the "everyone was gassed" thing wrong, you got your Zyklon B wrong, and you chose to ignore what I said about the Einsatzgruppen and the "working for the war effort".
      </p>
      <p>
       If you choose to ignore all this, fine, I can't force you, but please don't claim "careful examination", because that would include actually engaging with arguments that counter yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, as Einstein probably never said but maybe should have, "Condemning overwhelming evidence out of sheer contrarianism against what 'we were taught' and instead clinging on to easily disprovable pieces of pseudo-information and your own, very clearly false calculations is the height of ignorance."

       There were no mass graves where they should be and the documents don't reveal an extermination program for the jews. Also the 6 million story is logistically impossible, especially since there was no adequate facilities, transport, or resources for any of this. WW2 Germany did not have an extermination program and the large number of deaths that took place at the work camps at the end of the war were due to disease and hunger because the allied forces cut the supply lines and waged war on the civilian populations. The WW2 Jewish holocaust story is a false propaganda narrative used to accomplish many political and sympathetic machinations.

       Most of the posts in this thread regurgitate holocaust denial tropes of some sort, some of which are almost as old as the holocaust itself. Long story short: there is absolutely no rational reason to believe the holocaust didn't happen and very little reason to believe the death toll was far below six million. Many of the arguments you'll hear over and over are easily disproved or are strawman arguments to begin with (e.g. that all or most of the deaths resulted from Zyklon B - nobody really claims that, there were many gas chambers operating with CO2 or exhaust gasses as well as coordinated shootings and, of course, the hundreds of thousands who were worked to death).

       and
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial">
        criticism thereof
       </a>
       , while not strictly scientific, are a much better starting point than a subreddit dedicated to "conspiracy". And if that's too shaky for you, one of the oft-cited popular scientific works on the topic is Deborah Lipstadt's "Denying the Holocaust" (more than 20 years old, but it has a comprehensive section on common denial arguments and why they're mostly BS).

       You seem so defensive about your argument. I'm not sure why. You seem so desperate to prove that it did happen, like you're offended I actually dared to look into the details.

       I'm not denying that the Nazis didn't murder or kill people - that would be completely bullshit. I understand that. Yes, they did have prison camps. But I refuse to believe that the Nazis manage to kill 6 million Jews through gas chambers alone. It simply isn't possible.

       The only point that you make is the 6 million figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have never personally looked at the studies that rose the official Red Cross figure from 850,000 - 1,000,000 Jewish people killed in the 50's, which then went up to 3,000,000 after the 1967 war, and then the 80's to present day saw the Jewish numbers jump to 6,000,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Zionist scholars make claims of 6,000,000+.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe in a few decades the Jewish number will be 10 - 12 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just want to add that when I say this I mean the number that "Hitler killed six million Jews." There are studies that show the amount of Jews before and after WWII being 6 million, but how does this account for those who died in fighting, from disease, or who fled Europe? What study was done that documented 6 million Jewish people imprisoned and slaughtered in concentration camps?
