<blockquote>
<p>An investment banker jumped to his death from the window of his million-dollar apartment in the Financial District on Thursday, sources and authorities said.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old man plunged from the 24th floor of the luxury Ocean apartment building at 1 West St. at about 10:40 a.m. and landed on a guardrail near the northbound Battery Park Underpass, narrowly missing a black SUV.</p>

<p>The man’s body was mangled by the impact, leaving one of the vehicle’s passengers horrified, witnesses said.</p>

<p>“I went outside, and the woman in the car was screaming, ‘I didn’t know where he came from!’ ” said Hans Peler, 48, a manager at the building’s parking garage.</p>

<p>“It happened right in front of our guy who waves cars in with the flag. He was so shaken up, I told him to go home.”</p>

<p>The gruesome aftermath sent tourists on an open-air bus that was stuck in traffic scrambling for their cellphones to snap pictures of the body, said workers at the building.</p>

<p>“The head hit the railing . . . Half his head is on one side of the railing, half on the other,” recalled Frank Rodriguez, 44, a handyman who was working nearby. “It’s never worth this . . . Life is too precious.”</p>

<p>Sources said the young banker had made several attempts to kill himself earlier in the morning, including cutting his wrists, before making the plunge.</p>

<p>The man — whom police did not immediately identify — was from a wealthy family in Westchester County, sources said.</p>

<p>He had apparently become very successful on his own.</p>

<p>He owned his apartment in the 36-story Ocean complex, which overlooks The Battery and New York Harbor, and had just returned from a vacation in the Bahamas, sources said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to mentalhealthdaily on suicide rates in the financial sector: &quot; 5. Financial Services</p>

<p>Odds: 1.51
The finance industry is full of people making a lot of money, yet consistently has above average suicide rates. It is thought that among those who work in the financial industry, the suicide rate is approximately 1.51 times that of an average worker. Due to the recession that hit the United States and ensuing economic changes, those who work in the financial industry may not feel as secure as they had in the past.</p>

<p>Some evidence has demonstrated a clear correlation between suicide in the financial industry and the state of the economy. In a booming economy, the suicide rates plummet due to the fact that the financial workers are likely also raking in more money with less to worry about. In a bust economy, financial advisors are often losing significant amounts of money and have trouble generating business.</p>

<p>The fact that the financial market has been subject to instability in recent years, many in the financial industry become stressed and/or depressed. Although these individuals may not have ease of access to pharmaceuticals like doctors and dentists, the pressure to “swim-or-sink” in a poor economy often leads some financial experts to inevitably “sink” and they resort so suicide.</p>

<p>Think about it, if your job was at the mercy of a poor economy, you may become stressed. Also, if you are helping others invest and they end up losing money or not meeting projected quotas, it is easy to carry significant guilt. These are all hypothesized reasons that may contribute to elevated suicide rates among those working in the finance industry.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="http://poleshift.ning.com/profiles/blogs/nasa-exploding-launch-the-council-of-worlds-at-war-over-the-annou"><strong>ZetaTalk</strong></a> on why dead bankers are showing up</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; All this is a sign of the intensity of the battle behind the scenes, where the Council of Worlds has gone to war with those blocking the announcement. The public has a right to know the truth about the pending passage. <strong>The primary villains [against the announcement on Nibiru] are the banking industry, Israel at the hands of Netanyahu, and the wealthy elite who control the media.</strong> Secondary villains are Republicans or the ultra-right politicians who ally with corporations and the 1%, and fear a rioting populace will degrade their assets. The royal family in the UK, the Queen, are also adamantly opposed to the announcement as they plan to flee the UK as it floods and drowns and want secrecy around their plans. During this war, the cover-up crowd may start attacking EACH OTHER, and the war is at that point. </p>

<hr/>

<p>&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, the bravado and bragging continues, as the elite hope that after the announcement they can go back to business as usual – saving their own skins. <strong>Bankers are still being found dead for mysterious or suspect reasons, but killing witnesses will not allow them to escape an expose. The banking industry has now begun to pressure media moguls to allow the announcement.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>we are on the <a href="http://zetatalk.com/ning/30ma2015.htm">cusp of an announcement on Nibiru</a> by world leaders. After the announcement there is the possibility of disinfo. Now that you&#39;ve seen plenty of ZetaTalk material related to Nibiru (i.e. Planet X) &amp; the war taking place behind the scenes in getting an announcement out, you&#39;ll know that zetatalk was right in warning about Nibiru (aka Planet X) since 1995.</p>

<p>relevant ZetaTalk:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would an Executive Order on cyber-security be necessary at this time? Hacking of government websites and databases has long been an issue. Where Obama and his announcement team have had to work to get access to the Emergency Alert System, long blocked by the cover-up crowd to prevent him from making his announcement, the war in this regard will shortly be over. <strong>The worry will shift to use of the Internet and various fuming media outlets with a vested interest in the status quo that will try to control the information the public gets in order to arrange their private kingdoms.</strong> It is this that will result in a heavy handed federal response.</p>
