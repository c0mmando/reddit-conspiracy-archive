       They rave and rave about how much they love hard working citizens. People frown upon you if you say you don't want to work hard. All this work that people do, and sit on their high horses about, is driving an economy that is killing our earth. Its driving a system that supports israel no matter what and labels human beings "terrorists" before exterminating them. They have convinced the world that killing in the name of capitalism is acceptable and everyone else is a terrorist. It is sickening how blinded people have become. And yet, the goverment just wants you to "work hard". "working hard" will make you feel good about yourself. But you are contributing to the destruction of life on earth. The only way to break the system is if people were to refuse to cooperate en masse. Until that happens, the world is going to keep getting worse and worse. By doing what David Cameron or Obama or whoever wants you do and dutifully working, you are ensuring this system stays in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think twice about the morals of working. ITS ABOUT WHO YOU ARE WORKING FOR, work in itself is not a good thing

       In my opinion it's the same problem with people saying "we need more jobs". No, a job is just fulfilling a purpose, a means to an end so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we really need is not "hard workers" but smarter systems and a better distribution of resources that doesn't put a few people (80 billionaires) elevated to god status while the people actually working in thier factories/offices/stores get the scraps left on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the recent debate about the 15 dollar an hour minimum wage that a lot of workers in the 12 to 15 dollar hour tier don't want, because they see prices as rising and their schooling/experience meaning jack shit when any high schooler can work at mcdonalds for 15 bucks an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is they are both wrong. Everyone should have a standard of living of around 100k a year or even higher. We could accomplish this without higher prices or serious economic problems. All that we need to do is tax the rich back to what 1950s levels are, and reinvest the money in the economy. That and slash military spending about 50%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what is good for the average person is not good for the "owners" which is why things are going the way they are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are propagandized to see "wealth redistribution" and "socialism" as bad or "communist" but in reality it's how things were in the 50s/60s, the reason things are so bad now is because unregulated capitalism quickly turns the country/planet into the owners, and the serfs. Which is where we are at now.

       I wouldn't call it capitalism when the government is in charge of the currency. Government and capitalism can't coexist, you can't really have them both at the same time. A government controlled currency is pure and simply not capitalism.

       I'm not having a philosophical conversation about the human condition...  I'm saying that if you start a "group", or go searching for a group, you'll either get in trouble with the praetorians or you'll get taken advantage of by a shadow interest.  Yes, humans are cooperative animals.  The change should come on an individual level tho.

       edit: i guess "en masse" can also mean "individually" as it pertains to a social movement

       As someone who works, I don't know if I can withstand any more 'help' form the polititians.  More to your point, work is a good thing - it gives you purpose, it provides for your basic needs and for your family.  While you should work for someone (or for yourself), just be aware of who you are working for and if it's satisfying.

       Your desire for a purpose is not inside you it is an artificial, external force. Working for money, money that is given directly back to the people who already have ALL the money in the world, isn't purposeful or righteous, it is simple slavery to a set of ideas.

       When I think of future civilizations, I imagine that they get to a point where every citizen no longer has to worry about their basic survival needs and can instead focus on what they are passionate about, something that could be considered "work" but is done for free because it is its own reward.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if you give people everything they need to survive for free, they would get bored of sitting around and would want to occupy their time doing something they like to do. Their "work" would look more like play.

       yeah if people had their lives free i'm sure most people wouldn't sit around doing nothing. People would work on their own projects and follow their own passions. It wouldn't be a world without work, it would be a world where work is wonderful and joyful and essentially the same as play. I think Karl Marx talks about this, an ideal job is one which allows you to put your own personality into what to you. For instance its far more satisfying for a craftsman to craft a chair than it is for a factory worker to follow explicit rules to fabricate a chair.

       The ultimate resource is time not money. Your jobs are giving you money in exchange for time. Eventually you will realise that time is more valuable, and you've been conned into trading it all for something that will be no good to you.

       Work is what you make of it. It's what you do. To literally not work at all is to do nothing at all. My work is husband, father, minister and comedic ham. A nice blend makes it easier for those that wish to partake. Though I hope they don't drown in it like koolaid, as I was simply offering a glass of water. As for labor, that's a good thing. It's the wage differental, the 1000:1 ratios (and those are kind, some are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay higher) from boss to not bottom, but average employee, that is grotesque. And only through using the system our forefathers did will we fix it. This whole, "just quit, that'll show em" doesn't work. I know because I tried that protest. You know what happens? Nothing, because they don't give a fuck you quit, and while you are "quit", they keep the machine going. They have no reason to pause for roadkill, and so you need to get the fuck outta the road and then dust yourself off, and find out what God called you to do. Then just do it. Like a nike commerical.

       So in other words you want to live a utopian high standard of life while others do the peasant work. Just as long as you don't have to think/worry about how the things you need get made and get to you.. Just seems like the selfish bribe that allures the gullible to communism. Then they realize they were deceived into being the peasant workers for the political class' utopia.

       the thing is, in this day and age, our productivity is so incredibly high compared to past generations, that enough essential supplies could easily be produced for everyone with very little work. There is no need for armies of peasant workers. Whereas throughout history we worked to produce what we need, now we could produce what we need with very little effort at all. There is already a massive global food surplus.
We've just been convinced we need much much more. For instance, we're told we need accountants, but the only real reason we need accountants is because the tax system is overly complicated. In the grand scheme of humanity its just wasted effort. Imagine if you took all these intelligent accountants, lawyers, marketeers, and set them to doing something useful. Imagine if we as a country really set our minds on an energy revolution. Imagine if scientists worked on bettering humanity rather than boosting pharmaceutical sales.

       work in itself isn't good for anyone but yourself. It all depends on what you're working to uphold and whether you believe in it. What is good about work for work's sake? If you work in the U.K. you pay tax. This means you are working to uphold the status quo. The very system you conspiracy theorists dislike

       True, working to grow crops and raise your own livestock I think is healthy good work.  But working on an assembly line that makes the products to support the lifestyle of the smartphone generation doesn't seem like good honest work.  Even customer service for a cable company is a helper position that simply enables the idiots that can't walk away from the TV.  People are using their sweat and stress for rich people, and getting paid barely enough to stay alive.  You do $200 worh of work but take home $10.  It's just slavery on a different grading curve.

       You are saying the very fabric of work should be despised - this is totally not true.
       <br/>
       Without work, how were you supposed to build yourself a shelter, make a campfire, hunt for food or harvest your field?
       <br/>
       Do you want to lead a life in which you don't work
       <em>
        whatsoever
       </em>
       ? Work gives meaning to life and shows you your fruits of labor.
       <br/>
       If you are a follower of an Abrahamic religion (not sure about others), there are tons of passages showing how work is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       "[...]'The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.'" (2.Thes. 3:10)
      </p>
      <p>
       How would lazy and unproductive people deserve the fruits of others' labors? You not working forces us to do work
       <em>
        for you

       You have good points, work does give you something to do.  But i agree with OP as well, something isn't right with the way we live our lives.  For me i agree that we need to work at least to physically survive, food etc.  But working like we do, having something contstantly to do, and by extension phones to constantly look at with headphones to further occupy our lives, and movies tv everything to not ever have nothing to do- this makes it so we wouldn't know what to do if those didn't exist.  People can't sit still anymore, can't enjoy just silence and being alone.. They get bored.  I'm very curious what would happen after the whole world suddenly didn't have all of these ways to disconnect and were forced to reconnect again, I really think it would do more good than harm.

       Oh yes, I totally agree.
       <br/>
       Work is important and we should all be working (if physically able). On the other hand the kind of slavery of today, whether it be physical or mental slavery is getting out of hand. So yes, while work nowadays is going too far, abolishing work altogether (what I understand from OP's post) is horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, funny I'm getting downvoted. Is it because I advocate for basic work to be important, or is it purely because I included a Bible verse? Let's remember that Downvoting should be reserved for comments which don't further discussion.

       Jeez buddy who knows about the downvotes, it might be the bible quote as I suppose some might also think of religion as a kind of mental slavery, but to each their own.  I also agree that we need things to do/things to work at, I just wish that money wasn't the driving force behind work as it is! I hope you've found some work that inspires you:)

       yeah it's just the exact definition of work we differ on."Work" to me implies that its something you don't want to be doing, but yeah definitely positive work if that's what you want to call it is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree that we "should all be working" if physically able. Maybe this is why your getting downvotes as you are being very dogmatic about it, stating this as though its a moral truth, which is exactly what I was calling into question.
      </p>
      <p>
       If humans formed a society which enabled them to live whilst spending the absolute minimum time working possible, and this meant that most of their time was leisure time, I wouldn't impose this dogma upon them that everyone "should work". If they could get away without working, I would say let them. Of course if people had a huge amount of leisure time I don't think they would spend it simply doing nothing. I think they would pursue their own goals and projects.. or maybe meditate until they achieved inner peace. If people had the right to dictate their own time and energy I think most people would spend it being creative. You could still call it work, but it would be good work. Imagine a highly automated and efficient society that has no need for huge amounts of work to be done. Would you consider the people of that society to be immoral if instead of working, they took some time to enjoy their short lives?

       Okay, I just have to butt in -
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans have lived for
       <em>
        hundreds of thousands of years
       </em>
       without feeling like they have to 'work'. 'Work' being working for someone elses wealth and accomplishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We lived longer, more fulfilled lives with more leisure time.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are more productive than ever, but work far more and there are more of us than ever in various forms of slavery - from human trafficking to the for-profit prisons.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the lynchpin is that we are destroying the planet. Apple is destroying people and the planet. So is GE. So is Monsanto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Change your mind, free it from the Protestant work ethic, and realize that - as OP said - intention is what makes real work meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
       This economy is so goddamn broken, it's hopeless. From the very core - elections - this country is rotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work for yourselves first. No one in DC or at corporate HQ is looking out for you, and the outsourcing of jobs, student debt, economic crashes, and gradual tightening of longstanding freedoms our country was founded on have made it apparent to all but the most clueless.

       We should make a big distinction:
       <em>
        Inherent work
       </em>
       is not bad.
       <em>
        Slavery for a corporation
       </em>
       is bad.
       <br/>
       Under "work", I'd also put hunting, gathering, farming. So yes, we have "worked" for thousands of years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely agree with the statement of "intention is what makes work meaningful".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I may have explained myself wrongly. Work is not inherently good, nor is it inherently bad. It's what we make of it.

       Well work implies that something was sacrificed. As someone who's spent some time in nature I'll say that foraging and exploring the woods doesn't feel like work. It's more fulfilling to simply live in nature than it is to take part in any kind of modern "entertainment". Movies, sports and television suck away your creativity and higher thoughts.

       yeah but look, if I was to say something like The US is a country, or the sky is blue, I would think it would be ridiculous to ask me for a source. Just because you don't know basic things doesn't mean I should have to prove everything to you with sources. Its just a bit stupid. But fair enough, I didn't realise it wasn't common knowledge to everyone. I guess some people just don't know very much

       Common knowledge is relative. Talk to some tribesmen in Africa, and I am sure they will laugh at all the things us silly Americans don't 'know'. Will they know USA is a country? Probably not. Will they know the sky is blue? Probably.
      </p>

       Your claim could be considered common knowledge to you because of the life you have led, and all I am asking for is one link. Which you have yet to provide. I guess that would be too much work for you.

       The whole "providing for your family" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why not just grow your own produce and feed your family virtually for free? They'll also be healthier than if eating industrial run off and such. Why should you have to spend your life working for someone else's success just because you want your family to survive, when you can easily provide for yourselves everything that you need.

       Thank you. This is my point. Work has to be done even at the individual level, to sustain our own needs. Now put years of research and hard work behind it so you learn more efficient and effective ways to provide needs, but I guess the non-workers believe their food grows, harvests, and delivers itself. Maybe they learned secrets from Wonka they just aren't sharing.

       I see. I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think that's how the poster meant it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd read it as value neutral - work in itself is not a good thing. It's also not a bad thing. It's just a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I think the point was that work as ethics/morals/values is something we've been programmed to believe because it's basically a requirement for our current society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shifting away from that perspective allows us to consider what the value of work (meaning a job for income to live, not just the general concept of activity) really is in and of itself.

       Yes exactly, that's my point, work has no inherent value, it depends what you're trying to achieve
