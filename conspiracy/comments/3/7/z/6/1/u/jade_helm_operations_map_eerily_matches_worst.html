    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. The states shown on the Jade Helm map are Cali, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Of those, 100% fall into the darker-gray and blue categories on the fatal shootings map, which represent the highest number of fatal shootings.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my opinion that is indeed an eerie match.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Alarms have gone up among those in the US concerned about an erosion of their rights under Obama. Where Martial Law was the goal of the Bush administration, to install Bush as a dictator for life, to the extent that the Bush administration even tried to create a bird flu pandemic, Obama has no such ambitions. However, he must be concerned about the possibility of rioting after the announcement admitting the pending passage of Nibiru, as must all governments around the globe. To date, Obama has been surreptitious in this regard, for instance issuing EO 13575 to allow refugees within the US to be relocated to rural areas after a disaster.</em></p>

<p><em>The words “national emergency” are trigger words as the law within the US requires that a national emergency exist before Martial Law can be called. However, the US has been under a state of national emergency in some form or another since 1933. The Defense Production Act of 1950, which authorizes  commandeering civilian labor and assets, has thus been renewed by each President of the US. Those in the US who would have been happy to see Martial Law under Bush but resent the possibility under Obama are alarmed at the Jade Helm exercises to take place in the US in last Summer, 2015.</em></p>

<p><em>What is the intent of Jade Helm and the most recent Executive Order declaring a potential national emergency upon the event of cyber-security breaches? Jade Helm has been planned for many months and as can be seen by the swath of states involved, is concerned about a mass of immigrants coming from Central America, the Caribbean, and Mexico in the event of devastating Earth changes in those regions. The exodus from Central America is already a flood tide. But more than immigration is a concern, as Texas and other red states are likely to try to secede during times of crisis. Obama wants the DoD and other federal agencies familiar with the terrain, thus.</em></p>

<p><em>Why would an Executive Order on cyber-security be necessary at this time? Hacking of government websites and databases has long been an issue. Where Obama and his announcement team have had to work to get access to the Emergency Alert System, long blocked by the cover-up crowd to prevent him from making his announcement, the war in this regard will shortly be over. The worry will shift to use of the Internet and various fuming media outlets with a vested interest in the status quo that will try to control the information the public gets in order to arrange their private kingdoms. It is this that will result in a heavy handed federal response.</em></p>

<p>And here is <a href="http://poleshift.ning.com/forum/topics/zetatalk-chat-for-may-30-2015?commentId=3863141%3AComment%3A999937"><strong>ZetaTalk</strong></a> on the elite (like Soros, who view themselves as gods) wanting martial law to be on their terms , however:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp;nbsp; On the cusp of the announcement admitting that Nibiru is nearby, the elite in America are desperate to force Obama to declare martial law so they and their assets can be protected by the military. Riots are assumed, and thus the Jade Helm exercises to start this Summer. But the elite want to FORCE martial law, on their terms. We have mentioned the fact that Soros funded the public outrage in Ferguson and Baltimore in an attempt to ignite the US into race wars. We have mentioned that the attempts to get MTV to post images of Mohammed in New York City and Washington DC was a rather obvious attempt to bring ISIS terrorism to the US.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; Now we have the addition of an Anthrax outbreak.  This is not the first time live Anthrax has been released by this Utah lab. In 2002 when live <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/govmt/g148.htm">Anthrax was being mailed to politicians</a> in Washington DC, to enemies of the Bush administration, the strain was identified as coming from a Utah lab used by the CIA and DOD. No one was ever prosecuted. Now this same lab has yet again released live Anthrax bacillus. In 2005 under the Bush administration, the CDC <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261#.VWcF0UaInV8">released a live 1957 bird flu virus</a> to over 4,000 labs around the world. The FBI concluded this could not have been an accident, but no one was ever prosecuted.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp; What will be the outcome under Obama? The Bush administration protected those committing crimes that suited their purposes, but under Obama the Department of Defense and CIA have been cleaned up, old Bush cronies put in place by Cheney ahead of his exit being removed. Under Bush in 2007, a <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/index/zeta402.htm">live nuke was removed from North Dakota and flown to Louisiana</a>, to be used as a dirty bomb by the Bush administration. This <a href="http://www.zetatalk.com/ning/18ma2013.htm">mess was only recently cleaned up</a> by Obama. Expect a similar aggressive cleanup in the ultra-right Utah labs. </p>
