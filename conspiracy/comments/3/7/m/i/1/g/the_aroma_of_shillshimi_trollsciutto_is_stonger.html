    <div class="md"><p>Well, go browse thru other subs and you frequently come across things like &quot;those tinfoil nuts over at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot;. That statement alone creates a subconscious bias against this sub, even if the person(s) it&#39;s directed towards don&#39;t view it as such. So people come here and look for things that confirm that bias and reply accordingly.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I think it stems from a concerted effort to marginalize those that just won&#39;t swallow the official kool-aid. One that has been ongoing for <strong>many</strong> years. The statement &quot;conspiracy theorists have been correct far too often to discount every single thing they say&quot; is often met with &quot;yeah, but lizards&quot;. </p>

<p>I equate it with the idea that &quot;team local sucks&quot; because &quot;one dude on the bench hurt his ankle&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the people pushing this marginalization realize that they are complicit in the continued horrors visited upon the world via their continued <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jyY6rqP_3Q">&quot;shut up conspiracy theorist&quot;</a> and their constant appeals to authority.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I&#39;ve looked at a ton of this stuff. I haven&#39;t ignored it. I&#39;ve argued this stuff and that hollow earth mumbo-jumbo.</p>

<p>Answer these questions that no one has been able to for me:</p>

<p>Where does a flat Earth begin and/or end? If it&#39;s flat and finite  then it must start and end somewhere. is it a circle? A square?</p>

<p>How thick is this flat Earth? We&#39;ve drilled pretty deep down so it has to be deep, right? What&#39;s underneath it?</p>

<p>How can you explain plate tectonics? Old material has to go somewhere, and new material has to be created from somewhere. We&#39;re talking kilometers thick material that&#39;s created from absurd amounts of heat and pressure. How far down in a flat Earth would that have to be to take place? </p>

<p>How can you explain the Coriolis Effect? That&#39;s observable from Hurricanes, or even your toilet.</p>

<p>How can you explain gravity. Everything falls towards the center of Earth (or a specific point within a body, typically the center), which is why it falls down no matter where you are. Where would that center be? Without gravity on a flat Earth, a bullet shot from a gun would theoretically never hit the ground until it escaped this flat Earth.</p>

<p>Why are we the only known, observable flat body? We can use simple telescopes to see other celestial bodies that are spherical and have rotation. Why are we the lone exception? </p>

<p>Lastly, for what purpose would people have for hiding knowledge this flat Earth? What is to gain? A big April Fools joke? That seems excessive for a prank.</p>

<p>Edit: and another question, how do you explain seasons? On a flat Earth, every inch of the planet would receive equal amounts of rays of light. This would cause a large amount of infrared and ultraviolet radiation being absorbed, causing an extremely hot planet that would have no atmosphere, no weather, just hot. Not a very habitable environment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know you have not &quot;looked at a ton of this stuff&quot;, because you don&#39;t even understand the basic model that you could see in a 10 minute video.  I will address your points.  None of these points are related to proofs about flat earth though.  You are thinking about it from the wrong angle.  You are thinking it can&#39;t possibly be true because of the coverup required.  It is much better to start with proofs involving flat water over large distances and then later work on the how and the why of the coverup.  Again, it is clear that you have yet to consult the resources that I have linked to you multiple times because you keep asking very basic questions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where does a flat Earth begin and/or end? If it&#39;s flat and finite then it must start and end somewhere. is it a circle? A square?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shape of what we (the public) are aware of is a circle.  It is ringed by Antarctica.  What is deep past the edge of Antarctica we do not know.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How thick is this flat Earth? We&#39;ve drilled pretty deep down so it has to be deep, right? What&#39;s underneath it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, we have not drilled that far down.  I believe the deepest reported in somewhere around 8 miles.  How can we know what is past that?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can you explain the Coriolis Effect? That&#39;s observable from Hurricanes, or even your toilet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The below is copy paste.  A proper discussion on this specific point requires more:</p>

<p>The “Coriolis Effect” is often said to cause sinks and toilet bowls in the Northern Hemisphere to drain spinning in one direction while in the Southern Hemisphere causing them to spin the opposite way, thus providing proof of the spinning ball-Earth. Once again, however, just like Foucault’s Pendulums spinning either which way, sinks and toilets in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres do not consistently spin in any one direction! Sinks and toilets in the very same household are often found to spin opposite directions, depending entirely upon the shape of the basin and the angle of the water’s entry, not the supposed rotation of the Earth.</p>

<p>“While the premise makes sense - that the earth’s eastward spin would cause the water in a toilet bowl to spin as well - in reality, the force and speed at which the water enters and leaves the receptacle is much too great to be influenced by something as miniscule as a single, 360-degree turn over the span of a day. When all is said and done, the Coriolis effect plays no larger role in toilet flushes than it does in the revolution of CDs in your stereo. The things that really determine the direction in which water leaves your toilet or sink are the shape of the bowl and the angle at which the liquid initially enters that bowl.” -Jennifer Horton, “Does the Rotation of the Earth Affect Toilets and Baseball Games?” Science.HowStuffWorks.com</p>

<p>The Coriolis Effect is also said to affect bullet trajectories and weather patterns as well, supposedly causing most storms in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate counter-clockwise, and most storms in the Southern Hemisphere to rotate clockwise, to cause bullets from long range guns to tend towards the right of the target in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Again, however, the same problems remain. Not every bullet and not every storm consistently displays the behavior and therefore cannot reasonably be used as proof of anything. What about the precision of the sight aperture, human error, and wind? What about Michelson-Morley-Gale’s proven motion of the aether’s potential effect? Why does the Coriolis Effect affect most storms but not all? If some storms rotate clockwise in the North and counter-clockwise in the South, how do those storms escape the Coriolis force? And if the entire Earth’s spin is uniform, why should the two hemispheres be affected any differently? Coriolis’s Effect and Foucault’s Pendulum are both said to prove the Earth moves beneath our feet, but in reality only prove how easy it can be for wolves in sheep’s clothing to pull the wool over our eyes. -The Flat Earth Conspiracy</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Gravity does not actually exist.  This is a whole topic on its own and I realize this statement can seem outlandish but a careful look at the history of how gravity came to be accepted in the first place is important.  The motion you experience can be explained through buoyancy and density.  An object in a medium depending on their relative densities will float or sink.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are we the only known, observable flat body? We can use simple telescopes to see other celestial bodies that are spherical and have rotation. Why are we the lone exception? </p>

<p>You are assuming there are other &quot;celestial bodies&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, for what purpose would people have for hiding knowledge this flat Earth? What is to gain? A big April Fools joke? That seems excessive for a prank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I addressed this in the first paragraph.  The evidence for the &quot;why&quot; is not something you can observe with your own eyes (like the flatness of the earth).  It is certainly more important than a prank.</p>

<p>flat water over large distances</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only it&#39;s not flat.  If it were, when you go to the beach, you would be able to see EVERYTHING.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The shape of what we (the public) are aware of is a circle. It is ringed by Antarctica. What is deep past the edge of Antarctica we do not know. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously?  We don&#39;t know?  Maybe we don&#39;t know because it has no edge?  How would we not have the technology with planes and drones capable of equipping cameras.  You would think one guy would say &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t we just fly a plane out there as far as it will go and take some pictures?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about Michelson-Morley-Gale’s proven motion of the aether’s potential effect?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Gale%E2%80%93Pearson_experiment">Here&#39;s a more recent experiment done that actually contradicts the Michelson-Morley experiment</a> that proves the Earth has angular velocity, meaning it is spinning.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t explain why Hurricanes and Tornadoes don&#39;t always spin counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, but that&#39;s one thing I&#39;m sure I will research in my soon-to-be-career in Meteorology.  AFAIK, no one knows and it really perplexes people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity does not actually exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not, how did the planet form and what keeps everything here?  You say the air is less dense and more buoyant, which is true, but without gravity, how would it not just float away?  Something must be pulling it back down.  And just because an object is in a less dense medium, doesn&#39;t mean it should automatically sink to the bottom.  It still needs something telling it WHERE the bottom is (ie:  Gravity)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are assuming there are other &quot;celestial bodies&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Um....I don&#39;t even know where to begin with that.  Go grab a few lenses, throw them in a tube, find a cleary night sky and you&#39;ll see them.  Are you saying whoever created this hoax just threw a tarp over the entire Earth?  How does this tarp manage to move and have parts in it that move?  How do MASSIVE things routinely come from this tarp?</p>

<p>And you didn&#39;t address plate tectonics.  How do mountains and volcanoes form in this flat Earth?  How do Earthquakes occur?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe the deepest reported in somewhere around 8 miles. How can we know what is past that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One tool that is useful to see inside the Earth is an earthquake.  There are two different waves (S and P) that are produced.  Measuring the distances and speeds and different reflections of these waves, geologists are able to approximate what the structure of the Earth is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I addressed this in the first paragraph. The evidence for the &quot;why&quot; is not something you can observe with your own eyes (like the flatness of the earth). It is certainly more important than a prank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be observable with my eyes.  And you have yet to answer the question.</p>

<p>For the flat earth to be true, there must be a large coverup.  You cannot trust the Royal Academy of anything.  Things must be able to be repeatedly demonstrated by the layman.  If you think &quot;official sources&quot; don&#39;t lie, well that is incredibly naive, but a topic on its own.  Regular people cannot mount expeditions or plane flights over Antarctica.  That ends poorly for them.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know how the earth formed.  I do know that the official story doesn&#39;t sound very plausible.  I don&#39;t think you have to know this prove that the earth is flat though.  Who is to say what is actually above us?  Astronauts have never been past the Van Allen belts.  I know the official line has some issues.  How do you possibly have an atmosphere beside a vacuum?  Do you know what the force of a vacuum sucking is compared to what the strength gravity is supposed to be?  But both of these questions really aren&#39;t relevant.  To prove flat earth I don&#39;t have to show I know everything about everything, I just have to show that the earth is flat.  All of these other questions I would really like to know the answer to, but the answers to them don&#39;t change whether or not the earth is flat.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Certainly you can see lights in the sky with a telescope.  I don&#39;t think I mentioned a tarp.  This is like the last question, you are asking me to explain the nature of the entire universe while I&#39;m just trying to prove the earth cannot be a sphere and is instead flat.</p>

<p>Here is a video about deep drilling:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bLLxfwgEbM0">https://youtu.be/bLLxfwgEbM0</a>  12km down they claim</p>

<p>Geologists are not able to get an accurate picture hundreds of miles underground with earthquake waves.  And even if they could, why does it matter?  You are again asking for an explanation to everything in the universe when I am only trying to show that the earth is flat and not a globe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be observable with my eyes. And you have yet to answer the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question of why is not relevant.  Focus on the physical proofs, they are first order evidence.  You can perform experiments yourself to demonstrate it.</p>

<p>Summary:
1.  I will respond to you no more until you consult the resources I have linked in our many conversations.  You are wasting my time until you do.
2.  I do not know everything about the universe, most of your questions i would really like to know the answer to, but I don&#39;t.  I am just trying to demonstrate that the world is flat, and cannot be a sphere.</p>

<p>And you really should read that article I linked.  You are clinging to lies like a comforting blanket.  You refuse to even consider the physical evidence and focus only on the devastation of your world view if it were true.  You cannot face that reality, so cannot afford to actually consider the evidence.</p>

<p>That is not true, you can only see a finite distance.  The hallway is not bs.  It is showing you the linear progression of the lines of your perspective.  There is no point at which the lines curve.  If you don&#39;t understand this example, that is unfortunate, but that is how our vision works.  Next time you are looking along a long fence or something, have a look at how the appearance of the posts change as they get further away from you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What are you trying to say here?  Is this just more not understanding how field of vision works?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objects disappear over the horizon before the affect of atmospheric perspective take effect enough to obscure them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this is not true.  First of all, even if the earth was a globe it wouldn&#39;t be true since the air can have varying visibility.  But let&#39;s look at ship over the horizon.  This is again the hallway principle.  Its just how your vision works.  </p>

<p>To demonstrate this to yourself, bring a telescope the next time you are in a position to view a ship sailing away from you.  Once you can no longer see it with the naked eye, use your telescope.  You will be able to see the ship again.  It was not the water blocking your vision, it was the limit of your perspective with the naked eye.  The telescope has the effect of advancing your 2d viewport forward.  The viewable space is not occupied by the things close to you, so you can see further.  However the lines of your perspective through the telescope still end at a finite point.</p>

<p>That is a good question actually.  Its really just their own contradiction that is the issue there.  They say we can&#39;t do it now, and they haven&#39;t claimed to for a very long time (70s?).  I do believe there is something stopping them, exactly what the nature of it is, I don&#39;t know.  This is actually refreshingly insightful.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t need to be perfect.  If you take two sealed chambers with different pressures and make an opening between them so that they are one chamber, what happens?  How does the force of that process compare to the force of gravity?  The supposed gravitational force is an incredibly weak one as it is described to us. </p>

<p>They hinge their argument on incredulity : why don&#39;t we use 1969 technology?!! </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s not 1969. The metrics for the orion program are different from those in 1969.  Sure we could just use some 1960s tech and remake an apollo. But that would be stupid. Those things were dangerous. Technology changes and we need to fit all the metrics of <em>today&#39;s</em> needs and that will require prototyping and testing. </p>

<p>They are not two sealed off chambers, that is exactly the point!  How can they exist next to one another?  The force of gravity is extremely weak.  If we are on a spinning globe, would the spinning itself not push the atmosphere off (think of spinning a wet tennis ball).  But gravity supposed to overcome that, and the infinite pull of a vacuum?  That&#39;s a lot of tripe to swallow right there.</p>

<p>There is no &quot;end of our perspective&quot; in your case.</p>

<p>We stop seein things when they </p>

<p>1) are obscured by other things, mainly the earth</p>

<p>2) are so far away as to become indistinguishable</p>

<p>3) are obscured by the effect of atmospheric perspective</p>

<p>If objects were aligned on to a flat plane 1 would not occur (but it does and is present and noticeable) </p>

<p>2 would be immediately obvious, as large objects would be more visible from farther away (but they aren&#39;t)</p>

<p>3 doesn&#39;t matter much since our eyes can still see objects through atmospheric perspective out to some distance, and so can other devices. However, they can&#39;t see the rocky mountains from new york. or the himalayas from the rockies.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHA</p>

<p>this is a description of how perspective and parallel lines works across a 2D plane and has nothing to do with the horizon or the curvature of the earth. Notice nowhere in that 3rd grade art lesson does it discuss that. &quot;Perspective lines&quot; (orthogonals) actually follow the curvature of the Earth. </p>

<p>Using your shitty 2d example, as I&#39;ve stated <em>a half dozen times</em> already- objects recede infinitely <em>towards</em> the horizon.  That&#39;s perspective across a plane.</p>

<p>Objects however, don&#39;t do that. They disappear over the horizon. </p>

<p>If they did not, and everything simply receded toward a &quot;vanishing point&quot; one could see the rocky mountains from new york.</p>

<p>But one can&#39;t becaue they&#39;re on the other side of the globe.</p>

<p>If you believe this, I don&#39;t know what to do for you.  You are saying the appearance of an object 20 feet in front of you, vs the appearance of that same object 20 feet above you would be different because one is in a direction perpendicular to the ground?</p>

<p>No. You presented an article about how parallel lines converge on a 2d plane towards a vanishing point; keeping in mind of course all these orthogonal lines are congruent with the spherical earth.</p>

<p>You presented nothing about how objects apparently recede infinitely away, as one would see on a flat earth.</p>

<p>Meaning just that. These &quot;perspective lines&quot; (orthogonals) recede towards a vanishing point; and they do so following the curve of the earth.</p>

If you look up at a scene instead, how does perspective function then?  This has nothing to do with curvature of the earth, these effects occur the same on large scales and small.

<p>It seems like you are starting from a place of &quot;I know the earth is a globe, so I have &#39;right&#39; on my side and anything i make up is probably right because this guy has the wrong conclusion.&quot;  That is not the way a thinking person considers an issue.

<p>It functions with all lines receding towards a vanishing point.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. It &quot;doesn&#39;t have to do with the curvature of the Earth&quot;.   Perfectly parrallel lines project away towards the same vanishing point.  That vanishing point is along the horizon. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been over this but your flat brain doesn&#39;t comprehend it.</p>

<p>They appear straight because the size of the curve is so great you don&#39;t see it. Just like your stupid traintrack example. Just like your stupid &quot;level&quot; example.  This is also noticed when at greater altitudes, the line of the horizon and the theoretical &quot;vanishing point&quot; lines are not the same.</p>

<p>Looking at the horizon as you go higher is actually an important proof.  When you rise in elevation, the horizon rises to meet your eyes.  This is only possible on a flat plane.  On a globe, you must look down to see the horizon as you go higher up.  And no, the size of the earth that we are told is not too large to notice this.  We are given a circumference of about 25000 miles.  You can do the math if you like, its just pythag.</p>

<p>You have an issue now.  Are you sure you want to directly deny what you can see what your own eyes?  The horizon line does stay at your eye level as you ascend.  It&#39;s just what happens.

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely linked the right video.  Yes, the camera is moving, but do you know how much curve you should see at that height for the earth to be a globe?  Do you know how far the horizon line would need to be below your eye level in order for the earth to be a sphere of circumference 25000 miles?  Again, you can do the math, its just triangles.</p>

<p>If you want to watch a video with more on the subject you could try this one:    </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YQ0dMJEjsk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YQ0dMJEjsk</a></p>

<p>Considering a 35mm camera has a vertical field of view of ~27<sup>o</sup>  and the radius of the Earth is ~4,000 miles, it&#39;s simple trigonometry to calculate the necessary height (which ends up being 4000/tan(13.5<sup>o</sup> ) or ~2960 miles or about 15,632,000 feet). </p>

<p>And why do you keep linking the high altitude balloon video if it debunks a flat Earth? I thought you were trying to convince me it is flat...</p>

<p>That article was just posted.  You should read it.  It is very topical.</p>

<p>I will respond to all your points in a bit.  But again, these are all basic questions that tell me you have not consulted the resources.  </p>

<p>Again I will give you a couple of links:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, these are the last questions of yours that I will answer until you show that you have read things at the links I have given you.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Only it&#39;s not flat. If it were, when you go to the beach, you would be able to see EVERYTHING.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that is not the case.  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Your vision works like a cone.  To see this consider your own  &quot;viewport&quot;. Consider looking down a very long hallway. Think about the lines of the floor, ceiling and walls. If the hallway is long enough those lines converge in the middle of your view. The parts of the hallway closer to you take up a larger part of the 2d &quot;viewport&quot; of your vision.   Even though the hallway is a rectangular cuboid, you see the lines of the intersection of the floor, ceiling and walls meet in the center of your vision.  You can&#39;t see infinitely down the hallway and the same occurs outside.</p></li>
<li><p>Air has moisture and other particulate matter in it. You cannot see through it an infinite distance. Consider standing at a lookout and viewing two hills, one twice the distance from you as the other. The further away one will have more of a blue tinge to it due to viewing it through more air.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Seriously? We don&#39;t know? Maybe we don&#39;t know because it has no edge? How would we not have the technology with planes and drones capable of equipping cameras. You would think one guy would say &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t we just fly a plane out there as far as it will go and take some pictures?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the flat earth to be true, there must be a large coverup.  You cannot trust the Royal Academy of anything.  Things must be able to be repeatedly demonstrated by the layman.  If you think &quot;official sources&quot; don&#39;t lie, well that is incredibly naive, but a topic on its own.  Regular people cannot mount expeditions or plane flights over Antarctica.  That ends poorly for them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If not, how did the planet form and what keeps everything here? You say the air is less dense and more buoyant, which is true, but without gravity, how would it not just float away? Something must be pulling it back down. And just because an object is in a less dense medium, doesn&#39;t mean it should automatically sink to the bottom. It still needs something telling it WHERE the bottom is (ie: Gravity)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know how the earth formed.  I do know that the official story doesn&#39;t sound very plausible.  I don&#39;t think you have to know this prove that the earth is flat though.  Who is to say what is actually above us?  Astronauts have never been past the Van Allen belts.  I know the official line has some issues.  How do you possibly have an atmosphere beside a vacuum?  Do you know what the force of a vacuum sucking is compared to what the strength gravity is supposed to be?  But both of these questions really aren&#39;t relevant.  To prove flat earth I don&#39;t have to show I know everything about everything, I just have to show that the earth is flat.  All of these other questions I would really like to know the answer to, but the answers to them don&#39;t change whether or not the earth is flat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Um....I don&#39;t even know where to begin with that. Go grab a few lenses, throw them in a tube, find a cleary night sky and you&#39;ll see them. Are you saying whoever created this hoax just threw a tarp over the entire Earth? How does this tarp manage to move and have parts in it that move? How do MASSIVE things routinely come from this tarp?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly you can see lights in the sky with a telescope.  I don&#39;t think I mentioned a tarp.  This is like the last question, you are asking me to explain the nature of the entire universe while I&#39;m just trying to prove the earth cannot be a sphere and is instead flat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One tool that is useful to see inside the Earth is an earthquake. There are two different waves (S and P) that are produced. Measuring the distances and speeds and different reflections of these waves, geologists are able to approximate what the structure of the Earth is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a video about deep drilling:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bLLxfwgEbM0">https://youtu.be/bLLxfwgEbM0</a>  12km down they claim</p>

<p>Geologists are not able to get an accurate picture hundreds of miles underground with earthquake waves.  And even if they could, why does it matter?  You are again asking for an explanation to everything in the universe when I am only trying to show that the earth is flat and not a globe.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;d be observable with my eyes. And you have yet to answer the question.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question of why is not relevant.  Focus on the physical proofs, they are first order evidence.  You can perform experiments yourself to demonstrate it.</p>

<p>Summary:
1.  I will respond to you no more until you consult the resources I have linked in our many conversations.  You are wasting my time until you do.
2.  I do not know everything about the universe, most of your questions i would really like to know the answer to, but I don&#39;t.  I am just trying to demonstrate that the world is flat, and cannot be a sphere.</p>

<p>And you really should read that article I linked.  You are clinging to lies like a comforting blanket.  You refuse to even consider the physical evidence and focus only on the devastation of your world view if it were true.  You cannot face that reality, so cannot afford to actually consider the evidence.</p>
