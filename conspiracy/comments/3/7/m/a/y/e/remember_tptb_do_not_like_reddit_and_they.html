        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>TLDR</p>

<p>1) vote in new queue, comment if you can</p>

<p>2) xpost content from here to the major subs. they can&#39;t censor it if you don&#39;t submit it. r/technology is probably the easiest to get into because you can flair stuff as politics</p>

<p>3) research</p>

<p>Recognize</p>

<p>Organize</p>

<p>Mobilize</p>

<p>Want change in the world? It starts locally. </p>

<p>1) <em>You</em> must recognize injustice/corruption</p>

<p>2) <em>You</em> must organize those closest to you. Part of this is educating them, or <em>unplugging</em> them so that they can recognize themselves, and are eventually capable at doing the same to others. It is possible. Humans can reason, some find it harder then others.</p>

<p>3) <em>You</em> must organize your network. This of course is the hard part. How hard did Indians find it to convince the British to leave? How hard will it be for American&#39;s to change their government? Very hard. Will it happen? Maybe. Will it really? Probably not, but its <strong>worth a shot</strong>. </p>

<p>Starts with your family and friends. If you cannot <em>open</em> your SO or best friends eyes, how could I possibly open yours?</p>

<p>Goals:</p>

<p>a) Change through existing government</p>

<p>b) Change through a new government</p>

<p>Do we abolish our current government ?  (strictly speaking of American&#39;s <strong>constitutional right</strong> to do so, when they feel the need)</p>

<p>Unrealistic, but possible. Not sure how a modern Constitutional Convention would go.</p>

<p>So, Change through our existing representative government</p>

<p>Local Government- not <em>too</em> corrupt</p>

<p>State Government- not <em>very</em> corrupt</p>

<p>Federal Government- <em>lacks legitimacy</em> (corrupt?)</p>

<ul>
<li><em>what, the federal government is corrupt?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Depends on who you ask. But it certainly lacks legitimacy. </p>

<p>How? Source?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/180113/2014-approval-congress-remains-near-time-low.aspx"><strong>Americans&#39; job approval rating for Congress averaged 15% in 2014</strong>, close to the record-low yearly average of 14% found last year. The highest yearly average was measured in 2001, at 56%. Yearly averages haven&#39;t exceeded 20% in the past five years, as well as in six of the past seven years.</a></p>

<p>15% of American citizens view their Congress as their legitimate representative body? </p>

<p>Well, <em>next</em> election they&#39;ll VOTE THEM OUT. Right?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/nov/11/facebook-posts/congress-has-11-approval-ratings-96-incumbent-re-e/"><strong>Congress has 11% approval ratings but 96% incumbent reelection rate</strong>,</a></p>

<p><em>Oh</em></p>

<p>That&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p>Solution(s) ?</p>

<p>Simple</p>

<p><strong>End Gerrymandering</strong> in order to ensure accountability of representatives towards their constituencies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gerrymandering &quot;is not new ... but technology has brought the practice to new levels of absurdity. As gerrymandering has grown more sophisticated, elections have become less competitive and partisan differences more entrenched.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/01/this-is-the-best-explanation-of-gerrymandering-you-will-ever-see/">This is the best explanation of gerrymandering you will ever see</a></p>

<p>Yes, the left/right and democrat/republican is a false paradigm. Yes that&#39;s how <em>they</em> divide <em>us</em>, and they perpetuate their rule.</p>

<p>Telling people to x-post content from here and recommending <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> sounds like you are encouraging this subreddit to invade another and alter the nature of that community.  </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t see the problem, imagine if similar calls were posted in Fatpersonhate or Coontown for users to post their communities preferred content in certain subreddits to push their preferred narrative.   </p>

<p>So I think you are breaking rules or at least spoiling the nature of reddit as independent communities.  </p>
