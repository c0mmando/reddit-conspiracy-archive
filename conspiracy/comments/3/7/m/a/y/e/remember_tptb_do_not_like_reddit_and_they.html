      <p>
       TLDR
      </p>
      <p>
       1) vote in new queue, comment if you can
      </p>
      <p>
       2) xpost content from here to the major subs. they can't censor it if you don't submit it. r/technology is probably the easiest to get into because you can flair stuff as politics
      </p>
      <p>
       3) research
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognize
      </p>
      <p>
       Organize
      </p>
      <p>
       Mobilize
      </p>
      <p>
       Want change in the world? It starts locally.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       must recognize injustice/corruption
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       must organize those closest to you. Part of this is educating them, or
       <em>
        unplugging
       </em>
       them so that they can recognize themselves, and are eventually capable at doing the same to others. It is possible. Humans can reason, some find it harder then others.
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       must organize your network. This of course is the hard part. How hard did Indians find it to convince the British to leave? How hard will it be for American's to change their government? Very hard. Will it happen? Maybe. Will it really? Probably not, but its
       <strong>
        worth a shot
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Starts with your family and friends. If you cannot
       <em>
        open
       </em>
       your SO or best friends eyes, how could I possibly open yours?
      </p>
      <p>
       Goals:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) Change through existing government
      </p>
      <p>
       b) Change through a new government
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we abolish our current government ?  (strictly speaking of American's
       <strong>
        constitutional right
       </strong>
       to do so, when they feel the need)
      </p>
      <p>
       Unrealistic, but possible. Not sure how a modern Constitutional Convention would go.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Change through our existing representative government
      </p>
      <p>
       Local Government- not
       <em>
        too
       </em>
       corrupt
      </p>
      <p>
       State Government- not
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       corrupt
      </p>
      <p>
       Federal Government-
       <em>
        lacks legitimacy
       </em>
       (corrupt?)
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <em>
         what, the federal government is corrupt?
        </em>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Depends on who you ask. But it certainly lacks legitimacy.
      </p>

       You are absolutely right. Something very sinister is going on.

       Telling people to x-post content from here and recommending
       <a href="/r/technology">
        /r/technology
       </a>
       sounds like you are encouraging this subreddit to invade another and alter the nature of that community.

       If you can't see the problem, imagine if similar calls were posted in Fatpersonhate or Coontown for users to post their communities preferred content in certain subreddits to push their preferred narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think you are breaking rules or at least spoiling the nature of reddit as independent communities.
