       Why is this Fly Tape person running this Subreddit?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the guise of transparency...from the most untrustworthy mod here. Hell, he is a controversial figure on reddit as a whole!

       Flytape is running this place?

       This modlog right here in this very post says otherwise.  Did you even look at it?  I see far more activity from other mods in the past 24 hours.  Of the last 100 actions by a moderator of this subreddit, Flytape accounts for 2.  Please tell me how he is "running this subreddit" and how he is "involved too much"?

       He shouldn't be here at all. There is no argument for his place here except "The mods can do whatever they want in their subreddit." So Flytape might be a racist, spam post, ban people for personal reasons, and generally be an unpleasant person, but hey, they can do whatever the fuck they want, so who gives a shit right?

       That happens a lot to people who are banned by admins. You go from being a years old account with credibility to a suspicious looking newbie

       You misunderstand.  Just six weeks ago Flytape was witch-hunted by a collection of accounts barely over two months of age.  And then again, three months before that.  The comment above has nothing to do with the sticky it's posted in, immediately jumps at Flytape's throat, dredges up the podcast drama, and doesn't acknowledge that mod team has just implemented a transparency system
       <em>
        specifically to appease those accounts accusing mod team members of power abuse.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two types of people who make new accounts: people who get shadow banned and legitimately need a new account, and people with an agenda to push.  And there are vastly more of the latter than the former.

       The raw data is available here for anyone who wants to create an alternative frontend:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/log/.json?feed=c7b83b457469643f1912d5fee30e18dba808f351&amp;amp;user=publicmodlogs">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       and anyone may view an RSS feed version of basically the same data here:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/log/.rss?feed=c7b83b457469643f1912d5fee30e18dba808f351&amp;amp;user=publicmodlogs">

      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible to view filtered versions of this as well:
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/about/log/.rss?type=removelink&amp;amp;feed=c7b83b457469643f1912d5fee30e18dba808f351&amp;amp;user=publicmodlogs">

       </a>
       (any filter which is normally available in the main mod logs page on reddit is available here, including filtering by the acting moderator)
      </p>
      <p>
       I've derpily created a forked version of the modlog.github.io site at modlogs.github.io (I'm a web dev noob, please forgive me) and if you want to view a version without the pao cartoon in the background it's here:
       <a href="https://modlogs.github.io/#/r/conspiracy">
        https://modlogs.github.io/#/r/conspiracy
       </a>
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Edit:
       </strong>
       the cartoon no longer exists on the main frontend go1dfish created, so no need to use my derpy forked version if you were using it before.

       Not really. It
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       a coke ad. If it was an attempt to raise awareness of human rights violations, why coke? Many are arguably more culpable than that company; and if it was a call to boycott why not include the
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of other products that company manufactures? You'll remember the nice little logo in the lower-right hand corner of the image. No such thing as bad publicity. Another example of how easily this platform is gamed for thinly disguised monetary benefit. The real product of reddit is you and your pageviews.

       ...Honestly, it's embarrassing and ironic that Flytape is taking this subreddit by the reins--especially with this "transparency" meme after being secretly reinstated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he's not involved in some sort of reddit drama or mod conflict, he's pushing a sticky post or AMA.  Why is one person influencing and steering this subreddit so often?  Positive or negative, there's a conflict of interest here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not want Flytape to represent this subreddit any longer, it looks bad for everyone in my opinion and I feel that this "your voice is heard" and new "transparency" meme comes across as disingenuous and I personally would like it if he tried his best to stay out of the public spectacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter how justified, his actions cannot be taken seriously due to his reputation.  Whether it's a simple ban warning or an announcement such as this sticky, his credibility is completely gone and he can't be taken seriously. The fact that he has been demodded, reinstated, and involved in controversy so many times over the years really hurts the community and I would like it if he did not influence this subreddit any longer, no matter how "noble" his cause.

       Im a controversial member of the reddit community, and conspiracy is a controversial subreddit of the redditverse.

       If you had nothing but mainstream noncontroversial mods here this place would not be the conspiracy sub it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
       First things first, I don't know why all you 9-11 truth people are so angry with me, I didn't have anything to do with the Gage AMA you like to parade around about.  Literally never had a hand in it.  I've yet to have a hand in any of the AMAs.  You guys like to call me a Nazi Jew hater but the one person I tried to get to do an ama is an author who doesn't blame the Jews but instead blames the 4th Reich, that would be the Nazis latest incarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly its kind of selfish that you guys turn everything into a soap box for your vendetta, literally every sticky post we've had for any reason has been inundated with you and your friends shouting about this same incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Axol was duped with the Gage AMA,  he has apologized profusely time and time again.  At this point the only thing ruining /conspiracy is this never ending witch hunt.

       This modlog idea is just a kid's bandaid over an amputated limb — especially when it's coming from a very controversial user like yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're a meme on reddit now after your abysmal performance in that podcast. This coupled with your irresponsibility in the community over the years which includes but not limited to — ban abuse, petty arguments throughout reddit, poor AMAs, and again
       <em>
        that deplorable podcast
       </em>
       — makes it so I have no confidence in you. You have no credibility amongst the reddit community. I wouldn't care but you basically parade around this place like it's yours — plus the secret reinstatement of your powers makes this whole place look even
       <em>
        worse
       </em>
       .

       Are they explosions, or dust blowouts indicative of internal superstructure collapse, quickly pushing air, smoke and debris out of the building? I suspect the latter. But OK dude, surely they're nano-thermite demo packs planted by Mexican Illuminati Jew Lizards.

       Impacts, to an extent. Blast effects? Not so much. Uncontrolled post-impact effects? No. There isn't a tall building in the world designed to stand up to a bunch of internal supports taken out by a crashing and exploding jetliner, followed by a raging un-contained fire. This is why skyscraper fires in general have a history of being complete clusterfucks leading to many people dying.

       What are your physics credentials again, "endsieg88"? It's fascinating how some people will latch on to the cover story. What I'd call utterly stupid is obsessing about the minutiae over the collapse of some buildings over a decade ago, when
       <em>
        the people who organized the attack have had over a decade to continue operating.
       </em>
       But you don't care about them. You want to focus on the shiny distraction, the media friendly social engineering event with lots of cameras pointed at it. Someone sets off some fireworks, and it becomes a religion to you. You stare amazed at the rabbit pulled out of the hat, and never pay attention to the magician. They've blown up a lot more buildings since those in New York. They've killed not thousands but hundreds of thousands, and done so a lot more recently than 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Widen your scope. Consider things greater than a few buildings falling down, because believe me, to some people, that shit happens regularly.

       What in the actual fuck has that to do with anything? It's a fact that the buildings fell at free-fall speeds, even though over 75% of the buildings were untouched. Untouched = Undamaged - Undamaged = Resistance  - Resistance = Newtons Third Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you'd actually watched the footage, you can tell that the ''collapse'' was not affected by this, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the fact that BOTH buildings ''collapsed'' similar is just way way WAAAY too unlikely, for two (supposedly) naturally occurring collapses. What are the odds? Think about it. No way the damage could've affected both buildings in the same manner, to such an extent that they collapsed at, almost, the same speeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then building seven... I'm even gonna go down that road, because even the NIST simulation couldn't replicate that what had happened, and they were the leading investigators. One column failed, and let to the entire building coming down at free-fall?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gee, somebody must have thought about that when they build it, but NOOO - let's not get ourselves get confused by FACTS here.

       The people obsessed with the 3 buildings that fell on 9/11 have been digging at that root for
       <em>

       They haven't found squat. If they devoted that mental processing power to discovering who organized 9/11 instead, we might be a lot farther ahead, and have some actual answers, rather than insane hypotheses about nano-thermite and demolition which have never been substantiated.

       Flytape is a lot of things, childish and enjoys power far too much and a bit of power hungry as well. He shouldn't be a mod here IMO.

       Better idea: You open up a post and talk about it or directly message Flytape yourself.

       Should I talk about 9/11 in a climate change post just because I'm too lazy to create a post myself? No.

       Here's what I'm talking about.

      <p>
       Two of our mods want to do away with AMAs!! Did the conspiracy crowd know this fact?

      <p>
       Why don't we have a conversation, right now? This is the only place it's seen by the general pop. The place where voices are heard...
      </p>
      <p>
       One of these mods held a fake richard gage ama to discredit the 911 truth movement. The result?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Abby Martin, Ben Swann, David Chandler and Richard Gage know about this subreddit's failurs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You'll never hear from these people because of our mod team. When will we have a community discussion?

       The sticky (you went past that, wisely, to a vote) should be about whether or not the community thinks we should have community-held AMAs.

      <p>
       No more mods involved in AMAs. That's my vote. Only trusted users who know about the topics the AMA candidates speak of can be held accountable.

       <strong>
        Should mods even be able to hold AMAs anymore?

       Damn, if you're this suspicious there must be some big things going 'round here. I am not an advocate of anything you're trying to accuse me of; I thought your interest was in keeping AMAs, so the logical way of doing that would be a vote.
       <br/>
       No mods involved in AMAs; do you mean by questions, setting them up, ...?
       <br/>
       I could get behind this idea tbh. Haven't been here for any AMA but it seems like a good idea.
       <br/>
       Also, why the excessive paranoia of me being an alt? Strangely active, old &amp; voiceful of my opinion for an alt if you ask me.
