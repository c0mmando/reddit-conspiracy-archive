        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>America is losing it. They are clutching and clawing at their last remaining piece of consentual power. The country is in a steady economic decline, as is the world because of it. The debt they have is in no way to be repaid ever, and this will only grow exponentially. Meanwhile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States">the economic inequality is growing</a> making to so that the low-wage workers are working to repay the debt, whilst the ultra-rich are dodging taxes through semi-legal channels, only adding to the debt and inequality. Anyone can see that this is no sustainable model.</p>

<p>Yet the media is reporting none of this, only adding, from my perspective, to the (economic) uncertainty the public is feeling. <a href="http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Tb_z5Fcz--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/lckoza8wfctpe7k9k1de.jpg">It&#39;s obvious there are special interests there</a>, so let&#39;s not even get into that, seeing as it&#39;s a subject worthy of a discussion of itself. All we know is the media is under the influence of the economic elite, as is any other major institution, whether it&#39;s privately or state owned.</p>

<p>We can see an obvious increase in effort by the police force in America (and elsewhere) to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/21/407958035/white-house-ban-on-militarized-gear-for-police-may-mean-little">train for civil unrest, militarizing in the proces.</a> I have a feeling we are hearing about this so much these days is to keep us (especially Americans, for now) scared and meek.  Civil unrest is televised, being sure to show a intimidating amount of, let&#39;s face it, military trained police casually exerting <em>huge</em> amounts of force. Almost every day there&#39;s a post on Reddit frontpage reporting yet another casually executed victim of the police. Knowing that Reddit is basically a corporate media outlet now there must be reason this is happening now.</p>

<p>America is rotting at the core, and the ones up top can see this coming a mile away. Now I wouldn&#39;t mind this as much if it was 1 single country this was happening in, but we all know the western world is just an American Empire colony, and we will always follow in their footsteps. This is the death of freedom as we know it, limited freedom it may be. We are being bullied into complete apathy, through threats of violence and economic immobility. We are witnessing ourselves being reduced to ignorant, slavish, completely dependant livestock. Just smart enough to work, but not smart or brave enough to think critically and demand changes to enviroment. </p>

<p>America is pioneering this social structure, and I think the other Western powers see this structure as being very tempting to use and are preparing to transition to this structure to some extent. How are we as a people supposed to do in the face of this daunting Goliath looming over us? The answer I wish I had, but I don&#39;t. All I can do is witness my people, and myself sadly, slide into complete apathy and complain about it on some forum somewhere. </p>

<p>I want to ask you, where do you see this going?
Should we be scared? Have we done something wrong? Can we still do something about it? If so, how?
Are we imagining this malicious power structure? Is there really this much control over our system? Is America the new empire, ready to crack? Or will they have acquired so much power and control that this time the people won&#39;t stand a chance to rebel? Is every western country going through these changes? If so how, how fast and why?</p>

<p>These are the question that are racing through my mind and I am asking you.
I want to start a discussion about where this train is headed and your thoughts on it.</p>

<p>TL;DR : Economic inequality is creating a scenario where there are slave like workers and godlike bosses, controlling the masses through economy and straight up force. This model is spreading to other countries. Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While America&#39;s hegemonic reign may be coming to an end... the corporate/financial elite will jump ship long before it capsizes under its own pressure. The TPP will accomplish this goal, officially ushering a new era of global corporatism far greater than we&#39;ve experienced thus far.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll expand their influence globally and ensure that profits and control continue to increase exponentially. Like a virus, they will abandon one country for another, finding a new host body to rot from the inside out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes this is a very good point, they will jump ship. America will collapse and their vast wealth will never be affected by that.</p>

<p>But at some point the Earth is spent right?
There is a physical limit to how much they can get from us, and when they do reach that, their whole system they live off of will collapse. Because I do heartily agree that this is a parasite, a sickness on our humankind. But it&#39;s not like there&#39;s another host in terms of another planet right? At some point they will just wreck this Earth with their endless greed. How will they deal with that?</p>

<p>I know there are already lots of isolated farms, airplane runways being bought by the elite, in preparation of this collapse. But I&#39;m curious to see how they will deal with the absolute destruction of Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, Earth isn&#39;t going to be destroyed any time soon. Not by us, at least, no matter what we do. But yes; at some point, Earth is spent. At this point, mankind will do what it has always done best: deal with change. There&#39;s truly only two paths for our species.</p>

<p>Both have a similar near-future: corporate entities jump from region to region, following the trail of profit to be made: China, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa. The notion of the USA being worth a damn to them will be gone within a generation or two at best. Each new development region is built up and stabilized; each has its legs cut out from underneath it. But the real kicker happens when there&#39;s no more resources to extract from the Earth and technology stagnates. This is where things get interesting.</p>

<p>In the first path, civilization collapses upon itself until there aren&#39;t many humans left. It will likely start with food and water shortages, which will lead to disease, which will all lead to war. The people who declared this war (or moreover caused it and let it happen) will likely emerge unscathed by it. Small groups of powerful, intelligent people will remain. And truly, for the sake of our species, that might not be a bad thing. Regardless, we cease to be the dominant species on our planet over the next 1,000 years.</p>

<p>The other path revolves on our ability to start harnessing the resources of our solar system. Mars is enough like Earth that with some serious brain power and investment, we could terraform it. We have the ability to reach Mars with currently-existing technology. There&#39;s 23 other places in our Solar System alone with water on it. There&#39;s minerals and many other materials on neighboring planets, moons, asteroids and comets. If we can start harnessing them, and transform other worlds to be like ours, we can survive as a species.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because it shows how you see the world. For example why would you assume only powerful, intelligent people will remain? Maybe it will be those who can adapt to change fastest, or are charismatic/have social intelligence so they can gather a lot of people to push in the same direction.</p>

<p>And what you believe we should focus on. You say harnessing resources of the solar system, there are people around who would say we should focus on renewable energy instead, and that we can live just fine with what we have on this planet.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to say that it isn&#39;t true/what you said is wrong, there are just so many possibilities of what can happen, that narrowing it down to what you said just tells me more about you than anything else</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with <a href="/u/CineSuppa">/u/CineSuppa</a> on many points, the 2 paths, 1 of destruction and 1 of growth and expansion. And the thing is, where the Earth ever to run out of oil, food, whatever, only the rich in the end would remain because their vast wealth would be the only thing keeping them on the team with resources. The poor working class would be the first to run out of food for instance. As a resource dies out, it will increase in price, heavily. So the billionaires would still be able to get these resources, but when the supermarkets and pump-stations are depleted, the working man is screwed first.</p>

<p>The thing is, I would agree on you with social intelligence being a highly valued trait. Sadly I think the powers that be have indoctrinated us enough to make us fear not only each other but the state, keeping us from mobilizing socially.</p>

<p>His guesses about the possibilities isn&#39;t that far off I think. The fact that at some point resources are going to collapse is a fact, we are growing at the fastest rate ever, and it doesn&#39;t seem like slowing down. In 1 generation the world population has <em>tripled</em>. So either we run out of farmable land, oil whatever it may be, which causes our system to fail. OR growth will be regulated in some way, which is something I don&#39;t think we want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, another good way to look at this is using the virus model again. One can see the future of humanity as a mutation. We&#39;ve had this before many times, leading up to the last million or so years (moreover the last 200,000 years) in which Homo sapiens sapiens became the dominant branch of man. The next mutation will likely happen because of external stimuli, whether technological advancements on the road to singularity, or spreading to other worlds. Either way, while mankind in general will likely survive here on Earth, it&#39;s going to be a financial stimulus that affords some to branch off and take humanity down it&#39;s next path. And I feel it&#39;s likely that Mars is the next target, and if we&#39;re lucky, elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does show how I see the world. But it also reveals a little bit of the vast amounts of research I&#39;ve put into future scenarios. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t explicitly say only powerful, intelligent people would remain. Those who can live off the land will do just fine as well... whether they&#39;re woodsmen who&#39;ve either studied heavily or rejected Western culture to a degree, or aboriginal peoples. The problem isn&#39;t strictly a social one, but much moreover a financial one. With that in  mind, understand that a large portion of Westerners (specifically those earning more than $34,000 per year) fall in the top 1% of income earners worldwide. It&#39;s one of those &quot;sit back, watch-the-news... <em>oh those poor starving people; that&#39;s horrible...</em> microwave-your-TV-dinner&quot; sort of scenarios. </p>

<p>While we absolutely can survive on this planet with renewable or plentiful resources (solar, thermal, nuclear by way of LFTRs), this doesn&#39;t account for growth. We can sustain, not grow. And the problem is that all the faith in the world relies on a completely conjured economic model that needs to grow to be sustained. There is a point we can no longer grow here. When we approach that point, there are only two choices for our species: abandon the model, or find a way to grow. Is it not logical to start moving off the planet, then? China is already talking about stopping a meteor in our orbit by 2035 and mining from it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an infinite number of possibilities of what the future will hold. Truly. But logically, for sake of the end game of our species, it boils down to the two most likely scenarios. While humans will survive anything short of an E.L.E., this civilization we&#39;ve built cannot be sustained without mass infrastructure. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m concerned by, because there&#39;s only so much we can pull from the Earth, and so much we can recycle, before we need to come up with alternatives.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m very much a humanist, this argument is really much larger than individuals or societies. If you look at us simply as a life form, we are a virus in the strictest of definitions. And viruses pull from their host until they can spread. That&#39;s how viruses survive, and our host is currently Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Media can show all they want, but people see what they see. All their family and friends working as hard as they can, and going nowhere fast. Rent keeps rising, and jobs are getting harder and harder to come by. Discontent is rising. Even the police that are the lapdogs of the government will one day see their paychecks cut to fund the pockets of the 1%. I keep hearing the cry of &quot;wake up sheeple&quot; but they don&#39;t see that people ARE waking up. They understand that this isn&#39;t the life they want. Everyone, to some degree, knows that big banks/corporations/government is screwing them over, and that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. They just don&#39;t think they can do anything about it. False promises get them into the voting booth and nothing changes. Occupy Wall Street was a great idea, but went nowhere. I don&#39;t think we have done anything wrong, and we shouldn&#39;t be scared. We should be angry. Greed is what got us into this mess. We have the technology to be the greatest society in history, but our greed and love of money stops us from doing truly amazing things. We have the ability to feed every man, woman, and child on this planet. But we don&#39;t, because of the cost. We have the ability to make sure that no one has to sleep under an exit ramp, but we don&#39;t because banks might lose money. We have the ability to make sure every veteran has the medical care they deserve, but we don&#39;t give it them because big pharma might not make the profit goals they want. We have the ability, but our greed and selfishness corrupts us and makes us less human. I don&#39;t know how to turn our country around. Another civil war? A French revolution? I&#39;ve thought about this for years. But I do know that it is coming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Medicated or not, you bring up some good points.
But the thing is I know people are waking up, but only superficially. They acknowledge that they are on the bad side of a system ruled by bankers and financial elite. But what I see is people systematically denying the fact that they are totally and utterly trapped by this sytem. It&#39;s normal now that bankers and corporations are just psychotic sharks hellbent on making profit, regardless of damage to people or nature. How did we ever get to that point though? How did we not see this system flipping on us and indoctrinating us with false morals and beliefs. I feel we have been hijacked by the ones who we normally expel from society.</p>

<p>Let me explain.
In prehistoric societies or hunter gatherers of today, like aboriginals, there is no unhealthy competition. There is no I need more of this than you, because all is shared. Competition itself does exist but never to an extent where it hurts others. This means there is competition which drives, especially, the males of the tribe to greater achievements which fuels the growth and prosperity of the tribe as a whole. This way competition feeds the old and weak too. They get a kill, and it is distributed among the inhabitants, everyone getting their fair share, seeing as an old person for example would need less nutrition than the strongest male of the tribe.</p>

<p>Now image our society as this tribe. 
We have become a tribe where every hunter refuses to share, where they feel they earned more by being strong, agile hunters. They hoard their meat for themselves. This ofcourse is highly destructive for the tribe because now the weak and old people are left to fend for themselves because they can&#39;t share in the communal wealth of the tribe. Only the strongest and most willing not to share will survive. This creates cultures where the strongest also have the least empathy. You can see how dangerous that is. In the first tribe this person would have been scolded for even thinking of keeping his meat and not sharing it with the elders and the infirm. Yet somehow this is the norm in todays society.</p>

<p>When, how and why did we ever shift to the second tribe?
Why did we all abandon love and peace for greed?</p>

Anger is what the people in the riot gear train to defuse, through lethal force often. I think peaceful protest is the only way to go. Mahatma Ghandi, Martin Luther, these people had the right idea I feel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I agree to a certain extent, and I&#39;m certainly not calling for a violent revolution :)</p>

<p>But, if more people realized just how badly the general population is getting fleeced out of their cash, freedom and basic human rights and this caused them to be pissed off enough to switch off their reality TV and join a protest then that can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>Sadly though, I think if we gathered in large enough numbers the option for peaceful protest would be taken out of our hands by the people in the riot gear...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the governments answer to occupy wall street has been the militarization of the police. The purchase of millions of rounds of hollow point sniper ammunition by the DHS. The steady execution of suspects guilty and innocent alike. The media&#39;s steady diet of division, racial, class, politics to keep us fighting with each other while they continue to loot the nation. The Banking Cartel is just blatantly committing crimes with no repercussions. Corporate America is moving all of their money to off shore banks so they don&#39;t have to pay taxes on it and its available when they jump ship.</p>

<p>All the US has left is a massive Military but if Russia and China decide we&#39;re a threat that needs to be eliminated, they could work together to wipe us off the map. I&#39;m sure the elite will be warned so they can leave the country before the bombs rain down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I understand how you feel very well.
Many people in my enviroment have the same thing, where they feel kind of uncomfortable with certain institutions or official stories. I hope this movement is strong enough to break through the, lets face it, almost inpenetrable system the elite have rigged. </p>

<p>Like <a href="/u/CyberMinney">/u/CyberMinney</a> mentioned, Occupy was a good example of this think coming into mainstream focus. The banks just wrecked basically the global economy, people were losing their homes, were unsatisfied with the way things were going in general I believe. And still the media and whatnot still found a way to totally discredit and minimize this movement. And look how effective that was, in the end it was just a bunch of teenage looters and rioters to most people.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s when this whole police brutality wasn&#39;t anywhere near as widespread as it is now. Remember when <a href="https://theleashumich.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/pepperspray.jpg">this</a> picture was funny? It was at one of the Occupy Protests, a policeman spraying pepperspray into the faces of peaceful student protesters. That was a big deal then I remember to some people. This is just run of the mill stuff now. It&#39;s a fat guy in a easily identifiable police uniform still.</p>

<p>It has evolved from pepperspray and fat guys with a funny helmet on into lethal force and guys who look like <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/wip_0056_0813_h_14493511.jpg">this</a> </p>

<p>I think we can all agree, it&#39;s not funny anymore.</p>

NSA spying started, Dept. Of Homeland Security, Torture, Kidnappings, black sites, Whistleblowers prosecuted or suicides, the old guard in the media news were driven out and replaced with talking Ken &amp; Barbi news entertainment, militarization of the police, The Banking Cartel robbed the Treasury.

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t surprise me. Jesse Ventura&#39;s Conspiracy Theory show did an episode on FEMA camps and the network wouldn&#39;t show it.  The Military has been training with the police forces of several major cities for years now. They were just here in LA a few months ago training with Blackhawk Helicopters and Osprey tilt rotor, repelling down onto the rooftops of buildings downtown. I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re training to  evacuate the elite from the cities while they send in ground troops to suppress the population. Many of these FEMA Camps are near rail lines so I&#39;m guessing they plan on putting people in boxcars just like the NAZIs to move them to the camps. The NSA has been collecting data for a few years now so they know who to take in the beginning to remove all of the trouble makers. The 2nd amendment people, ex military, etc. Now they have Jade Helm going down in September. That could be the start of the plan. Whenever they run these operations, they disguise it as a &quot; training exercise&quot; and once they have all of their men and equipment in place, they go live and execute the plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there will be a revolution, hell Jade Helm is nothing more than a blatant military exercise to control the masses. 
The problem is that the 1% will just flee to another country that accepts psychopathic parasites. 
I can&#39;t believe America accepted the abolishment of estate taxes, you&#39;re only making the rich richer, but everyone is too busy working two jobs to take a step back and see how hard they&#39;re being screwed. 
I don&#39;t consider myself a communist/marxist, but how can we as humanity accept the fact that we have these materialistic parasites whom buy their second Picasso, while 50 miles away people are struggling to bring food to the table? 
We have fallen for the myth that as long as everyone looks after him/herself, everyone is looked after. 
I much rather life in a world where everyone can attain their basic needs than a world where one in a thousand can own a Rolls Royce. 
It&#39;s time we look at excessive materialism (i.e. Faraggio eggs, diamants etc.) as what it is: useless greed that demonstrates you don&#39;t give a fuck about your fellow humans. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America&#39;s power is going downhill relatively compared to other countries like China, Russia, and the EU. She wants to go back to 1945 when everywhere else was in ruins and she alone was strong. Unfortuanately for her, Russia and China are now de facto Capitalist countries economically, and the EU has been merged into one block economically and politically. This means it is almost impossible to go back to the &quot;good olde daze&quot;.</p>

<p>The military-industrial-congressional complex controls the countries and they will try to use their remaining strength (military) to control the situation for as long as possible. I don&#39;t think this bodes well for the rest of us (although they will make coin). I forsee a major war: Russia vs. EU, or more probably some proxy like ASEAN or better India vs. China. (with the US behind the proxy until they have to come out to fight).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as the end game goes, I see only two options. Either we all learn to coexist on the earth using planet sustaining practices, or the elite make their next move towards systematically decreasing the human population into a controllable and easily maintained size. </p>

<p>I&#39;m quite certain that the economic elite you described already have the means necessary for dramatically decreasing select portions of the population, the question remains of why they haven&#39;t used their depopulation tactics on a grand scale as of yet. The only reason the farcical charade of the world economy has been allowed to go on as long as it has is because the elite continue to somehow benefit from the current operations of the system as it stands. </p>

<p>The 8 billion human population must still be of some use, otherwise I feel things would have been allowed to fall apart a long time ago. There is still something that the richest and most powerful have left to gain. Once they&#39;ve depleted whatever it is, and they will eventually, then things will finally be forced into change. The ball continues to remain in their court. </p>

<p>Humanity is a beautiful and wonderous species. It would be a shame if all of our complexity and goodness were reduced over time into a small group of powerful elites fighting over ownership and claim to an ever dwindling pile of valuable resources. There are alternatives that could benefit all mankind. </p>

I, too, am not particularly pleased with the way this &quot;New American Century&quot; turned/is turning out. But rest assured, change gone come.

<p>See, we&#39;ve got a fever to break before the real healing can happen.  My hopes and prayers are always for a better tomorrow, but I prepare for the worst. Keep your conscious clean by effectuating good intent with righteous actions within the small circle around you (formerly known as family or the community).  And if that doesn&#39;t somehow improve the way you feel about our future, take solace in the fact that we, the awake, are truly the &quot;doves as wise as vipers&quot; amidst a flock of fools with eyes glued to a tube.  At least you can die knowing nobody pulled the wool over your eyes brother.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or we could be in some 3rd world country where this conversation wouldn&#39;t even be dreamed up because were busy thinking about where our next meal is going to come from. </p>

<p>I dunno man, while all of the evidence is pretty damning, I kind of just have to take a look at my life and those of others around the world and say I am pretty fuckin well off. If I go around worrying about all of these things all day every day then they win. I am in a perpetual state of fear and worry. I don&#39;t want that. I mean seriously, who wants to feel like that all of the time? Its like how most religious people think we are living in the end times so they act like it. Walking around thinking the government is going to collapse and martial law is going to be implemented at any moment is a shitty way to live.  </p>

<p>So I go to work, exercise, watch shows I like, cook for myself and those I care about and just generally do things I enjoy. If the government collapses next week then so be it. If it doesn&#39;t (which seems more likely IMO) then I will have lived my life doing the things that I enjoyed rather than being in a constant state of fear and worry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand where you&#39;re coming from. Yet I don&#39;t feel like I am in a perpetual state of fear. But I do worry, to me it feels more like caring. I know we are better off than 90% of the world, but that&#39;s just it. If we put even a little effort into redistributing this wealth to the bottom half of the Earth who are literally starving to death we would have solved so many problems. The fact that we have it so good is great I agree. But the fact that our comfort like iPhones and such is gained over the backs of people who have next to nothing is too much for me to ignore.</p>

<p>I completely understand your point of view and I will not try to change it. Living a good life, caring for your direct community and environment is a very noble goal.</p>

<p>Not really. Without the support of a large swath of the population, they couldn&#39;t have done 1/10 of what they did. They gladly occupied the land after numerous <a href="http://i.imgur.com/M8p6EzG.png">acts of terrorism</a> and let slavery last close to 300 years. Sure you had people like John Brown, a true human, but the vast majority <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/bc/31/4d/bc314dfbb9236740eb187b817ec32c5b.jpg">enjoyed</a>brutalizing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmauP_X5DI">africans.</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A blatantly false statement. The &#39;substantial evidence&#39; amounts to a handful of eyewitness testimonies and confessions extracted under torture. Physical evidence, either on the ground or in terms of paper...mass graves...allied aerial surveillance photos...enigma intercepts...no, there is no evidence in any of this. Particularly, of the gas chambers, and of an organized plan for mass extermination. If you believe this, I invite you to skeptically examine your beliefs and see how true they are.</p>

<p>I encourage you to watch, for instance, the Majdanek Gas Chamber Myth. Or the Treblinka Archaeology Hoax, documenting how the BBC completely fabricated a recent documentary. </p>

<p>Which Archaeological dig? The one in Treblinka, featured on BBC, where they dug up an old, marked, Polish Catholic cemetary and claimed they had found the &#39;mass grave of 700,000&#39;</p>

<p>Please, link me directly, I am unaware of any archaeological digs of any mass graves in Germany or Poland.</p>

<p>Yes, that is exactly what the powers-that-be want you to think. The stronger the racial tensions in this country, the easier we will all be for them to conquer when martial law is finally set into motion. Look at how the media is especially manipulating blacks and whites to hate and distrust each other this year, with their coverage of the riots, looting and shootings. And it&#39;s not just with race. Democrat against Republican, Christian against Muslim, religious against atheist, man against woman, old against young, wealthy against poor... our society has been subtly and gradually molded in many different ways to create tensions between as many groups as possible, so that only Big Brother can be trusted to hold the country together in the end. And by the time we realize what&#39;s really going on (if we ever do), it&#39;ll probably be far too late.</p>

Racial tension is something created by the media, in an effort to divide and conquer us. Oldest trick in the book, it&#39;s even in the Art of War, divide your enemies to fight among themselves and you won&#39;t have to do much fighting yourself. Individualism, religion, politics even sports is used to keep everyone divided to the point where they might as well stand alone, or at least feel like they do. They don&#39;t want the masses to know the message of unity and love which eminates through every persons soul. And I also fear when we get to see through the grey mist, things will have progressed to a point where we no longer hold any power to change it.</p>

There is a physical limit to how much they can get from us, and when they do reach that, their whole system they live off of will collapse.

    <div class="md"><p>I think it started in 2000 with the stolen election. Bush Sr., Rumsfeld and Cheney have been working on the Shadow Government or Continuity of Government plan for the past 3 Administrations regardless of which party has been in the White House or Congress. And then 9/11 happened and the plan was put into effect. The Anthrax Attacks were used to threaten anyone in Congress who was standing in the way and the Patriot Act was signed. NSA spying started, Dept. Of Homeland Security, Torture, Kidnappings, black sites, Whistleblowers prosecuted or suicides, the old guard in the media news were driven out and replaced with talking Ken &amp; Barbi news entertainment, militarization of the police, The Banking Cartel robbed the Treasury. Seems to me, it all started in 2000 and the elite are fast tracking this nation into a prison planet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that is the general idea, but there is a mass of people who are still so embedded in this system, who will even fight to defend it. These are the people these snakes prey upon and they will be the vehicle they will use to drive this humanity off a cliff.</p>
