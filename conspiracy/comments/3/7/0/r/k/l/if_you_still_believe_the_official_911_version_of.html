       If you haven't seen it already, the best video I have seen that completely rips apart the official version of events of what went down on 9/11 is
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DOnAn_PX6M">
        September 11 - The New Pearl Harbour
       </a>
       . The fact that there are
       <strong>
        SO MANY
       </strong>
       inconsistencies with literally every part of the official story tells a grave story indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But through the absurdity of it all, the one piece of the story that you can immediately point a finger at for being a completely fabricated lie is the explanation given by NIST for the free-fall collapse of Building 7.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, who exactly is
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology">
        NIST
       </a>
       and what do they do? NIST is an acronym for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and they function as a "measurement standards laboratory". Basically, they are the guys who set the measurement standards, the specifications, the tolerances and other technical requirements that are employed by engineers, scientists and architects everywhere. They set the standards, and everyone adheres to these standards because they are tried and tested true. They have a massive operating budget ($750 million in 2011 alone) and they employ over 2,900 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support and administrative personnel. You would think that an institution such as this would be the most reliable of all institutions to turn to when it comes to solving physics problems, right? And so they were tasked with investigating the collapse of the three World Trade Center buildings on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The fact that these guys, the ones who we are supposed to trust unconditionally because everything they do is assumed to be based on scientific principles, the ones with almost 3,000 engineers and scientists on their payroll and with a massive operating budget, the ones who literally set the standards in the first place,
the fact that these same guys would publish a report that is filled with inconsistencies is simply laughable.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       But for now, lets just focus on Building 7 alone. Building 7 was a 47-story building that was 610 ft (190m) tall, with a trapezoidal footprint that was 330 ft (100m) long and 140 ft (43m) wide. In other words, it was a big ass long ass steel reinforced high-rise building.
       <a href="http://rememberbuilding7.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/wtc7_tall1.jpg">
        Here
       </a>
       is a picture of Building 7 in all of its glory. NIST has
       <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkp-4sm5Ypc">
        ADMITTED
       </a>
       that Building 7 collapses at free-fall acceleration for 8 stories and 2.25 seconds. There is no conspiracy about it, they have admitted it. But what does that mean??
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It means that for 2.25 whole seconds (it was actually
        <a href="http://static.infowars.com/2010/09/i/article-images/video.jpg">
         2.5 seconds
        </a>
        ), an entire 8 stories of a massive 100m long 43m wide concrete steel reinforced high-rise building collapsed with a downward acceleration EXACTLY equal to the speed of gravity, with the floors below offering ABSOLUTELY NO RESISTANCE to the collapse. The entire 8 stories of a massive 100m long 43m wide steel reinforced high-rise building acted as one solid object and simply fell as if there was nothing at all below it.
        <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YYDUr2t.png">
         Here is a quick mock-up of just how much of the building 8 stories is.
        </a>
        For these 8 stories, NIST admits that the building fell in EXACTLY the same way any object would fall if simply dropped from a height with nothing but air resistance below it.
        <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsBVXbDRxk">
         Here is an introductory free-fall physics problem
        </a>
        that shows a ball falling at free-fall for a distance of 2metres. What you need to understand, is that NIST ADMITS that Building 7 collapsed for 2.25 seconds in an identical manner to this ball falling at free-fall speed with nothing but air below it. Essentially, the 8 stories below simply vanished and offered absolutely no resistance to the floors above. How is this possible in the real world??
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The simple answer is: It's not. Not without some other force vaporizing the floors below. NIST claims that Building 7 was the first ever steel reinforced high-rise structure to collapse solely from fire in the history of steel reinforced high-rise structures, even though it was built to accurate safety specifications and was designed to still be standing after any fire damage, just like any other steel high-rise structure is designed. Read that again to fully grasp what is being said. Of the thousands of steel reinforced high-rise buildings that have been built around the entire world, the first one to supposedly EVER collapse due to fire alone, and the ONLY one since, just so happens to have taken place on the same day that two planes were flown into its sister towers just a few hundred metres away. Is that not the greatest coincidence of all time??? It's not like Building 7 is the only building in history to be engulfed in flames either (though it was FAR from being engulfed in any case).
       <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1jtyln/here_are_images_of_wtc_7s_fires_compared_to_those/">
        Here is a reddit post
       </a>
       listing a few images of buildings engulfed in fire. As an example, here are the
       <a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/70dc791270ae.jpg">

       pictures showing
       <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/pp190104building7.jpg">
        the extent
       </a>
       of the fires that "engulfed" Building 7. Here's a quote from the "A New Pearl Harbour" video:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        If NIST's findings were true, 100's of skyscrapers from all over the world would suddenly be in danger of a collapse due to fire. This should have called for the immediate suspension of all high-rise constructions, widespread verifications in all existing skyscrapers, and a serious revision of fire codes and safety regulations for the new ones to be built. None of that has happened. Steel skyscrapers have continued to be built just as usual. The ones that caught fire, even when fully engulfed in flames, have continued to remain standing, and not one of the basic tenets of fire protection has been modified when it comes to designing high-rise steel buildings.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, the institution that is responsible for governing the standards by which buildings are built in the first place releases a report indicating that Building 7 was the first (and only) high-rise steel building in history to collapse solely due to fire. They then:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        refuse to release the model and data they used to demonstrate said collapse
       </li>
       <li>
        demonstrate a collapse simulation that does not match the actual collapse sequence at all
       </li>
       <li>
        never publish the collapse data in a peer-reviewed publication for scientific analysis
       </li>
       <li>
        do not call for any revisions of fire codes and safety standards for existing and upcoming buildings
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Does that sound like something the institution responsible for measurement standards would normally do? Business carries on the same as usual, as if the "collapse by fire" of Building 7 never really happened. Once again, these are the same guys who are responsible for setting the standards that all engineers and scientists follow, and they
       <strong>
        CANNOT
       </strong>
       demonstrate a model using science that exactly matches the collapse observed. If that alone does not blatantly prove that some other forces were at work, nothing ever will.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The free-fall of Building 7 is the real smoking gun in the whole 9/11 fiasco. Once you see that, it is easy to see how everything else is a lie as well. Educate yourself, educate others. Science and physics do not lie.

       If WTC 7 was the first building to ever collapse due to only fire, then how many high rise buildings after 9/11 were "recalled" and safety measures were upgraded to prevent such "catastrophe"? This would have created a lot of jobs per se.

       Non sequitur.  Not every building is like WTC7.  WTC7 collapsed because it had a shitty design because it was built over a ConEd substation.  And lessons from 9/11 have been learned and found their way into building regulations.

       That is what civil engineers, including those hired by Aegis Insurance
 have concluded.

       <p>
        I remember getting a call from the, er, fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire, and I said, "We've had such terrible loss of life, maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it." And
        <strong>
         they made that decision to pull
        </strong>
        and we watched the building collapse.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, if you reckon "pull" can only mean explosive demolition (which it doesn't) and also believe without question what Silverstein said (which only seems to happen when he's confirming conspiratorial thought), it was actually the
       <strong>
        New York Fire Department
       </strong>
       , not Silverstein who brough the building down.

       Correct me if I am wrong but I see only two "experts", Mowrer and Nordenson. As against
       <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/about.html">
        thousands of engineers
       </a>
       who say it was controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I noticed, the judge in this suit, Alvin Hellerstein is a staunch Zionist. His son works in an Israeli law firm. There is a clear conflict of interest here, given the fact that
       <a href="http://youtu.be/LbkQddEDPs0">
        Israeli citizens were apprehended for 9/11 by NYPD
       </a>
       . This same judge is

       Well, that's not our job to decide who is a terrorist and who is not. But instead of a trial, those Israelis were sent back to their homeland by another Zionist Chertoff, punching even bigger hole in this conspiracy.

       WTC 1 and 2 were audacious designs that pushed the limits of safety.   Buildings designed before were much more conservative.
       <br/>
       Bin Laden (the leader of al Qaeda at the time of the attacks) had studied civil engineering, and he probably knew that the towers would collapse if struck at the right height with sufficient kinetic energy to dislodge the fireproofing.

      <p>
       Their series of twenty-five provable points which clearly demonstrate that the reports produced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) on the destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) were unscientific and fraudulent. Therefore NIST itself – including its lead authors, Shyam Sunder and John Gross - should be investigated.

       C-SPAN Interview: Architect Richard Gage talked about his group, Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, which claimed that the World Trade Center was brought down by explosive demolition on September 11, 2001. The group was founded in 2006 and said its mission was to “expose the official lies and cover-up surrounding the events of September 11, 2001 in a way that inspires the people to overcome denial and understand the truth.” Mr. Gage spoke via video link from San Francisco, California:

       Tough to get a job when you go against the official story. I've spoken with two engineers who say pretty much everybody knows the WTC7 NIST story is a scam, but nobody can afford to say it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously; look at ALL the holes in the 9/11 story, man. It's not just WTC7. From the absence of leadership to the Secret Service not pulling Bush from that school to the lack of scrambled jets to the lack of footage of the hijackers getting on the planes to the fact that more than half the hijackers are still alive (a fact the FBI does not deny but refuses to address) to the stonewalling of any kind of investigation to the Anthrax attacks upon people pushing back against the Patriot Act and THAT fucked up investigation to six of the 11 members of the 9/11 investigation saying it needs to be reopened to the 28 classified pages of the first report to all the stock market short sales in the days  immediately prior to 9/11 to PNAC's prognostications to facts that go on and on and on.

       Either you don't know because you don't WANT to know or because you're being paid not to know. Our country has been betrayed from within by globalists affiliated with several other nation-states and corporate interests that create a round-robin circle jerk of militarism and campaign finance and the dumbing down of society.

       You are also ignoring outlier expert analysis. Experts you disagree with because other experts told you you should. That's not a very good way to get at the truth.

       AE911 is also a "professional body", just a smaller one. You're welcome to disagree with their assessment, but you can't say they're not expects in the field.

       I don't agree that AE911 is "not a professional body" They are a group of professionals, and they are grouped by a particular issue relevant to their professional expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're a sizable
       <em>
        group of professionals
       </em>
       with expertise directly relevant to the issue which unites them. You said, and I quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I form my own opinions based on the opinions of experts
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well, AE911 is a group of experts. So is NIST. These two groups disagree. In case you haven't noticed, I haven't even endorsed one narrative over the other. My goal here is to point out that you are wrong to say that there are no experts "in the real world" that dispute the official 9/11 narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you form your opinion based on the opinion of experts, you
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       account for the outlier that is AE911. If you rely on other experts, and do not spend your own time and effort independently analyzing the data, the only honest conclusion available to you is that the majority of experts side with the mainstream narrative, and a minority of
       <em>
        equally qualified experts
       </em>
       dissent. That is a far, far cry from "Meanwhile in the real world".
      </p>
      <p>
       You could probably make your point with arguments against evolution -- there is no thousand-strong accredited and vetted Biologists and Naturalists Against Evolution group. But close your eyes as tight as you want, AE911 does exist. The real world is not so clear-cut as you may wish to believe, and I advise you to incorporate nuance into your perspective.

       Just to shine some light on this; your assertion is not that the NIST report is correct, but instead a
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       theory that the ConEd substation wasn't substantially engineered to support a high-rise above it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Isn't this just you substituting your own conspiracy theory for the ones you reject?
       </strong>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This theory you convey is complete nonsense. As you can see from the link above, the building was offset. New beams were installed [even though the initial construction was designed specifically for a high-rise to sit on top of it].
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you claim that the sub-structure of the Con Edison facility collapsed, it still cannot possibly account for the symmetrical collapse of WTC7 sitting on top of it. And it is also clear in all the videos that the building collapsed from well above ground, then eventually flattened the bottom. It did not fall to the side, as it would if the offset sub-structure collapsed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't understand how anyone intelligent can possibly believe the story you tell.

       Thank you. If only more qualified people had your courage we wouldn't be in this situation where political science weighs more than actual science. I find it ridiculous that 14 years have passed and nothing done since verifiable and repeatable results disprove the official narrative. Two things stand out as the most easy to prove that would be the molten steel (fire hypothesis breaks second law of thermodynamics for obvious reasons ) and the observed and admitted free fall of 7 breaks at least newton's third of opposing forces. If there was free fall there had to be exactly 0 resistance for at least 100 feet and to say that fire can produce this is beyond ignorant.

       Hi dude, great post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any truth to the part of NISts 'story' that the inner structure of wtc7 collapsed prior to the outer/visible face?
      </p>
      <p>
       (seems ridiculous to me so definitely would like your expert opinion :)

       NIST claims that the entire collapse of Building 7 was initiated by the collapse of one main column,
       <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/metamirror_cache/img253.imageshack.us_img253_2936_wtc7column79hm2.png">
        column 79
       </a>
       . Now, have a look at
       <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/disasterstudies/wtc/images/WTC7diagramForFAQs_1.gif">
        all the columns
       </a>
       that made up Building 7. Simple logic can tell you that if you remove that one column only, the rest of the building is not going to suddenly symmetrically collapse 47 stories down to the ground. If that were possible, controlled demolitions would only require the planting of explosives on one column for a massive 47 story 100m long 43m wide high-rise steel reinforced building to be brought down to the ground in seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The likely scenario for the controlled definition would probably have had the inner columns blown up before the outer face though, so I guess that is true.

       So why, in your opinion, was building 7 destroyed?  For a little extra pizzazz in the overall catastrophe and media footage?  It was hardly shown and I doubt many Americans have ever heard of it.  Extra insurance money for Larry Silverstein?  Awfully audacious for more money when it could wreck the whole secret plan.  What then?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The free-fall of Building 7 is the real smoking gun in the whole 9/11 fiasco. Once you see that, it is easy to see how everything else is a lie as well.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How is it the smoking gun?  What are you concluding from these inconsistencies, in other words?  "It doesn't add up in my opinion, therefore ____________ happened" doesn't seem to add up, either.

       If you research the corporations and agencies that had offices in Building 7, it starts looking more and more sinister. While it obviously cannot be proven, there are theories that a lot of incriminating evidence was completely destroyed along with the building. Also, it is entirely possible that Flight 93, which was shot down/crashed in a field, was on course for Building 7, and once that failed, the building had to be brought down through controlled demolition. For a more out there reason, I have also read theories about the entire 9/11 event being an occult ritual which required the destruction of all 3 buildings. There are many theories about why it was brought down the way it was, you just need to research it for yourself. The only fact of the matter from the evidence at hand is that it was not brought down the way NIST describes.

       The debris that fell and damaged the other WTC buildings (
       <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Six_WTC_SW_Corner.jpg">
        for example WTC6
       </a>
       ) was much more destructive than the debris that fell onto WTC7, yet each one of WTC3, WTC4, WTC5 and WTC6 were still standing (but damaged) after the events of 9/11. WTC7 was only seen to have fire damage and no major debris damage at all, yet was the only one other than the towers to collapse. NIST does not make any claim to the debris causing major structural damage to WTC7 either.

       Wow, that's pretty crazy. I thought they would have blamed it on the debris. NO way that only fire caused the building to collapse like that.
