       Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems odd that the media could have run this story a long time ago- it was known for years now, apparently- but only just as the TPP moves into its fast-track stage does it become headline news.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't seem like a stretch that some high level government PR worker asked media contacts to run something in their pocket that would take attention away from this huge global economy cluster fuck that is the TPP.

       Eh, I see the article's point, but I question if maybe their phrasing isn't intentional but rather just bad writing. Sometimes I have to wonder if the media gatekeepers are malevolent or just naive.

       Ahh... I didn't realize driving fast away from cops* now draws an instant firing squad death penalty -- and without even a trial or anything!!  How awesome and convenient!!   (*Pro Tip: mostly only while being black)
      </p>
      <p>
       The standing on the hood emptying your gun into the already bullet riddled bodies is a particularly nice bit of "justice" for fast driving while black.

       Well lets be sure to give this guy a continued career in law enforcement then where he won't be around many perceived "threats" that he can (apparently) safely overreact to and where any random backfire will lead to firing squad executions of those perceived "threats."
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if anyone else heard this "backfire" or can attest to the "pos" and "clunker" status of the car in question other than the 137 bullet firing cops and Rambo who dispatched the unarmed men.

       You sure don't mind embellishing - or making up - facts as you go along.  The pursuit began because a car, driving by a black person, backfired as it passed by a police station.   No running of a red light, no continued backfiring, no clunker.  Two black men pursued by over 100 angels of the military death squads cops and shot at 137 times including 15 shots point blank from the hood through the windshield after the UNARMED men were already riddled with bullets.

       Pardon me, but I think your anti-black bias is prominently on display.

       Well I still don't see the connection to blacks...AT ALL.  Besides, it's an undisputed fact cops kill more white men every year anyways. If anyone should be outraged it's white men since they're being shot dead by the police every single day.

       This is my last comment as I'm really tired of talking about this non-story.  There's a whole lot more to it than what the media wants to report.  And after over a month of hearing all the facts and seeing all the evidence the judge ruled in favor of the police officer.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's anything to learn from this its to just pull the fuck over when cops are following you with their lights flashing.  I think we can both agree on that.  Good night

       Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's a secret (or, well, they want it to be secret) trade agreement that we know only some things about, but we do know it gives corporations the right to sue governments for passing laws that hurt their profits, essentially giving them equal legal footing with nations. It's bad enough that corporations are people- letting them compete for power with
       <em>
        countries
       </em>
       seems very Shadowrun-esque.

       It has bipartisan support and is now fast-tracked for signing into law. Obama and the Republican leadership are the primary supporters. When there's cooperation like this on a grand scale, you know a common enemy united them. In this case, the common enemy seems to be the average person.

       ugh... so much about this country died with Citizens United... A person can be tried, convicted, and jailed. Can we do that with a corporation? We have created a legal "person" whose rights are

       Apparently it's fast tracked in the sense that congress can't modify it with amendments, they have to vote on it as is. It's still a shit bill and even though it's going to take a year to pass, it will still pass and then we'll be left with shit.

       On one hand yes. On the other hand, in todays fast paced age of information if the media doesnt stay relevant and milk the new fresh of the press crap they dont stay relevant. Loosing to internet and media devices.

       Its easy to forget that first and foremost they sell add space. So if there isnt a new shiny pop story  eing played noone would watch their shit.

       I may be even inclined to say, that this hecktic world is perfect for sneaking in draconian policies as people 1. Forget wtf they just read as they read a brand new thing and 2. So much crap out there that can take the spot light as the story that its easy for the policy makers to have heat shaved off of them.

       I get that. But they more or less refuse to discuss the TPP, probably because the government wants the people to shut up and stay quiet about it. But it affects the people. I also think that there may be a mixup of causation there- the "hectic world" isn't allowing for more draconian government policies to pass, but rather the government fosters a hectic world to keep people distracted. Hence, the media is always on "alert" with "breaking, dramatic news", but something huge like the TPP only gets attention on alternative sites like Reddit.
