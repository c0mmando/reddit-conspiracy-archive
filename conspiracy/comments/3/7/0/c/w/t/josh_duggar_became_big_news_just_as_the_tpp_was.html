    <div class="md"><p>You sure don&#39;t mind embellishing - or making up - facts as you go along.  The pursuit began because a car, driving by a black person, backfired as it passed by a police station.   No running of a red light, no continued backfiring, no clunker.  Two black men pursued by over 100 angels of the military death squads cops and shot at 137 times including 15 shots point blank from the hood through the windshield after the UNARMED men were already riddled with bullets.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I still don&#39;t see the connection to blacks...AT ALL.  Besides, it&#39;s an undisputed fact cops kill more white men every year anyways. If anyone should be outraged it&#39;s white men since they&#39;re being shot dead by the police every single day. </p>

<p>This is my last comment as I&#39;m really tired of talking about this non-story.  There&#39;s a whole lot more to it than what the media wants to report.  And after over a month of hearing all the facts and seeing all the evidence the judge ruled in favor of the police officer. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s anything to learn from this its to just pull the fuck over when cops are following you with their lights flashing.  I think we can both agree on that.  Good night</p>

It&#39;s a secret (or, well, they want it to be secret) trade agreement that we know only some things about, but we do know it gives corporations the right to sue governments for passing laws that hurt their profits, essentially giving them equal legal footing with nations. It&#39;s bad enough that corporations are people- letting them compete for power with <em>countries</em> seems very Shadowrun-esque.</p>

<p>It has bipartisan support and is now fast-tracked for signing into law. Obama and the Republican leadership are the primary supporters. When there&#39;s cooperation like this on a grand scale, you know a common enemy united them. In this case, the common enemy seems to be the average person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get that. But they more or less refuse to discuss the TPP, probably because the government wants the people to shut up and stay quiet about it. But it affects the people. I also think that there may be a mixup of causation there- the &quot;hectic world&quot; isn&#39;t allowing for more draconian government policies to pass, but rather the government fosters a hectic world to keep people distracted. Hence, the media is always on &quot;alert&quot; with &quot;breaking, dramatic news&quot;, but something huge like the TPP only gets attention on alternative sites like Reddit.</p>
