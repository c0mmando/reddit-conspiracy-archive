       Why did he also really have Nick Berg's email address and password?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an old post about these "beheadings" I made a long time ago.  Amazing that it all keeps tying back to Israel and other "intelligence agencies":
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just researching this Steven Sotloff.
      </p>
      <p>
       His father is a ghost. His name is Arthur Sotloff. He appeared to found Arthur Sotloff Enterprises in the early 80s out of his home. I can find no mention of what it was that he actually did for employment. Be assured though that Arthur was making big enough money to send Steven to a ritzy private school in New Hampshire called Kimball Union Academy which has a current annual tuition of over $50k.
      </p>
      <p>
       The girl who has been coming out talking about Steven is named Danielle Berrin.
       <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/03/two-huge-secrets-about-steven-sotloffs-life-and-faith-emerge-after-his-execution">
        http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/09/03/two-huge-secrets-about-steven-sotloffs-life-and-faith-emerge-after-his-execution
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Danielle Berrin, who writes for the Los Angeles Jewish Journal, knew Sotloff since first grade and had corresponded with him in recent years.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is is @hollywoodjew on twitter. She published this article on August 25th talking about how great zionism is and how thankful that the jews in hollywood stick up for Israel.
       <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/for_hollywood_protest_letters_are_the_new_black">
        http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/for_hollywood_protest_letters_are_the_new_black
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "it's comforting to know that at least 200 Hollywood leaders care about Israel's welfare. But the Zionist hero of the summer is Kavanaugh, grandchild of Holocaust survivors, who didnâ€™t require groupthink to use his mind."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So let's deal with Danielle Berrin for now. She is vouching for Steven. She may well know him, but I haven't seen any pictures or evidence of a friendship or that she has been contacting him as she has claimed. Furthermore, we don't really know the nature of what they would talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       The connection we have is that she works with the American Jewish World Service.

      </p>
      <p>
       This was an organization founded by Ruth Messinger.

      </p>
      <p>
       She had Nick Berg, the original man to be "beheaded", to her home shortly before he left for Israel, then Iraq!
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/us/a-family-tries-to-remember-a-son-killed-in-iraq-and-his-style.html">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/15/us/a-family-tries-to-remember-a-son-killed-in-iraq-and-his-style.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Ms. Messinger, who opened her home to Mr. Berg and other volunteers for a gathering last summer, said that much of Mr. Berg's work with the service stemmed from a desire to get closer to his Jewish heritage, particularly the Hebrew concept of ''Tikkun Olam'' or helping to heal or repair the world."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How is it that this zionist organization is so close to two people who were "randomly" captured and "beheaded"?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to further the question with the evidence of Nick Berg's "random encounter" with the terrorist named Moussaoui. We are supposed to believe he let this guy borrow his computer on a bus to check his email? We are supposed to further believe that this guy had wifi/satellite back in the 90s/early 2000s on a bus?

        http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/Northeast/05/13/berg.encounter/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "At one point during the bus ride, Berg said, the man sitting next to his son asked if he could use Nick's laptop computer. "It turned out this guy was a terrorist and that he, you know, used my son's e-mail, amongst many other people's e-mail who he did the same thing to," Berg said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Government sources said Berg gave the man his password, which was later used by Moussaoui, the sources said."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I mean seriously.... how much "random coincidence" hyperbole are we supposed to believe?

       i agree that zionist "fingerprints" are all over this; but this has become a pattern, seems like they're always lurking in the shadows when some shtf.

       Yes this was posted yesterday and didn't get huge traction but it should have. Blackwater is an arm of the CIA and is used for many black projects that are too sensitive for government property. The control network of psychopaths transcends the CIA or any other institution and Blackwater is square in the center of black ops.
      </p>
      <p>
       That there is such a distinct connection to 9/11 comes as no surprise but at the same time it is important add this towards the top of the massive list of holes in the official story.
