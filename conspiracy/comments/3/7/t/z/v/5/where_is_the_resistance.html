    <div class="md"><p>Always start with yourself.  The masses are not ready or unwilling to accept the responsibility that lies ahead if they were to awaken at the present time.  Many of their comforts/luxuries would perish under the new lifestyle and, to them, it is an unacceptable risk for an uncertain reward (at the moment, they have their bread and circuses).</p>

<p>Vote with your dollar.  Switch your money to a credit union.  Eat healthy (Vegetarian if at all possible, or the best you can do).  Exercise.  Share information with those who ask and are ready.  Switch your furniture/beds/curtains from chemically-sprayed P.O.S. to natural alternatives (wool).  Only buy clothing you know doesn&#39;t come from slave-labor (Prison or 3rd-world country) and are made of natural fibers.  Continue reading (may I suggest Chris Hedges new Book &quot;Wages of Rebellion, The Moral Imperative of Revolt&quot; or even perhaps the new Fight Club 2 graphic novels).  Take fewer bathes/showers that use shampoo/soap.  Get a Go-Bag ready and a plan of escape (practice once a month - make it a camping trip).  Grow your own food/join a community-garden that grows their own food.  Shop locally.  Learn basic carpentry, machinery (small motors) and other important skill-sets (take on a new project every few months).  Collect rain-water.  Pay attention to weather patterns (happens naturally if you garden) and if you live in a risky area, consider moving if possible (earthquakes, coastal floods, nuclear power plants, fracking, metropolitan areas etc).  Continue researching the mechanisms of control to better understand your enemy.</p>

I&#39;ve never seen any stores around me that don&#39;t have clothing made in another country. I searched for a list and I saw some that listed companies and then others would say that they&#39;ve purchased something and it was made in China, I know that a lot of big box companies have stuff from China, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and so on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends where you live, but as the other poster said, it will cost more.  A 9.99-15.99 plain shirt at Target/Kohls etc will be 30-60$ (wool, made in America) [one example: <a href="http://appalatch.com/store/products/category/all-products/">http://appalatch.com/store/products/category/all-products/</a>].</p>

<p>I like to buy plain shirts (v-neck or tee&#39;s) and bleach art onto them.  I also buy pants that are made from hemp.  My jeans I used to buy wouldn&#39;t last 3-4 years of use (in the knees and bottom cuffs).  The hemp pants seem like they will start to wear down after my grandchild begins to use it (atm my child is not even two ;p).  This place has natural fiber clothing and shirts starting at 32$: <a href="https://www.pararev.com/">https://www.pararev.com/</a></p>

<p>Just search for hemp/wool/cotton all natural made in America (or country you live in).  Look at reviews off-site etc and determine what is best for you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just bothersome when you go to a rally/protest and everyone has a BoAmerica/Chase etc card and their shirts have Made in Bangladesh/China on them.  Be authentic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either you can learn to make clothing yourself, find some local stores that sell self-made clothing or search for some high quality clothing made in Europe or the US. It&#39;ll cost you way more than sweatshop products, but that&#39;s of course a given.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100%.  I am still working on many of those myself, and it&#39;s been a decade-long journey so far.  Trees planted first after we got some property.  They&#39;re just now starting to yield dozens of surplus fruit we can&#39;t even handle (put them in the ground 5-7 years ago).  I used to eat spam and velveta mac n cheese or ramen on-the-daily back in college (or Domino&#39;s delivery).  It&#39;s been a evolutionary change of all my habits - now we cook nearly every meal, but we still eat meat/fish 2-3 days a week (still working on it).  I&#39;m also sure I&#39;m missing tons of things that I will eventually learn (hopefully) to increase my experience on Earth as an authentic being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why shouldn&#39;t we think they are stealth human impersonating lizards? What&#39;s the evidence for an against it? Lol. I know you&#39;re saying and that is a shame. Shunning ones pursuit for the truth is disrespectful, especially when everyone looks to their explanation and it&#39;s blatantly obvious that it&#39;s flawed and mysterious. Which often makes me think they want to distract us with this so we can forget something else, but what would be to gain and they can&#39;t be that stupid to not know the flaws are there.</p>

<p>Are <em>you</em> going to fire the first shot in this resistance?  Because right now, other than educating others there isn&#39;t a fucking thing anyone <em>could</em> do.</p>

<p>And frankly, I&#39;ll be very disappointed if it comes to violent resistance anyway -- because the predictable result of a bloody fight is that somebody else will rule over us.  And the new rulers will be even worse.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that it will take empty bellies and unheated, unlit homes for people to be angry enough to throw caution to the wind and rise up.  But they&#39;ll be rising in anger against MRAPs and killer drones in a total surveillance environment and the results will not be pretty.</p>

<p>TPTB have planned for all that.  </p>

<p>And nobody has stolen any plans for the death star.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a trap.</p>

<p>Ok.  Now we have some vaporware.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not solved though until we have fully-tested, peer-reviewed software.  And we still have to figure out how to grant access to the poorest people who don&#39;t have internet access or in many cases, even a smartphone or computer.</p>

I think we should use our technology and creativity to usurp the powers that be.

    <div class="md"><p>Romans 13:1-7 states, “Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. For he is God&#39;s servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God&#39;s servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God&#39;s servants, who give their full time to governing. Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.”</p>

<p>This passage makes it abundantly clear that we are to obey the government God places over us. God created government to establish order, punish evil, and promote justice (Genesis 9:6; 1 Corinthians 14:33; Romans 12:8). We are to obey the government in everything—paying taxes, obeying rules and laws, and showing respect. If we do not, we are ultimately showing disrespect towards God, for He is the One who placed that government over us. When the apostle Paul wrote to the Romans, he was under the government of Rome during the reign of Nero, perhaps the most evil of all the Roman emperors. Paul still recognized the Roman government’s rule over him. How can we do any less?</p>

<p>The next question is “Is there a time when we should intentionally disobey the laws of the land?” The answer to that question may be found in Acts 5:27-29, “Having brought the apostles, they made them appear before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest. &#39;We gave you strict orders not to teach in this Name,&#39; he said. &#39;Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man&#39;s blood.&#39; Peter and the other apostles replied: ‘We must obey God rather than men!&#39;“ From this, it is clear that as long as the law of the land does not contradict the law of God, we are bound to obey the law of the land. As soon as the law of the land contradicts God&#39;s command, we are to disobey the law of the land and obey God&#39;s law. However, even in that instance, we are to accept the government’s authority over us. This is demonstrated by the fact that Peter and John did not protest being flogged, but instead rejoiced that they suffered for obeying God (Acts 5:40-42).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very interesting response. I believe that because the bible was written by man that over time man has added or skewed the message to benefit themselves. Not all of the bible but some parts I just think an omnipotent being like God wouldn&#39;t really care about. Our authority is feeding us substances in our food that essentially kill us. It&#39;s poisonous to our health. Do we accept that or fight it? Our authority also performs executions. Should we support that or fight it? Last question, should we support our authority abusing the resources our earth offers that has led to genocide and will lead to more?</p>

<p>That&#39;s some Bush-logic &quot;If you&#39;re not with us, you&#39;re against us.&quot;  </p>

<p>Of course we shouldn&#39;t support this, but we have to live with it. No, we <em>should</em> try to eat healthy food (since we should keep our body healthy &amp; clean as also said in the Bible).<br/>
No, we should not <em>support</em> them abusing the Earth and destroying it. We shouldn&#39;t be doing it, but that doesn&#39;t stop others from doing so.<br/>
As the Bible says, everything will be resolved soon and the Earth will be cleansed of this evil and it&#39;ll be completely restored. </p>

<p>Let me just tell you, I totally do not support government, but it&#39;s the way we have to live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Christian and I believe God helps those who help themselves. I don&#39;t think sitting around waiting for Jesus is the way to go. If I am proven wrong, I hope the Good Lord will forgive me.</p>

<p>It reminds me of the story of the guy who lived in the suburbs when there was a horrible flood. The waters are rising, rising. </p>

<p>A neighbor comes by in a rowboat, offers to help the homeowner escape. Homeowner says &quot;No thanks; Jesus is going to save me.&quot;</p>

<p>Later, the local Sheriff comes by in a larger powerboat. Homeowner, again, says  &quot;No thanks; Jesus is going to save me.&quot;</p>

<p>After another day, flood waters still rising, a rescue helicopter is sent to get the guy. He still declines: &quot;No thanks; Jesus is going to save me.&quot;</p>

<p>You can guess what happens: Flood waters keep rising and the stubborn man drowns. When he gets to heaven and meets God, he says, &quot;Great to be in heaven, but what the heck happened down there? I kept waiting for you to help me!&quot;</p>

<p>And God says, &quot;What are you talking about? I sent your neighbor, the Sheriff and finally a helicopter to save you!&quot;</p>

<p>God works in mysterious ways. We are his vessels. The body of Christ should not be sitting around waiting for the Messiah. He&#39;ll show when he shows, and if he&#39;s not grateful for my efforts to push back for Good and Justice in his name, I will swiftly drop to my knees and beg for his immeasurable forgiveness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not.  </p>

<p>When talking about &quot;evil&quot; things in the Bible, most if not all of the arguments stem from the &quot;evil&quot; Mosaic law where stoning was allowed. Well, the Mosaic law was removed by Jesus and nothing in it should be done today for we aren&#39;t under the law anymore. Nonetheless its inclusion in the Bible is important because it&#39;s the history of God and his laws do reflect his views and opinions on certain things. (Just wanted to clear that up ;D)  </p>

<p>But, no, there&#39;s really nothing in the Bible I don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t even make any sense. God doesn&#39;t place governments over us, we elect governments ourselves. If we can pick them during elections, we can also depose them with revolutions when they no longer serve our interests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, they&#39;ve never read even a single chapter, most easily deducted from how they think the Bible prophesies an &quot;apocalypse&quot;, &quot;end of mankind&quot; or whatever junk. Totally not true. The end of the Great Tribulation will be a glorious day indeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, not many will see it. Like 1. Thes. 5:2 says &quot;for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night&quot;.  </p>

<p>We are very close to the Great Tribulation indeed. We can see all the signs of the UN coming more and more together in a more and more immoral and godless society and religion being mocked and ridiculed, leading to the soon destruction of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh yes. Soon Jesus will be seperating the good harvest from the weed.  </p>

<p>But then again, just knowing about this and knowing Jesus won&#39;t bring you very far, as Matthew 7: 22, 23 say &quot;22&quot;Many will say to Me on that day, &#39;Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?&#39; 23&quot;And then I will declare to them, &#39;I never knew you; DEPART FROM ME, YOU WHO PRACTICE LAWLESSNESS.&#39;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t lay this at the feet of the UN. The core evil in the world does not stem from the UN. </p>

<p>But what you say about the mockery of religion rings very true. And in many cases, religions have done themselves no favors and been corrupted from within, just like our government. </p>

<p>Things are indeed advancing quickly, but I am not convinced they cannot be slowed or put off for another generation or two. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh no, the core evil does not stem from the UN, it&#39;s simply a tool to make things happen.  </p>

<p>Oh yes. Just look at the Vatican, a.k.a. Corruption HQ. Of course they&#39;re part of the false prophets.<br/>
Yeah, the mockery is funny. When I watched that video of Dawkins telling his &quot;followers&quot; (let&#39;s be honest here: atheism of today is for many almost like a religion itself) to mock and ridicule religious people, I just had to laugh. I mean, that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> what&#39;s written in the Bible. They&#39;re being steered and don&#39;t even know it.  </p>

<p>Yes, things are advancing very quickly. But then again, we <em>do not</em> know when the time has come. Not even Jesus knows it. Only God.<br/>
We can&#39;t slow down or put it off though. We can&#39;t do anything against God&#39;s will, he controls the direction the world is going to be going and when. If there <em>is</em> a big revolution which stops the world government, that would also have been part of the plan - we just don&#39;t know, and therefore, there&#39;s little we can do other than wait.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The authorities that exist have been established by God. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes lasers shoot out of my eyes. Let&#39;s be clear as to the statement I&#39;m attempting to make here:</p>

<p><strong>FUCK THAT.</strong></p>

<p>They <em>claim</em> that God said that shit. The truth to the right of that claim comes from the lips of a man holding a blade. The same claim has been made for generations and rests on this fucking ridiculous concept of &quot;a divine right to rule&quot;. Prove it. The crown&#39;s &quot;divine right&quot; is nothing more than a bullshit pretext for a monopoly on violence. Any Religion that exists with any kind of &quot;ours is the only way&quot; sentiment <em>anywhere</em> in it&#39;s holy text only serves the greater purpose of keeping humanity divided and enslaved.</p>

<p>Any person or group claiming <em>dominion</em> on my person is committing an immoral act, because God made me sovereign over myself when I was given free will. This is your <strong>unalienable right</strong>.</p>
