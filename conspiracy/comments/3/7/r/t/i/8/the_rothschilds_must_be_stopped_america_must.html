       To stop ongoing global crisis, the people of the World MUST tear down the Rothschild’s global power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschild’s power started with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 which gave them private and total ownership of America’s banking and money supply. Now, the entire money supply which they privately print out of nothing and loan to the U.S. government is all being paid back to the Rothschilds with compounding interest all the time. As a conservative estimate, the Rothschilds are now worth over 100 trillion dollars.  All countries worldwide have this same big problem, since almost all have a Rothschilds owned Central Bank. The Rothschilds are trying to reinforce their power by getting the the TPP signed into law. Further, the Rothschilds are attempting to rule globally using a World Currency. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is also associated with the Rothschilds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschilds are going to intentionally crash the dollar to try to trick Americans into accepting a World Currency that they control, therefore, they MUST be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they own all of the Global Central Banking, they loot the money to pay for the gradual Purge they are deploying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Climate engineering(causes alzheimer’s, autism, cancer), vaccines(causes autism and cancer), GMO(causes autism and cancer), fluoride in the water(causes low IQ, and cancer), poison pharmaceuticals, economic crashes, wars, full control of the media and bribery of the government, and also nullification of the Constitution are how they are implementing this gradual Purge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they want to deploy a Purge? The Rothschilds, who are Jews, have an evil mentality because their doctrine is evil, as evidenced by the Talmud, which allows Jews to harm non-Jews and retain a clear conscience. The Jews innately want global ownership and control since it would fulfill their Doctrine. Of course, the free will of each individual Jew chooses weather they follow this doctrine or not. If they follow it, they should pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Privately owned Central Banking is the principle mechanism which precipitates the Rothschilds endless looting and must be abolished, all countries must create SOVEREIGN currencies and public national banks to stop the Rothschilds from having total control over countries and funding this gradual Purge which they hope will enable them to achieve global control by using banks as a World Government.

       Just before he was assassinated John Kennedy had issued a $5 United States Note which was not in any way connected to the FED.  No interest was charged on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that those $5 bills  are the only real constitutional currency that exists now. I very fortunately have one that I received in change and noticed the red seal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's  just another one of those unfathomable  coincidences that he was soon killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen several ads recently calling for a billion of  those same bills to be printed again in honor of the anniversary of Lincolns death.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On June 4, 1963, a virtually unknown Presidential decree, Executive Order 11110, was signed with the authority to basically strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. With the stroke of a pen, President Kennedy declared that the privately owned Federal Reserve Bank would soon be out of business. The Christian Law Fellowship has exhaustively researched this matter through the Federal Register and Library of Congress. We can now safely conclude that this Executive Order has never been repealed, amended, or superceded by any subsequent Executive Order. In simple terms, it is still valid.

       This theory is the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of what Executive Order 11110 was about. Silver certificates were issued from 1878 to 1964. It was President Kennedy who stopped them. Kennedy asked for a law to stop the printing of silver certificates and replace them with $1 and $5 Federal Reserve notes. Congress passed the law and the day Kennedy signed it, he also issued the executive order which allowed the Treasury Secretary to keep printing silver certificates until the new Federal Reserve notes were ready.

       Both of your cites claim the red seal United States Notes were silver certificates. That is unsupportable with anything found on the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm old enough to have been around when silver certificates were the norm and these are a completely different form of currency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver certificates were clearly marked across the top of the bills 'silver certificate' these  red seal Kennedy $5 bills  show  no reference to silver certificates at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The label conspiracy theory holds no power for me. It is a tool invented to keep people from looking into the Warren Commission 's 'findings'
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a Kennedy  red seal $5 United States Note,  It's not a silver certificate

      <p>
       And for comparison Here is a $5 silver certificate. 
 These were discontinued and the Kennedy bill  briefly replaced them until Kennedy could be eliminated.

       Yes, there were both $5 United States Notes and $5 Silver Certificates. Executive Order 11110 was about silver certificates. United States notes were issued from 1862 to 1971. Kennedy didn't change anything about them.

      <p>
       The Rothschilds have never owned or controlled the Federal Reserve in any way. The Federal Reserve is controlled by a mixture of government control (a board appointed by the President of the United States), and the member banks of the Federal Reserve (all national banks in the United States plus those state-chartered banks which choose to join).
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Now, the entire money supply which they privately print out of nothing and loan to the U.S. government is all being paid back to the Rothschilds with compounding interest all the time.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, that's not how things work. The government borrows money by auctioning Treasury bonds to the public. The Federal Reserve buys a certain portion of these (usually 10 to 20%) on the secondary market. The Federal Reserve
       <em>
        gives
       </em>
       most of its profit back to the federal government, so it has only received about 2% of the net interest on the federal debt since 1947. The Federal Reserve has given more than a trillion dollars to the government.
      </p>

       That's a hoax. There is no evidence that the Rothschilds own even

       By what bizarre logic are you linking these to Rothschilds/bankers/Jews? Do you think that they don't rained upon? Children in Israel are vaccinated at a high rate than in the U.S. (For example
       <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS/countries">
        97% of Israeli children are vaccinated against measles, compared to 91% in the U.S.

       You must love reading public school history books and "scholarly articles" regarding monetary policy created by foolish academics or insiders on how the system really works.  You probably also believe that bubbles (housing, student loans, tech) weren't created intentionally to effectuate enormous wealth transfers from the middle class to the uber rich either.

       Currency in general is the problem. If the usa starts printing a 'sovereign' currency, its only a matter of time until it also gets perverted. The only way to keep tptb from having unfair/unequal power is to refuse to use currency. I know, we wouldn't have the internet, led 3d tv's, iphones, fast food, packaged/processed food, xbox or most likely any computers.  But we also wouldn't have  million man standing armies, thousand mile pipelines, plastic islands, and the rampant consumerism that is 'our' culture.

       I think the whole idea about currency is that no one wants a stagnant economy in recovery. So over the past 2-3 decades operators have tried to push the local maximum of the economic pendulum since WW2. This fundamentally forces the feedback pendulum to 'grow' exponentially.

      <p>
       This model is not sustainable.

       The more growth you have, the more the population grows. In cell cultures we refer to this as a rate of population growth curve. Where when the colony reaches equilibrium there is a stagnant phase (linear) and then eventually a death phase.

       Sounds like we'd have a tremendous fall in standard of living, quality of life, economic activity.  There are good reasons money was invented and barter mostly went away.  Barter isn't very efficient or flexible, doesn't scale well.

       If you feel that having iPhones, microwave dinners, and margaritaville machines are important to quality of life/standard of living; then yes the standard of living would drop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole reason I advocate it is because it isn't flexible and doesn't scale well. It forces everything to be localized. it compartamentalize cultures, causing diversity and unique foods/music/games; as well it would slow the spread of diseases if you can't fly across the world.  It would seem a nearly impossible task to centralize production or control if barter reigned.

       Barter would stifle opportunities and advancement of technology.  It wouldn't slow the spread of disease much; all it takes is one person able to travel to spread a disease.  And barter would drastically increase the "friction" in society; food would spoil in one place while people starve in another, workers couldn't move because they have the wrong skill or possessions to work in another place, etc.  Costs of everything would go way up, impoverishing far more people.  No, there are good reasons we mostly abandoned barter.

       How would one travel? Horses? Boats? I figure airline infrastructure would be more or less unattainable. It would take a while for people to get places, so you cant have a guy from west africa hop on a plane and make it to new york before he is even showing symptoms of being sick.

       This already happens. The difference under barter would be that every local would more or less have to provide what they

       , rather than relying on people thousands of miles away.

       You mean people? They could do whatever they want. Grow crops, or hunt, or raise livestock. If you are talking about having a pizza delivery job awaiting them where-ever they go, no that wouldn't happen. They would have to provide it them-self.

       There would be no "cost" per say, just the value that a person holds an object to have.  Impoverished means: make (a person or area) poor. How do you make someone poor if there is no money. I guess it would probably depend on your meaning poor?

       Well you could try and force your will that people shouldn't use currency. But forcing your will on others hardly works - and if it does - some including myself would have a moral issue with doing that. It has to be voluntarily. People have to be intelligent enough to see what currency has allowed/caused, and decide for themself not to use it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In your scenario about anarchy, you are more than welcome to try whatever you wish.  But if you make enough enemies, someone is going to come assassinate you. The funny thing is, anarchy is the rule of the world.  People have just been taught to follow 'the law' while those who understand disregard it completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an idealistic hope. But you should strive for what is ideal.  My philosophy on influencing people is to lead by example. And I do. I strive to barter as much as possible, probably about 80% of my needs are met through barter. It's easy and most people are open to it, they.just never considered it an option.

       Yes, this world, especially at the upper levels, is anarchic (unless we believe that there is a single unassailable power that controls everything). Given that the current state of anarchy did indeed develop from a more dispersed anarchy, I just wonder how it could be possible to maintain that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a supercooled liquid. Water, if you maintain its purity and keep it in motion, you can cool it to less than zero without it freezing. But, as soon as a nucleation point is introduced (and insofar as this analogy goes, that might be a charismatic leader) the fluid rapidly congeals in an orderly fashion as ice crystals firstly around the first nucleation point, but soon after others emerge and the whole thing solidifies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, I'm saying that in human society, the only way to maintain anarchy is for there to be constant agitation. As soon as you allow ideologies to develop, for rules and codes to come into existence, you've already lost because the inevitable result is world government.

The constant agitation would be natural if people weren't of the mind that they had to follow any laws - and were also unhappy with the situation. I think you are correct in the idea that once the idea of government takes strong root, the inevitable outcome is a one world government.

       With the right currency, you have the pros of having a medium to barter with without the cons of fiat money. It is called "demurrage" and makes sure the money stays in circulation and cannot be misused as a commodity.

       I read it. It sounds like the same thing as inflation but on a agreed upon fixed predictable timeline. How would it change anything? It still would be ripe for abuse as soon as someone amassed enough.

       Did you read the Freigeld and Silvio Gesell articles as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that there is no point in amassing it, because with each cycle, it loses its value. You have to
       <em>
        pay
       </em>
       a storage fee, so to say, so it makes more sense to spend it than to amass it. It is exactly the contrary of inflation. The amount of money in circulation is fixed for each cycle, and only as much as needed is printed and emitted - by the government, that is, by the people, not by a private bank.
      </p>
      <p>
       With such a "tax" on "amassing", the value of the money mirrors that of most commodities - instead of inflating all over the place, it rots and decays just as much as food, clothes, furniture, cars, computers and houses, which either are consumed or need investment for upkeeping. It entices the investment into whatever seems to have real value (in the sense of Adam Smith's markets), be it metals, art or education.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is true and tested. In old Egypt, not all wheat brought into the "bank" for storage was returned - it was always associated with loss to mice and mold. In the middle ages, coining a new coin with the face of the new king was always associated with a fraction of the metal being kept behind. On the Pacific islands, where sea shells were used as a bartering medium, it was a tradition to meet once in a while and throw all the surplus sea shells into the ocean. In Wörgl, the system got rid of unemployment, the infrastructure got fixed - until the Austrian government threatened military action against them and they had to give up the experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's totally worth looking into it. Once you understand it - and it's not hard, we're just not used to thinking about different forms of money - you'll wonder who got the fucking idea that usury and inflation are "the motors" that keep an economy running. With demurrage in place, money is dethroned and becomes the slave, instead of being our master.

       I did not read those articles but will. I feel it is not really contrary to inflation though.  Its outcome is almost exactly the same: thru amassing and simply holding on to currency, you are losing value. One is a result the other is a cause, but they both do the same thing.  In  demurrage currency, wouldn't people just cash out right before the currency revaluation? Wouldn't they buy something else which would hold value through the revaluation, such as corn or metal or land?  How would the revaluation occur? Does the government decree that the money is now worth less and people just abide by it?
      </p>
      <p>
       It sound good in theory, but it seems ripe for abuse, like all currency. Maybe not as ripe as the fiat system we have or the gold standard, but abuse would be plenty easy.

       You have a point with the land, but that is addressed by Gesell also. He proposes a land reform, where the land belongs to everyone and you have to rent it if you want to use it. The spoils - in his model - go to the mothers... but 100 years have passed since then, there surely are new concepts already. Heck, there already is a cryptocurrency with built-in demurrage.

       2016 - Demurrage is introduced. New money is printed, and it bears the number: 01-2016. New money is printed 04-2016. If you want to pay with your 01-2016 bill on May 3rd, 2016, you buy a stamp and stick it onto your bill, otherwise, no shop will accept that bill. It's that easy.

       "Fiat money" as in the usury system today IS the abuse - a hidden, mathematical Ponzi scheme, because the system is constantly under pressure - you have to work for money that does not yet exist, and that pressure is conducted all the way down to those who have little to nothing.

       I don't know, If someone was to buy a bunch of commodities just before revaluation, and then sold them right after, what would change? Or if everyone tried to do that and it drove the price up, someone would just have to buy commodities a bit earlier that the majority. All the money is going to be revalued an the same rate across the board, right? So the wealth gap would remain the same based on percentage, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: say one person has $1000 and another has $100. If the revaluation makes it to where you have to pay 10 cents on the dollar to continue use of old money. The person with $1000 pays $100, essentially making it to where his $1100 is now worth $1000. The person with $100 would have to pay $10, essentially making it that his $110 is now worth $100.  1100/110=10 and 1000/100=10.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I understand correctly, you see reinvestment into commodities as a way of getting around the revaluation as a good thing? Why? What happens if they just sell it immediately after? Isn't the whole thing just adding that one step, easy as it would be to sidestep?
      </p>
      <p>
       When the new money is printed, how does it work its way into circulation?

       The problem i have with this is that there has to be a judge of what an improvement is. Everyone is not going to agree, meaning that what some see as improvement, others will see it as detriment. If majority rule is the judge, 51% can see it one way, then 49% just have to deal with it.

       The problem with the driving of prices up just because a new cycle is due is virtually non-existent - if they all immediately sell after, the prices go down again. It makes no sense. At all. At the end of a cycle, everyone will go spend his money on something. Luxury. Donations. Things he wouldn't buy otherwise. It's a type of money you actually want to get rid of, not to hoard!

       Speaking of the wealth gap. I do share neither the hate for capitalism nor for communism or whathaveyouism. I'm pretty much in the demarchy (democratic anarchy) camp. The wealth gap is not a bad thing per se! There's nothing wrong with being rich at all. The rich have a valuable role to play in a healthy society. They will have a yacht and a castle, which need upkeeping, for which people are paid. For a job that is fun! Who doesn't want to be pool boy in a filthy rich family? The rich invest in art and science. Rich is good. Rich as in "has more than he needs" - and in that sense, it would be preferable for everyone to be rich. To not suffer from need. I think it is plausible, doable, logical, and healthy to have a society where those with the lowest income have enough to eat, acceptable clothes, a roof over their head, internet and can afford to go out every once in a while and those with the highest income do not make 1,000,000 fold the money, as is the case in our present, neo-crony-capitalistic, communistic, ochlo-plutocratic oligarchy.

       The usual way. Ah, you can't know it perhaps, I've been through it twice, thrice even. First, we had the Deutsche Mark. After Germany's reunion, new bills were printed. And after that, the Deutsche Mark was replaced with the Euro over the course of a few months. Right now, they are replacing the old Euro bills with new, betterer ones. Coin money comes from more than a dozen different countries, and they all coin something different on the back - ships, swans, harps, eagles, buildings, paintings, queens.

       It makes sense if done correctly. One would buy whatever commodity before the majority, as a result, they would have saved the 10cents/dollar cost of using 'old' money. They would then sell whatever commodity they bought after the revaluation. I would assume alot of people would take advantage of such a loophole - thus increasing the price prior to revaluation and decreasing it afterwards. If you don't think that would happen, it would be even easier to bypass the 10cents/dollar, as the prices wouldn't rise or fall?  Say it does rise and fall though; all it would take to beat the system would be being the first to buy and sell.  Something akin to building private fiber networks to shave fractions of seconds off of data transfer in an effort to be first to buy or sell stocks...

       And in doing so, steer the society and culture in their own vision. The wealth gap is not inherently bad; however; the gap is the origin of power. It allows people to coax others into doing their bidding out of need or desire.  I personally think it is the persons fault for being coaxed into whatever circumstance they get into, however, if the person is rich enough, and there are enough very poor people(ie: if the gap is wide enough) one person could command an army. That would not be possible without a currency.

       Come on, you know it would be no different in a world without money - some other kind of currency would take its place. The wealth gap must not be of monetary nature for sick people to abuse their power. It could be a few guys upstream building a dam, without asking about your fishing grounds first.

       Let me rephrase your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wealth gap is not inherently bad, and the gap is the origin of (relative) power. It allows people to entice others into doing their best out of need or desire for a better world. I agree it is each persons responsibility which concept he will let himself be enticed to support - by reason, a share of the wealth, or intuition. And if the person is rich enough, and there are enough people having nothing better to do, one person could start some bullshit project like making the deserts green.

       I don't read it like that - he just doesn't think a society is sustainable if the majority is unhappy. Read: most people should be happy. That will not work if the majority tells the minority how things are going to go, because the minority will resist, one way or another. From here on, it is merely negotiation.

       That is why the internet is important. It allows communication of information, world wide, instantly. A monetary system is possible where everyone gets at least what he needs, works for what he wants, can tell what is important and gets what all the others have. From there, consensus can be negotiated: free and open. But that's a different story altogether.

        Come on, you know it would be no different in a world without money - some other kind of currency would take its place. The wealth gap must not be of monetary nature for sick people to abuse their power. It could be a few guys upstream building a dam, without asking about your fishing grounds first.
Let me rephrase your argument.
The wealth gap is not inherently bad, and the gap is the origin of (relative) power. It allows people to entice others into doing their best out of need or desire for a better world. I agree it is each persons responsibility which concept he will let himself be enticed to support - by reason, a share of the wealth, or intuition. And if the person is rich enough, and there are enough people having nothing better to do, one person could start some bullshit project like making the deserts green.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The difference without currency would be that building an army, large dam, or turning deserts green would be rather unfeasible. You would have to find a bunch of people who all desired the same thing - which you had alot of. Or you would have to find a bunch of things people desired on an individual level. Way more difficult than offering something that is universally accepted and letting them fill their own desires. I'm not saying it would be impossible, it would just be unfeasable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it would limit people form making 'improvements' to the world such as your example of making the deserts green.  That would be done because people wanted to. There would be plenty of time as producing enough food to make a whole family fat takes less than 40 man hrs a week. Having no currency would drastically cut back on 'projects' that people don't want to happen though as currency wouldn't be a necessity.

        What improves the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole. No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He uses the word greater with regards to population twice in those two sentences.  Advocating that whats good for the majority can't be bad for the whole.  Then that a society can't be happy/flourishing if the majority is poor/miserable.  So if the majority isn't choosing, who is?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Now we have learned from game theory that there is no way to negotiate with a win-win outcome if there is a huge difference in power. A power gap, like, means or information withheld, enforces a win-lose. Because the weaker player's information is incomplete. In the long run, he must always lose. Like in a monetary system where a private body takes interest on interest for money he prints and people have to use to keep their asses poopin'.

       I'm not really sure. lol. You said democratic anarchy, so I felt compelled to add something. My view is that if there are no laws, everything will work into a nice balance. If there are no laws against murder/stealing/whatever, people would try to have only friends. People would also stand up for them-self in the moment rather than chasing a paycheck in court. Which would in turn lead to less and less people willing to risk their life trying to steal a wallet(hahaha - people wouldn't have them).

       This happened in Canada too though not in 1913 but 1974. We're
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       past the event horizon and there is actually a group bringing a lawsuit against finance ministers since then, the bank of Canada, and others for abdicating their duties mandated by Canadian law that gives the Bank of Canada rights to loan money to the federal, provincial, and municipal gov'ts at 0% interest. Since 1974 we've been paying into the same compounded interest scheme as you; roughly $35+B/year and we'll never catch up or pay it off, here's a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8Zl1Wax8MI">
        decent explanation
       </a>
       . We're at the point of waiting for a response from the government to this lawsuit; it started in 2011 but was blocked in various legal forms from proceeding. You guys are going to have a tougher time though because your politicians are so corrupt and can be purchased so easily. There's that in Canada too yes, but it's not as extreme. Plus the cops and agencies here aren't as raging and rampant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The coolest thing to do would be to make a high-budget movie of the success story of Canada taking back their banks;
       <strong>
        and then it happens
       </strong>
       (just like in their movies). At the end of the movie the protagonists head out on a road trip south and as they reach the border the screen fades to black.  Then write a sequel!!

       I've often thought about the movie idea. There's so many possibilities for really engaging stories in this context that are not only based in reality, but would be new and very interesting to most people. Think about how popular "The Da Vinci Code" was. Imagine if the content had been less fictional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I just watched the pilot of a new TV series "Mr. Robot", which appears to have the theme of destroying the Fed (or at least the system of fiat money) through hacking, etc. Of note, the "tech" scenes in the film were actually quite accurately written, and the linuxy terminal mockups were indeed congruent with what was supposedly going on. I'm going to keep watching it (which is saying something).

They are the central bank of the central banks and you will be hard pressed to prove that  Evelyn De' Rothschild is connected to it but of course he is.

       Nothing gives one a greater understanding of what must be done in order stop stop them than an intimate knowledge of 'The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'. No, they have not been "debunked". You can not debunk something with third party information.

       When it comes to the subjugation of races, nothing is more well written, more well studied, knowledgeable and nefarious than, 'The Protocols'. It's no mere hoax, nor is it a coincidence that every single one of them has either happened, or is in the process of happening.

       The protocols are a fucking trip.  A truly fascinating, albeit difficult, read.  But so much of what it calls for has come to fruition.  How folks can close their eyes and minds so quickly to something just because they are afraid of the ramifications of merely acknowledging it as maybe having some truth to it is beyond me.

       I mean I'm not sure if you're being a bit sarcastic, since BTC has also been steadily losing value the past couple years, but it is in its infancy and has increased in value 1000x's if you spread out the timeline further.

       to understanding the absolute mess we are in these days, more vital than understanding false flags or anything else really. It's not talked about as much since it's not as sexy or interesting, but in the fine print of modern finance is truly written your slavery.

       We also need to begin casting a very critical eye towards modern Zionism / Judaism, for the simple reason that this critical eye has been denied us for so long with emotional accusations against the character of anyone who dared to do so.

Now I think of the powers of the modern NSA, and if Israeli interests have the 'dirt' on

       There are two aspects. A military and an economic aspect. The current plot is that the existing nations will go bankrupt in the sovereign defaults and the debt will be rolled over into the SDR. There will be manufactured food, water shortages, nukes. A major catalyzing event and military hand over to the UN of the TPP nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putin is fighting and opposing them publicly and so is China, but they may be working against them. There will be a free for all
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        either the US remains sovereign (US military coup removes executive branch before the other side completes the coup d'é·tats)
       </li>
       <li>
        US is assimilated into UN with Russian/Chinese/European troops and mercenaries in a crisis event (China and Russia support Rothschild)
       </li>
       <li>
        The US breaks apart. Russia supports Texas and supplies anti-aircraft weapons and troops and uses assets in Mexico. (At least Russia goes against Rothschild)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These countries have nuclear and biological weapons aimed at them and have been threatened with annihilation for just opposing the money powers. The objective of the money powers if to create a "trilateral" set of regional powers, where they control/dominate all three and can use the other two to go to war and annihilate the other one if they defect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the money power is already dead. The SDR will not work. We are going back to a gold standard. This is a cycle in history and it is impossible to keep the fiat ponzi going for much longer. If fiat is imposed on people, it will be by military force.
      </p>
      <p>
       The food as a weapon strategy will kill many people. I see the world falling apart. I am not sure nation states will continue to exist. A lot of people will die in the up coming purge. There are countries that have self sufficient food production but they do not have military control over the distribution of the food, so it will end up for export while domestic population starves.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the food as a weapon strategy started, the DHS began hoarding five years of food in caves and training troops to go door-to-door confiscating food from "hoarders" who have more than 7 days of food. They were going to survival/prep stores and getting customer lists so they know who to raid to steal their food.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the great depression, while people were starving on the streets, the government was sending troops to farms to burn crops and kill cattle, to keep the food prices up. Today it is the same story, but access to food can be leveraged both to control domestic populations but can be used against foreign countries as a bargaining chip.

       We first need to divest from corrupt federal and state governments before we take any action on currency, otherwise we will just be empowering them to commit more criminal acts against people:
      </p>
      <h1>
       Divestment
      </h1>
      <p>
       The best way to stop an abuse or corruption is to stop supporting it in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Take responsibility in its creation, by recognizing your ignorance of, or participation in it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do what you can in your own life to remove your support.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do what you can to bring awareness to others by letting them know your part in its creation and what you have done to remove your support.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h1>
       DIVEST INSTEAD OF PROTEST
      </h1>
      <p>
       Protesting sets up the dynamic of putting the protesters in the role of children and the state in the role of nanny. In order to grow up and no longer need a nanny you need to be able to take action yourself to right wrongs. Protesting sends a message that you are expecting somebody else to do that work for you.
      </p>

       If you want to bring real change you need to:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pool together resources from your community participants that you can use to circumvent the malicious entity by taking control of the source of supply and demand.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Stop investing resources into the malicious entity: Time, Money or Energy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bring awareness to other people to stop investing Time, Money or Energy into the malicious entity.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This actually happened in Boliva, [Mcdonalds withdrew from the country entirely ](&lt;

       the people work together to bring awareness, and stopped purchasing the product. This is all you need to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are having trouble with criminal actions of state or federal government officials, it might be best to create your own state international common law court of justice revoke the authority of any and all agents of that state or federal government by submitting a public revocation order.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember you can never win by playing the role of a victim. Stop letting society dictate to you your range of responses to any unjust act. You have to act from a place of power if you want any real change to happen, and you need to inform yourself and others so that you can act from this place of power. I suggest you take a look at some freeman-on-the-land videos: [Dean Clifford](&lt;

       It's too far gone, I'm afraid. Even if we were to get a leader to find us a way out. I'll give you one guess what happens to him/her. As to the new currency, it is already being printed. It is called the Amero, legal tender from north Alaska to south Chile.

       This theory is the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       of what Executive Order 11110 was about. Silver certificates were issued from 1878 to 1964. It was President Kennedy who stopped them. Kennedy asked for a law to stop the printing of silver certificates and replace them with $1 and $5 Federal Reserve notes. Congress passed the law and the day Kennedy signed it, he also issued the executive order which allowed the Treasury Secretary to keep printing silver certificates until the new Federal Reserve notes were ready.

       Are you suggesting that just because the government says it gets money from its bankers, it actually does? Are you also suggesting that the government doesn't tell lies, especially about money?  Have you not learned from real history?
