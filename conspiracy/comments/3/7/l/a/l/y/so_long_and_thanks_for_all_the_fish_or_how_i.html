       I am a died in the wool conspiracy theorist.  i love it.  I don't care anymore who is fucking over whom, because it is already happening and I cant stop it .  And why should I try to?  This world was up and running before me and it will be running after im gone .
      </p>
      <p>
       But, in the mean time, there is nothing stopping me from observing circumstances of happenstance and connecting the dots.
I am very proud of this community in that we are still able to talk about the big deal (911) so long after it happened. 
 If the truth be known, two things made the internet what it is today.  Online shopping and the independant press driven and nurtured by truthers.
       <br/>
       There are many places to discuss the truth, but what I like about this place is that there is a healthy population of shills that provide a sounding board to the theories we like to posit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets face it , if it weren't for the shills, this sub would be as dead as the Top minds of Conspiritard .  As it is , we have over a quarter million subscribers, and since the vape debacle we are actually averaging about %40 more in free thinkers currently thinking freely.( see the side bar)
The point is , if it wasn't for the shills here ,and im refering to the boys and girls that are reddits biggest fans,
       <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html">
        http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/07/eglin-air-force-base-busted-gaming-reddit.html
       </a>
       , then the truth wouldn't look as legit.
  It is self apparent that logic fails a shill and others see that and take note.  That is why the truth is still as vibrant as ever and as is evident on reddit , it is even growing.
There will come a day when all will be revealed and future generations will look askance at how naive and trusting in government we were at the time; from then on understanding that the event was a desperate act of desperate men.
      </p>
      <p>
       But till that day, Hail to the shill, our symbiotic parasite. May both sides be presented on r/conspiracy, and we will let the jury decide.

       You are also a real problem around here.  Frankly, I'm almost sure you've said the exact same thing in response to me before in this subreddit.  Interestingly enough, refusing to consider my further posts because you have me RES-tagged as godknowswhat is much closer to the utilization of an
       <em>
        ad hominem
       </em>
       argument than citing specific reasons for dubiousness on a case-by-case basis.
      </p>

       EDIT: Ah, and what's what?  You're a holocaust denier.  There's your "ad hominem".

       I look for facts, regardless of where they may lead me. The narrative of the holocaust is largely false. There isn't any "denying" anything. There are facts, and then there are fictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I consider every post regardless of who writes it. The point I was making, is that your actions are consistent. Hence the tag.

      <p>
       I agree with what you've posted, but shilling in all forms is just despicable. It is the arm of great propaganda machines nationwide and internationally. I'll never understand what it is that drives a person to hide the truth. That makes a person put others in danger simply by spreading misinformation from the other side of a computer screen. I hope that one day these people can wake up as we have, and I know that day can't be far off. Until then, shills, think about your family/future family, your mother, or your father. Every lie that you propagate does not only hurt us, it hurts EVERYONE including you an yours; even if you can't feel or see it.

      <p>
       But yea the people so aggressively against conspiracies and trying to make fun of us really increased activity by giving something for us to reply to for one thing. Seriously though because of their actions there's no way we can be a hugbox, and now with these debates we can check ourselves and/or can be even sure of what is right.

       And honestly they get pretty ironic when they make fun of us yet never leave. I still think the word shill is dumb though
