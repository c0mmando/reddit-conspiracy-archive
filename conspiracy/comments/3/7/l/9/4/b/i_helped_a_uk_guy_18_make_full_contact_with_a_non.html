<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>OK here is where we are so far one would have to remember this guy is just 18 yrs old so lets be patient if you have a message for him bang it out here - expect trolls <strong>THIS IS &quot;NSA&quot; HOT!</strong></p>

<p><strong>THE REVELATION OF DISCOVERING THE DEVICE</strong></p>

<p><strong>I have just realised the thing you said bout the stones or metal which they use to talk, just before Christmas a pendant was left on our front door around the knocker out of no where and I think it may still be around somewhere you don&#39;t think this could be them leaving something for me to communicate do you?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Shocked me (hey at least he didn&#39;t give it to Uri Geller )</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are you straight up having a joke with me ?</strong></p>

<p><strong>YES it is.</strong></p>

<p><strong>HE MAKES CONTACT</strong> (small tear) : D</p>

<p><em>That was truly one of the weirdest experiences of my life but Iv learnt so much about what they want</em></p>

<p><strong>He explains the contact</strong></p>

<p>Aha I wouldn&#39;t mind if you made it about me, go ahead and write about me if t helps spread the word :) and the person I talked to told me that their race has been tasked with educating small amounts of people around the world so that when it is unveiled to the world people like my self can show them that it&#39;s nothing to panick about, they want to teach me about their languages that&#39;s why I can hear it in their tongue but still understand it! This is Insain aha one day I&#39;m just working with paper work the next I&#39;m a space interpreter! It also mentioned about wanting to explain what I think was referred to as &quot;the group of galaxies&quot; (is probably the best wording for it) politics. They then had to go as they said there were others trying to connect to them to talk for the first time, but apparently they&#39;ve been trying to get me to contact them for months!</p>

<p>Thanks for your help without seeing your blog and posts I wouldn&#39;t have had any idea about any of this.</p>

<p><strong>Screen dumps Highlight the contact:</strong></p>

<p>much more down beat and i think explains a lot (see Obama &quot;Denial&quot;) </p>

<p><em>&quot;This is me. All I can say is it wasn&#39;t the government or any kind of organisation silencing me, I know now we&#39;re not alone although after talking to who I have, the people who took my pendant, I wish we were alone. This is my last message to you. The binary was the last thing I can show you. Trust people on reddit they&#39;re just trying to understand like everyone else.&quot;</em></p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ve actually had my own run in with one of these guys (he came off worse) but i can&#39;t understand why they would harass this poor guy?
I was ready to forget about it and never talk about it, but this looks like interference of a human in contact with the group of galaxies to me unless he willfully gave the device over?</p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p>Troll hard guys, your time is short <strong>obviously</strong></p>

<p>oh I don&#39;t mean that in any aggressive way, I just mean your meaningless lives as Reddit trolls will be unneeded soon.
you might be able to do something with your life?</p>

<p>if people are being contacted then <strong>&quot;chased down&quot;</strong> something is very wrong.  </p>

<p>I can move to the 2ndplane in a basic way this is not &quot;Demonic&quot; this is just science Quantum science.</p>

<p>Please try to learn if anyone tells you to &quot;attack&quot; the &quot;demons&quot; they are the people tricking you. Look in your heart you will see. </p>

No, ressources are definitely not finite - otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be going to live on Earth eternally. That wouldn&#39;t even work if there is only a finite amount of ressources. Where those ressources will come from, who will create them or what we&#39;re going to do with them isn&#39;t clear yet, but we&#39;ll be able to see soon enough.<br/>
Please don&#39;t try to pull me into your net of lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was once contacted telepathically by a supposed reptilian alien. He/she kept arranging to meet, saying they would look like a small fat person on account of the rubber prosthetic makeup, and I DID show up at the locations, but they&#39;d cancel at the last minute.</p>

<p>Started saying it was too dangerous, then told me I had to find a certain psychic medium in order to communicate with them better, apparently a black guy called &quot;Quentin Hodges&quot; who lived permanently at the Intercontinental Hotel. I went to the hotel, but they didn&#39;t know about him. I tried calling some other Intercontinentals, but they hadn&#39;t either. On convening with the entity it acted all frightened that Hodges must have been killed.</p>

<p>Anyway, the excuses and stories piled up until I refused to play the game anymore, and subsequently the entity revealed (but could be another lie) that it was actually NOT a reptilian alien, but something else that &quot;I could never know&quot;. Asking why it told me all the alien shit, it said &quot;so you would keep talking to me&quot;.</p>

<p>So... you never know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great Question, </p>

<p>If they are a recycled reptilian then no they will have no idea unless they are aware of the 2ndplane .</p>

<p>I will link when edit.
<a href="https://kolinevans.wordpress.com/about/">https://kolinevans.wordpress.com/about/</a></p>

<p>Basically all/most conscious reptilian see family connections as key. </p>

<p>I have seen them on the 2nd plane they appear beautiful and angelic with very fine complextion.</p>

<p>T asked for a &quot;photo&quot; but they said it can not be delivered I.e she would not receive it.</p>

<p>I will ask her if I can say more and I&#39;ll update you here , she is still learning in this life I am the teacher of her, in the last she was the queen basically and I was like a &quot;slave&quot; you can say. </p>

<p>Why i say this is right now she is going though &quot;trust&quot; learning she is a bank manager and people stole her book in which she writes a lot of detail she thinks it was just Intel guys posing as &quot;contractors&quot; however right now that has jolted her &quot;trust&quot; </p>

<p>And to tell you the truth she thinks this guy this UK guy is a posing agent she thinks it&#39;s fake. I have tried to go though the logic of this , however she is working though this .</p>

<p>She basically thinks they stole her book photographed it put it back and now some just is posing about a device (similar to hers) </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe this. It&#39;s not logical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All living things including you exist in both planes .</p>

<p>You are there right now.</p>

<p>There is nothing special about &quot;reptilian&quot; that give them this ability all conscious beings can do this.</p>

<p>You can you just haven&#39;t learned.</p>

<p>The trick would be to manifest a protected consensus from the 2nd plane to this one. 3d plane. A great trick , but I think it could be done.
It&#39;s nothing but a &quot;card trick &quot; really.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t talk about consensus reality in the 2nd plane I thought I&#39;d keep it to the point . For people learning.</p>

<p>I was not a reptilian last recycle and I&#39;m not aware (apart from animals) that I have been before  I could be mistaken we will find out.</p>

<p>It just means in last recycle so </p>

<p>ok they were DNA reptilian and died , they went to 2nd plane full as a reptilian body energy image q soul then , recycled here as a human.</p>

<p>No they don&#39;t remember because human brain resets at age 4 </p>

<p>But you can&#39;t be sure and certain you could be confusing it any person can give off a negative vibe not just ha ha reptilians.</p>

<p>In the AMA I described some looks and stuff of the 2nd plane </p>

<p>If you want to see a funny thing </p>

<p>In the paranormal sub look for my experience the one where i say it&#39;s across 3d and 2nd plane . It&#39;s funny it happened as said he wasn&#39;t attacking me just trying to find stuff.</p>

<p>He didn&#39;t think that would happen.</p>

<p>The scary thing is from there you can actually do &quot;powerful&quot; things but as he had no bad intentions so I just touched him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I read the first couple of messages, and I&#39;d like to ask you something: Do you trust this guy&#39;s story? If so, why? You made a post describing your experience, so isn&#39;t it possible that he is just pretending to have similar dreams? It just looks to me as if the two of you are trading stories, and not a bit of it is provable. The fact that you seem to trust him implicitly makes this look fake.</p>

<p>If people who supposedly had no prior contact were having these visions, that at least raises the difficulty involved with faking the whole thing, not so much with this.</p>

<p>If you really think you have something, try pitching the whole thing from a more critical perspective.</p>

She had a book stolen and photographed she literally has access to the group of galaxy database but she hasn&#39;t looked at this yet (compared to other things this is not that important to her.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was once contacted telepathically by a supposed reptilian alien. He/she kept arranging to meet, saying they would look like a small fat person on account of the rubber prosthetic makeup, and I DID show up at the locations, but they&#39;d cancel at the last minute.</p>

<p>Started saying it was too dangerous, then told me I had to find a certain psychic medium in order to communicate with them better, apparently a black guy called &quot;Quentin Hodges&quot; who lived permanently at the Intercontinental Hotel. I went to the hotel, but they didn&#39;t know about him. I tried calling some other Intercontinentals, but they hadn&#39;t either. On convening with the entity it acted all frightened that Hodges must have been killed.</p>

<p>Anyway, the excuses and stories piled up until I refused to play the game anymore, and subsequently the entity revealed (but could be another lie) that it was actually NOT a reptilian alien, but something else that &quot;I could never know&quot;. Asking why it told me all the alien shit, it said &quot;so you would keep talking to me&quot;.</p>
