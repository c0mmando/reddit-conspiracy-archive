<p>Alphabet agencies, as well as some companies, troll this sub-reddit to get a pulse on the resistance movement.  They especially love threads like this one.  </p>

<p>Here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> most of those 300,000 + subscribers are socks/shills/agents.  It doesn&#39;t really matter where you go on the web, you are being monitored and managed.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about the eye.  The elite guide/follow the herds&#39; eyes.  If you get enough eyeballs on ya, you attract their attention.  It&#39;s all perception management in the war to enslave or liberate the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq69-MI9TA0">observer</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tons of scientists all over the world fall into one of 3 categories:</p>

<p>1) They take money straight from a corporation and deliberately falsify data. Kinda like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/dec/08/smoking.frontpagenews">this bigshot who worked 20 years for Monsanto making 1500 dollars a day.</a></p>

<p>2) They pick and choose statistical data, not deliberately, but because they have a deeply ingrained belief about something (pesticides don&#39;t cause harm). They perform mental gymnastics to rationalize their shitty decisions. </p>

<p>3) They simply don&#39;t care about integrity and are there for the paycheck. (or perhaps they&#39;re too scared to say something) They know which side their bread is buttered, so they know which results to publish. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s why: <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1/fulltext?rss%3Dyes">The Editor-in-Chief of <em>The Lancet</em>, one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, shares a similar opinion.</a></p>

<p>Scientists are regular people. Regular people sometimes steal from their jobs, cut corners, falsify or exaggerate their work, behave unethically to get ahead, etc. I&#39;ve worked in many different industries and this is normal across the board. Why people treat scientists like priests (bad example), as if they would do no wrong, is beyond me. </p>

The locals call it &quot;Uncle Bill&#39;s Island&quot; because Bill Clinton spent so much time there. EVERYONE on the island knew shady things were going down...but, it&#39;s the islands, plenty of yachts full of underage boys/girls, creepy shit. The last time I visited the islands were in dec/jan.2005 where I met Hunter S. Thompson and family at Bleuwater restaurant. A month later he &quot;killed himself&quot; and shortly after I heard rumors that he was investigating pedophilia/child sex trafficking. 2+2=suicided. (in march 2005 Epstein, who pimps out children to politicians for a living, got busted in Palm Beach soliciting a 14 for sex...Now, If you don&#39;t know about Palm Beach, you don&#39;t know that cops there do not bust people like Epstein for ANYTHING, he could have a dead child stuck to his penis and they would detach it, clean him up, give him a blanket and a warm cup of cocoa. Very suspicious anonymous call leading to a bust/investigation/2years of harassment/plea bargain Bill Clinton&#39;s child sex pimp. Conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I don&#39;t exactly believe it, but the hypothesis that many people who think they were kidnapped by aliens were actually kidnapped by the CIA, drugged so they would be disoriented, then experimented on using dwarfs or others in &quot;suits&quot; that made them look &quot;alien&quot;, so when they were later released and described what happened, no one would believe them and would think they were crazy.</p>
