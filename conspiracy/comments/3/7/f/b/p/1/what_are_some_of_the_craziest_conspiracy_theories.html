       Tons of scientists all over the world fall into one of 3 categories:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) They take money straight from a corporation and deliberately falsify data. Kinda like
       <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/dec/08/smoking.frontpagenews">
        this bigshot who worked 20 years for Monsanto making 1500 dollars a day.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2) They pick and choose statistical data, not deliberately, but because they have a deeply ingrained belief about something (pesticides don't cause harm). They perform mental gymnastics to rationalize their shitty decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) They simply don't care about integrity and are there for the paycheck. (or perhaps they're too scared to say something) They know which side their bread is buttered, so they know which results to publish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why:
       <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960696-1/fulltext?rss%3Dyes">
        The Editor-in-Chief of
        <em>
         The Lancet
        </em>
        , one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, shares a similar opinion.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists are regular people. Regular people sometimes steal from their jobs, cut corners, falsify or exaggerate their work, behave unethically to get ahead, etc. I've worked in many different industries and this is normal across the board. Why people treat scientists like priests (bad example), as if they would do no wrong, is beyond me.

       What about the scientists who actually try to study real shit, only to be shunned by the scientific community and labeled as "crazy" or a "conspiracy theorist"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who purports any evidence that goes against a well established paradigm immediately gets shot down and ridiculed.

       I believe there are an organisation, so big, so deep, so absolute, they use the government data and the listening of phones, emails, everything to their personal gain in the stock market, trade and business decisions, they have so much influence they can influence country into war, spending, law change. they have been doing this for a long long time now and they are so establish we`ll need to have a civial war to remove them from power because our government are so corrupted by greed, power and money, you cant fix the probleme anymore you have to erradicate it.

       also believe we have been in contact with advanced extraterrestrial race from outer space even other dimensions for a long time now, we have traded tech with them but government or government contractors refuse to release the technology even the fact they ahve delt with aliens. I also had alot UFO encounter, one that was pretty epic, that huge triangle I saw was either manmade or not.

       Do you really preffer it to be manmade or not? For myself, I preffer not, I wish not the USA or the millitary industrial complex to possess such technology and use it against the people of earth for their personal gain.

       One of the only conspiracy theories that i can fully commit to is the JFK assassination. The fact that there is so many parts of the story that don't seem to add up and the suspicious nature of Lee Harvey Oswald being killed by jack ruby, makes me uneasy.

       I totally believe that aliens (possibly Anunaki) came to Earth during prehistoric times. They manipulated primitive hominids to create modern humans.

       I agree with this. How else would one explain humans losing their hair? In the history of world evolution no animal has ever shed their own hair as a form of self preservation. Some could argue because we wear clothing we evolved to lose it because we didnt need it. Once said point was argued I would then declare malarkey, the whitest word known to modern man.

        Jeffrey Epstein's private pedophile island.
       </a>
       I've dove and fished around the island and have seen old men "frolicking" on the beach with obviously underage girls.  The locals call it "Uncle Bill's Island" because Bill Clinton spent so much time there. EVERYONE on the island knew shady things were going down...but, it's the islands, plenty of yachts full of underage boys/girls, creepy shit. The last time I visited the islands were in dec/jan.2005 where I met Hunter S. Thompson and family at Bleuwater restaurant. A month later he "killed himself" and shortly after I heard rumors that he was investigating pedophilia/child sex trafficking. 2+2=suicided. (in march 2005 Epstein, who pimps out children to politicians for a living, got busted in Palm Beach soliciting a 14 for sex...Now, If you don't know about Palm Beach, you don't know that cops there do not bust people like Epstein for ANYTHING, he could have a dead child stuck to his penis and they would detach it, clean him up, give him a blanket and a warm cup of cocoa. Very suspicious anonymous call leading to a bust/investigation/2years of harassment/plea bargain Bill Clinton's child sex pimp. Conspiracy?

       Well I don't exactly believe it, but the hypothesis that many people who think they were kidnapped by aliens were actually kidnapped by the CIA, drugged so they would be disoriented, then experimented on using dwarfs or others in "suits" that made them look "alien", so when they were later released and described what happened, no one would believe them and would think they were crazy.

       The fact that govts around the world hold alien tech that they will not release to the public for many reasons. We went from horse and buggy to self parking cars in 100 years. No way we did that by ourselves.
