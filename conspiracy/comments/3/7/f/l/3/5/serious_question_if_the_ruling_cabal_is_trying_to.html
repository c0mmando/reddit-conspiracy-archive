       Please don't simply say money. I get that the super rich have access to better health care and can afford to "undo" much of the damage done. Seriously though, how can they ensure that they aren't simply poisoning themselves? Or maybe more importantly, how do they rest with the idea that the Earth they hope to "take" from all the dead people will be any kind of place that they want to inhabit? Won't the planet just end up inhospitable to them too?

       I don't think that they are deliberately poisoning anything; I think they are trying to increase their wealth, and the poisoning is a side effect that they don't much care about, or deny, or believe their money will shield them from.

       They don't care about this place or the bodies they are in because they know something that we don't know.  I firmly believe it is NOT about the money.  Money is some other kind of illusion that is in place to keep the rest of us stuck.

       When I finished my interview, I saw that my daughter had also received a large imported chocolate bar in a gold foil wrapping. "Daddy, look what Cindy gave to me!" she said proudly. "But I didn't open it because maybe I think it's not kosher. Will you look and see and check if it's okay?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Our children have lived all their lives in a kosher home and they know that unfamiliar products should be checked for the recognized insignia that certifies that all ingredients conform to Jewish dietary law.
      </p>
      <p>
       My daughter was hoping against hope that I'd detect some excuse in the fine print on the wrapper that she hadn't been able to find, but the absence of any visible certification created a problem. "I'm sorry, Sarah," I said, handing it back to her after a careful search. "I just don't see any kosher mark."
      </p>
      <p>
       My six-year-old looked crestfallen for just a moment, but quickly recovered and bravely passed the bar back to the lady who had given it to her. "Thank you," she said with a shy smile, "I'm sorry I can't eat it."

       If "they" can triumph over death, disease, and energy scarcity, and find a way to automate the majority of labor, then the only problem "they" would have left to solve would be overpopulation. A human extinction event that didn't Irradiate the planet would leave enough resources for "them" to buy "themselves" a lot more time. I believe land scarcity is the largest problem facing humanity. You kill off most of the humans with a disease, and only give " them" the vaccination, and you can solve pollution, global warming, war and all other population related problems that essentially derive from land scarcity. Look up rewilding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the effects the black plague had on labor relations. The scarcity of labor caused a shift in power that essentially created wage labor in Europe. Now imagine if instead of needing laborers to grow your food, you could automate labor, and instead had too many underlings to feed, shelter and heal.

       Land scarcity is not a problem. Big cities are all located either on large rivers or next to the ocean due to the use of boats in the past, now that cities like Denver, and Phoenix, or Las Vegas are possible land scarcity will not occur, the only thing rich people want is more control over the taxpayers they leach their fortunes from, they want slaves who are cheap to feed, and that live in tiny houses or apartments that are 100% controllable through tracking or better yet just put the slaves in a prison. Humans take up a very small percentage of the land mass on earth.

       I can avoid toxins just fine. Why can't they? I only eat organic food, food from the garden, or from the woods. I eliminated all food containing large amounts of fluoride and all fluoridated water. It's not even that hard to do. I also avoid all vaccines and don't take prescription or over-the-counter medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as chemtrails and all of that, I'm not convinced, but I also haven't spent a lot of time on that subject. There's plenty of evidence that living in a city will lower your IQ because of pollution. That seems like a much more important topic.

       I used to test organic foods for contaminants. All of them had just as many [some even more] contaminants from the environment in them, depending on where they were growing. These came mostly from the air and included heavy metals and even more worryingly Dioxins.
Which are very bad for you:

      </p>
      <p>
       Just because they weren't sprayed against pests, does not make our food safe. I saw the data first hand and back in the lab, we decided that we might as well eat crisps an chocolate, because everything [we thought was safe] contained something unhealthy.

       Still looking for proof that organic food, on average, contains "more toxins." That is what you're claiming, right? I think it also matters which toxins and how they act synergistically to harm the body. Hopefully this turns into an extremely complicated convo.

       Our entire world is saturated with petroleum by-products, heavy metals in the air and water that fall from the sky with rain. The vegetables you grow, or that an organic farmer grows, can be tested to find that they have concentrations of known toxins that are well above normal, or safe. The toxins are literally surrounding us. I applaud the steps you've taken to protect yourself, and they certainly will help. I guess I'm asking what is their plan, or strategy for exempting themselves from the same "fallout" that we all receive...or that they certainly will receive in a future where the environment is even more toxic than normal. EG, if they destroy the ozone layer, the UV rays will damage everything they touch. Food, homes, skin, everything. They can't avoid all of it forever...

       I lean more towards the idea that corporations have massive influence in what studies are published and what they say. Each CEO who deliberately pollutes a small area of the globe doesn't give a shit about that tiny slice of the world. The profits are worth it.

       Also, if you lower the amount of toxins present in your body, they are flushed out normally. Too many toxins means your liver will be overloaded and won't work efficiently. So, even if I absorb some toxins from organic food, I should be fine. There's no reason for me to give up avoiding toxins because some are present in organic food.

       The transhuman upgrade. The goal is to kill all but about half a billion through what will be deemed the third world war. those that survive will enjoy new robobodies and those that refuse those bodies will be beheaded.

       It's a false evolution though. It's extinction disguised as evolution.

       Still looking for proof that organic food, on average, contains "more toxins." That is what you're claiming, right? I think it also matters which toxins and how they act synergistically to harm the body. Hopefully this turns into an extremely complicated convo.
