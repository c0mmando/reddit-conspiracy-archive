<p>I consider myself an actual American patriot, i try and expose and spread awareness of corruption involving state and particularity local government where i live.</p>

<p>I can tell you now, for a 100% fact, that we never got humans any where near the moon, the claim that we achieved this in 1969 is scientifically absurd and laughable in the extreme, it has been nearly 50 years and experts in the industry think we are probably in near 100+ years away from being able to do wht the Apollo program did.</p>

<p>It was all political theater.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The link raises some terrible points, like the claim that the astronauts shouldn&#39;t have been visible when in the shadow of the lander. </p>

<p>Currently i&#39;m in a room with lighting only from the ceiling. Yet I can see the underside of my desk despite it being in shadow - How is this possible? </p>

<p>He also claims that there is more than one light source. If there were two lights, there would be two shadows. </p>

<p>Then he&#39;s talking about the shadows being at different angles to one another. It&#39;s called a change in landscape - <a href="http://www.dominiquebrewster.com/images/pictorial/shadow-stairs.jpg">For example</a></p>

<p>Main issue is the linear function being used. If that&#39;s wrong (which it appears to be), and this is the math that the projections are based on, then the resulting calculations can&#39;t be correct.</p>

<p>I hesitated to mention this in the previous post, as it&#39;s somewhat of a reverse &quot;argument from authority&quot; and I did not test this theory myself. So it might be wrong for all I know. You&#39;re welcome to check it out if you wish; I&#39;m convinced that the paper is flawed regardless of whether the authorship is valid or not, so it&#39;s a moot point to me. </p>

<p>But if, hypothetically, the author&#39;s name and credentials are fake, then it makes me wonder why someone would do so if the science is valid.</p>

<p>I guess if they were in the industry it could hurt their credibility, but really we can speculate for ages.</p>

<p>Either way I don&#39;t have the background to assess or debunk the paper, I just always found it interesting and hadn&#39;t seen a thorough response to it. The one you provided seems pretty good though, but even then I feel like it&#39;s above my head. Oh well.</p>

<p>I understand it well enough, but am not sure how well I could explain it, especially in my current state of mind (on 4 hours of sleep from previous day, about to go to bed and slightly buzzed from a few shots of sleeping helper aka rum). Like one of those &quot;I know how to drive a stick, but I&#39;ll be damned if I can teach my wife to do it&quot; kind of things. If that makes sense.</p>

<p>Maybe when I wake up I&#39;ll take a stab at it if you wish. But there are probably better teachers around that can do a better job than I could (hence why I linked in the first place).</p>

<p>Well NASA certainly is, as they&#39;re a government agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. NASA has a very small group of public relations spokespeople that appear on virtually every space themed documentary. </p>

<p>When I was a wee lad, you could write NASA letters and they had a pretty good mailing system. They would send you large manilla envelopes filled with material and pictures - free! I of course wrote each NASA facility on a weekly basis. My favorites of course were the booklets and info packets from JPL. Their Spin-Off magazines were always a great and the mission sheets and pictures occupied my days as a kid. Professors from places like Los Alamos would even send you old books on topics like quantum chemistry far superior to anything offered in most graduate programs today.</p>

<p>NASA though has fallen a long way. Where once there was a healthy skepticism of &quot;popular science&quot;, today NASA has pretty much acquiesced their scientific credibility to catering to public fantasy. &quot;Making the Christians feel good&quot; </p>

<p>Today, they happily tow the line in promoting modern myths like:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. &quot;Dirty Snowball Comet Theory&quot;</li>
<li>2. &quot;The Big Bang Creation Myth&quot;</li>
<li>3. &quot;The Black Hole myth&quot;</li>
<li>4. &quot;The International Effort myth&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Other examples like, what powers the Sun, the actual quantum photonics of spectral redshift, all signs of NASA corruption. You don&#39;t need an international program to build a space station or a mission to mars. A very small town mobilized to that end could easily accomplish the feat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you don&#39;t. Name one component that can only be acquired through international cooperation? Can you only get Steel in China? Is rocket fuel only available from Russia? Are smelters and blacksmiths for hire only in Britain? Perhaps there aren&#39;t enough mines in America. Name one component to a spacecraft that can&#39;t be crafted in the United States. Hydrogen &amp; Oxygen rocket fuel? Easily obtainable from any body of water. International cooperation is a bullshit myth. Pure &amp; simple. The state of Texas has all of the resources needed for a successful space program. Hell, so does the state of Rhode Island. The International Cooperation Myth is about helping make people feel good, about creating the illusion that humanity can only get to space by &quot;working together,&quot; - commie globalist bullshit. A single launch of an American built rocket using Bigelow Space Modules all built in the US could easily replace the ISS 10 times over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the United States has all the resources.</p>

<p>But you are missing two key factors: <strong>Money and Interest</strong></p>

<p>There is no interest the public in space exploration, except for say 5% of the population of the country. There is no competition, no race, nothing exciting. Only if a rover lands of Mars, New Horizons is closing in on Pluto, or a rocket failure will the public get interested. All the great scientific discoveries from Nasa and the international space community barely come to mind to the public. Without excitement, lack of interest. According to Congress, what&#39;s the point of sending a rocket into space? Nothing there except science that can be utilized for the future and give insight on the climate.</p>

<p>Lack of interest = Lack of money</p>

<p>NASA&#39;s budget is $17.5 billion. That is less than the net worth of hundreds of celebrities, actors, and innovators. So NASA&#39;s goal can&#39;t be accomplished. They need to reach out to other countries, who in part have a small percent that care about the future of science and technology, with their own budget issues. If countries collaborate, they can actually establish a stable international space program.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Of course it can. But why would Congress give the money to NASA? There is no point. No value on Earth, to them. Other countries with space programs face the same problem.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>For one it is not a myth if it actually happens. Also when something big happens, then it makes people feel good. </p>

<p>A space race energized the space agency, but today thats different. America has already won race, and what now? Half the population can&#39;t even tell you some of the stuff that is happening in science/NASA. To them there is no point, so why work for it?</p>

<p>A 17 billion dollar space agency by itself. With a lack of public involvement and interest. What happens?</p>

<p>Even if say the space program works out. What will a child see? A bunch of countries crudely putting together rockets and compete to make to space. Not a bunch of countries working together to further push the advancement of mankind. </p>

<p>Let me ask you, what happens when countries don&#39;t work together? </p>
