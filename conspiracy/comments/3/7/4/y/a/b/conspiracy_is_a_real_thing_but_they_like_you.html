        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At the end of the day, It&#39;s love vs. fear. We are crippled by so much going on. Even if normal entertainment doesn&#39;t do it for us, we can dig into the inner workings of madmen and murders and dictators. At the end of the day, once we find their truths we still sit here and dig through more and more and more. Unable to act. Forgetting the only action is love. So to all my friends here on this wonderful subreddit who think with an open mind: don&#39;t forget to love.</p>

<p>I sold much of what i owned and backed packed and hitchhiked. It was amazing. Not consuming, not contributing to their evil, but living off of love and spreading as much of it as I could. I ended up coming back home, to tie up some loose ends, playing some games, take care of some financial things I don&#39;t want to be burdened with and just sampling what I left, what I got rid of.. and i&#39;m gonna do it again.. ride the waves of love. This time, permanently. It takes us to push this great wheel of human consciousness forward. We can share as much knowledge as we like but in the end; We must act on this knowledge. So go forth and love my friends! Let&#39;s change the world with kindness and love! Step free from the shackles of bondage and suffering and consumption and give back to this glorious world which has allowed us to discover the one truth. We all want to end the conspiracy right? We want to set the world on a positive path.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the world don&#39;t run on love. maybe some day everything in the world will be automated and carriedd out by unthinking robots that want for nothing, and we&#39;ll focus on irrigating the planet to a point where no person is hurting for food and shelter, but it is not this day, or even this century. I think such a reality happening anytime before the year 3000 is an optimistic prediction.  We are progressing towards a world where we all love each other, there is no doubt that the world as a whole has only been more violent and hateful the further you look back on history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t preach to those without an open mind or those closed off and deep within the sleep. Show it. This is what the conspiracy mantra does. Has you thinking you are utterly alone and deep in enemy territory. But even there, you can find a resistance movement. &#39;Swine&#39; need love not pearls. And they need a lot of it too. They are humans. They just need more help to realize they have lost love and replaced it with the plethora of distractions. Keep trying and never give up. If your life ends, it does so full of purpose having lived as nothing but a pure transformative example. Don&#39;t preach: SHOW. Best of luck to you my friend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Love, it&#39;s a good thought but silly to think you can shower every one with love no matter what the consequence.  I have a 7 week old daughter, so yeah, I&#39;m not out touring the country side, trusting anyone I come across or going where life takes us, there&#39;s no balance there.  Not only is it unpractical but it&#39;s also just plain nonsense. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to fill yourself with complete love, because as I&#39;ve already stated, there is no balance there. And one who observes nature with a clear mind will see no division, or rigidness because Mother Nature creates nothing in vein.</p>

<p>To think that love is the total and complete answer to the world&#39;s problems is not only questionable but outright absurd.  You don&#39;t need to have any one emotion be it love, compassion, respect, etc, but rather a sound mind not stuck in any one position, capable of critical thinking and adaptable to any situation.  If you approached a Zen master with this nonsense they would say you are completely out of balance, because you trying too hard, you are one-sided-- fake.</p>

<p>A true Zen master isn&#39;t trying to be all loving or all anything, because when one strives to be all &#39;whatever,&#39; they ultimately become just fake as those they supposedly love, it simply goes against human nature. So, the key is to let your mind wonder but not be spoiled by it&#39;s simplicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. Love is what lifts you in tune to every emotion. You feel more conscious of every emotion that isn&#39;t love and work to understand that and transform it to a positive force. Mastering your emotions rather than being &#39;fake&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To master your emotions requires effort, and that&#39;s really not the point and also a waste of energy.  But rather one should observe the mind subjectively and not act out of balance to any one emotion, this is where clarity lies.  To master ones emotions is essentially alike to being fake, but to watch the mind without hesitation, or a negative reaction is Zen. </p>

<p>If you are constantly trying to subdue your non-loving thoughts, or &#39;Master your Emotions&#39; then you will expend yourself in futility. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, if you had a daughter and someone rapped her would you be filled with love? The way to enlightenment is not to fill yourself with only loving thoughts, because it&#39;s impossible. You are totally missing the point here and should maybe try reading the Shobogenzo or something alike.  </p>

<p>Be honest with yourself, it&#39;s impossible to have only loving thoughts, and no matter how hard you try you won&#39;t be able to do it.  But as the Buddha said go ahead and try, you will have many lives to find out just who you are, some may find enlightenment in 3 seconds, for some it make take 30 years, and others may never see it, even on their death beds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the world is filled with love, these things no longer happen. But we need to get there first. I have ready many books. Have you read the Upanishads? Very enlightening. We are all the same consciousness. We are each other.  The person who raped my daughter needs love. Even if they came from a loving family, something happened. Maybe because of the many conspiracies that clouded their mind and perverted their true form, but in the end.. they are lost. There is a man in a woman but it is repressed for she is hyper sexualized. There is a woman in a man but it is repressed, for it is explained as weakness. Bring forth both inside you. Not in a sexual manner, but in the whole manner. Perennial joy is what we strive for. Not the passing pleasure of this one instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe so. A world filled with love would not end all cruelty or hatred. Would a tiger not kill a gazelle, would light exist without darkness? 
We are from the same consciousness because we share the same emotions, and we all also share in earths finite resources for survival. But to think love would conquer all is just as silly as a thinking capitalism is the way to prosperity or Catholicism is the way to heaven, it&#39;s still just a belief, or way thinking that can be inhibiting and nonsensical.  </p>

<p>The Upanishads do not promote a one-sided consciousness, but rather an all encompassing understanding, which means the right view equals no particular view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are the same consciousness. We are one. The upanishads talks of the self and shedding the Illusions of &quot;I&quot;. Our problems now are not the problems we would have with love.. We Would still have weather, predators and human error and the never ending advancement of time, tripping, falling, a breaking branch etc etc. A lion killing a gazelle is very different from a man raping another man&#39;s daughter. It is thought (and I believe) that the animal kingdom is mimicking some of these behaviors due to our terrible vibrational frequency. We still have to &#39;kill plants&#39; to eat them. Although there is evidence we get plenty of energy from just sun and water should we be able to shed the shackles of this lie we live in and tell ourselves. I ate less when I has hoofing it around and actually grew stronger, gained some muscle and weight. Ate about 10tbs of hemp seeds a day and drank quite a bit of water. Had some other seeds along the way as well, some food strangers decided to give me for whatever kindness they decided to bestow upon me. The reality we think we are dependent on is very different from what we actually need. We are poisoned. At the end of the day, the argument against love is feeble. Compared to the ones against whatever gov, religion, etc etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no argument against love, but more so in the strive to be all loving because it&#39;s impossible. The fourth stage of the Yuga cycle, according to ancient Sanskrit scriptures called the Kali Yuga, is where goodness and virtue has all but disappeared from the world, and when moral virtue and mental capabilities reach their lowest point in the cycle. But the first stage is called the golden age, and one stage could not exist or proceed without the other.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a terrible vibrational frequency, and maybe you can survive purely on the sun&#39;s energy, but in order to reach this  point of existence there was and always will be the previous stages of growth and understanding.  So for you to say love is all there is and all there should be , and that love will conquer all doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Without hate there cannot be love, and one must realize the duality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wolf?? The lion and the tiger are more powerful but the wolf never preforms in the circus. &#39;Swine&#39; is a denial of humanity. Not enough love emanates from you. You need more from others and to give more. Again, something everyone has to participate in. Conspiracy makes you complacent. Just sitting and waiting for something and yet nothing. If you think what you just proposed, exposing the leader elected for the people as a charlatan since this leader you proposed is coming from the internet (?) and wouldn&#39;t be beholden to other parties. But that ignores conspiracy of manipulated governments and the fact that such a leader would be almost impossible to find. Ignore the system that oppresses and shuts you down and make a life independent of that. Demonstrate how you do not need this corrupt world but just the love of your fellow human, like i did. Getting love and support from strangers and returning that to others. Remarkable self sufficient and independent. We can all learn to garden and tailor and restore the damage the charade has done to our planet. Become caretakers and not consumers. Once the leaders start panicking, the colors we know to be true will rear to the surface for all to see, allowing an even more transformative process by which we invite the damned to come love with us or continue on their path of hatred. They will choose love.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the responses though. Love is great, you said it yourself. So give more. If it overflows then you have more than many. Even self replenishing love. Do not assume others loving you means you love. There is nothing wrong with giving more. Especially if you seem to have an infinite supply of love. Why ever stop? To renew the childlike wonder we all had is what needs to be done. We have been made into cynical adults.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is! If everyone does it, who is left pillaging burning and stealing? It would seem pointless at that time. You see hippy happy dude, you punch him and take his stuff, but more hippy people just pick him up and replace the clothes you took form him. At the end of the day, you are alone with a bunch of people&#39;s clothes. They sees the futility of stealing and shares the clothes he stole and he is brought into love. It&#39;s much easier to go from bad to good when you realize, upon confessing evils, the good people will just hug you and tell you to try again. Not imprison and execute people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lost much more than a wallet, it was everything I had. It was by a junkie clothed in ripped shorts and a vest in october, not some dude. i would have given him stuff if he asked but he jumped out of nowhere and grabbed my back and yanked me down and proceeded to punch me while taking shit from me. I just gave him stuff to get him to go away. Left with the hoodie I had on and ripped jeans I wore. I also lost one of my best friends in a car crash not even a year ago. I&#39;ve moved away from countless buddies because of my dad&#39;s job, into countries who&#39;s language I did not know. The one thing i&#39;ve learned we are all humans with problems. The poorest I ever was, I had .52 cents available for withdraw in my account. The friend who was sexually abused that I had was institutionalized and nearly killed herself (in the most agonizing way, her wrists still are scared pretty horrendously from it and she always wears long sleeve shirts for it). There are many others who have suffered  far, far more than I have and can even comprehend and they have even more life energy and drive than I do. Loss is but a lesson</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus never gave up. He kept going until he was nailed to a cross by the very &#39;swine&#39; he tried to save. But he forgave. That story is a great example of the inherent divinity and love in all of us. He endures toady because of it. But fear, conspiracy, and power collude those kinds of message into war, righteous fury, segregation, and separation of &#39;saved&#39; and &#39;damned&#39;. Drawing distinctions about people like that is the exact opposite of the positive energy we need to radiate from us. Love has been hijacked and made into the separate beliefs that cause us to convulse in violence. I appreciate your support for my continued desire to spread happiness. When I&#39;m on the road (I depart from Louisville, Ky. Though not my home forever as we moved a ton as a family, simply where I am now) maybe i&#39;ll get a chance to run into you! XD That would be crazy cool!</p>

<p>Amen to that. I&#39;m not Jesus. Even in my best of days, I stumble that walk. And now a days, I claim no likeness. My flesh is so filithy in sin, people can&#39;t see the light anymore. I did that to myself. I don&#39;t worry about it. Won&#39;t change a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Recognize this comment of yours? &quot;really makes me wonder. I mean, we know blacks have low IQs, but are they that stupid? What do they think is going to happen if a race war starts? Do they think we are going to just let them kill people? Dumb, dumb, dumb. They will be herded like cattle into those FEMA centers we&#39;ve all heard about; or they will be put under lockdown in their &quot;projects&quot;#&gt;Love won&#39;t cut it. The various races in the world are in competition with each other, and the minute one of them stops fighting for its piece of the pie, it will get run over by the others. Do you think the red ants and the black ants could get along, if only the black ants were filled with love for the red ants? No. The red ants would eat the black ants and enslave them. It works the same way with human beings.</p>

<p>and &quot;blocks&quot; and whatever else they call the pest-filled hell-holes where they live. The ones who resist will be shot like mad dogs in the street. Blacks need to realize that they live in white society because they are tolerated. Once that toleration goes, they go.</p>

Real life story: A man went to Africa and was playing with village children, he said: race to the tree and i&#39;ll give the winner a candy (some western thing, a bag of marshmallows). When he gave the bag to the winning kid, the kid immediately ripped it open and started handing it out to his buddies.

    <div class="md"><p>If the world is filled with love, these things no longer happen. But we need to get there first. I have ready many books. Have you read the Upanishads? Very enlightening. We are all the same consciousness. We are each other.  The person who raped my daughter needs love. Even if they came from a loving family, something happened. Maybe because of the many conspiracies that clouded their mind and perverted their true form, but in the end.. they are lost. There is a man in a woman but it is repressed for she is hyper sexualized. There is a woman in a man but it is repressed, for it is explained as weakness. Bring forth both inside you. Not in a sexual manner, but in the whole manner. Perennial joy is what we strive for. Not the passing pleasure of this one instance.</p>
