       And if religions were like mobile phone operating systems, which would be which?
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity would be Android - a lot of sub franchisees and variants in on the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Islam IOS - rigidly controlled walled garden with sexual imagery covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judiasm would be Windows Phone - very small market share. Plenty of potential but stunted by its own ethics.

       I really don't want to insult you because I think we should respect others beliefs. But does the fact that every single generation of humans believed 'the end times' were coming closer, influence that thought?
I think it's a dangerous to believe in judgment day and I think humans are inclined to have a cognitive bias when it comes to 'signs of the apocalypse'. 
Again, don't want to insult you, but I don't think Allah would allow billions to suffer simply because they grow up in an area no-one has ever read the Quran.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way OT: I'm an atheist, but I strongly believe we need some sort of ideology to keep people from being rich parasites who rot our economy from the inside out.
Before you ask, yes I've read (parts of) the Bible and the Quran, and I really think that if it
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       is the word of God/Allah, he would've sent a new prophet to clarify some things, and who could update hundreds of years old guidelines.

       No, because the prophecies that happened so far are true and reasonable and have been mentioned in the previous scriptures. Here is a list for the curious:

       I think its reasonable because when there are no consequences its human nature to do what ever we feel like. Believing in an ultimate justice prevents many from doing crimes that they could get away with.

       We believe the same , as Muslims its our belief that no one but God can decide who goes to heaven and who does not regardless of his or her religion.

       It seems to me that if this were true, athiests would commit more crimes than religious people; however I don't think there is any evidence to support that notion what so ever,

       The bottom of the conspiracy rabbit hole is the spiritual nature of reality. Even though religions are a part of the control system, God is not only real but the very basis of reality from which all else manifests. All we experience has a deep spiritual purpose, and our consciousness is immensely powerful in creating our reality. The hiding of this knowledge is the number one priority of the elite.

       Anyone who believes the bible to be a Devine work. Remember the messiah came to get rid of religion, Those that follow Yahweh must follow in Spirit and in truth. So the op knows it was writtin that Babylon would rule the world, Babylon defined as secret society's. Secret society's today are a mash up of every ancient one.

       I tend to look at religions as valid psychological operating systems and vehicles for culture.  I don't 'believe' in religions, but I acknowledge their validity on some level, even if they are not factually precise in all of their claims.  I respect some people who are religious. I don't like to be anti- religious as that would limit my potential for friendships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example.  One of my friends from HS is a fireman. I can understand that he "knows Jesus" every day, because he might die in the line of duty on any given day.  I respect and understand that operating psychology, but it's not my own.

       The Way, as taught by Jesus to His disciples, was at some point, perhaps early on, taken to be the facade of something more sinister and less moral, upright and Holy?

      <p>
       If this is near-accurate, do you believe Jesus was the visible image of God, actually God in the flesh?

       Third Woe. Now I'm not sure with tribulation sequence this follows - or if it follows one at all - but are you referring to the second coming of a fiery-eyed Jesus with a sword in hand after the 7 years where the whole host of Heaven joins Him for a smackdown of the demons and/or the unfaithful idolators?

       So Matthew and you're good? What do you think about those who say Mark (named for Peter's disciple) was written first and the two other Synoptics were copies with a little Q thrown in for good measure?

       Allow me to speculate as to your position...
      </p>
      <p>
       The Way, as taught by Jesus to His disciples, was at some point, perhaps early on, taken to be the facade of something more sinister and less moral, upright and Holy?

       If this is near-accurate, do you believe Jesus was the visible image of God, actually God in the flesh?
