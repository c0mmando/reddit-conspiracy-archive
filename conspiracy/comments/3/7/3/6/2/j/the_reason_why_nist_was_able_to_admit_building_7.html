        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>so many times i have seen things written here such as: &quot;the vague concept of free fall cant determine things about the vast amount of internal forces in a building.&quot;</p>

<p>First off: Free fall speed is not a &quot;vague concept&quot;. It has a rigorous scientific definition: F(x) = m (d2 x)/(dt2 ) where d2 x/dt2 =g. or in normal english: Mass times the second derivative of position with respect to time (also known as acceleration) gives the force acting on any body (or in our case a composite of bodies). When the acceleration is equal to 9.8 m/s2 this is free fall as felt on bodies on planet earth. </p>

<p>Furthermore, its not &quot;complicated&quot; (as ive seen so many people use that argument to imply that its too hard for even an amateur scientist to contemplate)... Free-fall is a concept from first principles Physics which although are simple enough a highschool student can understand them, remain TRUE as long as speeds remain far from c (the speed of light). That equation up there is TRUE when a body falls with zero resistance in a uniform gravitational field, and acceleration is 9.8 m/s2 when that field is earths.</p>

<p>The next thing i see often are phrases like &quot;its such a big complicated building, you cant know whats going on inside of it just by just watching it fall!&quot; Well... you cant know everything, but you can know enough. and enough in our case means zero resistance. Einstein deduced the SIZE OF ATOMS by watching some pollen floating in water. He deduced the internal structure of matter itself from whats called brownian motion (or the random motion of particles suspended in a liquid). Given the power of physics to deduce the internal forces by observing macroscopic (large groups) behavior, how can one doubt its ability to determine the resistance experienced by groups of falling debris? (one of the simplest possibly situations)
the skeptic may think that the &quot;vague concept&quot; of free fall means nothing, But to a scientifically literate person, it means EVERYTHING.</p>

<p>The fact that NIST left out the fact that building 7 experienced free-fall for about 2.5 seconds either means they were incompetent (as it was a mistake no scientifically literate person could ever make), or they purposefully withheld it because they knew what it implied. I cant for even a second believe that the people hired by the government to conduct one of the most important scientific reports of the century could be that idiotic. But if they were that stupid, thats even more damning for the people who knowingly hired a bunch of scientifically illiterate people to conduct such an important study.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My explanation from another thread:</p>

<hr/>

<p>There is one simple principle involved, Newton&#39;s third law of motion. Straight down free-fall acceleration for 2.5s implies ZERO counteracting force which implies ZERO structural rigidity for at least as far as the building fell during that timeframe. The only way for a complete lack of rigidity to occur throughout that much of the structure is for the steel frame supporting the building to be broken and displaced almost simultaneously across the entirety of the structure.</p>

<p>NIST&#39;s unscientific and non-peer reviewed theory, a &quot;progressive collapse&quot; resulting from weakened steel at specific hotspots, means that most portions of the structure would still be rigidly standing and give resistance to the falling parts, preventing free-fall and resulting in an largely asymmetric and asynchronous collapse sequence, which is the exact opposite of what the evidence shows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People think that &quot;weakened steel&quot; instantaneously can change state to provide no resistence.</p>

<p>That it was free fall was obvious on the day of the event. (Obvious to me whose first job was in a physics lab)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People make sense of the world through their understanding of the world - most people don&#39;t have a high school level understanding of of physics - so disputing the story with confidence isn&#39;t even a possibility for most.</p>

<p>The ELI5 Problem with NSI model for 1 &amp; 2 is (there seems to be two main ones I think) is:</p>

<p>(1) The buildings collapsed literally through the path of most resistance, however, the total collapse time does not reflect this, it reflects a path of [near] no resistance. NIS wants their cake and to eat it too: It was a resistances based collapse model that had no apparent resistance in it.</p>

<p>(2) The tops of the buildings (above the impacts) that collapsed each and every floor underneath them, to dust, also collapse at [near] free fall at the end - So picture a bowling ball dropped through a Jinga tower, the ball passes through each layer, displacing the blocks, but the bowling ball magically turns into Jinga at the end. Once again NIS wants it both ways, that the tops of Towers 1 &amp; 2 were structural enough to collapse each floor below them, into dust and molten steel, but then collapsed at the end as if nothing structural was holding them up either.</p>

<p>Building 7 Just has another anomalous &#39;unique&#39; layer of explanation heaped on top of it to try and explain away why it behaved like 1 &amp; 2 did, while not having a plane hit it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The descent time did happen in three basic stages.
but the thing to take away, is that if a period of free-fall is experienced, that means for that time period, there is zero resistance opposing the collapse of the building. </p>

<p>The fact that some of the building fell before the rest of the building entered free fall doesnt take anything away from the fact that, the a majority of the parts which constituted the building fell with zero resistance (nothing was opposing it) for a period of time. and the only way that could happen is if every support beam failed simultaneously, or failed in succession as the building was falling. </p>

<p>(like a row of dominoes: as the first one tips into the second one, some force causes the second one to start falling into the third one exactly as the first one hits the second so that the first one doesnt need to transfer any force to the second one. it may seem like a small amount of energy difference in this example, but the time needed for one domino to knock over the next one gets compounded into a total time for the whole series to fall, culminating in the last domino falling over. if the sequence of dominoes finishes 2 seconds before it was supposed to, you can conclude that the last domino falling over was not a consequence of the first one falling over, because it happened 2 seconds before the laws of physics allow it to happen.).</p>

<p>This is precisely the reason why the NIST simulation wasn&#39;t provided for this free fall stage of collapse. As given their initial conditions, and initial collapse stages, it would have been impossible to get the simulation to play out the way we saw it (Collapse in free fall for a period of 2.5 seconds).</p>

<p>The chances that the entire support structures of the building collapsed first, only leaving the outer shell of the building to collapse without resistance is slim to none. Furthermore, if it DID happen that way, NIST would have rejoiced in their ability to show an accurate simulation for the entire collapse. but they didnt.. because the collapse didnt happen that way. So they weren&#39;t able to show the collapse in simulation.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, even the most conspiracy oriented people believe that &quot;the entire support structures of the building collapsed first, only leaving the outer shell of the building to collapse without resistance&quot; - what&#39;s the alternative?  The outer shell had no structural value.</p>

<p>What the conspiracy theory says is that the &quot;support structures&quot; of the building collapsed <em>because they were demolished.</em>   We see all sorts of buildings falling exactly the way you claim is impossible - this happens all the time, in controlled demolitions.</p>

<p>So the real question is not, &quot;Is this form of collapse possible?&quot; because we know it is - we see it happen every time they knock down a building, and we saw all three WTC buildings collapse.</p>

<p>The real question is, &quot;Is this form of collapse possible <em>without a controlled demolition</em>&quot; - and all your random information about dominoes (a model which btw exhibits none of the characteristics of a collapsing or demolished building) is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I&#39;m not saying the official story is right!  What I <em>am</em> saying is that none of your arguments are convincing to someone who knows physics or engineering.  There are many other discussions of this online which are much more convincing, that are written by people who clearly know this material well.  If you want to convince people that your theories are true, you should use those, not this long rant about dominoes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know any conspiracy oriented people who believes the interior collapsed first leaving the outer shell to fall down on its own. The outer shell is joined to and supported by the inner core, so controlled demolition of the core columns resulted in the entire building coming down more or less at the same time once the demolition sequence completed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in a NIST-style &quot;progress collapse&quot; which posits the interior somehow &quot;collapsing first&quot;, we would see the building collapsing in upon itself as the exterior is pulled down and in by the failing interior it is welded to. The interior cannot come down without bringing the exterior down with it at the same time.</p>

<p>You are confusing yourself, free falling is when something or someone is falling through the atmosphere without anything producing drag, this is what was observed with WTC7, zero structural resistance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are actually the one who is confused. An object will never reach terminal velocity if there is zero resistance. Air resistance is a function of, among other things, velocity. The faster an object travels, the more resistance air provides. </p>

<p>There was air resistance of course, and yet it still fell at free fall. That is because the air resistance was so small that there would be no way to measure its affect in the videos we had. My point is that the buckled columns would have provided a similarly negligible resistance. The more a column buckles, the less resistance it will provide, until a point when it will fracture and then provide literally zero resistance. This is what happened and what people who bring this point up fail to realize.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By that logic then it must have also fallen in a vacuum, otherwise the air resistance would have slowed it down. Point being that it wouldn&#39;t have had to provide zero resistance, only negligable resistance, similar to the amount of resistance that air would provide.

<p>This is exactly correct and the exact point I was trying to make. The buckled columns would similarly provide negligible resistance. That&#39;s how you get a free falling building minus the conspiracy.</p>

<p>In this particular collapse, at a certain time during the collapse, yes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how what I said would lead you to that conclusion. Explosives are the safest and most reliable way the demolish a building. You could spend months running computer simulations of fires to look for weak spots in a structure when you could light a fire and hope that it will collapse. But that is obviously not practical no matter how you look at it.</p>

The argument you are making in this thread makes it pretty obvious that you&#39;re confident any steel framed building can easily be brought down by buckling only one key column.

    <div class="md"><p>Every building is different and it would take a lot of analysis beforehand to figure out the absolute minimum number of columns that would need to be destroyed in order for the building to collapse. Not only that, but that makes the collapse a lot less predictable.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re arguing that one column failing due to office fires/falling debris lead to a total collapse of a massive steel framed building, a collapse so fast and so thorough that it buckles all columns in a matter of seconds leading to total freefall.

It&#39;s so simple, NIST engineers quit out of disgust for what they were doing. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so simple, no one (other that NIST) has yet to create a simulation showing this effect.</p>

<p>You&#39;re arguing that one column collapsing leads to a chain effect so catastrophic that freefall for a total of 2.5 second is achieved. </p>

<p>According to your calculations, it&#39;s actually quite straightforward. Which in that case it would be quite straightforward for any engineer to calculate the one column needed to detonate to completely drop the building into it&#39;s own footprint.</p>

<p>In fact, it doesn&#39;t even have to be one in the center, just one of the ones a few from the very outside.</p>

<p>How can you type that with a straight face. Surely you must be laughing at your desk.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have it both ways. On one hand you argue it&#39;s really simple, buckling columns = chain effect which leads to total freefall/collapse into it&#39;s footprint.</p>

<p>On the other hand NO ONE can come up with a simulation that works that actually demonstrates this as we see in video of the actual collapse, and NIST refuses to release a model to the public.</p>

<p>How can you take yourself seriously arguing along these lines?</p>

<p>Explain why NIST will not release a simulation to the public that matches the observed collapse in video? And don&#39;t tell me political reasons, that&#39;s a joke. NIST is outside of politics, at least supposedly. </p>

<p>I never said that. It took literally tens of thousands of man hours and years for NIST to complete the models to show how the collapse initiated. What is relatively simple to see, is how it could have collapsed at free fall. And that&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to argue here.

    <div class="md"><p>The NIST report says it was in free fall. You have seen the countless posts with math that was calculated simply by watching the collapse. This math factors in the forces that you are mentioning, but they are null and void in reality because the math still works out to the building being in free fall. Which means that for 2.5 seconds, or however long it fell for, there was absolutely nothing underneath the top section as it collapsed. In other words: Everything underneath it was completely vaporized. </p>

<p>Edit: Im not an engineer, but this is how I understand the whole free fall conundrum. Also, air resistance is minuscule compared to the resistance that bending steal beams would offer. So that is typically why people would say: &quot;There were no resisting forces in the collapse.&quot; Because there really were no worthwhile resisting forces that were recorded.</p>

<p>Edit 2: Upon further contemplation I think I understand what you are getting at. The mere introduction of air resistance might change the math completely, but I still have feeling that it is never factored in because it might just be useless. Air resistance affects all objects, and all objects in free fall have to deal with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point I am making is that free fall is <em>technically</em> only possible in a vacuum because air provides resistance and slows the descent. In this particular case, air provides a relatively small amount of resistance to the point where it is not meaurable from the video evidence we have. So if the buckled columns (the only structural items resisting the descent) provided a similarly negligable amount of resistance, then the building would still be falling at &quot;free fall&quot; like we observed from the video and no controlled demolition theory is needed to explain it.</p>

<p>So what you are saying is that when air provides resistance, the building will still fall at free fall, but if the structure is providing a similarly small amount of resistance, it won&#39;t free fall?</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with WHAT is providing resistance, but HOW MUCH resistance it is providing. A buckled column will provide a negligible amount of resistance in the same way that air will provide a negligible amount of resistance, hence free fall.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Really? Well you might want to read up on the behavior of structural steel undergoing plastic deformation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93strain_curve#Ductile_materials">Link</a>. The strength of steel drastically reduces at the onset of yielding (as you can see in the graph) which will coincide with the column beginning to buckle. The strength continues to reduce until it fractures at which time it provides literally zero resistance.</p>

<p>Not only this, but once the column buckles, the loads are no longer applied axially to the column, they are applied as a bending force about the points which buckled. This also drastically reduces the resistance the column will provide and the further the columns buckles, the more eccentricity there is about the buckling points and the less the column will resist.</p>

<p>For both of these reasons, the resistance of a buckled column will rapidly reduce to zero. That&#39;s how steel columns come to resist even less than air. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the columns were all buckling at the same point, but that doesn&#39;t mean that each one began buckling at the same exact time. In fact it was only the perimeter columns buckling during the collapse, and they began buckling with a few seconds of each other in what was a chain reaction initiated by the collapse of the core.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I see here is that people love to over simplify things. It&#39;s not as simply as free fall = controlled demolition. There is a lot more to this that people just don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s not their fault, they just don&#39;t have a background in this area, but it can make for a lot of misconceptions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mathematician here - I speak physics.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m very skeptical about Building 7, but, well, this isn&#39;t going to convince anyone that you understand physics or engineering or that you have exposed a hole in the NIST&#39;s report.</p>

<p>Heck, your wall of text isn&#39;t even consistent with itself - the title says, &quot;NIST was able to admit building 7 entered free fall&quot; but the body says, &quot;NIST left out the fact that building 7 experienced free-fall&quot;.  So which is true?</p>

<p>All this irrelevant, unrelated material about Einstein&#39;s discovery of Brownian motion simply underscores the fact that you have no deep understanding of physics.  I mean, here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion#Einstein.27s_theory">the equations for it</a> - my guess is that you don&#39;t understand any of this material, even though it&#39;s over 100 years old, because you spend so much time explaining the idea of force, which is almost 400 years old and shouldn&#39;t need explaining even to a high school student.</p>

<p>Again - this is <em>NOT</em> saying that there&#39;s nothing wrong with the story of building 7!  What it <em>is</em> saying is that your article isn&#39;t coherent or convincing to anyone who speaks physics.</p>

<p>The post didnt <em>expose</em> ANYTHING.   It seems  simply to be spreading knowledge about something that was already exposed.  Mainly, NISTs effort to not admit that the building entered freefall, and then NIST playing it down after they were forced to acknowledge it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>heres the basic story.
When building 7 collapsed, it happened in 3 stages. The 1st stage: some of the corner of the building started to fall. A couple seconds later, the building entered freefall for 2.5 seconds. the final stage it slowed down again.
when NIST made their first report on building 7, they averaged the collapse time of the first 2 time periods. And because the building didnt enter freefall untill ~ 2 seconds after the collapse started, when they averaged the acceleration from these time periods, they concluded that the average acceleration was less than freefall.
And thats entirely true. But its also entirely uninteresting. it would be like, when calculating the speed of a major league Fastball pitch, to take the velocity of the ball during the time when its still in the pitchers hand during his windup (slowly moving backwards before accelerating forwards) and averaging that speed with the speed when its in the air moving towards the catcher. It may be true that the ball had an average velocity of 70Mph during that time period, but the INTERESTING thing is that that ball had a speed of 95 MPH while it was moving through the air.
Thats exactly what NIST did at first. they obscured the fact that the building experienced a 2.5 second period of free fall by averaging it together with a period of collapse preceding free fall
Then at a NIST event, a highschool physics teacher in the audience brought the mistake (a ludicrous mistake that no competent scientist would ever make) to their attention. They then revised the building 7 report and admitted the building entered free fall. But they were deff hoping that it would go un noticed. Since then it has been played down a whole lot by people without any knowledge of physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but we already know that there is not actually zero resistance because there is at the very least air resistance slowing down the descent, yet it still free falls.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand the point I&#39;m making. I agree the building was in free fall. The point I&#39;m making is that being in free fall does not exclude the possibility of there being some, minimal resistance, against the collapse. We know that there was at the bare minimum air resistance slowing down the collapse, meaning that there does not have to be literally zero resistance like everyone here is saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point I am making is that free fall is <em>technically</em> only possible in a vacuum because air provides resistance and slows the descent. In this particular case, air provides a relatively small amount of resistance to the point where it is not meaurable from the video evidence we have. So if the buckled columns (the only structural items resisting the descent) provided a similarly negligable amount of resistance, then the building would still be falling at &quot;free fall&quot; like we observed from the video and no controlled demolition theory is needed to explain it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re trolling or actually  being serious....</p>

<p>Zero resistance means free fall acceleration. Technically you are correct the air does resist slightly but the point is the same regardless...there was not even slight resistance from the rest of the building which equals destroying every single support column at the same time. Impossible for fire alone.</p>
