        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">5152</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2015-05-24 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ExileOnMeanStreet.html">ExileOnMeanStreet</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last weekend I posted <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0sBNlhT.png">an article</a> about a possible religious hate incident to <a href="/r/europe">/r/europe</a>. An hour later I was banned from <a href="/r/europe">/r/europe</a>, <a href="/r/HistoryPorn">/r/HistoryPorn</a>, <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a>, <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> and <a href="/r/food">/r/food</a> by power mod <a href="/u/davidreiss666">/u/davidreiss666</a>. I was later banned by power mod <a href="/u/agentlame">/u/agentlame</a> from hundreds of subreddits even though I broke no rules in any of them. I asked both of them and the other mods what was going on and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/cRJRk">this was the response.</a> I was issued global bans from the numerous subreddits that these mods control for having opinions that they personally disliked. They wrongly slandered me as a racist and banned me for saying things outside of the subreddits they mod that they didn&#39;t like and this is in keeping with their past tyrannical behavior. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/cQE96">This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve seen this type of mod abuse for having opinions/views that mods don&#39;t personally agree with and being labeled a racist for holding them in an effort to eliminate dissent and/or open discussion.</a> davidreiss666 has been purging and censoring opinions on reddit that don&#39;t align with  his Leftist views for as long as he has had power here. He corruptly ran <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> before being thrown out and he mods Left wing subreddits like <a href="/r/postnationalist">/r/postnationalist</a>, <a href="/r/Green">/r/Green</a>, <a href="/r/Liberal">/r/Liberal</a>, <a href="/r/labor">/r/labor</a>, and <a href="/r/neoprogs">/r/neoprogs</a> (New progressives). Here is his rap sheet as one of reddit&#39;s most dictatorial, biased, and corrupt mods.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/tKwtX">In 2012, davidreiss666 was responsible for serious mod drama that led to a near-meltdown in /r/Canada. He was constantly removing posts, spamming the subreddit with Left wing posts with his secret alt account, and banning users who posted views that went against his Left wing positions. The entire subreddit turned on him and eventually managed to push him out of the mod team.</a> <a href="http://i.imgur.com/T0Fy5vw.png">He is so bad that he managed to have a reddit admin kick him out of /r/ideasfortheadmins because he was up to no good.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/fKYZV">He has a history of the same type of behavior in /r/europe as well.</a> The last screenshot is from voat.co and was posted by a user this week who noticed what davidreiss666 has been doing in <a href="/r/europe">/r/europe</a> and how he is trying to control the subreddit just like he did with <a href="/r/Canada">/r/Canada</a> before he was thrown out of there. <a href="https://voat.co/v/MeanwhileOnReddit/comments/98027">Here is a link to that post from voat.co for you to read.</a></p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t stop there. In what was probably his most blatant act of abuse and corruption, in 2013 he used his mod power to censor people exposing his shady moderation of and posting in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. He caused immense drama and got serious attention on the front page of reddit for trying to get rid of someone who got tons of upvotes for calling him out as a spammer and shill in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was removed as a default subreddit by the admins because of mods like davidreiss666 running it in a way that allowed him to create what has to be the biggest political echo chamber filled with Left wing bias on the entire internet.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/j3mYRZp.png">One,</a> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OcUioEr.png">two,</a> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tFhlu5P.png">three,</a> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/O4ymS">four.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1ckgu1/bestof_links_to_rmurica_comment_calling_out_the/">Read the comments in this /r/SubredditDrama thread about this incident to really see what this guy is about.</a> </p>

<p>His behavior hits close to home for those of us here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as well since <a href="https://i.imgur.com/aE8jT1p.png">he was the mod responsible for banning links from this subreddit to /r/bestof.</a> He is lying when he says that the other <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> mods &quot;agreed&quot; with the banning since it doesn&#39;t matter what any other mod thinks because he is the de facto top mod of the subreddit. The mods above him pay no attention to <a href="/r/bestof">/r/bestof</a> and are inactive.</p>

<p>He happens to be friends with and mods subreddits with agentlame. Both of them were in part responsible for the total meltdown of <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> in Summer 2014 that led to the admins temporarily having to remove its default status. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/aOMHl">Here is a good look at the way these two moderate together.</a></p>

<p>I posted this today because I have had enough of the wrong turns that reddit has been taking recently with its many biased, authoritarian, and terrible moderators. I felt the need to share this information with all of you just in case you weren&#39;t aware of how bad the problem has gotten on this site. Between mods like this and Ellen Pao forcing this site to become <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ib6kT">a &quot;safe space&quot; instead of a place for the most open and engaged discussion on the web,</a> I felt the need to show those who don&#39;t know about two of reddit&#39;s most dictatorial mods just how perfect they are for the new reddit under Ellen Pao. </p>

<p>As for my bannings and the reasons given by these two mods, I reject their view that I am a racist and that I deserve to be banned from every subreddit that they moderate for this accusation. I make no apologies for and do not reject the view that I hold conservative and right of center opinions on certain issues. I reject the notion that the views I hold are inappropriate, that I have no right to participate in discussion in the many subreddits that these mods control due to my views, and I know that the censoring of myself and others for holding these views is the wrong way to run subreddits that are supposed to be places for open and varied discussion. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating for the right to spam racial and/or other hateful slurs in a subreddit. I&#39;m not demanding the right to yell &quot;FIRE!&quot; in a crowded theater or subreddit either. I&#39;m staunchly in favor of the right to hold opinions that cut against the grain and that challenge others to think and to address beliefs that may not be popular or widely-held. I actually believe that the reason why I was banned from hundreds of subreddits is because these two mods were angry that people were giving <a href="https://imgur.com/a/TG1uY">positive attention to the views that I hold</a> since my views apparently do not align with their own.</p>

<p>If I have to choose between a safe space where my ideas aren&#39;t challenged or deemed worthy of sharing, where I have to walk on eggshells not to push the envelop too far, or where I have to think twice about every &quot;controversial&quot; view that I hold before posting then you can count me out. I like a reddit where we&#39;re all able to post freely without any sort of coercion from mods or admins that makes us alter or sanitize what we say and/or to scare us from saying anything at all that would be deemed inappropriate by biased, authoritarian neckbeards like davidreiss666 and agentlame. If you&#39;ve read this far, I hope you&#39;re in favor of the latter reddit and not the former.</p>

<p>Edit: The top comment in this thread is telling me that <a href="/r/subredditcancer">/r/subredditcancer</a> is the place for this type of post so I will post this over there as well. </p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve just been told that <a href="/u/davidreiss666">/u/davidreiss666</a> is talking about this post in his backroom private subreddits with his other power mods and his sycophants who are telling him he&#39;s not to blame for anything that I&#39;ve exposed and dug up here. He&#39;s such a coward that he won&#39;t respond to this post in any public subreddit where people can challenge his poor behavior but he&#39;ll act like he&#39;s not a piece of garbage in his private subreddits with other authoritarian neckbeards just like him who all tell each other that it&#39;s everyone else who is the problem reddit but not them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. After reading this tread and a few referenced threads I was becoming a little disillusioned. </p>

<p>I joined Reddit a few years ago and recently returned. The main attraction being that the community were the main driving force behind what was promoted... how wrong I was.</p>

<p>You pointed me toward Voat and their philosophy seems more to my liking. I know its not a be-all utopia but nothing is perfect. However, I&#39;m voting with my feet. </p>

<p>Goodbye Reddit. Hello Voat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Voat.co. It&#39;s the 8chan of Reddit and run by an anti-SJW / anti-bullshit, free speech friendly administrator. It has transparency lists for moderators and the actions they take and other sorts of goodies that Reddit does not have. </p>

<p>Remember; civilization was not built in one day- nor will Voat. Don&#39;t be a 99% and not contribute- join the 1% and contribute to the website, and help grow it. Reddit was incredibly small and nearly the same when people made the transition from Digg to Reddit. </p>

<p>Just because people value free speech and defend the rights of racists bigots and pieces of shit (like the guy that called you a hippie) doesn&#39;t mean they support those groups, which SJWs can&#39;t seem to tolerate. They are professional victims and coddlers, constantly looking for outrages or perceived offenses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too bad the same shit happened at 4chan. But they are always years too late. Sites pop up and become popular amongst free-thinkers because they are not censored. Then the genius starts to get known, and casuals start showing up. Some get <em>TRIGGERED</em> by something they read and the complaining starts up. Jackasses with agendas and absolutely no life start showing up and weaseling into mod positions. And eventually they get control and feel self righteous - but in the meantime, the sites fall into absolute irrelevance. Other great sites are doing great things, but the pooh-poohers and finger waggers are so helplessly out of touch that they have no idea. </p>

<p>The one problem is when big companies start hiring shills to shit post, because they have the organisation to ruin good things. Victimhood seems to be a <em>huge</em> demographic they are promoting everywhere, because it sells a lot of media. They want to fertilize a huge crop of self-righteous victims who are completely powerless except for whining - and congratulating one another about their whining. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about the clicks. </p>

<p>I, for one, have just been moving on from reddit - except for a few specific subs I still visit sometimes. There is <em>far</em> better internet out there, untouched by these greasy, lame, self-righteous morons.</p>

mod pool, and self selection ends up with even more rotten ones
joining them, and the good ones leaving. </p>

<p>Eventually, you end up with toxic mods, and a user base of 
sycophants, kiss asses, circle jerkers, and plain old lurkers. </p>

<p>I first observed this, and mentioned it even, in 1988 relating to
the BBS scene. It&#39;s sort of a microcosm of the rise and fall of 
civilizations. You can speed up and slow down some of the 
cycle, but there&#39;s no stopping it. Forum Rot will turn lethal 
at roughly a maximum of 8 years from the birth of a forum. </p>

<p>And while people will still be there as long as someone keeps 
the power on, visit Kuro5hin.org if you don&#39;t believe me, the 
place will be dead for all practical purposes. </p>

<p>Of course, some outlast this, but usually they&#39;re novelty sites, 
photo sites, or hobbyist sites that are essentially a circle jerk. 
I mean really, how many years can you talk about AR15 platforms
before people think you&#39;re freaking rainman or some shit? </p>

<p>Fark.com, I think that one will outlive The Onion. The Fark forum, 
I think that one was dead on arrival. :D </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That post is actually terrible, full of untruths and ignorance about how reddit works and why certain choices were made. I made a rebuttal against every single point he raised <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/30hy5r/i_wrote_how_reddit_was_destroyed_and_it_went/cpt22vw">here</a>. All you need to do is stop and think for 10 seconds and you&#39;ll see how he&#39;s wrong</p>

<p>EDIT: I also want to point out to those who choose to gloss over the post or not even read it, that the OP argued <em>for</em> reddit&#39;s part in the Boston Bombing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look what happened in the immediate aftermath of the Boston Bombing, while users were pooling resources, the website was DDos attacked to stop the momentum<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/19/reddit-ddos/">[15]</a> . Good thing to, since moments later, our honest government said “Hey everybody, these two guys did it!” For arguments sake, despite anything that followed, it should be extremely alarming that millions of people suddenly decided they were guilty based on nothing more than a picture, the government’s word, and the <del>manufactured</del> consensus of their peers. I was on reddit in the exact moment the shift happened and NOBODY could tell me why they suddenly believed, without any other evidence, that two people attending the marathon with a circle around them was evidence of guilt.</p>

Saying shadowbanning is okay because it stops these bad guys from potentially doing bad things is a false equivalency.

The fact is, innocent people get caught in a shadowban without them becoming aware of it, which effectively censors those individuals, which clashes thunderously with Reddits core pseudovalues.</p>

<p><a href="/u/agentlame">/u/agentlame</a> has shown up in this thread and called OP a xenophobic bigot, so there&#39;s probably something that was deleted.</p>

<p>Maybe, but now you&#39;re not being any less conspiratorial than some of the people on the sub.  Either could be true, but if the OP did make a bunch of racist comments don&#39;t mods have access to that type of thing?  Because it seems like in their convo they just gave him ammo when they could have shut him up immediately, if that&#39;s the case.  </p>

<p>Also to be honest, &quot;xenophobic bigot&quot; can be pretty subjective, depending on the sensibilities of the accuser.  Some people might think that saying &quot;Islam is dangerous&quot; is bigoted/xenophobic, but someone else might think it&#39;s justified.  Even if he did post something that someone might consider xenophobic, it&#39;s bad to shut out his position.  What if one day you want to talk about a controversial topic and some mods just decide you&#39;re a bigot and ban you from tons of subs?  </p>

<p>Not if he deleted it. The admins might, but mods do not. We can see comments we remove from out own subs, but if someone deletes their own posts, we cannot see them.</p>

<p>Then you have to deal with that. Their subs, their rules. Remember: reddit is not the government, nor the US. The US Constitution and its first amendment do not apply on this website. If a mod wants free speech in his sub, he can have it. If he doesn&#39;t, then he can stop it</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need the first amendment to value free speech.  The first amendment just prevents the government from getting in the way of expression, but isn&#39;t the whole point behind it that we value our free expression so much we don&#39;t want the powerful entity of the government getting in the way?  By that reason I think we should still try to bolster discourse, and not just shut people up behind the excuse &quot;What, I&#39;m not the government so it&#39;s ok when I do it&quot;.  I&#39;m not saying that mods should be forced run their subs in a certain way, but just because it&#39;s not government mandated it doesn&#39;t mean that a person shouldn&#39;t have open discourse, at least for the sake of reciprocation.  I&#39;m just saying it seems like a hazy and abusable policy to ban people for something as nebulous as &quot;xenophobia&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can value free speech while still retaining the desire to not have a troll run through your subreddit whose entire purpose is to piss people off. That person is not sharing opinions, he&#39;s just being a little cunt for the sake of it. And as much as I will probably get hated for this, not everyone in the world has the same look on &#39;free speech&#39; as americans do. Americans get the constitution rammed down their throats from birth, and it grows on you (I need only point out the stereotype of &quot;I&#39;M AN AMERICAN, I HAVE RIGHTS&quot; to make my point). People in other places are much more casual. I&#39;m Australian, and we don&#39;t have constitutional freedom of speech. You know what <em>is</em> in our constitution? I have no idea, and neither does anyone who isn&#39;t a lawyer, because it means practically nothing to us. So there are going to be a lot of people on this website who don&#39;t share the same values as Americans, and so think that banning a racist is perfectly fine, even though it conflicts with &#39;freedom of speech&#39;</p>

For example there was the guy who posted in askreddit explaining how a cabal of people from SRS gained mod positions in a load of subs essentially taking over a large part of reddit, he then set up a subreddit dedicated to chronicling all that sort of shit which got a fair few people subbed to it in one day (it was a couple thousand IIRC), he was then banned and all the other mods of that sub were banned and I think the sub was taken over by the very people that it was set up to chronicle.</p>

<p>Look at this guys submission history, it is all pretty much race baiting and anti-democratic stuff, no wonder he is banned from so many subreddits. There is a ton of people like this as well where you check their post history and it is just them jumping around regional subs and attacking democrats and not right enough republicans.

    <div class="md"><p>I never was on Digg, but Reddit is the closest thing I&#39;ve found on the internet to the hybrid of organization and anarchy that was Usenet.</p>

<p>The chief difference between Voat and Reddit is in the anarchy side of things.  How much regulation is there, and where is that regulation coming from?  In Reddit, the trend has apparently been toward a more top-down structure, where Reddit used to be (and Voat still is) more user-modded by way of karma.</p>

<p>The big problem with top-down structures is that, in some cases, it results in millions of users but only a handful of opinions, because if any of those users gets too far outside the accepted lanes, bad things happen to their accounts.</p>

<p>To me it&#39;s bullshit.  Now I am a pretty conventional guy in terms of worldview, conservative, anti-SJW, anti-racist, and so on.  But as much as I dislike certain other worldviews, a chief piece of my philosophy is that they should be demolished in open debate (if indeed their views can be demolished at all) and never censored away.  That&#39;s not to say OT posts and untagged NSFW or NSFL posts shouldn&#39;t be deleted, because they should be.  But as an extreme example, if someone wanted to come deny the Holocaust, I&#39;d much rather have that argument than to just toss the guy out for having an unpopular point of view (no matter how stupid I might think that POV is).</p>

<p>So I think Voat is more in line with my philosophy.  The real problem is that it lacks the critical mass of users and might always lack them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty funny, i would have said &quot;it is an awesome reddit knock off not run by feminists&quot;, but I guess I actually use the site, so there is that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Under Yishan reddit wasn&#39;t that bad, and we still have a couple strongholds, like here, but for the first 4 years you could even have good discussions on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, then one by one the mods and sjws (with the blessings of the admin). There were never tools on reddit for transparency, that was left to the mods, and things like &quot;shadow bans&quot; were only used for spam. I would be VERY surprised if the admin at voat create a shadowban even for spam.</p>

The owners put a person like Chairman Pao at the top, that means they want to change Reddit into something more monetizable fir a large corporation, and away from being a free discussion board.

    <div class="md"><p>davidreiss666 is one of those mods who &quot;oversees&quot; 139 subreddits.  While it isnt possible to do so and do a good job, it IS possible for him to ban him on 139 subreddits and to convince his friends on an offsite/private chat to do the same.</p>

<p>A cap on the amount of subreddits a person could moderate would be wonderful.  Obviously a cop cant patrol 1000 miles by himself...nor should he be given blanked jurisdiction over 1000 miles with zero accountability.</p>

<p>Reddit has been using the buzzword &quot;transparency&quot; a lot lately.  I hope this shows EXACTLY how transparent they are.  Call their customer service hotline or follow the &quot;Help&quot; link to get in touch with the Reddit Mods/Admins and see what you can do about this.</p>

<p>Im just shitting you....there is no hotline or link.  Go fuck yourselves, you plebs.  davidreiss666 said &quot;bye now&quot;...what about that dont you peasants get?</p>

<p>As a person who lost a 3 year old account with 40k karma, 10 gift exchanges on RedditGifts, over a year of gold with months remaining, and a full friends list/tagged list that got banned for posting a business&#39; phone number (aka &quot;doxxing&quot;).....if you dont think this kind of thing CAN happen to you, you are fooling yourselves. </p>

<p>Many of you would be surprised to learn that this isnt davidreiss666&#39; first &quot;my way or the highway&quot; mod activity or the first time he has been caught dead to rights.</p>

<p>Not only is it impossible to moderate 139 subreddits...not only has he been shown to not be capable....not only has he shown to be abusive with his power....not only has he been caught in the act.....but there he is, still &quot;doing the impossible&quot; with the full blessing of those who made him a mod and who keep him as a mod.</p>

<p>If a mod gets off on the power and control they receive from a WEBSITE, treats those with differing view points with disdain, and does so with the help of like-minded &quot;power hungry&quot; mods in a figurative cigar smoke-filled backroom... (for no real reason I might add)</p>

<p>edit: who thinks that that&#39;s even possible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve wondered about this many times. Not gonna name any names but...</p>

<p>I think everyone here has noticed that some names keep coming up all over the place. I see links posted by the same user in ten or twenty different subs like worldnews, science, movies, geopolitics etc. Then I start wondering about stuff like, how the fuck do they find all this stuff? And how are they always the first one to post? And also, how is it that their posts are always making it to the top ten?</p>

<p>Then there was a weird episode I had where I asked a question to one of them. I did this by asking them a question in the comments section of a link they&#39;d posted. They made a reply that seemed like it must have been based on personal information (possibly gained from looking at my user history). So I sent them a PM asking about their reply. This is where it gets interesting. I got back <em>two</em> replies from the same account. <em>But it seemed like each reply had nothing to do with the other</em>.</p>

<p>Something tells me that the username is just a name and that,  maybe, there are <em>multiple users</em> for these accounts. This might explain a few things. One is the stuff I just mentioned. The other? Maybe there&#39;s 4 or 5 people on the reiss666 account. Most of them are cool, plus one neckbeard. </p>

<p>Guess which one is doing all the banning?</p>

<p>What a classy response from mature, professional mods.  A+, gents!  </p>

<p>These guys are like high school hall monitors, and they&#39;re all clique&#39;d up together and drunk on their &quot;power&quot;.  Unfortunately, they&#39;ve become so entrenched within Reddit over the past 5 years or so, I&#39;m afraid they are here to stay for whatever length of time this site remains popular.  Call me a pessimist, but mark my words: They&#39;re not going anywhere, and the only thing that will ever get rid of them will be the complete collapse of Reddit <em>a la</em> Digg, and an exodus elsewhere.  </p>

<p>The best we can hope for is that that new elsewhere will once again be open &amp; free, and will remain resistant to authoritarian, manipulative megalomaniacs like these guys.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wanna know a secret, most mods probably are college or high school students. On my old account, which I was forced to delete due to unintentionally doxxing myself and associating my company with my username, I was the mod of several subreddits. I was much more active during high school, but slowed down in college as real life hit me like a ton of bricks. </p>

<p>I got into fights with <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> mods, dealt with spammers, and at one point was in charge of over 1,000,000 collective users. The power trip and responsibility was too much for 16/17 year old me, so I just stopped responding and got other mods to do the work. </p>

<p>I had the power at one point to effectively turn a 30k subreddit private and ban everybody. It&#39;s amazing the power that can be given to someone so idiotic and inexperienced. Reddit is run off of volunteers. Some mods are bad. Mods who run hundreds of subreddits do it for the power. I did it because I genuinely like the communities. Now, after deleting my 4 year old account and starting over ( going to choose a new profile cause I hate the name of this one) I feel relieved. </p>

<p>This turned into more of a rant, but I guess the point is that reddit is not run by some professionals. We don&#39;t get paid, we don&#39;t do this for a resume builder. Some people power trip. It sucks. Reddit admins should limit the number of subreddits one individual can be a part of. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about voat that&#39;s supposed to be good is that it doesn&#39;t matter if the &quot;usual suspects&quot; come over. We can see everything they do, and the admin is on the userbases side when it comes to nonsensical and power tripping mods.</p>

<p>Reddit, or any site like it, would absolutely FALL APART without user moderators, and creating a subreddit should mean you get to run it how you want. Anyone who denies this is just a greedy shit head who wants their OWN power to be more than it should be.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t however mean we shouldn&#39;t keep &quot;power modding&quot; as unreasonable and not allowed, or that we don&#39;t have to work to keep things working properly on both sides.</p>

<p>You will never have a platform that is perfect, and you will never have anything like reddit without people to create, mod, and run subreddits. You can however hold people more accountable, keep things more transparent, and allow for better ways to find alternative subreddits.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think users should be pushing out mods for the same exact reason you wouldn&#39;t want your account deleted. Some of them work really hard to make things nice, get codes implemented properly, and keep the subreddit clear. Users can make their own subreddit if they don&#39;t like it. We just need ways to get people to be able to find them should the atmosphere of the original subreddit degrade.</p>

<p>Voat seems to offer most of this. You can see if some mod is nuts. You can see what kind of crap they are trying to pull, and if you don&#39;t like it, you can say something, and then move the hell on. I however would like a &quot;related&quot; or &quot;alternate&quot; subreddit/subverse button, so easily find the next biggest sub to use. I would also like a site like that to limit mod positions, based on the person not just the account, similar to how you can&#39;t use multiple accounts to downvote people without getting in trouble.</p>

<p>It was always a loss service, the Facebook acquisition was a defensive measure to allow facebook users to interact with websites who otherwise did not offer FB tie-in; <em>raw userbase numbers</em> were not sufficient to keep it relevant in that context.

    <div class="md"><p>It was a long read and late at night, but this is what I recall: It was sort of like a behind the scenes look at the corruption within internet forums, specifically Digg and Reddit. He was with Digg from early on and watched it go from user-run to shill-run. He knew people with already-well-known usernames on Digg who would accept $400+ for a post from whatever company/organization. Later in an edit he admitted that he, too, accepted money for a post, and then hated himself for it and started calling out other shills and trying to spread awareness. By then Digg was already on the downfall and people started moving to Reddit... he said he&#39;s seen the same thing happen here with the big subs... my memory is a bit foggy at this point, but the next day I checked out the front page and suddenly it was so fucking obvious. His comment blew my fucking mind, I was already starting to see Reddit differently lately, especially after subscribing to this sub, but since I read that... I don&#39;t know, man, Reddit isn&#39;t the same any more for me. It&#39;s like food lost its flavor or something.</p>

<p>or are you bored and channel surfing the frontpage of reddit like someone who would sit in front of their TV clicking from one channel to the next completely out of habit.</p>

<p>QFT</p>

<p>You&#39;re exactly right on this, I catch myself doing this all the time now. Just mindleslly, aimlessly clicking on this or that link, this image, that image, amused for a couple of seconds and then completely forget about what I just saw as I click the next page of submissions.</p>

<p>If I really truthfully think about it, there are maybe about 10-19 subreddits I browse that are of any actual value in terms of content or images. The rest are filler, that fills in your main pages and just serve as amusing distractions for a couple minutes.</p>

<p>You made me re-think how I should be browsing reddit, maybe I&#39;ll cull that frontpage of all the useless garbage full of unfunny forced attempts at memes and all that useless shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Want to fix reddit? Take away the mods. Let the users vote up what they like and downvote what they don&#39;t like. Let the arguments recommence and the cyberdrama that entertains people flare up again. Let the vote system next to every comment and post count for something again other than being a tool to control thought</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve alway been a believer in user moderation, I&#39;ve seen it work to great effect on 4chan when the few mods couldn&#39;t give a fuck about the boards and the users were mostly left to their own to self-moderate their board while mods only stepped in for illegal shit and spammers. The rest was up to us and it made for one hell of a wild west, it was fun and it was chaos, and it was free speech to the fullest extent possible - it&#39;s how the internet should be. And for some crazy fucking reason it worked because the users were smart enough to not respond to bait, not get all upitty over anything NSFW posted and immediately come crying to mods, threads stayed on topic, derailed spectaculariy and then by some miracle managed to get back on topic. Over-moderation and especially highly subjective rule enforcement and corrupt SJW mods fucking ruin everything and it&#39;s happening to 4chan now as well. </p>

<p>What a shame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t discount the idea that mods are unpaid. Some evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li>People can play MMO games (and Facebook games, ugh) for 12+ hours a day.</li>
<li>Even people who work for a living often spend &gt;75% of their day doing nothing.</li>
<li>Businesses are likely averse to outright paying people because of the paper trail.</li>
</ul>

<p>If I were trying to get myself some internet-savvy mods and needed them to be absolutely 100% locked down to follow my orders, I wouldn&#39;t use money. I&#39;d find some existing low-level mods who fit the power-hungry personality type and compromise their computer with CP or other illegal material and threaten to report them if they get uppity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True.  Also people can be compensated, without being paid.  I was a moderator on a tech board outside of reddit for a long time, and several popular users were given hardware from time to time in exchange for spamming the board in that company&#39;s favor.  It doesn&#39;t even need to be a concrete transaction, as in &quot;we will give you <em>this</em> if you say <em>that</em>&quot;.  If you give someone free shit, they&#39;ll likely start towing your line of their own free will.  </p>

<p>This is not a supposition on my part, I was approached several times by an unnamed hardware manufacturer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you were onto something interesting but kind of lost the thread with the idea that companies are setting people up for blackmail. I have no doubt that has happened, just like I have no doubt that people in positions of &quot;power&quot; on internet boards sell their influence, but I firmly believe that the vast majority of the time, it&#39;s just people who earnestly believe a certain thing. After all, someone needs to be paying those shills to advance a viewpoint, and the raison d&#39;etre of shills is to convince other people of an idea. For instance, the OP might be a Stormfront troll, he might be someone who bought into the idea of white supremacy from stuff he read from Stormfront trolls on here, or he might just be a random person who signed up here and happens to believe that BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you really appreciate how much people like power. Being a mod is a teeny tiny amount of it but they love it.</p>

<p>When I was young I volunteered to mod a ~6,000 users forum, it was the only forum to discuss an obscure game I liked a lot and I wanted to keep it thriving. </p>

<p>The other mods there were fucking nuts man. They talked in the mod forum about the other forums they modded and how they did things, or talked about their stats on wikipedia, that kind of thing. One of them was a mod or admin of dozens of ~100,000 user forums, and he bragged about being in the top twenty for amount of edits on wikipedia at the time, and he spent a lot of time curating urbandictionary.com. He wasn&#39;t paid, he just liked feeling special and lived with his mom.</p>

<p>There were a LOT of mods in that forum like that.</p>

<p>The kind of people that are moderators for dozens of the huge subs just thrive on feeling superior, even though that is the smallest and most insignificant amount of power possible. I promise, whenever there is a post in a moderate size sub asking for more volunteer mods, they get hundreds of applications.</p>

<p>How do you trust someone with control of 54 subreddits to not be corrupt? There is a reason power is distributed in well-governed systems. If one link of the chain is corrupt, the rest is not by default corrupt as well (although I believe that would count as a conspiracy if it were as such). </p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/A3XWbmk.png">http://i.imgur.com/A3XWbmk.png</a>  (This is the top mod of this subreddit)</p>

<hr/>

<p>I&#39;ll now mention that I don&#39;t feel like the 12 subs you mod are too many or that you&#39;re a bad mod. Most are of the same or similar subject content, which lends itself to having mods that know the subject matter. I will say that even though I think that is fine in this case, it would still lend itself to overzealous modding across a whole subject in this case (if you were a huge dick that wanted to censor something or otherwise hide/omit something from the limelight).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>unlikely <em>that soon</em>, reddit has a <em>large</em> base and significantly more traffic than voat (as of the source i checked about <strong>2000</strong> times more traffic; ~500Mil vs ~250k views per month).</p>

<p>Check something like <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> which has a base of 650+k members vs voat has 307; despite a lot of drama <a href="/r/leagueoflegends">/r/leagueoflegends</a> has a very active base, a frontpage post rarely has less than 100 comments (and often  several 100&#39;s or even thousands)</p>

<p>the best players when they make a great play on stream they say <em>&#39;reddit!&#39; OR &#39;we&#39;re gonna be on reddit!&#39;</em> to the point that everyone in the community goes to reddit to talk about the game.</p>

<p>as <a href="/u/iki_balam">/u/iki_balam</a> points out below i think most people don&#39;t go to reddit for main pages but the niche pages and then also view the defaults/big pages</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t give a shit that some random person was banned from subreddits they didn&#39;t use in the first place. reddit literally lets you make a new account to circumvent bans without even having to verify an email address.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The current problem with voat is that 60% of its content is people bitching about how bad reddit&#39;s gotten. I really tried to start spending some time there as I&#39;m totally for what they&#39;re trying to do, but sadly, they&#39;re largely living in a butt hurt past and its <del>toxic</del> super annoying listening to high-schoolers whine continuously in the corner of my eye on every page of &quot;content&quot;, so much so that i start to feel almost infected by the negativity there. Much like someone would if they spent too much time in the presence of, oh I don&#39;t know say... something.. toxic.</p>

<p>When voat and its user-base decide to actually move on from their bad break-up, it may become a worthwhile use of time.</p>

I posted an article about Bowe Bergdahl, and they took it down saying it was &quot;hearsay and not facts&quot;. They deleted the submission, and then a few hours later the same article appeared, and stayed up. I called the deleting mod out and I got banned for it. </p>

<p>A week later I was allowed back. Then about a month ago one of the newer mods banned me over something similar. So I just went and made mybown military based subreddit, <a href="/r/militaries">/r/militaries</a>. It probably will never have the 60,000+ subscribers they have, but I do what I can for any who come looking.</p>

<p>Honest question, why not? If he posted racist comments in one sub (this is actually a case where he did, just look at his comment history), what is the problem with other subs who have anti-racism as a policy from preventing him from posting in there? Seems like it would be really inefficient to do otherwise. He&#39;s unambiguously racist, look at his post history.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s harsh. If he really wanted to &quot;turn over a new leaf&quot; and participate in those other subreddits, nothing is stopping him from making another account and just not being racist anymore.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>If we don&#39;t have a definition of what is or is not acceptable, we must either accept everything, accept nothing, or accept things arbitrarily.</p>

<p>There are sites and subreddits that accept everything. And of course there are others who have rules, which might prohibit any one of those things you mentioned. Any arbitrary topic could be prohibited (even unracist viewpoints) and everyone is still within their rights. The only question is, how many people would still want to participate?</p>

<p>There are two sides to the &quot;free speech&quot; coin, people are free to express themselves and other people are free to not listen. Or if it happens in a space that they have authority, to kick that person out. That is what happened here. </p>

<p>Of course, the people of those subreddits would not be able to honestly say that all perspectives are tolerated. That is a standard they are not obliged to have. </p>

<p>edit: just to add, the slippery slope argument is regarded as a logical fallacy unless it can be shown that one step is likely to lead to another. If a subreddit decides to have rules for discussion, it is absolutely possible for them to say &quot;it is OK to discuss whether abortion is inhumane&quot; while simultaneously saying &quot;it is NOT OK to discuss whether some races are inferior.&quot; That is not a line a rational person would consider ambiguous.</p>

<p>I think this is very reasonable. I&#39;m aware that there are mod abuses, although I don&#39;t agree that this is one of them. I think it is worthwhile to think about what kind of system we want and how it should be moderated.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You seem to be mixing up &quot;racist discussion&quot; with &quot;discussion about whether racism should be allowed.&quot; Right now, we are discussing whether racism should be allowed, and as of yet neither of us have been banned (yay!). And I don&#39;t expect either of us will be at this rate, it is a respectful discussion. (Worth noting that this wasn&#39;t one of the subreddits in which he was banned, which sort of makes my point moot, but hopefully the idea still makes sense).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m glad this isn&#39;t a system in which the community decides who gets banned or not, then you will have people getting banned simply for being unpopular. There are some decisions that are not well served by a popular vote. If we are going to have a system where people can be banned, it is better to have them be banned for reasons rather than for being unpopular. </p>

<p>In a way, the community does decide which rules they consider valuable, simply by whether or not they choose to use that subreddit. Considering all the different permutations of subreddits out there, if they wanted one that was more open to topics like racism, they would be using that one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is an interesting idea, having mods being voted in or out of power. I&#39;d like to know about websites that have tried this and if it worked well. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that it could work under the right conditions. At the same time, I think it is understandable that reddit is not a system like this, as much as we wish it was. As far as popular internet hubs go, it is the very worst one, except for all the others.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do Ivy League schools routinely have ~30% Ashkenazi Jews then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they&#39;re super-intelligent and because they network and are tribal in helping each other out. Think about how many legacy Jewish students there are in the Ivy League, then about the money that they have to pay for them to go to schools in the Ivy League, and then about the Ivy League even thinking about diluting their Jewish population like they&#39;re trying to dilute their Asian population. Can you even imagine the ADL mainstream media shitstorm if the Ivy League discriminated against Jews in their applications? Our media is run by plenty of Jews so they would destroy any Ivy League dean who so much as thought about lessening the number of Jews that they accept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first paragraph buys into antisemitic stereotypes and makes some pretty broad claims without having any justification, as if it is just &quot;understood&quot; that this is the way Jewish people are.</p>

<p>As for the statement about diversity, I could see how a non-racist person might still have problems with affirmative action. But he is condemning diversity entirely. In another comment he talks about his desire for racial homogeneity.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I don&#39;t really see it as my role to decide who is racist and who isn&#39;t on the internet. All I said is that I don&#39;t blame anyone for thinking that he is. Perhaps you are right about mods having too much control, I don&#39;t really know much about how that works. In this case I&#39;m having a hard time mustering sympathy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm well I like to think it can be objectively proven and if it can&#39;t then it&#39;s not. But yea, I suppose that it can easily be perceived to be racist... I just think he&#39;s sharing his opinion without trying to be offensive.<br/>
I don&#39;t really feel sympathetic either; if a place has low tolerance then it&#39;s no surprise talking like that can get you banned. However the majority of redditors seem to think that this place has free speech but this clearly shows that it doesn&#39;t. Maybe I&#39;m wrong though and most know that there is no tolerance here. Either they don&#39;t care or don&#39;t know that there are alternatives (when there are)</p>

<p>diversity is racism against Whites</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how that is racist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Are you stupid? Those are word-for-word active racist talking points. There&#39;s no context that can excuse it. There&#39;s lots of ways of criticizing Affirmative Action, but calling racial diversity &quot;racism against Whites&quot; is one of the most blatantly racist things you could say. Promoting diversity in colleges is about trying to counteract racial inequality and racial divisions, not about unfairly over-representing non-Whites.</p>

<p>Agreed in general, though I&#39;m okay with banning overt racists from explicitly anti-racist subs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is racist. On that we agree. I think we also agree that we disagree with his views.</p>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>But why should he be banned from subreddits like <a href="/r/food">/r/food</a> and <a href="/r/history">/r/history</a>? that&#39;s just mod abuse. He is racist but he is not uttering hate speech. he is not saying we should kill some group of people or deprive them of rights. he just dislikes non-white people, and though I disagree with him I fail to see why we shouldn&#39;t allow someone with differing views to present their argument. If it&#39;s bad, we ignore it.</p>

<p>The problem with silencing everyone who disagrees with you is that someone makes the call on &#39;what is right and what is wrong.&#39; Of course hate speech that calls for the deaths or limitation of rights of other people is bad, but that&#39;s not happening here. What if this was the other way around? What if the mods were right wingers and they banned everyone who was pro-abortion or something because they said they don&#39;t allow baby killers in their subreddits? would that be okay? Because I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>I know reddit isn&#39;t public domain, it&#39;s private. We can&#39;t tell the reddit mods to allow free speech. But we can leave reddit if they refuse to do so, and we should on good conscience. </p>

<p>No, they don&#39;t. Nobody has the right to have their views heard. The right to speak them? Absolutely, but you can&#39;t force an audience to be receptive, and nobody should have to put up with a bunch of racists shitting up their subreddit.</p>

<p>Nope, pre-emptive banning is horseshit.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this aspect of your personality is a little &#39;fucked&#39; by our standards, and instead of trying to help you out, change you a little, educate you on the proper way to behave, we&#39;re just going to dismiss you and anything you might ever say&quot;</p>

<p>I hate to break your bubble, but &#39;some&#39; people are actually racists, those same people live &amp; work in the same world you do, they have the ability/right to interact and learn, just like you do.</p>

<p>Dismissing everything they might ever say, every contribution they may ever make, because of a &#39;character flaw&#39; is bullshit.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve lived &#39;x&#39; number of years, they have &#39;x&#39; to contribute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a side effect of Reddit&#39;s system. When you have a large subreddit, there&#39;s a natural tendency to find mods of other large subreddits for their experience. Same goes in smaller degrees for subreddits that share topics of interest.</p>

<p>This is caused by an independent group of people, and I don&#39;t really see what Ellen Pao has to do with it. In fact, the spam of 400+ ban messages could easily be considered to break the new harassment rule <em>of individuals</em> that was <a href="http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html">announced in the Reddit blog</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Getting banned from <em>unrelated</em> subreddits, especially in those numbers would seem to pretty clearly violate that statute as well as being spammy. I&#39;d recommend <a href="https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=reddit.com">contacting the admins</a> about the matter. </p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s not really anything to &#39;fix&#39;, per se. On Reddit any given subreddit is owned completely and irrevocably by the head mod, who is usually the person who created the sub. In other words, the one who was first to think of the name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might have some right to complain about these mods, but what really makes your post laughable is the fact that you claiming not to be a racist is an essential part of your point.<br/>
I don&#39;t know you, I maybe looked a total of 5 minutes at your comment history and it&#39;s megamultifucking obvious that you have some issues with this.<br/>
1/3 of all your postings mention someones race. Few days ago, you write:<br/>
&quot;Typically, it&#39;s White nations in the Western world that have diversity pushed on them but if you look around you&#39;ll notice that the diversity mob and the Left never demand diversity in non-White places. &quot;  </p>

<p>Are you actually believing that your view on things here can somehow be considered something other than racist? Face it like a man, of course you&#39;re racist, and tbh I seriously doubt you don&#39;t realize that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is any of that &quot;racist&quot;?  It may be a broad generalization regarding one view of diversification. Believe it or not, some conservative views recognize the effect forced diversity hurts the Nationals of a certain group or tribe if you will. Saying that immigrants are inherently worse because they are a different race would be &quot;racist&quot; but there is no denying having a country/power state that your national culture is inherently wrong hurts the national pride, image, and what made that country great. That is not to say that diversity is a bad thing, but it being forced not by the will of the people but by the powers that be, isn&#39;t a good thing. </p>

<p>This is opinion, not inherently racist.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is an opinion <em>that is inherently racist</em>. Opinions can most certainly be racist, there&#39;s no distinction between the two. And trust me, I read through his comment history too and it is not pretty. It is beyond obvious that he is spewing racist shit. He only uses selective facts to veil the utter ridiculousness of what he is saying.</p>

<p>Specifically, he spins facts against diversity. He clearly has an oppression complex. The ultimate irony of this is that he is <strong>no different</strong> from the SJW, black lives matters, and other movements against <em>actual</em> oppression that he hates himself! It&#39;s the ultimate irony.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a lie. Produce the comments that I copy and pasted from that White power website and I&#39;ll delete this post. Link me to the places off of reddit where I took my comments from and I promise you I&#39;ll delete this post from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. Go on.  You can&#39;t do it because whatever I write and say is in my own words and I don&#39;t copy and paste any pre-made comments from White power websites since I don&#39;t frequent them at all. Also, post proof of vote-brigading from CoonTown. Good luck with that since the mods don&#39;t even allow you to link to any posts on reddit. Show me the links from CoonTown or their IRC chatroom that prove this and I will delete my post here. Yeah, that never happened either. People just agree with some of what I say. It&#39;s ironic to say in this sub but there&#39;s no conspiracy of vote-rigging going on so you&#39;re not being truthful at all. </p>

<p>He is claiming that I come from a White power website called Stormfront which is run by David Duke. I don&#39;t &quot;come&quot; from there and I&#39;ve never even posted there. I didn&#39;t even know what Stormfront was until I saw idiots from <a href="/r/Shitredditsays">/r/Shitredditsays</a> accusing people of being from Stormfront whenever they start losing an argument about race. It&#39;s their boogeyman that they go to in times of need. When he refers to copypasta he is referring to things on the internet that have already been written by someone else and that I&#39;m copying and pasting them as comments on reddit. That&#39;s a lie and he has failed to prove otherwise. </p>

<p>Benthetraveler is accusing me of being some sort of operative from that site here on reddit and that I&#39;ve come from there equipped with pre-written talking points and comments to spam all over reddit to recruit redditors for my nefarious plots. Yeah, no. Anything I&#39;ve written was written after doing my own detailed research through good old Google, not through links provided to me by neo-Nazis on White power sites like this guy is claiming. I honestly don&#39;t even know how to navigate through old style internet forums like Stormfront. I&#39;m strictly a reddit and 4chan type of guy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, you do realize that you are the one slandering him and he kept his views on your racism private and just banned you and only mentioned it in mod mail when you asked why he banned you, right?  Do you feel a tad hypocritical.  This guys an ass, but he just banned you, you&#39;ve obsessively stalked him.</p>

<p>Second, I can&#39;t read the post since you didn&#39;t link to it, but the title does sound racist.  Why mention that someone of African descent attacked the girl?  Why not just say a girl was attacked for wearing a crucifix?  Does it actually matter that it was by someone of &quot;African descent?&quot;  Also, do you realize that &quot;African descent&quot; is almost always not the right way to refer to a black person unless you&#39;re referring to someone who literally migrated from Africa in their lifetime and are acting in a way informed by that?  Giving you the benefit of the doubt I&#39;d imagine it&#39;s just a misstep, but realize that specifically calling out race is race-bating a bit when it has nothing to do with it.  Why not call out the other kids religion?  This is like saying the girl was attacked by someone of Irish descent...unless it&#39;s a protestant/Catholic English/Irish related attack it serves no fucking purpose.  You should ask yourself why you&#39;d mention someone of African descent and not if they were of Irish descent.</p>

<p>Tl;dr: The mods an asshole and so are you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The title of the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Girl, 12, beaten by classmate, for wearing crucifix - update</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The title of the post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Girl, 12, beaten by classmate, for wearing crucifix: A schoolboy of African origin attacked a 12-year-old-girl at a school in central Italy because she was wearing a crucifix on a neck chain, police said Friday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The original title of the article makes no mention to race, albeit it does mention it in the article, why include it in the title?  I&#39;m not sure why the article included it either to be honest.  Race literally has nothing to do with this from what the article says, it sounds like normal schoolyard bullying.  Guess what, Irish kids do the same thing (I had a protestant English friend attacked by an Irish Catholic due to his faith, that would have more relevance because of the cultural history specific to that, however where you come from does not relate to religion directly).  Mentioning specifically, especially in the title, the race when it&#39;s completely irrelevant would appear like race-bating even if the OP didn&#39;t mean it that way.</p>

<p>Again, not opposed to black people being associated with African-American (though black people generally don&#39;t like that term anymore as many have lived their whole lives in America and are just as American as the English or German descendants) my problem was bringing race in at all, I mentioned Africa because it&#39;s also considered politically incorrect now (just trying to help OP out in phrasing things in the future).</p>

<p>Yes, various cultures (race doesn&#39;t matter anywhere near as much as culture) can act differently but in this instance black people aren&#39;t known as being persecutors of the Christian faith...in general a lot of black people are Christians.  There&#39;s no pattern to recognize aside from schoolyard kids can be assholes and in this case this kid was one of many who&#39;s picked on religion.  I would love to see some evidence that black people are significantly more likely to be bigoted against Christianity than anyone else.  I would imagine personal beliefs and the desire to make fun of something regardless of what would factor in more (let&#39;s be honest, if this kid is bullying for a crucifix he&#39;d have found something else random if that wasn&#39;t there...there were other students at that school who wore crucifixes).</p>

<p>Political correctness is not what&#39;s at play here, this is an instance of biasing driving linguistics.  He mentioned the race because he felt that was pertinent when there&#39;s no evidence that it is, not only does that imply undue bias on his part it also subtly promotes that bias to others.  I would strongly recommend reading more on linguistics and how word choice and extraneous text can impact overall interpretation and use.</p>

<p>Oh, and as for searching...I&#39;m not going to spend time searching for his post, he should have put it in there and Reddit&#39;s search system is quite the mess.  I used the information he gave us to make judgement on to make judgement, in part because what was in the article almost assuredly didn&#39;t matter...I mean, if the kid was in some sort of Black Panthers movement...maybe, but Italy isn&#39;t exactly known for racism by its minorities...rather by it&#39;s neo-nazi&#39;s.  Something tells me more kids have been beaten up for being black there than for wearing a crucifix and more white people have beaten people up for wearing a crucifix than black (though I have no sources so I could be wrong).</p>

<p>Tl;dr: I&#39;m not sure how this actually applies to the meat of what I was saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I wouldn&#39;t be surprised I&#39;d like to give him the benefit of the doubt and think he&#39;s actually referring to pattern recognition among different cultures and just doesn&#39;t realize culture extends beyond, and is way more important, than skin color.</p>

<p>I think the bigger issue is that he thinks there&#39;s a pattern of black people persecuting Christians.  To my knowledge a majority of black people in Italy are Christians so this would be a bit counterintuitive.  Regardless I think it&#39;s obvious from the article this kid was just looking to pick a fight, let&#39;s be honest...there were a hell of a lot more kids wearing crucifixes than this kid picked upon, he would have picked on this girl for some reason or another.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, no. This isn&#39;t about &quot;improper English&quot;.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I went to the original source:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ansa.it/english/news/2015/05/15/girl-12-beaten-by-classmate-for-wearing-crucifix-update_600d65d8-3046-4cf7-afcd-8e77686b13e6.html">Girl, 12, beaten by classmate, for wearing crucifix</a></p>

<p>The exact words &quot;A schoolboy of African origin attacked a 12-year-old-girl &quot; do appear in the first sentence of the extremely brief article. No other details are given about the &quot;schoolboy of African origin&quot; other than that he is a minor who first attended school three weeks prior.</p>

<p>In the US, that is cringe-worthy because it&#39;s very clumsy in meaning and questionable interpretation.</p>

<p>I concede that since this english article is published in Italy, conventions are different there, but that would not be entirely clear to most western english readers who read the reddit headline.</p>

<p>So, I still stand by my point that a better choice of words can go a long way when your message is international.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never stated it being bad English was a problem (because it aint), but that I cant see whats the sensitivity problem in using the sentence he did, because I meet such sentences in my normal life here. Sure there was probably better ways to describe it, but I wouldnt think twice when reading that headline, as it does not stand out as racist at all from where I come from, and I guess most of Europe wont have troubles either with such a headline, which is where OP seems to be from (well, and me too). </p>

<p>So what im indicating here is, that OP didnt know that these mods comes from a lot more sensitive area in the world compared to him, and never stood a chance of knowing that the sentence is wrong in their eyes, as they: 1: dont speak the same native language (Im guessing OP is Italian judging on the post) meaning something can go wrong in translation, and 2; comes from two very different parts of the world in terms of whats okay to say, and whats not.</p>

<p>At least make sure the mods tells him whats wrong before just banning him without a warning at first, especially as that sentence actually is in the damn article...</p>

<p>EDIT: About your update, his message was only intended for Europeans. That sentence would be perfectly fine in 99% of Europe, so cant see the problem here still... But the fact that there&#39;s a mod on <a href="/r/Europe">/r/Europe</a> thats from USA makes no god damn sense...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Systemic and continued actions to torment someone in a way that would make a reasonable person conclude that reddit is not a platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversaion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/36kiw5/reddits_political_moderation_is_harassment/">start of a discussion in undelete about political moderation</a> but it did not progress far.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to see you report it to the admin and see what they say in light of their policy.  You seem to have the ability to express the problem in a way that they may listen to you.  This isn&#39;t a simple ban .  They are tormenting you for expressing your ideas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Has anyone looked through OP&#39;s comment history? He talks a lot about race and has certainly posted some comments that some may interpret as racist: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>TIL that nations, races, and ethnicities have no right to want to keep their societies homogeneous and that they&#39;re racist when they don&#39;t cave to the demands of the diversity mob. There&#39;s nothing racist about wanting to live in a homogeneous society. Typically, it&#39;s White nations in the Western world that have diversity pushed on them but if you look around you&#39;ll notice that the diversity mob and the Left never demand diversity in non-White places.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because CNN does a shitty job at acting like they&#39;re not biased and pushing the liberal narrative. I think they would be better suited covering actual racial hate crimes like a pack of Black teenagers attempting to murder an innocent White Baltimore man amid the Baltimore riots. Won&#39;t hear about that on national news outlets because it ruins the &quot;Black people literally did nothing wrong unlike White people&quot; narrative that gets pushed relentlessly by our mainstream media. These &quot;teens&quot; have been charged with attempted murder yet a racial hate crime like this gets no media attention. Instead, CNN and our media need to create White-on-Black racial crimes out of nothing because our media is trash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think the police have said that they &quot;hunt&quot; black men. If they look at them with suspicion it is because Black males comprise about 6 percent of America&#39;s population but commit about a third of the nation&#39;s crime. The incarceration rate for Black males is about seven times higher than that of White males. Would it be wrong for airport screeners and the TSA to look at Muslim or Middle-Eastern passengers with increased suspicion given the climate of terrorism in today&#39;s world?</p>

<p>Most of this stuff is borderline, but I would imagine that OP has deleted the stuff he doesn&#39;t want people to see. Let&#39;s take this with a grain of salt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey Exile. Long time fan here. And as someone who has been in your position let me explain why this happened to you.</p>

<p>You are a victim of your own success. A quick look at your profile shows that you are an excellent writer. You use sources. You summarize them in a rational way. You make persuasive arguments etc... Most people would think that is exactly what a site that is suppose to be &quot;a discussion board&quot; needs.&quot; And they would be right. The fact that you have six years of reddit gold gifted to you clearly indicates that the users of reddit appreciate your contributions.</p>

<p>However, you argue and persuade for the wrong opinions. I don&#39;t mean as in objectively wrong. But simply out of sync with what powermods like davidreiss666 are willing to tolerate. </p>

<p>You are a immigration skeptic. You criticize feminism. You bring attention to violent black on white crime. You coined &quot;the fappening.&quot; You are an apologist for free speech and anti-censorship. You are basically the Captain of Team Shitlord. And that is all it takes.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you follow the rules of the subreddits that you post in. It doesn&#39;t matter that you argue and debate in an open and forthright manner. Your positions are unpalatable to people like davidreiss666 and agentlame. You are simply to good at criticizing their beliefs to be allowed to continue to post.</p>

<p>Years ago reddit was an open discussion platform and debates raged. Rebuttals and arguments flowed and the karma didn&#39;t matter. Then slowly but surely the usual suspects realized that open debate doesn&#39;t serve their purpose because they usually lose. Censorship is much more effective. Now the majority of popular subreddits are simply sanitized of controversial topics and comments by mods who believe that they know what is best. And what should and shouldn&#39;t be discussed. It sucks. And it is literally the cancer that is killing reddit. You are just the latest casualty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You used immature personal attacks towards another user. You also tried to argue that 11 year olds can consent to sex with adults. You&#39;re just not the type of person we want on our sub. Whether you agree with our reasoning or not is kind of irrelevant anyway, as you can see our sidebar clearly states:</p>

<p>WARNING: We might ban you just because we feel like it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you listed happened after I was banned with the exclusion of a personal attack, which was a retaliation and I can show that.</p>

<p>I actually defended myself from a personal attack by another user, he said fuck me for something I didn&#39;t do and I respond with &quot;Your stupid too I guess cause that&#39;s not what I said in anyway&quot;.  What I pointed out was that 11 year olds have sex with 11 year olds, not adults. I also pointed out that the cops thought that the kid consented with adults. Go back and look at the sub that got me banned, You guys have never even deleted it and I took screenshots just now in case you try to pull a fast one.  I also have screenshots of the very immature way you and the rest of the mods responded to me when I asked why I was banned.</p>

<p>Regardless of wether you want me on your sub or not I may already be back there, you guys aren&#39;t exactly the fore leading group on internet security.</p>

<p>I brought it up here because It was relevant, and I still stand by my statement, your logic is flawed for the subreddit in question and cheapens the Negareddit, since it&#39;s purpose to be a place for unpopular opinion.  Showing me your trump card rule of we can ban you because we disagree doesn&#39;t really make that change, your moderations of Negareddit is flawed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even caught up on it like I said it was relevant here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is why I visit reddit less and less. It&#39;s become a shithole for weird, control freak shills to get off on power trips. I have no idea why reddit allows it to continue, except that they are corporate owned and must be getting paid by a group of parties interested in controlling mass media, ever since reddit got popular. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad. Reddit had the potential to be a great site. But I get turned off almost every time I come here anymore. It&#39;s just a circle-jerk of extremely closed-minded people maskerading as liberals. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a <em>very</em> liberal thinker in many ways, and I find the brigading, whining, power tripping idiots (mostly SJWs) who have no purpose in life but to preach weird victimhood on social media like it&#39;s a badge of honor - disgusting. They aren&#39;t liberal. They are more like fascists - there&#39;s <em>one</em> way to think, their&#39;s, or you get brigaded, banned, etc. </p>

<p>It sucks to me that it ruined a potentially good site, but I laugh at the fact that these losers spend their entire day acting like 14 year olds. They probably are - I can&#39;t imagine any of them have a life resembling that of an adult. </p>

<p>Oh, well. There&#39;s a lot of sites out there better than reddit. It will be in the realm of myspace, livejournal, and AOL sites soon. They and 4chan can circlejerk one another about how they took over sites and turned them to shit, while the rest of us go have lives and have long forgotten whoever they are and whatever they did. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad this sub is at least a place where the idea of free speech is still taken seriously. You&#39;ll notice that the places where free speech is respected thrive. And places where control freaking is rampant disappear pretty quickly. </p>

<p>Sorry about the bans. You know you can just create another username and keep on using those subs if you have any desire. If they start shadowbanning you or something, just use a VPN or Tor or whatever and do the same thing - that is, if you give a shit at all about watching those places crumble and fail. </p>

If they actually attempt to bring their bullshit to the hundreds of hate subs on reddit it&#39;s like poking a hornet&#39;s nest with a stick and there will be backlash. By doing it to a nobody (no offense) not affiliated with a hate sub they get this miniscule victory with zero repercussions. It&#39;s just stroking their own ego.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we have come full circle. </p>

<p>The Digg kids left Digg because the admins realized popular vote is a terrible way to build a community when 15 year old are dictating the parameters of the discussion. Digg tried to empower superusers to proactively keep the house in order. Reddit tried handle the influx by empowering mods and splintering the community by removing the front page. </p>

<p>This has created the problem for Reddit that all the Digg kids were afraid would happen there...because they all came to Reddit! Of course, it&#39;s not even 99% of the users fault. It&#39;s the 1%...or in this case, two guys.</p>

<p>Some solutions I see:</p>

<p>. Remove the motivation for abuse of mod powers by removing user moderated subreddits from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> and other advertising like trending.</p>

<p>. Once above a certain threshold (ex. top 5% of subreddits), moderators may no longer be anonymous and have to be vetted by Reddit Corp. in as transparent a way as is responsible. Something along the lines of a job interview.</p>

<p>. Continue the splinter path and remove static mods. Make everyone a mod, and allow people to choose who moderates their favorite subreddits. The end result would be that, for example, the  <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> front page could look very different for users depending on their moderator choices. </p>

<p>Reddit is essentially an internet forum and internet forum posts have never really changed anything in the history of the world.

special. It used to stand for free speech. A place where the voice in the crowd could be heard if it had something valuable to say. But inevitably another website will be created. One that is better than what reddit has become, a place that stands for uncensored honest opinions. Even though it too may fall, so shall the cycle repeat. And hopefully free speech shall prevail.</p>

Look at how these people responded.  If that isn&#39;t a bunch of adolescents, that&#39;s sad,. what a shameful way for adults to act.

<p>Where can we go next?  There&#39;s one of these posts like every week, and I&#39;m sure this happens ALL the time and doesn&#39;t get posted about. Not like making new accounts and scrubbing IP is hard, as if anyone we take seriously actually gives a fuck about karma.</p>

<p>I&#39;m done with reddit. I&#39;m done with manchildren default mods, I&#39;m done with the fucking nonsense arbitrary rules in most subs.  It&#39;s time for something new. The admins and mods finally achieved their apparent ultimate goal of smashing Reddit&#39;s nuts with a hammer so it&#39;s a completely tame, neutered, sanitized place with no good discussion about anything. Just one massive circlejerk that all follows the same approved narrative.  Better make sure the topic you wanna talk about is on the approved list of circlejerks.  Whole topics can be removed, thousands of hours of people working on posts to submit.  Why post? What&#39;s next?  Reddit is fucking done, people.  These days reddit is less a news aggregator and more of an advertising aggregator, and thats the way the admins want it anyways.  Welcome to fucking Digg 2, folks.  This is indeed cancer, and it&#39;s terminal.  If we don&#39;t do some kind of invasive operation and remove these fucking disgusting, malignant, toxic, tumors, Reddit will die a slow painful death. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been pretty outspoken about my disgust for reddit and its censorship, but I&#39;m having a hard time being sympathetic in your case. Further, you&#39;re a troll. Half of your comment history&#39;s first page is three word insults and idiotic drivel.  You claim to not be racist, but based on your comment history, it appears to me that you are biased in saying so. Being targeted for a dissenting opinion is one thing, but you have a clear racial bent and you apparently can&#39;t at least be honest about it, furthering my belief you&#39;re nothing more than a troll. True racists can at least be honest about it, but whitewashing it is the oldest trick in the troll book. You deserve your banning. Make another account if it bothers you so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept of a Shadowban or whatever as I saw someone point out awhile back is the truest form of being a coward.</p>

<p>I assumed this site would have learned from the Gamegate incident that trying to conceal and hide things instead propels it like an atomic bomb, no truer example I could think of was that two weeks of something that would have faded instead because the center point of 3 months of conversation topics in multiple websites.</p>

<p>Reddit these days really needs some serious overhauling and management working, Bias will always exist but the current management is so biased towards these bizzare social crusades that exist to only cause anger and stir up problems.</p>

<p>Yet... I think that&#39;s kind of why it&#39;s set up this way, more clicks to random websites, more money in pockets. All in all I believe the answer to Reddit being such a cesspool as the time went on is the oldest answer in the book.</p>

<p>Money.</p>

<li><p>Who cares if you think his comment history is racist, that&#39;s not the point, and bringing it up here edges on a huge <em>ad hominem</em>. He could he could a card carrying member of the KKK, that still doesn&#39;t justify what happened to him. Banning from one sub? That&#39;s a bit of a gray area. Banning from 400? That&#39;s turning the alleged racist into a victim. You don&#39;t fight bad speech with mod abuse and power tripping, you fight it with more speech, with a ban as the last resort rather than the first. </p></li>

<p>I&#39;m telling people. These power (tripping) mods, enabled by the corrupt SJW admins will destroy this site, little by little, piece by piece. And it&#39;ll be sad. I&#39;m unbelievably fed up this kind of shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you noticed you come off as highly racist.</p>

<p>Tons of white fuckers don&#39;t pay taxes every year. Why single out All Sharpton? Fuck taxes anyway. Government don&#39;t know how to spend my money.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if black on white violence was a problem. Just look at all the diversity of violent people. Mostly they&#39;ve all got one thing in common:
Less than their wealthy neighbors who practice lawful violence.</p>

<p>I agree that reddit is dead. </p>

<p>You come across as highly racist. Racism isn&#39;t popular on reddit. At least it wasn&#39;t. Good luck with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typical cowardly, subversive and deceitful leftist behavior, I expect nothing less from them honestly.</p>

<p>You cannot allow critical thinking to break through your delusional construction of reality so you amass power and influence in order to ban and censor any opposing and alternate viewpoints. It is the hallmark of a leftist to censor and silence instead of engage in debate and explain your actions and opinions in an honest way, because anything that challenges their ideology is immediately a threat as it could poke holes and expose fallacies in their fragmented worldview - especially in regards to what is happening in Europe right now, and what the future of Europe entails if it is not stopped. That is why so many people get banned from <a href="/r/europe">/r/europe</a>, the mods seem hellbent on enforcing the leftist viewpoint, and I&#39;m honestly not surprised that they do the same for other subs they control as well.</p>

<p>Honestly this whole funny situation reminds me of the marxist &quot;long march through the institutions&quot;, where throughout the 1960&#39;s leftists and communist subversives were slowly but surely acquiring power and spreading their single ideology across a broad spectrum of American institutions (academia, media, science, literature, education, politics, etc) subverting and slowly censoring and pushing out the opposing traditional ideologies. Well that seems to be what has happened now to reddit in a similar sense.</p>

<p>One can ask what is the point of browsing a sub where the leftist ideology, thriving only on shaky foundations and great delusion supported by extreme censorship and leftist authoritarianism is the only ideology allowed? It&#39;s childish and dishonorable to the extreme. Reddit is not the only site where you see this kind of oppressive censorship of any viewpoints that challenge the &quot;progressive&quot; left, neogaf also comes to mind.</p>

<p>It is of great concern how this many subreddits are under the control of such a small group of mods, censoring and banning with abandon, corrupt and cowardly. In my view reddit needs to break up this mod monopoly - limit severely the amount of subreddits one is able to mod. Otherwise if only one viewpoint/ideology is enforced over such a broad spectrum of subreddits there can be no free speech and honest inquiry at all. And why such childish and obviously dishonest behavior has been allowed to persist for so long is of great mystery to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit needs a spring cleaning, perma ban all current mods and start fresh, if they did nothing wrong, let them fight for their old post back, in which they have to explain why the deserve it, and these appeals should be public with polls to vote in their favor or lack thereof. It will give them a taste of their own medicine. This should be done every couple of years to prevent corruption.</p>

<p>Another way to do it is to have redditors vote their own mods in, any potential mod candidate must submit a public statement why they deserve to be a mod and have users vote whether he/she should or should not be a mod, and every year the actions of this mod should be made aware publicly to be peer reviewed, if he/she his found to be a good mod, he/she will stay, if not, he/she&#39;s off the mod team forever.</p>

<p>And it goes without saying that noone should be a mod of more than one subreddit, because, realistically, how can you expect one person to successfully moderate more than one at a time?</p>

<p>That&#39;s because you broke their sub rules though, one of which is no fat sympathy. They have 0 tolerance for any argument or post that leans towards fat sympathy. I got banned from FPH but I did have it coming, for breaking that rule. Haha. </p>

<p>At least their mods enforce their rules quite consistently, and they don&#39;t go banning people from other subreddits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason that you have been banned, obviously, is for the shitstorm that you tend to leave in your wake. You are a deeply racist person. You are profoundly toxic to every community, and they obviously have the right to ban you, and even though you are &quot;entitled&quot; to your opinion, your opinion is not original, and no one is missing out when you are deprived of your privilege to share it.</p>

<p>More specifically, I read your example posts, and you seem to have two theses.</p>

<p>The first seems to stem from the idea political correctness has gone too far. This would not cause a shitstorm on its own. It&#39;s probably true. The conclusion that draw, however, is that the solution to this problem is to simply reinstitute racism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is literally no crime committed by a black person in America that will make the media talk about racial issues in a way where black people are being criticized. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Your second thesis is somehow more hypocritical. In which you point out that Islamic, or secular ideology is toxic, and should be treated as such, but then choose to make this VERY POST defending yourself by saying that it does not matter if YOUR ideology is toxic. As long as it is popular, you should be allowed to share it indiscriminately. </p>

<p>Pick one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I was rooting for OP until I started reading the kind of stuff he rights. But that&#39;s my problem to deal with, as a Muslim. I still think he was treated unjustly. I don&#39;t know if I can call him a common racists for sure, since he presents his arguments in a cohesive fashion. I liked reading his posts and though I hated the blatant generalizations (unbecoming of how he writes), but I don&#39;t see why discussion promoting cohesive posts that beg the opposite view point to bring their A game should be banned and or deleted. This gives the poster she his views more credibility then it deserves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno, I think I reserve the right to ban provably wrong posters if they are going to dominate the discussion, and have demonstrated an inability to change their minds. </p>

<p>The problem is that anyone who wants to agree with OP will, regardless of accuracy because he <em>seems</em> well researched. Discrediting him in a subcomment is not sufficient, because it is less visible, and it does not force OP to retract his comment. Other readers inherit his stubbornness, and the propaganda spreads.</p>

<p>OP is an infectious disease, and should be handled with pragmatism. His &quot;freedom of speech&quot; just means that the community is responsible for silencing him, since the government is not allowed to. </p>

Personally I wouldn&#39;t want someone like you around me, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s unfair that someone also decided this and stopped you from being around them.

Freedom of speech, as in the USA&#39;s Bill of Rights, is freedom to criticize the government and be free of jail time. It&#39;s hilarious how many people want to say dumb shit then get mad at the back lash because they don&#39;t understand the right they try to hide behind. </p>

<p>This is not a supposition on my part, I was approached several times by an unnamed hardware manufacturer.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. After reading this tread and a few referenced threads I was becoming a little disillusioned. </p>

<p>I joined Reddit a few years ago and recently returned. The main attraction being that the community were the main driving force behind what was promoted... how wrong I was.</p>

<p>You pointed me toward Voat and their philosophy seems more to my liking. I know its not a be-all utopia but nothing is perfect. However, I&#39;m voting with my feet. </p>

<p>Goodbye Reddit. Hello Voat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like you were onto something interesting but kind of lost the thread with the idea that companies are setting people up for blackmail. I have no doubt that has happened, just like I have no doubt that people in positions of &quot;power&quot; on internet boards sell their influence, but I firmly believe that the vast majority of the time, it&#39;s just people who earnestly believe a certain thing. After all, someone needs to be paying those shills to advance a viewpoint, and the raison d&#39;etre of shills is to convince other people of an idea. For instance, the OP might be a Stormfront troll, he might be someone who bought into the idea of white supremacy from stuff he read from Stormfront trolls on here, or he might just be a random person who signed up here and happens to believe that BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s anyone willing to call out bigotry when they see it. Especially recently, here one reddit, ever since stormfront (Internet&#39;s largest white supremacist forum) started brigading and reddit got more popular. Educated folks became less of a majority here and bigots have made some headway.</p>

<p>SJW is the new term, stands for social justice warrior, and is used as a derogatory slur for anyone who criticizes the racist comments of people like good old OP here </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole reddit situation depresses me when I think about it&#39;s implications on real life power and control. </p>

<p>If a mod gets off on the power and control they receive from a WEBSITE, treats those with differing view points with disdain, and does so with the help of like-minded &quot;power hungry&quot; mods in a figurative cigar smoke-filled backroom... (for no real reason I might add)</p>

<p>Then I can only assume when people have power IRL, the average citizen is fucked, lied to, and manipulated beyond belief. And probably doesn&#39;t know it. Again for... what reason? Control freaks man. </p>
