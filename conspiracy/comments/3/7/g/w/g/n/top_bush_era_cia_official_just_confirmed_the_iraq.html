        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://theantimedia.org/cia-official-just-confirmed-iraq-war-based-on-lies/">From The Anti-Media:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Twelve years after George W Bush initiated the illegal invasion of Iraq, ostensibly under the premise of preemptive self-defense, a stark <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm">majority</a> — as many as 75% in 2014 — feel the so-called war was a mistake. </p>

<p>As evidence rapidly accumulates that Bush’s yearning to launch an aggressive attack was likelier due to a personal grudge than anything else, that number will surely swell. </p>

<p>This past Tuesday, the former president’s intelligence briefer lent yet more plausibility to that theory in an interview on MSNBC’s Hardball, making an admission that the Bush White House misrepresented intelligence reports to the public on key issues.</p>

<p>Michael Morell’s stint with the CIA included deputy and acting director, but during the time preceding the US invasion of Iraq, he helped prepare daily intelligence briefings for Bush. One of those briefings, from October 2002, is an infamous example in intelligence history as how not to compile a report. </p>

<p><a href="https://www2.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB129/nie.pdf">This National Intelligence Estimate,</a> titled “Iraq’s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction”, was the ostensibly flawed intelligence cited continuously by Bush supporters as justification to pursue a war of aggression against Iraq. </p>

<p>However, this claim is dubious at best, and serves more as a smokescreen to lend credence to a president who was otherwise hellbent on revenge against Saddam Hussein, as evidenced in his <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/27/bush.war.talk/">statement</a> a month before the report, “After all, this is the guy who tried to kill my dad.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.com/hardball/watch/fmr-cia-deputy-director-grilled-on-iraq-war-447888451643">In the Hardball interview,</a> host Chris Matthews asked Morell about Cheney’s notorious statement in 2003: “We know he [Saddam Hussein] has been absolutely devoted to trying to acquire nuclear weapons. And we believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons.” The following is the conversation that ensued:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MATTHEWS: Was that true?</p>

<p>MORELL: We were saying—</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: Can you answer that question? Was that true?</p>

<p>MORELL: That’s not true.</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: Well, why’d you let them get away with it?</p>

<p>MORELL: Look, my job Chris—</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: You’re the briefer for the president on intelligence, you’re the top person to go in and tell him what’s going on. You see Cheney make this charge he’s got a nuclear bomb and then they make subsequent charges he knew how to deliver it…and nobody raised their hand and said, “No that’s not what we told him.”</p>

<p>MORELL: Chris, Chris Chris, what’s my job, right? My job—</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: To tell the truth.</p>

<p>MORELL: My job—no, as the briefer? As the briefer?</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: Okay, go ahead.</p>

<p>MORELL: As the briefer, my job is to carry CIA’s best information and best analysis to the president of the United States and make sure he understands it. My job is to not watch what they’re saying on TV.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Discussion continued:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MATTHEWS: So you’re briefing the president on the reasons for war, they’re selling the war, using your stuff, saying you made that case when you didn’t. So they’re using your credibility to make the case for war dishonestly, as you just admitted.</p>

<p>MORELL: Look, I’m just telling you—</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: You just admitted it.</p>

<p>MORELL: I’m just telling you what we said—</p>

<p>MATTHEWS: They gave a false presentation of what you said to them.</p>

<p>MORELL: On some aspects. On some aspects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the host pushed just a little further:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MATTHEWS: That’s a big deal! Do you agree? If they claimed they had a [nuclear] weapon, when you know they didn’t.</p>

<p>MORELL: It’s a big deal. It’s a big deal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He’s absolutely right, of course, and even further to that point, Morell made another admission of a direct misrepresentation: “What they were saying about the link between Iraq and Al Qaeda publicly was not what the intelligence community” had found. “I think they were trying to make a stronger case for the war.”  The administration had to do this, considering no such case existed. </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Cheney’s statement directly conflicts with what the <a href="https://www2.gwu.edu/%7Ensarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB129/nie.pdf">NIE actually stated,</a> which is that the intelligence community only found a “[lack of] persuasive evidence that Baghdad has launched a coherent effort to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program.” </p>

<p>This is in line with the <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/statements/status-nuclear-inspections-iraq">International Atomic Energy Agency report</a> that came to the same conclusion: “[W]e have to date found no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear weapons program.”</p>

<p>All of this solidifies what former <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/sep/16/iraq.iraq">UN Secretary General Kofi Annan resolutely stated</a> about the US invasion of Iraq in 2004: “I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter. From our point of view and from the charter point of view it was illegal.”</p>

<p>The question most deserving an answer, and increasingly posed by the populace at large: If George W Bush, Dick Cheney, and others in the administration, deliberately misled the public on false pretenses, directly contradicted intelligence information through misrepresentation, and ultimately initiated a wholly illegal invasion of Iraq that led to the deaths of well over 1 million civilian, non-combatants; WHY have they not been charged with war crimes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only reason they haven&#39;t been charged with war crimes is the only one that fits the situation: They are above the rule of law. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really sad to think that people will still believe <em>anything</em> the media tries to tell them, when they have found to be complicit so many times. People continue to pretend they haven&#39;t, continue to ignore the complications American businesses put on the rest of the world, and continue to get irrationally emotional at criticisms of the roots of these issues.</p>

<p>Some MBMC&#39;s have a GDP in excess of some nations, and I don&#39;t mean 3rd world nations. They have representation in legislature that is <em>more equal</em> than yours or mine. They have &quot;private security forces&quot; or the capitol to finance PMCs. And soon here in the states they&#39;ll have the ability to sue governments for effecting their profits.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think people are going to be able to justify that &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot; thought for much longer.</p>

<p>Yes, they are above the law, they know they would be pardoned by Obama or whoever else is in office.  This has always been the undertone argument of the conversation with charging them with war crimes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t completely disagree but you overlook the significant social issues that the left of center party ensures Americans have. If the right of center party had complete control we would be a christian caliphate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too bad Chris Matthews was too busy jizzing all over his sound stage for Bush and the Iraq War from 2002-2005.  </p>

<p>&quot;And that&#39;s the president [Bush] looking very much like a jet, you know, a high-flying jet star. A guy who is a jet pilot. Has been in the past when he was younger, obviously...He won the war. He was an effective commander. Everybody recognizes that, I believe, except a few critics...He&#39;s like Eisenhower. He looks great in a military uniform. He looks great in that cowboy costume he wears when he goes West.&quot; -- <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/04/27/mission-accomplished-a-look-back-at-the-medias/135513">Matthews masturbating with Ann Coulter to images of W landing on the USS Abraham Lincoln and declaring Mission Accomplished in 2003</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;If his gamble that he can create a democracy in the middle of the Arab world and he does it, he belongs on Mount Rushmore.&quot; -- <a href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2005/12/20/matthews-felt-sensitive-with-bush-its-like-sant/134493">Matthews still masturbating to the Iraq War in late 2005</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;I like him [W]. Everybody sort of likes the president, except for the real whack-jobs, maybe on the left -- I mean -- like him personally.&quot; -- <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2005/11/28/first-odonnell-now-matthews-everybody-sort-of-l/134301">Opposition to Empire was cramping Matthews heavy masturbation habit in 2005</a>. </p>

<p>&quot;You know, I felt sensitive. I was with him last night, the president [W]. We all went to see the president. You were there -- went to see the president for our Christmas. You get your picture taken with him. It&#39;s like Santa Claus, and he&#39;s always very generous and friendly...And I was wearing a red scarf. And I wanted to look a little bit festive for the occasion, look a little preppy. And he came up to me and said, &#39;Matthews, I didn&#39;t know you were that preppy.&#39;...I felt like I was too towel-snappy with him. I felt he deserves a little -- I mean, he deserves a lot of respect for this bet he&#39;s making.&quot;  -- <a href="http://mediamatters.org/video/2005/12/20/matthews-felt-sensitive-with-bush-its-like-sant/134493">The fap for war was strong in this one</a>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt that Matthews&#39; erection for Bush and the Iraq War was long and hard (to defend).  It even earned him <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2005/12/23/chris-matthews-2005s-misinformer-of-the-year/134530">the dubious honor of being named Media Matters&#39; &quot;Misinformer of the Year&quot; in 2005</a> -- joining an elite group of journalists like Bill O&#39;Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Sarah Palin, Glenn Beck, and Rupert Murdoch.  Matthews erection for war may have gone a little flaccid.  But, I doubt it will take the next Bush or Hillary very long to perk this pecker back up.  He&#39;s an Inside-the-Beltway acolyte that worships the pageantry and pomp of Empire.  </p>

<p>The question most deserving an answer, and increasingly posed by the populace at large: If George W Bush, Dick Cheney, and others in the administration, deliberately misled the public on false pretenses, directly contradicted intelligence information through misrepresentation, and ultimately initiated a wholly illegal invasion of Iraq that led to the deaths of well over 1 million civilian, non-combatants; WHY have they not been charged with war crimes?</p>

<p>Excuse me sir, your naivety is showing. You don&#39;t seem to comprehend the &#39;Yah, we did it, fuck you - what&#39;re you gonna do about it?&#39; attitude that prevails in our ruling class in our modern society. They&#39;re really not into covering up their foibles. They&#39;re more about &#39;See, you can&#39;t stop us&#39;.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com">www.democraticunderground.com</a></p>

<p>&quot;Falsifying intelligence to start a war is a war crime under International Law. The German war trials of the 1940&#39;s established that falsifying intelligence to Start a war is a war crime.
