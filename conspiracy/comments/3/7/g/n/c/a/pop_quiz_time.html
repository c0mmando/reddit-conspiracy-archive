    <div class="md"><p>Obvious the one with no building in the way. This is reflected in reality as well. The twin towers did not collapse at freefall speed... you can see free-falling debris falling faster than the collapse in any video for one.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question. Have you ever bothered showing this to a qualified professional in person? Maybe a physics or engineering professor in your area? You know, someone qualified that can explain these complicated processes to you? I say in person, because it is a lot harder to discount people as shills when you have to look them in the eye.</p>

<p>Edit: regarding my comment you inexplicably decided to cite, I stand by my position, although I&#39;ll admit to using a bit of hyperbole. I think most 911 truth theories are pretty silly (your linked material being an obvious example), but certainly not the stupidest things I&#39;ve come across. </p>

<p>Objective tests require a user to choose or provide a response to a question whose correct answer is predetermined. The buildings fell at roughly the same rate as free-fall. It&#39;s rather obvious why you can&#39;t answer the question correctly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there should be no option for &quot;roughly the same time&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s because it&#39;s the correct answer and you can&#39;t admit you have no other explanation that fits the description of events. Controlled demolition is the only explanation.</p>

<p>On 9.11 we were told that the block on the left fell through the path of greatest resistance at <strong>nearly the same rate it would have taken to fall through air.</strong></p>

<p>In the same comment. Wow.</p>

<p>The answer is A. No debate. If we look at the laughably unscientific &quot;roughly&quot; description it is too vague to be valid, as in this scenario A hits first every single time, So that description of C doesn&#39;t work in the context of the questions.</p>

<p>I get the point you are trying (poorly) to make. But this question doesn&#39;t demonstrate that. You would want a question like &quot;how much sooner does the piece on the right hit the ground?&quot;. Then the answer could surprise people based on how fast the tower with all that visible resistance collapsed.</p>

<p>Of course, my answer to that question would be, &quot;it depends on various factors including weight of the upper portion, resistance provided by the floors below (blueprints/floorplans/calculations required), kinetic energy generated from the collapse initiation etc.&quot; So even then, this silly little flawed logical trap only works on those who have already decided that 9/11 was an inside job. This quiz attempts to reduce a complicated process to the point of irrelevance. It is pointless.</p>

<p>Now, rather than endure another exercise of you hearing what you want hear in my comment followed by me correcting your twisting of my words yet again, I&#39;ll end this conversation now.</p>

<p>You may have dodged my question about actually consulting an expert entirely, but I can say with relatively certainly That I doubt you&#39;ve ever even tried. Why don&#39;t you give it a try. Ask someone honest questions in person and see what happens</p>

<p>Damn, I&#39;ve been found out.</p>

<p>I work for Illuminaughty. I have been tasked with having discussions on unpopular threads on niche internet forums, in order to prevent the truth of 9/11 from coming out. Now that I&#39;ve been discovered, I may as well reveal the truth to you now.
George W. Bush commissioned a team of Mossad Agents to fill the buildings with anti-matter bombs. This is the only way free-fall collapse is attainable. The controlled demolition theories are a red herring. Anyone supporting those theories is a shill, most likely employed by the JIDF. If they state otherwise, that is further proof of their shillness.
The reasons for the attack aren&#39;t what you think though. It wasn&#39;t about getting to the Middle East for oil, the real reason was far more sinister.</p>

<p>Back in the 1970&#39;s, Bin Laden organized a raid on Area 51, capturing alien technology and hiding it among the mountains of Afganistan. This was used as leverage for generations, as the Americans couldn&#39;t let the truth out to the world. If the rest of the world found out that they hid first contact in order to harvest their technology, there would be outrage. All world events America was involved in were at OBL&#39;s beck and call. They planned 911 to discredit him, and destroyed the evidence by bombing the mountains, until the pretense that OBL was hiding in a cave.

<p>I&#39;m not posting it because I&#39;m not the one pushing it as a valid argument. If you were to post it you could discuss its relevance with actual experts! What is stopping you?</p>

<p>If you were sure of yourself, you would take the leap. But you&#39;re hesitating. That says a lot about your railroading technique. You won&#39;t even try to prove you&#39;re right!</p>

<p>You stalk and harass me but can&#39;t follow through on your <em>great idea.</em> That&#39;s about right for a debunker of your caliber.</p>

<p>Edit: also, go to ask engineers, I posted it. I wont link because I dont want to invite a brigade. I&#39;d ask that you refrain as well.</p>

<p>Hello, <strong>I&#39;m a skeptic</strong> when it comes to this sort of thing, but I&#39;ve seen this quiz getting passed around in conspiracy circles regarding 9/11. <strong>(I know you all must be sick of this!).</strong> I challenged the legitimacy of the quiz to a particularly committed user and they pushed me to post it here and get a more expert opinion. If you are interested, could you take a look and evaluate?</p>

<p>I figure there is no better place to either confirm my problems with it or tell me that the truthers got this one right!</p>

<p>I apologize to the mods if I broke any rules, and I understand if <strong>you all are sick of questions like this</strong> or <strong>don&#39;t want to risk inviting an r/conspiracy brigade</strong>. Like I said, any input is appreciated!</p>

<p>(Edit: If I&#39;m being honest <strong>I&#39;m actually embarassed to post this.</strong> Given the arguments that quiz makes, I think this falls way below the paygrade of all you folks here. <strong>If it is inappropriate, let me know and I&#39;ll delete!)</strong></p>

<p>Damn, I&#39;ve been found out.</p>

<p>I work for Illuminaughty. I have been tasked with having discussions on unpopular threads on niche internet forums, in order to prevent the truth of 9/11 from coming out. Now that I&#39;ve been discovered, I may as well reveal the truth to you now.
George W. Bush commissioned a team of Mossad Agents to fill the buildings with anti-matter bombs. This is the only way free-fall collapse is attainable. The controlled demolition theories are a red herring. Anyone supporting those theories is a shill, most likely employed by the JIDF. If they state otherwise, that is further proof of their shillness.
The reasons for the attack aren&#39;t what you think though. It wasn&#39;t about getting to the Middle East for oil, the real reason was far more sinister.</p>

<p>Back in the 1970&#39;s, Bin Laden organized a raid on Area 51, capturing alien technology and hiding it among the mountains of Afganistan. This was used as leverage for generations, as the Americans couldn&#39;t let the truth out to the world. If the rest of the world found out that they hid first contact in order to harvest their technology, there would be outrage. All world events America was involved in were at OBL&#39;s beck and call. They planned 911 to discredit him, and destroyed the evidence by bombing the mountains, until the pretense that OBL was hiding in a cave.
Open your eyes, Sheeple.</p>
