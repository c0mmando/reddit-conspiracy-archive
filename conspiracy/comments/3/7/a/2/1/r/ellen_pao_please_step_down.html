Because lets be honest 2-3 years from now there will be no place for subreddits like r/conspiracy on reddit. Personally i think theres a large amount of reddit users who are looking through this subreddit so starting the dialouge here would be nice. I think we have a significant amount of power in this subreddit so i think we should use it to reach some short term goals rather than spend all our time talking about how government is bad etc etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll eat shit for this as always, but this is such an obvious distraction. Ellen Pao suing whomever or promising &quot;safe&quot; discussion doesn&#39;t make a lick of difference to the site. &quot;Safe&quot; spaces already exist in the form of moderated subreddits. Plus, she hasn&#39;t actually done anything concrete yet, and really the damage to reddit had been done before she ever stepped in. Defaults and mass influx have filled the site with inane content, and corporate meddling can simply be done through sockpuppet astroturfing, as we&#39;ve seen time and time again. It&#39;s just not cost-effective to target the leadership when reddit itself is so exploitable.</p>

<p>Also I think most of the rage fomented against her is misinformed, but that&#39;s really irrelevant honestly -- I just think it&#39;s pointless when the site itself has so many numerous, non-Pao-related problems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, if people are going to fall to the ground screaming they&#39;ve been subject to total fascism, they should be able to explain why.</p>

<p>Because I think that&#39;s what Reddit is probably talking about: you won&#39;t be able to threaten people with rape, or violence, or hound them around the site for weeks on end. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they are going to start deleting all the accounts of everyone who likes Ron Paul. </p>

<p>I understand: The victim mentality is <em>central</em> to the worldview of a certain kind of person. And it&#39;s just not nearly as interesting if it turns out that Reddit&#39;s new &quot;safe space&quot; thing is totally benign. So let&#39;s go with &quot;OMG IT&#39;S A POLICE STATE!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest: There&#39;s a tiny number of people who <em>really do believe</em> that Reddit and the entire world are run by a band of evil monsters who intend to enslave us, any minute! And everything that happens at Reddit, or at CNN, or at Harvard University, or at the Federal Reserve, is all part of a plan carefully woven by The Evil People. </p>

<p>So if that&#39;s what you think? Then yeah, OF COURSE Reddit&#39;s new policy is part of a plot to lead us all into FEMA camps. </p>

<p>These are the angry remnants of the Confederacy; the descendants of the white conservatives who stood in the way of Civil Rights, who have blocked progress at every stage of America&#39;s development. They infest the very fabric of the nation, and we won&#39;t really be able to realize our potential as a nation until we find some way to defeat them completely. Unfortunately, they are cultivated and fertilized by billions of dollars from rich people and corporations, and fed a steady diet of bullshit by an array of propaganda outlets ranging from Fox News to talk radio to the ten thousand and one right-wing web sites.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The title can (and often does) remove context, too. For example, here&#39;s the full quote, emphasis preserved:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The question is whether it would make them fear for their safety, or the safety of those around them or where it makes them feel like it&#39;s not a safe platform. Somebody expressing ideas that aren&#39;t consistent with everybody&#39;s views is something that we encourage. There are certain posts that do make people feel unsafe, that people feel threatened or they feel that their family or friends or people near them are going to be unsafe, and those are the specific things that we are focused on today.</p>

<p><strong>It&#39;s not our site&#39;s goal to be a completely free-speech platform.</strong> We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious by &quot;completely free-speech&quot; she means allowing people to throw actual threats around. The only parts of this article that refer to controversial parts of reddit are written by the paper itself, not her.</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m surprised that an online news service would take something out of context (and make it the damn headline for the whole article) for extra clicks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit already is censored, though. You can&#39;t post literal threats against people, you can&#39;t post personal information, you can&#39;t post trade secrets, code that breaks the site, and in a lot of subs you can&#39;t even advertise.</p>

<p>I like her, she&#39;s in the impossible position of trying to balance the wishes of the user-base with those of the shareholders. All websites sell out eventually - even Anandtech and TomsHardware have recently sold out to the same company.</p>

<p>She&#39;s probably the best friend we have in the boardroom, so please let&#39;s just cut her a little slack.</p>
