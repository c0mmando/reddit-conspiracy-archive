For which I was attacked by <a href="/u/Mae-Brussell-Hustler">/u/Mae-Brussell-Hustler</a>, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/37mfn6/i_figured_it_out_please_debunk_my_theory/crnwwkp">here</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/37mfn6/i_figured_it_out_please_debunk_my_theory/crnxaj8">here</a>. Minutes later, he made his <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/37mi1g/the_aroma_of_shillshimi_trollsciutto_is_stonger/">post</a> calling out the trolling in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. His post got more than twice as many comments as mine and more upvotes and was featured on the front page of this sub, while mine did not. TPTB know that we are a threat to them. The real &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; know that that is true. We can be sure that they are now gaming this sub to bury the truth, and distract us with their own &quot;conspiracy&quot; posts to lead us off course. I don&#39;t know any way out of this, but I just want to say that the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> movement is under heavy attack. The front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can no longer be trusted. </p>

<p>Be careful, your foes come disguised as friends. That&#39;s the way they manipulate you.</p>

<p>Wake up.</p>

<p>Above: &quot;You might find it hard to vocalize.&quot; I think you meant &quot;you might find it hard not to speak up.&quot; You are doing a poor job making yourself look trustworthy, or like an analytical mind worthy of attention.</p>

<p>You have an insanely paranoid persecution complex, and your theory makes no sense. It doesn&#39;t stand up to the very minimum of scientific scrutiny, while you would ask for an absurdly high burden of proof for any evidence to the contrary. Do you see how that&#39;s a problem? It&#39;s called &quot;confirmation bias.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a></p>

<p>I guess I don&#39;t expect you to do anything to read that or even consider anything other than your preconceived notions, because you seem a bit unhinged. A person makes a post with more comments than you, gets upvoted, and it can only be explained by a vast conspiracy by TPTB? </p>

<p>Do you really think you are that special, powerful, or worthy of attention? There are millions of people making the same crazy, unsubstantiated claims elsewhere. There doesn&#39;t need to be a psy-ops team to defeat you, because you already defeat yourself better than any paid shill ever could.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs are real. Why would there be a vast conspiracy involving hundreds of thousands of paid conspirators over hundreds of years, no leaks of information, no one sends documents of evidence to Wikileaks, etc? It&#39;s hard to keep a secret with three people, let alone hundreds of thousands over six or seven generations of humans.</p>

<p>The mental gymnastics you do are Olympic caliber, I&#39;ll give you that.</p>

<p>You have not tried to help anyone understand your point of view - you just expect people to take your word for it.

<p>TL;DR: The other poster has sincerely tried to help you understand his point of view, and you have not thought to return the favor. You get extremely defensive when anyone opposes you, which makes it extremely hard to take you seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, just because you are a fellow conspiracy theorist, it doesn&#39;t mean he should respect your opinion. The fringe elements of this subreddit make the entire movement look fucking nuts. You have no evidence for your claims, you can&#39;t write properly or in paragraphs, and I understand that you are not a native English speaker, but put in some effort. All cultures use paragraphs.</p>

<p>When posts like yours are around, it makes the legitimate lines of inquiry look absurd by association. A high person rambling is a benefit to no one. You have an absurd persecution complex, are incredibly defensive and combative, are quick to be offended, and your theory makes no sense in the first place. Even if it did, you have zero evidence other than &quot;THEY are lying to us, maaannnn!!!!1&quot;</p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy. For some people, pot can be very harmful to their psyche, especially for underlying psychiatric problems. Can&#39;t you see that such profound, far-reaching claims of a 200 year conspiracy involving hundreds of thousands of people over seven birth generations require some extraordinary proof?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need proof that Wikipedia is controlled? Then look up the 9/11 conspiracy page. Any fool will know that they wrote it in a tone to malign the so called conspiracy nutters. Any fool can see with their plain eyes that wikipedia is favoring the governments version of the story. In this neck of the woods, good old fashioned &quot;evidence&quot; doesn&#39;t cut it. It should be followed up with logic and sound judgement, something only your brain can do. Im sorry evidence doesn&#39;t suffice. If you are a &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;, you should have realized it by now. But it is clear, that you are here just to attack the people who want to raise important issues on this sub, with or without evidence, it doesn&#39;t matter. Its all a theory anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DUDE forget Wikipedia...you are not providing <strong>any</strong> evidence to back your claims, let alone a shady article from Wikipedia, or a credible Youtube video, or any kind of self-compiled research in any form. You&#39;re not giving anyone any kind of leverage to even start exploring your way of thinking. You are <strong>not</strong> using logic and sound judgement here...you cannot tell people the world is a certain way without a shred of evidence, and then try to forcefully tell them that you&#39;re right and they&#39;re wrong based on the assumption that nobody else besides you is using logic and sound judgement. </p>

<p>You sound like a fucking child, and I&#39;m convinced you&#39;re either too immature to be on the internet, or you&#39;re trolling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pardon me for having a look at your profile. I had to understand where you are coming from. If you still believe ISS is what we are told to believe, you might want to do some more research. Particularly look at the anomalies in the iss tours on YouTube. Maybe you will begin to wonder. If not, just ignore this post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DNA doesn&#39;t prove that, neither are some unidentified bones/rock formation proof of dinosaurs as how we know them to be. All these &quot;theories&quot; have been carefully concocted to perpetuate the evolution myth, that humans and this world isn&#39;t really that special. None of us are loved by a higher power. Our lives are really not that important.</p>

<p>This is all systematic brainwashing via &quot;science&quot; and the &quot;education&quot; aka brainwashing system.</p>

<p>If you are as innocent as you claim, why are you defending TPTB while attacking your own fellow &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;? You should be aware by now, the extent of their lies.</p>

<p>Wake up. I mean, <strong>really wake up!</strong></p>
