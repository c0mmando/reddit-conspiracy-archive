      <p>
       I'll start this out by saying I'm sharing my opinion on the topic and sources that swayed me. I am not extreme in this and am willing to change my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe GMOs are safe and a smart route to take. I haven't found one study that shows negative health effects on humans
      </p>
      <p>
       Main arguments against:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        All herbicides and pesticides are harmful and organic is a healthier option.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I see this as false, it's not well known but organic crops are sprayed with pesticides as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/%7Elhom/organictext.html">
        https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~lhom/organictext.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "A recent study compared the effectiveness of a rotenone-pyrethrin mixture versus a synthetic pesticide, imidan. Rotenone and pyrethrin are two common organic pesticides; imidan is considered a "soft" synthetic pesticide (i.e., designed to have a brief lifetime after application, and other traits that minimize unwanted effects). It was found that up to 7 applications of the rotenone- pyrethrin mixture were required to obtain the level of protection provided by 2 applications of imidan.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems unlikely that 7 applications of rotenone and pyrethrin are really better for the environment than 2 applications of imidan, especially when rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic life."
      </p>
      <p>
       What I get from this is pesticides suck, but we really need them for crops. GMO crops are modified to be more tolerant of these requiring less pesticide used. They are also modified to release certain toxins (bacteria) that attack specific species of harmful insects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a great article citing studies of how much pesticide use drops IN GMO crops.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe70s/pests_08.html">
        http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe70s/pests_08.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It also discusses a negative:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Organic Center argued that many fields of CMO crops were being overrun by new weeds that had developed a resistance to Roundup."
      </p>
      <p>
       Another article:
       <a href="http://www.enveurope.com/content/24/1/24">
        http://www.enveurope.com/content/24/1/24
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Weed management costs per hectare increase by 50% to 100% or more in fields infested with glyphosate-resistant weeds, as evident in a series of case studies submitted to the USDA by Dow AgroSciences "
      </p>
      <p>
       Farmers want to use roundup, GMOs make this possible. However these new weeds are damaging non GMO crops. It goes into detail on methods recommended to farmers to deal with this and there has been fewer problems since. Also from article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is estimated that between 1996 and 2005 the deployment of Bt cotton has reduced the volume of insecticide active ingredient used for pest control in cotton by 94.5 million kilograms and increased farm income through reduced costs and improved yields by US $7.5 billion, with most of the benefit accrued by farmers in developing nations…"
      </p>
      <p>
       I have trouble putting these savings into perspective, but at first glance I'd say that sounds good. The more I read though I see insecticide use has taken a huge drop and herbicide use has increased. Basically an overall increase of pesticides, 7% since 1996 or around 430 million lbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember this is on all crops. Those weeds are causing damage. I'm starting to get a feeling GMO crops would work best if they were the only crops. Obviously they would have to prove their worth. I think if the goal is less pesticides and higher yields it's worth seeing what these modifications can do. Remember no increased harm in human health has been linked to GMOS.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Here is another common argument, no long term studies done on GMOs and human health.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       All the studies that we have done showed no link in increased health risk. GMOs showed to lower pesticides and produce higher yields. Yes we need long term studies but why assume the worst? Does anyone have any scientific evidence that leads you to believe these genetic modifications are harmful?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember a currently promising cancer treatment is a genetically modified polio virus. Would you refuse this because it's been modified? I think this science is amazing and should be encouraged. We are engineering nature to work with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can I compare the two?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        (And final common argument) Junk science. I want real studies. A short YouTube video with no references or credentials won't sway me. Neither will pseudo science weekly. I have read the articles on people burning GMO crops, instead of referencing those show me what science they are using.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Here is an example of what I would say is a poor source:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.responsibletechnology.org/10-Reasons-to-Avoid-GMOs">
        http://www.responsibletechnology.org/10-Reasons-to-Avoid-GMOs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides not linking to studies or even naming any (huge red flag) they bring up increased use of herbicide and no mention at all of decreased insecticide. Seems bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am no expert, I may have misunderstood information. My understanding now is that GMO crops are safe and have potential to produce higher yields and use less harmful chemicals. I do not see the evil, I see a problem with weeds and potential solutions proposed. I don't see anything seriousness enough to abandon this scientific venture.
      </p>

       GMO's aren't designed to be better for you, they are designed to be better for profit....like the 'meat product' in a McDonalds hamburgers they are the cheapest solution for x amount of profit.  The practice of using modified plants and higher amounts of pesticides is beneficial to the industrial monoculture crop system which itself is destructive and prone to infestation and blight. These pesticides runoff into the ecosystem and reek havoc in insect, microbial, and plant communities which have lasting effects into higher trophic levels. There are very few long term studies on pesticides, approval for these chemicals is done with 90-day studies paid to labs who are dependent on the money from they very companies who's products they are verifying for safety. There is a lot of information out there you have to put effort into finding it, look for the MSDS for some pesticides.

       There are two pesticides that are common in GMO use: Bt, which is produced by some GMO plants, and glyphosate, which is sprayed by the farmer onto glyphosate-resistant GMOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bt is used uncontroversially in organic farming, so there's no legitimate concern there. I'm willing to bet that you don't know (or care) how long it takes glyphosate to break down into harmless byproducts after use. All of this opposition is just driven by ideology, and facts don't matter.

       We should remember that GMO technology, along with ALL emerging bio-technologies, could be used for much greater purposes than profit. Capitalism that treats humanity as a commodity is the culprit here, not bio-techs including GMO.

       If you think this is an in-depth treatment of the GMO topic that will satisfy this subreddit, you are sorely mistaken. This is pretty weak propaganda, very little information with lots of vague declarations that end in repeating the advertised talking points.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the GMOs that you're trying to sell were actually an improvement, you'd label them as such so people could purposefully purchase them in preference to non-GMOs. Instead massive lobbying has occurred to keep GMOs from being labelled in many countries, ashamed to show the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't bother responding to me, I don't trust someone who has a year of comment history in sports and mainstream entertainment subreddits suddenly coming to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to tell us the (condescending) truth. In fact, your only posts to this subreddit are to defend to GMOs and the Bush family and to argue that marijuana doesn't cure cancer immediately.

       I guess I can't argue when you don't dispute a single point. Obviously you're against GMOs, I came here to ask why. I have no problem changing my mind, I just would like a reason too. Try to judge this post by the quality of the content, not my personal history.

       Edit: My opinion on why they won't label, copy and pasted from another comment. Apologies, mobile. And here's a opinion better than mine, good article.

       "I can answer that. Misinformation. I just posted a long wall of text sharing my opinion and backing it with scientific research. I asked those who are against GMOs to share their reasons why.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far we have no scientific evidence supporting this anti GMO view, yet a group who won't budge. A group who attacks an individual as a person, which is interesting. If you had legitimate information supporting your view that would be your first option.
      </p>

       A whole community of people that blindly hate GMOs and spread misinformation. People who ignore science. This is why they don't want to label their product.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the studies I've shown and points I made yet you hold in to your view because "they won't label it"
      </p>
      <p>
       I will appreciate hearing others reasons they won't, would like if that's backed by something.

       I'm against government-enforced mandatory labeling for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       Those that wish to avoid GMOs are making a lifestyle choice that is not scientifically linked to any health or nutrition concerns.  Lifestyle choice labels, such as halal and kosher, are not mandatory.  Creating a label and enforcing it through a private entity is a cost that should be conferred upon those who wish to cater to that lifestyle choice (kosher, halal, non-GMO).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, when asking people why they desire a GMO label, I generally find that their response has almost nothing inherently to do with GMOs (e.g. wanting to avoid a corporation, avoiding pesticides) and generally a GMO label would give no information about the things that the consumer is actually concerned about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, Those that genuinely want to avoid GMOs for whatever reason already have that option by purchasing USDA certified organic or non-GMO project certified foods.  There's also a new USDA non-GMO label coming out soon which will cater to this population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without any incontrovertible scientific evidence that there's health or nutrition concerns inherentely linked to the process of genetic modification, it seems to me arrogant for a group of people to request mandatory labeling for the entire population's food supply to cater to their emotional or political beliefs.  However, with the
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-entine/post_8915_b_6572130.html">
        scientific consensus on the safety of genetic modification being
        <em>
         stronger
        </em>
        than that of human-caused global warming
       </a>
       , that introvertible evidence doesn't seem to exist.

       I can answer that. Misinformation. I just posted a long wall of text sharing my opinion and backing it with scientific research. I asked those who are against GMOs to share their reasons why.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far we have no scientific evidence supporting this anti GMO view, yet a group who won't budge. A group who attacks an individual as a person, which is interesting. If you had legitimate information supporting your view that would be your first option.

       I'm pretty sure I didn't attack you as a person. You're being quite melodramatic. People have a right to know what they eat, it's that simple. Your opinion is certainly not unpopular, at least according to mainstream media. I'm not anti GMO I'm anti cancer and disease. You said you need help understanding, not me. I understand completely fine. So if you want my help quit beating round the bush and answer a simple question. You still haven't told me why they want to avoid labeling GMO products. You just stated your view of this community as a reason, how does this relate?

        Diatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It is used as a filtration aid, mild abrasive in products including metal polishes and toothpaste, mechanical insecticide, absorbent for liquids, matting agent for coatings, reinforcing filler in plastics and rubber, anti-block in plastic films, porous support for chemical catalysts, cat litter, activator in blood clotting studies, a stabilizing component of dynamite, and a thermal insulator.

       Great, then whats the big worry about labeling everything with GMO's so you can eat as much as you want and everyone else can make their own decision as well. Sounds simple. They are spending $50+ million a year against labeling and this money can then go into producing a new label and it all comes out even. Argument over!!!

       I didn't know this. It is possible that it's worth 50mil to get a largely misinformed public from blacklisting their product. Here's an example
      </p>
      <p>
       "Aspartame is one of the most studied food additives in the world. It has been a common food additive for over 30 years, and there is a strong consensus among scientists and regulatory agencies that it is completely safe."
      </p>
      <p>
       Pepsi removed this chemical because an ignorant public thought it was unhealthy. Chipotle removed GMOs from their ingredients and cited this:
      </p>
      <p>
       " pseudoscientific fears of GMOs as their justification. (But that’s another story.)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if there is scientific reasons backing this up why wouldn't they say it? Would be great PR removing harmful ingredients.

       I'm a freedom of choice person, that's all. Let people make their own choices. Lets not hide things and play games, that's all. If you want to eat GMO's you have every right to, if you want aspartame by all means. Its all about what you believe in and want to add or not add to your body. You have the right to know, that's all. The rest of the world are labeling it, why aren't we? I am not here to argue their safety because it has been done on this site 1000 times always ending with no conclusions. 
As for Chipotle, fantastic marketing move. I applaud their marketing department. Look at the headlines it generated (my family never even knew they existed until now). It also leans on the fact that 90% of Americans fear the unknown with GMO's and gives them an option to eat out free of it.

       It's very sad that you think you are in some kind of superior position and therefore a lamppost of rationality.

      <blockquote>

        I see this as false, it's not well known but organic crops are sprayed with pesticides as well.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I see what you wrote as false.  Aside from having no references, it sounds like scare-mongering.  There have been numerous studies showing that organic has less pesticide on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to get into science, look into the CaMV transgenic vector.  Exactly how many ORFs is it believed to have today?  How many was it believed to have when it was approved as a vector?  Do you understand the significance of the discrepancies?

       This is a fine place for someone like you to come ask questions and learn.  This is not a place for you to tell people what's what.  You don't know what's what.

       I would love for you to go do your own research and not ask me to spend my time on your strawman.  My lack of providing any reference for you is a mark of my derision for you, and respect for myself.  You aren't paying me to work for you, and you don't appear to have inherent value that would benefit my cause by empowering you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect you to actually go educate yourself, although I just gave you the opportunity.  I expect you to pretend this is wikipedia and attempt to invalidate the facts I just pointed you to, rather than respect the fact that you've just been educated and you can follow-up on your own.

       I wasn't looking to argue with you but to see if you could guide others to finding more knowledge. I don't have many good sources to recommend to others on this topic and was hoping to find more. Most of my knowledge on this subject is about the legality and the lack of independent long term studies. I am not familiar with specifics such as those you mentioned, and I'd like to be.

       Very defensive, I encouraged others to share, discuss and criticize. I can't find anything linking GMOs to what you're talking about. Wouldn't mind some help, a link would be nice.

        second Google hit
       </a>
       when you type in "organic crop pesticide" and appears to be quite dated, as it's referencing a work from 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, there are a number of scholarly articles that have been written on organic pesticide usage that you could have looked at.

       Well, you could maybe try the "scholarly articles for organic crop pesticide" that Google links when you do a search for those particular terms. Like at the top of the image I linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or use something like scholar.google.com to find some relevant information. Your local university or library may have access to a larger database as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why you need someone to type those things in for you and then copy the links to here... seems like it'd be much easier for everyone if you type them in yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time, you might consider doing this before participating in a community that you think should be known for scientific awareness. Make sure you've got that scientific awareness going on yourself first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or at least know how to Google some thoughts a bit better.

       You are dodging. I can provide all the information I find and share my opinion in depth yet you can't link to one scholarly article, study, or anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have this insider knowledge on why GMOs are bad and your philosophy is "go find it yourself, I won't help you at all". I searched, I shared. I can't find anything that supports YOUR VIEW so I ask you where you get your information. "Google, and good luck"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll ask you. Will you please share some of the information you have that leads you to believe GMOs are bad?
