       You see it all the time from Liars (my word for anti-Truthers, haha), but all I can do is roll my eyes; I can nary dignify it with a response.  Do they really think that the CIA operates the way that a typical organisation does? They have "Cells" just like the terrorists do...  black boxes where no information is dispersed into the agency except at the highest levels (if that). Within such a cell, whether technically in the CIA, or wherever- you could have the dozen or so people who'd need to know what was going on. The remote pilots (4). The demo guys (4?). 3 Engineers to procure and implement the hardware. One John Clark-esque guy to run it, and oversee anything that did not require discrete knowledge of the events (such as appropriating any drones/missiles..)
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr, How is 12 people not enough? Does our community believe that it would require thousands of intelligence operatives to know what was going on? Discuss.

       John Stockwell referred to the Church Committee investigation which counted CIA Operations between 1947-1972: 9,000 small-scale operations and 3,000 large-scale operations--every one of them secret, every one of them, by definition, a conspiracy. As the fucking CIA has now been around for almost 70 years--you can Triple these numbers: 27,000 small-scale operations and 9,000 large-scale operations which the public has virtually no information about. The files we are given access to are also heavily fucking redacted.

       We know the CIA and the DoD are extremely secretive and extremely compartmentalized. During the Vietnam War, Daniel Ellsberg finally read the Pentagon Papers which clearly showed that the U.S. would have to commit 500K to 1 million soldiers to control South Vietnam--yet, this remained SECRET (even from the President) with only a few traitorous fucking generals knowing this info.

       Using compartmentalization, the US government was able to employ thousands of people during the Manhattan Project. There was only a handful of people who really knew what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. Every single person working a job at a major corporation only does their job. They don't know what's going on.

       I would ask them "Do you think the janitors at Enron knew what was going on?"

       I would argue the fact we are discussing it means they haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, if there was thermite used it was probably planted by covert teams and/or Mossad. Those guys usually don't go around telling secrets. Sometimes, they even fall out of helicopters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: there doesn't have to be anyone who specifically did anything. All the people on the planes are dead. They won't refute anything. A lot of people in the Trade Centers died. They won't refute anything. A lot of people who were in the Trade Centers and survived report explosions, especially coming from the lobby and/or basement area
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the Towers fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       And aside from that: even if it was simply some Saudi terrorists hijacking planes, flying them into buildings, buildings collapsing, there's nothing that gets in the way of the fact
       <em>
        the government lied about not having prior knowledge.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like me to link to any of the politicians lies, I will. I can also link to 9/11 Commission lies. It's fucking common knowledge now that there are complete lies with the official story. It's not always about the "how" but the "who" and the "why".
      </p>
      <p>
       And if that's the truth (since know one really knows, that's why we are discussing it), then there isn't anyone who could possibly come forward with anything. If our government willingly cooperated with these terrorists (like say....monitoring and allowing the wire transfers from Germany to pay for the flight school at Max Westhiemer in Norman, OK, then using a white male informant to purchase tickets for one of the flights) then the only person in that case who would have anything to spill is the CIA agent overseeing the Hamburg cell of Al-Qaeda and the informant.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Nick Berg was found beheaded. After his parents had been told he was being held by the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       So. Yeah.

       The idea the Manhattan Project was a well-kept secret is a myth. And it's also one thing to keep something compartmentalized in the planning stages. How long were things kept secret after execution? The next morning, specifics of the project were front-page news in the New York Times.

       So by that regard, 9/11 has probably had about 1,000,000 leaks.

      <p>
       And they kinda had no reason to protect any more secrets, we had literally just dropped the bomb.

      <p>
       And it's a decent enough secret even today. I would bet only a few out of 100 random people would really know many of the details of the Manhattan Project. Even less if you mention MK-Ultra, COINTEL PRO, Operation Gladio, Iran-Contra and the Mena Connection, the Murrah Bombing and 9/11 Connection.....

       Right, but what I'm saying is the link you posted makes mention of "1,500" leaks, but by their own account some of them were merely people talking. I
       <em>
        highly

       doubt what is being considered "leaks" by your original comment were actual truthful accords, just maybe a general idea of the events that would unfold.

       in the dark about all of government's covert operations.

       The fact remains, using the Manhattan project as an example of perfect secrecy is wrong. It was far from perfect - even in a circumstance where secrecy was clearly in the national interest, and with the enforced co-operation of the entire media, in the name of the war effort.
      </p>

       That is certainly not the case here: journalists would fall over themselves to break legitimate information showing 9/11 was an inside job. It would make Watergate look like a bungled burglary....

       Citing examples of where the media tells flat out lies about 9/11 doesnt make the media seem more credible, it makes the media seem less credible.

       They're also missing the piece of the puzzle that western media is utterly controlled, and covered for the crime rather than investigated it. (Because the assumption is that
       <em>
        somebody
       </em>
       would have come forward and CNN would've run a big expose...) And that's a pretty hard pill to swallow; the implications are mind-boggling.

       I need a better way to broach that subject, myself. It sounds pretty ridiculous to most people to say, "FoxNews, CNN, BBC, MSNBC, Time magazine, Popular Science... They were all in on it! Oh, and Hollywood too! And 1000s of shills on the internet!!"

       People came out publicly and they knew. It was just ignored. Covered up by the media.

       As long as the enemy controls the media, it is pointless. If you want you to get vaccinated, they will find experts who says "vaccinations are good" and ignore the science or other side of argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they decide to blame Muslims for what was essentially a government coup, then they will stick with that and anyone who goes against it will be retaliated against or fired. Charlie Sheen was fine until he went out against 9/11 and then they destroyed him. Chomsky shuts up about it, because he just has to watch what happens to people who speak truth to power.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 brought martial law to America. It ended the constitution. It created a parallel unaccountable, hidden court system. That continues today and shows no signs of being shut down, but is being entrenched and expanded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of absolute media control has increased since 9/11. The people who control the media control congress and control the decision makers. They create reality itself.

        'People would talk'...

       when someone tells me this regarding bigger-than-life possible conspiracies, I just refer them to those whistleblowers that have, and also to another thing:
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       has to keep secrets. Might be so trivial as trade secrets at work, more personal as family tragedies and intimate matters, but keeping information away from others is very much a part of adult life. Repercussions from revealing those can go from lawsuits, financial losses, ridicule or a wrecked life... and on higher levels, the loss of it.

       There would be many people in the know, but from divergent fields and to varying extents. For example, the total lack of air response can be explained with war games, communication breakdowns can be excused but specific behaviour of those in command is harder to explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual attack needed a few remote controlled aircraft, a few bombs, which could have been what is commercially comparable, by that I mean the demo teams could have been kept small.
      </p>
      <p>
       So those who could have been directly responsible, who could blow a worthwhile whistle could have been few. They could have been told it was a drill and taken out before the act took place, like the seals were with obl.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest, insiders who knew it was going to happen, what can they expose? "Yes, I knew it was coming." They wouldn't get anywhere but dead. They have no tangible evidence and admitting they knew is admitting responsibility.

       Whenever someone says 9/11 would have taken too many conspirators, i accuse them of being a holocaust denier, because certainly the holocaust would have taken more conspirators than 9/11 did.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then follow it up by agreeing with them that the holocaust must have been a hoax because it would have taken too many people to pull off.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can they argue with that logic? From my experimentation with this line of reasoning, it pretty well shuts up the idiots and shills, because they really dont want this logic applied to other conspiracy theories. They find it better to stop the  conversation rather than to let it grow and attract more attention and participation.

       A person saying, "I don't think it could've happened" in no way explains the twin towers turning to dust as they fell, or the complete lack of planes at Pentagon and Shanksville, or the demolition of WTC7.

       What I wrote similar on a different thread:
      </p>
      <p>
       This argument is brought up all the time on any grand illusion/conspiracy...how could so many people be involved and not say anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's really a question that if you applied to anything in everyday life, you see "conspiracy" or rather ignoring behavior, is going on constantly.  How many hundreds of millions of businessmen conceal their future plans daily?  How many doctors don't tell their patients the full story of their health problems, often to the doctor's profit?  How many salesmen make exorbitant profits on naive customers in over their head, often deeply negatively effecting that customer's financial stability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet the lying goes on daily, yearly, in never-ending fashion across every industry...especially in America, a land built by hustlers and hucksters.
      </p>
      <p>
       That grand technological fakery can take place is not at all surprising to me that it could take place.  It may be surprising when one begins to put the pieces together and see which events and technologies are very likely fake.  But the fact that people would attempt such things, or how they could keep such secrets, or go on living ignoring and forgetting them, none of that is surprising...the normal present state of humanity.
