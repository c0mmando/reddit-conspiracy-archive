    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve studied the bible and the KJV version is far more corrupted than the Catholics. I&#39;m a former Catholic and I can tell you, it&#39;s all bullshit. They weren&#39;t guided, they were paid. Research history of the book. Jesus was a philosopher, not the son of God or a Savior. The Way is you, what you know and natural laws that we are all born with. Old books serve no purpose, what you need to do is look within, not outward. The power is you, not a paragraph in a book. If you need a book to tell you right from wrong, you are already lost. We are all created in his/it&#39;s/her image right? That&#39;s the point.</p>

<p>doesn&#39;t change the fact it was written by man</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but to be fair.. Even if <em>&lt;¿name¿&gt;</em> came down in some divine ultraform and wrote the book in front of everyone alive at the time it does not change the fact that you would still have the same reaction today. Even if it was caught on film, anyone could just say it was altered. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you but things like &#39;divine/celestial inspiration&#39; seem rational to me, logical even. Though, not to claim (anything really) its irrational or illogical if you don&#39;t see it the same way as me.</p>

<p>Its just tiring to see these arguments used time and time again. Honestly, think about it, if you were such a being how would you do it? </p>

<p>Anyway, not to start an argument or anything, but the reality is global social/civil well being isn&#39;t healthy enough to be having such wide-spread staunch dismissals. Yeah, some &#39;solutions&#39; proposed by &#39;religious subject matter&#39; are rather extreme.. But at least some are trying to be socially responsible (on some level) by bringing up the problem while it can still be collectively assessed and discussed with some comfort. Opposed to in the midst of collapse/starvation/war/etc where no one will be concerned about rebuilding due to the shock experience and excitement, not to mention the pendulous anticipation from generations of tv/movies/rumors/conspiracy. </p>

<p>IDK, meh. See in this thread/post its not as big of a deal as I make it out to be even though im not suggesting its a huge deal or anything, do does as it will do, but collectively the individual(s) constantly abstaining from such discussions inherently is going to bring a disconnect between any &#39;power structure&#39; and the &#39;peoples.&#39; Even if there were, which there are a few, legitimate methods of A&lt;-&gt;B interaction to change things, as you can see from casual observation, so little people know of any due to this disconnect from uncaring and blind trust it just leaves the niched people to take over or assume control. </p>

<p>Any (non)religious person ragging on a (non)religious person about &#39;blind faith/trust&#39; whom isn&#39;t interested in addressing the real tangible problems within a &lt;social/civil structure&gt; even at a public/theoretical/whatever level, sadly, is doing the exact same thing, just on a different subject. Either way you look at it its still just as hypocritical, its just more socially acceptable to apply such a statement to the religious subjects. Unfortunately by the time people get slapped around enough to not ignore it, due to the hypocritical disconnect of collective individual(s) perpetuating the same hypocrisy for so long over so many subjects, it just redlines the collective into the &#39;blind pissed&#39; mode. Where they can neither assess the situation properly collectively or propose realistic ideas/changes. Basically most of the world is driving around in duct tapped model-ts wondering why an air conditioner costs so much to install. </p>

<p>Be well. </p>
