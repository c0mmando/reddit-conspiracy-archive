       I recently read a io9 article about Fury Road (
       <a href="http://io9.com/do-you-realize-mad-max-fury-road-is-a-miracle-1707000166">
        http://io9.com/do-you-realize-mad-max-fury-road-is-a-miracle-1707000166
       </a>
       ) I enjoyed the article until I got  to "At first Mel Gibson was going to reprise the role of Max, which would have been a disaster, because Gibson is an anti-Semitic loon." All that Gibson has done in his life and one drunken comment about Jews is all it takes to undo it? It sinks my soul that this the kind of world Hollywood has made us.

       Well, the Jews control Holywood so Gibson came into contact with them and figured out how they work. This lead to the drunk tirade, and that fucked him for work in Holywood and any other place Jews control.

       He was going to have a cameo in The Hangover 2 but some of the cast/crew said they wouldn't work with him.  So they got Mike Tyson, convicted rapist, instead.

       Might have to do with more than one drunken insult to Jewish people.

       He's not "blacklisted". He's still in movies and he still creates his own movies just fine. You seem to be implying he wasn't in Fury Road because he's blacklisted but that's not what the article said.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Reportedly, Miller has been working on Fury Road since 1998 and very nearly got it made on several occasions. At first Mel Gibson was going to reprise the role of Max, which would have been a disaster, because Gibson is an anti-Semitic loon. Then it was going to be a a 3D CG animated movie, which probably would have been lame and looked terrible, and even if it was good wouldnâ€™t have been nearly as good as the movie we eventually got.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ignoring the fact that most films that languish that long in development hell never, ever, ever get made anyways, so many random things had to happen to prevent us from getting an earlier, crappier version of Fury Road. The movie had to be thwarted, over and over again, for nearly 20 years so we could get this version of Fury Road

       I don't know if you read any movie blogs/news, but this is very, very normal.

       I read it. You are obviously are very unaware of how Hollywood operates. Do some research. I'll leave you with this
