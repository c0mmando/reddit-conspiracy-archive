        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>R/worldnews caught red handed once again. Mods delete one users comment criticizing a report on ISIS as propaganda and calling out subreddit mods for deleting comments. DELETED. Another user (me) reposted the comment, mentions it was deleted. DELETED.</p>

<p><strong>Imagine how many comments are being deleted hourly in that subreddit.</strong> Just for going against the grain. It could be hundreds, I guess we would never know because the mods simply delete all traces of evidence.</p>

<p>This is the new reddit. </p>

<p>And this <em>is</em> a conspiracy. Mods wholesale deleting comments that go against the mainstream-media sponsored narrative. There is no way that anyone can justify this. And &quot;mods can do what they want because it is their subreddit&quot; is not a valid excuse. </p>

<p>This is BLATANT information manipulation. On the highest level. And exposing millions of people daily to a manipulated consensus where dissidents are ERASED. Not even downvoted. <strong>ERASED.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://imgur.com/EZ7VTMo">The original comment was a child of the top thread comment</a> (and by the way, in this case, I can maybe even understand why mods would get butthurt and erase it)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://imgur.com/QPG3zEs">The reposted comment</a> (mods have <strong>NO</strong> excuse for deleting this)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And since I was the second OP, <a href="http://imgur.com/RbHr3nm">this final screenshot</a> shows my response to a highly upvoted comment that said &quot;I understand why mods deleted it, it sounds like ISIS propaganda&quot;. Which is a crazy precedent, <strong>apparently comments can now be deleted because mods feel like it &quot;supports ISIS&quot; and the people in that subreddit upvoted that premise (unless bots upvoted it). Let that sink in for a moment.</strong></p>

<p>But of course, mods deleted that to. Because they don&#39;t want to be caught out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&quot;The simple answer to your very stupid question is the fact is that the discussion in this comment thread is based on want she has to say, wherein I posted a video of the TED talk. By commenting on it without watching it you&#39;re polluting a decent conversation with shit.
I&#39;m not interested in a dialogue with you. You&#39;re at best a troll and at worst a person that actually believes the shit your saying, which resembles an adolescents take from the worst of cable news. If you want to espouse your banal and bigoted views then go fuck off into another part of the comments section to do that, where you can continue to stick your fingers in your ears and prattle on about 1-dimensional strawmen.
You get a four out of ten for trolling with that shit-stain comment but a shit out of ten for adding anything of value to a platform that&#39;s normally conducive to edifying discussion.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The above concerns quoting from the parent commenter&#39;s post history in a strange, ad hominem, non-sequitor response</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not the one out to win hearts and minds to a particular cause here. I suppose that might not be your concern at all. It could be that instead of promoting the spread of ideas and truth, someone like you might actually be into this sub because you see the truth as something exclusive that only you deserve to know because of your &#39;high intellect&#39;. It could be that this is just an insular community for circlejerking over the idea that you&#39;re all clever underdogs that see things how they really are, unlike the stupid masses.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the latter for you based on how you chose to respond to my concerns.</p>

<p>Good luck being better than everyone else on reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the attempts to &quot;clear it up&quot; involved redditors stalking a daycare centre and peering in the windows, reddit had no choice about deleting it. Even the barest appearance of reddit tolerating weirdest stalking a kindergarten would be the worst PR imaginable, particularly after jailbait made the mainstream news.</p>

<p>Reddit&#39;s a business. Having weirdos stalk children on your site is bad for business.</p>

Didn&#39;t take me too long to realize that I was in the wrong spot for unique thought. People here are so fucking brainwashed, it makes me want to cry. So it actually makes me feel a little better knowing that there are people who think for themselves, they are just being silenced.

    <div class="md"><p>My first impression of Voat is that since it&#39;s a reddit clone, it&#39;s guaranteed to succumb to the same effects of a democratic system as Reddit, like endless memes and shitty, easily digested content. Their ad revenue sharing plan, apparently intended to promote creative and original content, relies on some definition of &#39;creative and original&#39;, and will more than likely become a way to reward content with lots of upvotes and views which of course tends to be memes and other garbage. They claim they won&#39;t let it happen, but talk is cheap.</p>

I collect and save the good ones, I was entertaining myself at <a href="/r/showerthoughts">/r/showerthoughts</a> yesterday when I saw a joke about 9/11. The title was innocuous enough but I was curious about the comments and of course   encountered  a lot of jokes about steel beams and dank memes which did little to make me feel like that was appropriate commentary about the most important issue of our times so I countered their comments with a few facts . They were heavily downvoted by the folks who were after all just in it for fun. But I  tried to have them realize this was not a joking matter. I was immediately reported for &#39;harassment&#39; and banned.  This sub is allowed to have the content it has in order to coral us and profile us for further action and to find out what our &#39;proof&#39; is so that it can be scrubbed.</p>

<p>I was looking at material I posted on Usenet during 2003 to 2005 yesterday </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t prove anything but every single item I used to prove my points back then was 404 missing. To their chagrin I have copies of most of it.</p>

<p>No, it is the equivalent of living in a country that is becoming more and more out of control and actually trying to do something about it, and then the little minds come out with their pathetic excuses to attack the person reacting to the injustice.</p>

<p>Your argument is invalid, and tired, and it pops up 1000&#39;s of times. It makes zero sense and is basically boils down to one of the worst attitudes that anyone could ever take when confronted with a problem.</p>

<p>You are literally bashing the people who try to change a system from by saying &quot;if you don&#39;t like it then nobody is keeping you here&quot; which is an excuse that remains valid regardless of how far the authorities turn up their corruption.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, people are being taken out of their homes and shot, but hey, if they didn&#39;t like it, they shouldn&#39;t have lived in a country where that happens, they should have just moved away&quot;. </p>

They are definitely pushing an agenda, especially with the ISIS fear mongering. Another example of this selective bias is whenever Israel attacks Gaza, they also allow all comments cheering for dead Palestinians, but any comments saying &quot;good&quot; when an Israeli terrorist dies gets removed (because Israelis are always the good guys and Palestinians are always the bad guys). <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Q6BHE26.jpg">This is a comment of one of the mods I found in a /r/politicalmoderation post about them</a> that leaves no doubt in my mind that they are actively using their positions for propaganda.

<p>Please, show what part of this comment demonstrates &quot;being an asshole&quot;:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is just another of many propaganda headlines <strong>(the headline stating that ISIS committed 5 million human rights abuses in one month)</strong> that only sounds legitimate based on the other thousand &quot;OMG ISIS bad&quot; propaganda headlines that the Western public has been steadily bombarded with. <strong>(bold added after the fact for clarification)</strong></li>

<p>Show me. I am interested.</p>

<p>Oh wait, you can&#39;t. Invalidating your entire argument that I run around &quot;being an asshole&quot; just for kicks.</p>

<p>The Internet&#39;s Own Boy: <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheInternetsOwnBoyTheStoryOfAaronSwartz">The Story of Aaron Swartz</a></p>

<p>Aaron Hillel Swartz (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013) was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer and Internet hacktivist who was involved in the development of the web feed format RSS and the Markdown publishing format, the organization Creative Commons, the website framework web.py and the social news site, Reddit, in which he became a partner after its merger with his company, Infogami. He committed suicide while under federal indictment for data-theft, a prosecution that was characterized by his family as being &quot;the product of a criminal-justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit will be massively important going forward for the Awakening. We can moan all we want about its decreasing quality and discuss alternatives, but ultimately we need to keep a presence here and not be deterred by censorship.</p>

<p>The answer is to not back down, but to increase activity both here and throughout the site. Record all censorship and post about it. Make it known  beyond alternative subreddits that corruption is endemic. This awareness is vital.</p>

<p>So, thanks for this post :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi friend! </p>

<p>In basic terms, the awakening will be a spiritual-based counter-movement to the culminating negative events of the world. When terrorism, economic collapse, disease, natural disasters and more began to unfold on unprecedented levels, there will be an equally polarized movement of love and light among people who reject the new status quo.</p>

<p>In scientific terms, it is the raising of the vibrational level of our being.</p>

<p>In spiritual terms, it is the return of love and light to our spiritual matrix, and will be a &#39;graduation&#39; of sorts. Those who embrace and join the awakening will have their consciousness expand tremendously, unlock latent perceptions of extra dimensions, explore the phenomenal divinity of creation and come closer to God.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love it if you could read this post:</p>

<p>It is exactly what my inner self was looking for today.  I feel everything that you shared about you and your friend.  Though unsure about how it will work out, I have a good feeling that it will amazingly.</p>

<p>I feel like the negative side is starting to put out their final plans though.  And that they will go out in a huge battle or some kind.  No way around the fight but what it makes way for is more important.  Thank you.  Love and blessings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh --- I don&#39;t agree.  As the world &quot;grieves&quot; for its loss of the status quo then society will collectively experience the 5 stages of grief in a progressive and chaotic manner.  After a long dark period of denial, and anger we&#39;ll reach bargaining and then acceptance --- at acceptance we might reach a one world spirituality but typically these things sway toward fundamentalism.. </p>

<p>who said he&#39;d just delete his account and keep going back.  </p>

<p>He goes on subs like worldnews, tries to pick a fight(sometimes more subtle than others) then comes here to try and stir shit up.</p>

<p>Notice he complains about his comment being deleted in the second image, where he reposted a deleted comment.  If you post something they want deleted, of course they will delete it again.  Use your head.  Personally I think it&#39;s him just using more than one account.</p>

<p>The thing this guy doesn&#39;t get is the mods can delete whatever the fuck they want.  Reddit isn&#39;t a free speech haven, and picking fights and acting butthurt when they don&#39;t go his way is not going to change that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is correct that the mods have the power delete whatever they want.  The drawback is that if they delete real discussion, people WILL and DO get upset.  The expectation is that the moderators are there to &quot;moderate&quot;.  Removing spam and annoying shit that takes away from &quot;good&quot; content is what is expected.  Posting stuff that challenges this power in an abusive or stupid way is like walking up to a police officer and saying &quot;What the fuck are you going to do?!?  Arrest me?!?&quot;.  Everyone&#39;s going to laugh at the person who does this.</p>

<p>Basically, as long as moderators don&#39;t abuse the power to delete content, no one cares.</p>

<p>The relevant censors at VOAT can expect the same treatment censors got post the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, they were charged, tried convicted and <a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?num=100&amp;amp;q=William+Joyce+hanged&amp;amp;oq=William+Joyce+hanged&amp;amp;gs_l=serp.12...2503.20126.0.22153.15.15.0.0.0.0.256.2948.0j4j10.14.0.msedr...0...1c.1.64.serp..10.5.1085.73vYw4LX_XI">hanged!</a></p>

<p>All of my stuff calls for the prosecution and execution of the Jews who perpetrated the 911 attacks, September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>Edit: that was sarcasm if it wasn&#39;t clear.  See most of reddit loves the censorship of opinions they don&#39;t like.  See safe spaces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So called hate speech is free speech. We&#39;re all supposed to be able to express our point of view whether others like it or not. Look at it this way, if your point of view is suddenly declared &quot;hate speech&quot; and you are no longer allowed to express yourself, how would you feel about it? </p>

Victorian people had some fucked up opinions, yet at the time that was accepted standard amongst the best of them.</p>

<p>Sometimes you NEED to hear the other side. Remember that censoring doesn&#39;t get rid of opinions, it just forces them underground.
Also if someone has an opinion you don&#39;t agree with, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to have a discussion about it? Maybe you can change their minds with decent enough arguments, or is that too logical?</p>

<p>Original comment below, please highlight the part that implies there is something good about ISIS:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is just another of many propaganda headlines <strong>(the headline stating that ISIS committed 5 million human rights abuses in one month)</strong> that only sounds legitimate based on the other thousand &quot;OMG ISIS bad&quot; propaganda headlines that the Western public has been steadily bombarded with. <strong>(bold added after the fact for clarification)</strong></li>

<p>Its entire revenue stream is generated by content its users create. Let that sink in. What would make them more money? Leaving your controversial comment up or delete it with a good chance you would make a post somewhere else bitching about it being removed.</p>

Because all I see around here are fans of relatively non-interventionist guys like Rand Paul or Bernie Sanders; while neo-conservatism, IMHO, is primarily about direct intervention in foreign affairs in an attempt to further (certain) American interests.</p>

<p>Where are the redditors drum-beating for the next war in the middle east?  Have I been missing all these posts?</p>

<p>I keep seeing posts in comment threads that say that foreign intervention rarely works, and that the terrorists of today are often the product of yesterday&#39;s interventions.  When I post things that say this, I get upvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every website starts from the bottom.  Facebook used to have &quot;all 300k of them&quot; and at some point MySpace was probably laughing at them.</p>

<p>Honestly, I haven&#39;t really been there much or made an account or anything, but I&#39;ve been given the impression that it&#39;s building pretty rapidly.  I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a &quot;mass exodus&quot; the way some people claim; I&#39;d think it&#39;s probably a matter of users using both websites, not just giving up on this one altogether, but I&#39;d be interested to see how fast that 300k number grows over a short period of time.</p>

<p>I read a lot of people talking about it more and more frequently lately, and I suspect that if it becomes a thing people will go from using both websites, to just quitting one of them altogether eventually.  &quot;Not with a bang, but with a whisper&quot;, if I&#39;m saying that correctly?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really follow politics/world news stuff, so I don&#39;t see myself angrily migrating to the other one.  The subs I follow here are mostly trivial subjects not too important enough to censor information, and certainly not on a scale that could potentially control information to millions of people.  I don&#39;t see Wizards of the Coast getting <a href="/r/RPGs">/r/RPGs</a> mods to start deleting GURPS posts.  So if I was ever to go there, it would have to be bigger with already established and active subs of all the dumb and trivial stuff I follow on this site.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So do you believe that a 15 or 16 year old worldnews mods should be allowed to delete any comments that they deem as a &quot;shitpost&quot;?</p>

<p>And I forget, whats the legal definition of &quot;shitpost&quot; again? You know, so we can have a standard and not allow the definition to mean whatever the mods want it to mean.</p>

<p>Lets look at the second comment they deleted since I already said that the first comment was more &quot;offensive&quot; if that is the game we are playing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is just another of many propaganda headlines <strong>(the headline stating that ISIS committed 5 million human rights abuses in one month)</strong> that only sounds legitimate based on the other thousand &quot;OMG ISIS bad&quot; propaganda headlines that the Western public has been steadily bombarded with. <strong>(bold added after the fact for clarification)</strong></p>

<p>So, really, can you please tell me what part of this comment designates it as entering &quot;shitpost&quot; territory. I am genuinely interested in your analysis.</p>

<p>False equivalence is a logical fallacy which describes a situation where there is a logical and apparent equivalence, but when in fact there is none. This fallacy is categorized as a fallacy of inconsistency. It would be the antonym of the mathematical concept of material equivalence.</p>

<p>And honestly, I never saw the hype about beheadings. If I committed a crime and was sentenced to death, I would MUCH rather have someone cut off my head (which would take a millisecond) than be strapped into a chair and electrocuted, or given a poison injection, or face a firing squad.</p>

<p>Credit where it&#39;s due, the western world invented that one. IIRC, there are even places in America, and certainly in other &quot;civilized nations&quot; where execution by firing squad is still practised. Depending on where you ask (I&#39;m looking at you, Texas) a majority of average citizens probably aren&#39;t even opposed to the idea of firing squads, conceptionally...not unless you tell them how much the government would have to spend on bullets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s relevant because we are talking about execution methods.  ISIS will burn because I think when Obama is no longer president. The next president will invade.  We will annihilate them with bombs.  So figuratively they will burn.  </p>

<p>Luckily for them, when they surrender to US troops they will be treated like prisoners of war.  It would be nice to emulate their savagery and shoot the ISIS soldiers one by one and throw them in a river, but we won&#39;t do that to them... Hopefully.  Simply because we don&#39;t want to become them.  </p>

<p>I personally prefer the method used by the Allies when they encountered the ringleaders of the SS and the death camp personnel, Hung with wires.  </p>

<p>I admit we have committed acts of savagery.  I&#39;m not sure we should have done that to the SS but yet again they were dogs.  So should we have? Shouldn&#39;t we have?  I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;m concerned with what we will do now against ISIS, who can legitimately  be compared to the SS in savagery. </p>

<p>ISIS aren&#39;t killing the SS, they are killing underpaid surrendered Iraqi soldiers, sinners and political opponents.  They are fucking savages.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you&#39;ve ever seen a terrorist beheading video like I have, I don&#39;t think you would be speaking so lightly about the painlessness of being beheaded. I&#39;ve seen a number of terrorist beheading videos, both because I like to keep up with what people are seeing, and also because I used to run an adult media website that would post fucked up content all the time. Truth is that even a beheading by saw would be merciful in comparison to the actual beheadings I&#39;ve seen, which were all done with either machetes or some kind of crude hunting knife. Each one I&#39;ve seen has been incredibly brutal - often taking a horrifyingly long time to complete, and even for the victim to lose consciousness, due to the sheer ineffectiveness of the tool and the beheading technique. So, while it&#39;s true that ISIS beheading videos are pretty tame in comparison and don&#39;t show the actual beheading processes, if they are anything like any of the other terrorist beheadings I&#39;ve seen, the beheadings are definitely going to be much more brutal than you give them credit for. Just saying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t think that was the standard for beheadings, but then again I have not been watching any of the videos that &quot;ISIS&quot; produces.</p>

<p>Are these the videos where the shot suddenly fades out right before the kill? Because in that case, it would make sense to &quot;play-up&quot; the incident as much as possible and show the executioner holding something like an old rusty saw, for the fear-factor (even if they don&#39;t actually end up using it).</p>

<p>Do you have this <strong>acrid &amp; acidic</strong> response on cut/paste speed dial?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;&quot;The simple answer to your very stupid question is the fact is that the discussion in this comment thread is based on want she has to say, wherein I posted a video of the TED talk. By commenting on it without watching it you&#39;re polluting a decent conversation with shit.
I&#39;m not interested in a dialogue with you. You&#39;re at best a troll and at worst a person that actually believes the shit your saying, which resembles an adolescents take from the worst of cable news. If you want to espouse your banal and bigoted views then go fuck off into another part of the comments section to do that, where you can continue to stick your fingers in your ears and prattle on about 1-dimensional strawmen.
You get a four out of ten for trolling with that shit-stain comment but a shit out of ten for adding anything of value to a platform that&#39;s normally conducive to edifying discussion.&quot;&quot;</p>
