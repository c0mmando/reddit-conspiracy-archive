<p>But why? What could they gain by doing this? Why do people think they&#39;re going to all of this trouble to harm their own population?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not geo engineering. Engineering implies intentional effects, which is what cloud seeding is. If you throw a rock into a river and it happens to block waterflow, that&#39;s not engineering. Intentionally damning the river is engineering.</p>

<p>That&#39;s highly debatable given how all of the entire planets weather system is tied together and one thing influences the next. Cloud seeding on a large scale can cause large changes, potentially.</p>

<p>Plus, that&#39;s only what they admit to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can they make it stop raining when it&#39;s raining? No.</p>

<p>Quite possibly, yes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Quite possibly. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Quite possibly. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d hope so given how complex the weather is. </p>

<p>One thing is for sure, they DO admit to intentional geo engineering. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since the average person has never noticed that all of the important  decisions are being made based on personal greed alone, by sociopaths in power, the simple solution is to make them aware so that they can screen out individuals who cannot demonstrate the qualities I mentioned. Leaders for instance should be able to demonstrate some kind of conscience.</p>

<p>For examples of this already having worked before
 I give you several kinds of people who are already screened out of power  positions </p>

<p>Labeling them what they truly are will work. Labeling people as racists works, no one can keep a position of power after they reveal themselves as racists, Neither can pedophiles witch burners, cannibals or the most recent addition homophobes.</p>

<p>Adding this one more personality type to the list would make a profound difference in the world now and increasingly in the future.  If we could somehow see the transformation this would make immediately, no one would be a doubter any longer.</p>

<p>Adding to the list of screened out individuals, &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;  otherwise known as  people who question  the actions of known liars.</p>

<p>edit Your point about transparency is lost on me. If we accept sociopaths as leaders they always lie and transparency will be just an inside joke to them. We&#39;re already living in transparency nirvana don&#39;t ya&#39; know.</p>

<p>Everything is toxic in high enough concentrations. The fluoride in the water supply is well below what could be considered a harmful concentration and as it&#39;s a salt and water soluble our body has absolutely no trouble excreting a surplus through our renal system.</p>

<p>You would literally have to eat a lump of it for it to harm you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the harm is deliberate (negligent, complicit, or intended doesn&#39;t matter).</p>

<p>It&#39;s clearly demonstrated that government projects (regardless of legitimacy) have had a negative impact on people&#39;s health. Not to mention the businesses that have engaged in similar practices. To give them some kind of cognitive free pass rejects the inclusion of a long historical context of such behavior. The effect on the public&#39;s health is usually only considered after the fact, and likely long after the actual event (because the information doesn&#39;t always make it to public awareness, or someone gets shot, or charges are dropped, or something is settled out-of-court, etc).</p>

<p>Don&#39;t give me the &quot;everything is toxic&quot; argument. The standpoint is lunacy. The position here is clear: <strong>No Amount</strong> of fluoride should be being ingested by humans at any concentration. There is no &quot;supposed&quot; benefit that out-classes the demonstrable effects. There is no good reason that it should be in the water at all. The cost of this &quot;humanitarian effort&quot; to strengthen the whatever of humans drinking the water is a waste of the funding. It creates a detriment to the overall health of the organism, therefore it&#39;s stated reason for existing is false. The basic pretext is rejected completely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We can consider the &#39;elite&#39; to be composed of two levels, with different ends that use the same means. </p>

<p>There is, on the lower level (which includes all of TPTB in the public light: Banks, Governments, Military/Intelligence) a desire for total control. They are psychopaths who get &quot;stuck&quot; on ideas of hate and fear and feel a compulsion to manifest this energy into the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/377gbe/love_and_light/">My friend</a> calls these <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/33b7db/a_brief_spiritual_dissection_of_the_elite/">&#39;Animen&#39;</a> [If these posts are blue please read them now!] and they literally feed on the negative energy they unleash. Astral vampires, as Manly P. Hall would put it. </p>

<p>Their desire is total control, and that is the purpose for them being here. They don&#39;t care if they have to spend millenia in underground bunkers because the surface of the planet has been completely destroyed. Thats why there is poison in our food, water and air. </p>

<p>These powers are occult. They spend their time in secret performing rituals and working with dark energy. This is how they rise above the poisons, but working with the very same negative energy that they are spreading across humanity. </p>

<p>They are also psychopaths, and thoroughly enjoy the pain, suffering and manipulation they unleash.</p>

<p>There is a level above them, who pull the puppet strings of these psychopaths. They have a different, more complex reason for being here, but their solutions to not succumbing to their own control matrix are the same.</p>

<p>We can overcome the mind control and poison by practising yoga (eastern mysticism, not western exercise style), meditating and being conscious every moment of what we put in our bodies. This is basically what the elite does, but from the other end of the polarity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure a lot of this post will have people shaking their heads but if there is anyone interested in learning more about this idea, let me know. There is so much more to be said than can be squeezed into a quick reddit comment.</p>

<p>Love and Light, friends.</p>

<p>Just saying &quot;profits&quot; as the answer of the question how they benefit from deliberately poisoning us is the same as just saying &quot;by benefiting from it!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s ok to admit you don&#39;t have an answer to a question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So they&#39;re not deliberately harming the population, you&#39;re just worried that legitimate government projects, like trying to manipulate the weather, might have a negative impact on our health in the future?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you aware that fluoride is a toxic substance and that ingesting any isn&#39;t really the best idea?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everything is toxic in high enough concentrations. The fluoride in the water supply is well below what could be considered a harmful concentration and as it&#39;s a salt and water soluble our body has absolutely no trouble excreting a surplus through our renal system.</p>

<p>You would literally have to eat a lump of it for it to harm you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do they gain? The answer is different in each case, and probably isn&#39;t just as easy as a blanket fits-all encapsulation. Do you really think that some board or panel or committee gives one righteous shit about Joe Taxpayer? You are missing the MASSIVE HISTORICAL CONTEXT of your assumption.</p>

<p>Still not explaining what it is they&#39;re gaining and how they gain it by poisoning the air and water.</p>

<p>As far as the government&#39;s control of weather, since it&#39;s limited to cloud-seeding then you&#39;re making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

<p>Can they make it stop raining when it&#39;s raining? No.</p>

<p>Can they raise a wind when there is none? No.</p>

<p>Can they cause a strong wind to cease? No.</p>

<p>The list of things they&#39;re incapable of doing is extensive.</p>
