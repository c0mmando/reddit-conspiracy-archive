       To be honest, anyone who thinks that we are alone in the universe clearly does not have an understanding of how massive OUR universe is, let alone the fact that there could be infinite other universes.

       Look at who is pushing the alien meme.  The disclosure project was started by a Rockefeller, and the connections go back a lot further than that.  Hollywood pushes it, the main stream media pushes it(there are actually quite a few stories there).  The whole thing is likely one huge, century long psyop.

       Consider what James Corbett has to say about it:

       What is the purpose?  Its the next conflict for us to believe in so that we can be manipulated.  Currently we are working through the islamic terrorist narrative.  But that one is starting to get old.  People aren't buying it anymore.  They will need something new soon.

       He's a flat Earth pusher. Doesn't believe there even is anything out there. Ask him about it and he gives you a link to a book written in the 1890s written by "Rectangle" aka T. Winship. Told me gravity doesn't exist....

       It's ridiculous. And would make me laugh if I didn't see it everywhere I go on this sub. He hasn't explained how it's a conspiracy so until then, I wish he would just take that shit else where, because it further pushes the narrative that we're all crazy around here. Wouldn't be surprised if that's his goal though.

       i gave up years ago trying to provide proof. i have offered time and time again .....'come star gazing with me' and find out for yourself.
i have been experiencing all my life......absolutely no horror stories.sorry.  pictures will never be proof testimony will never be proof. an alien handing me a sample of some material will never be proof. it will all be in some way debunked. bye some one. some how.   go out side and spend time looking up.

       it could very well be and it is significant. and exciting.

       Yes. Radio waves are the same thing as light, just at a lower frequency. If a species were able to send out a signal that strong, they would most likely do it in the radio frequency due to energy requirements and the fact that waves of that frequency are not often produced in short bursts by stars and other celestial bodies

       and that would be assuming they even relied on a technology that we recognize or would be dependent on energy as we understand it. im thinking if the wow signal was indeed an intelligent transmission.. it was done in such a way that we would recognize.... the movie contact with jodie foster made this point brilliantly

       We understand energy very well. Physicists understand the universe much much much better than people give them credit for.
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, the Higgs boson was proposed using math, and properties like mass, spin (etc) were all calculated to make sense of some findings. And when the Higgs was finally discovered, it was exactly what physicists had predicted decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       High frequency signals take more energy, does not matter how they are produced, it's just fact.

       And yes, about the contact thing. It would make sense to send a powerful signal in radio frequency. High frequency, high energy bursts occur in nature all the time. "TIL a gamma ray burst could kill us at any time" is posted on reddit all the time, which is a high frequency burst. However, high energy radio wave bursts DO NOT happen in nature, hence why the WOW signal is a very good candidate for alien life

       im not arguing with you im agreeing
we are up against something that is far grander than our known physics. as an example there have been experiments telepathy melded with technology that amplifies it. that goes down the rabbit hole... i do know for a fact that our govt. and the russians were researching remote viewing and other organic technologys and im convinced they still are and are using it.
ive heard it called psychotronics.

       i believe they exist. not just because i saw a UFO many years ago &amp; even if i had never seen it, i knew before then that we're not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       ancient history in other cultures plainly states the fact imo.

       Right there with you my friend.  I too am a witness to several 'UFO' encounters.  Thrice when I was a kid, yet only once in adulthood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Living in Arizona my entire life, save for a few short stints in neighboring states, all of my experiences occurred in Phoenix.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first observation of an 'UFO', meaning I couldn't define it and no reasonable explanation has be given, happened at a Drive-In movie with my mother.  My mom was the first to point it out to me.  Based on the distance, which was hard to tell/remember being so many years ago, the object appeared huge.  About an inch in the sky, it had rotating lights of different colors.  The object passed behind the screen, and I never saw it again.  Once the screen obstructed my view, I left the car to see if I could get a better look at it.  Apparently, I missed it 'zip' (my mother's words) upward into the sky while meandering through parked cars.  I was about ten when this happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next incident occurred when I was a teen.  Around 15 or so.  I was sitting outside my house, sneaking a cigarette on the tailgate of my dad's truck, when I was startled by a huge boom and blast of wind, as a 'glowing white orb' (for lack of better words, but that's what it looked like) shot over the rooftops above my head.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when I say huge, I mean sonic boom huge.  That shit rattled windows, set off car alarms, and I could feel it in my chest.  It scared the shit out of me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My final observation as a teen happened on a Thursday, March 13, 1997.  Some of you might have heard about it.  I was driving on the freeway heading to pick up my girlfriend at the time.  I remember looking out my driver's side window thinking, “that's an odd light formation.”  I was on the 51 heading North, and the lights appeared on my left.  I saw a large, very distinct 'V' shape made of whitish-yellowish-orange lights.  Thank God, I wasn't the only one.
      </p>
      <p>
       My last observation was about three to four years ago.  I was sitting on my patio in north Phoenix at about 2 am browsing reddit and contemplating the Multi-verse.  Concluding my internet session I turned to take in the night sky before heading to bed.  Within minutes I saw what I thought was a spotlight, like the ones you see at car dealerships, heading South towards me over the trees and roof lines.  As it approached it piqued my interest being larger than any other spotlight I had seen before, and oddly shaped.  It looked like a doughnut with a bite taken out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I watched it, I half expected it to circle back, like those spotlights do.  It wasn't till it was over my house that I realized it wasn't a light projection.  It was actually up there, in the sky, flying over my house.  I tracked it from every point I could, and even thought of hopping in the car to chase it.  It was up there, and it was BIG.  About 4-5 inches in the sky from my perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny little side note.  My wife had never witnessed a UFO until driving with my son a few years ago.   What they both saw sounds fascinating, as it occurred in broad daylight on a busy street.  If you would like to ask her about it her name is
       <a href="/u/Haven">
        /u/Haven
       </a>
       .  They both tell me that it was ovoid/spherical in shape, metallic in appearance, and hovering over treetops.  My son said he got such a close look at the object that he could see plating of the metal.  His exact quote was that “It looked like the Death Star from Star Wars.”

       You're probably more likely to see a UFO if you live in a

        hotspot

       "Aliens" do exist somewhere in the universe, and this is pretty much 100% true (well 99.99 and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
       The chances of them having visited earth or knowing about our existence is the opposite, essentially 0 percent. The first radiowaves were sent out by humans less than 200 years ago and those signals were so weak that there is no way they could be picked up by an alien species. Also, by the nature of radio waves and how they disperse, it will be next to impossible to communicate with them in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I believe that at some point within the next 10,000 years, if we do not destroy our species before then, we will be able to contact some life form, assuming there is another one in our galaxy. We will eventually discover some way to create almost free energy with some crazy discovery in particle physics. Maybe it's that warp drive nasa is talking about. Maybe we discover an energy efficient way to create matter/antimatter drives. Hell, maybe we find a way to interact with dark matter or a way to harness gravity as a means of energy. These all seem like crazy ideas now, but physics is crazy and humans will never stop trying to play god and understand/control the universe.
