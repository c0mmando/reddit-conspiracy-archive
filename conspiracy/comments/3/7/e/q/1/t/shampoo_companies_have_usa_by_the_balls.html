        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Americans spend 2-3x more on shampoo than europeans. Allot of this can be attributed to clever marketing by the shampoo companies, convincing us of the need to wash our hair daily.</p>

<p>Its very simple really.  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102062969">your body has a natural and healthy oil/ ph level that it likes to stay at</a>.  When you constantly, on a daily basis strip your skin of its natural oils, it starts going into overdrive to compensate, which causes an excess of oil production, which most people respond to by washing it even more... its a viscous cycle.</p>

<p>What  most people dont realize though is that this is not the natural amount of oil that a scalp wants to produce, and their oil glands are in overdrive due to excessive washing.  This is exactly what the shampoo companies want from us.  </p>

<p>If you can get through the first 2 weeks of having an oily scalp, after that your head will tremendously back off the amount of oil it produces, and you&#39;ll find that washing once or twice per week will produce better feeling hair than did daily washing previously.  </p>

<p><strong>Dont let this shampoo propaganda conspiracy continue!!</strong> get over the 2 week hump!  they&#39;re stealing hundreds of dollars from all of you every year..</p>

<p>Obviously though if you exercise, wash your damn hair afterwards lol.</p>

<p>Edit: this thread got way more attention than i thought it would lol.  Glad to know my r/conspiracy brethren are knowledgable about their bodies :)</p>

<p><strong>ALSO</strong> i didn&#39;t really emphasize the more important part of cutting back on shampooing daily... better than the money you&#39;ll save,  your hair will feel NOTICEABLY better!  But dont take my word for it, look it up!  or ask a hair stylist!  </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;ve found that cool water works best on a daily basis. Once or twice a week or so I mix two tablespoons of baking soda with a cup of water and use that as shampoo as soon as I get in the shower. I rinse, then immediately follow up organic apple cider vinegar, which I let sit while I finish showering. </p>

<p>My hair looks great, smells great, feels great. I used to have itchiness and flaky gross shit. That&#39;s all gone now. </p>

<p>You&#39;re supposed to condition afterwards, broheim.</p>

<p>Kinda like the Trinity killer.</p>

<p>EDIT: What are the downvotes for?  Shampooing without conditioning causes unmanageable hair, and you can&#39;t use scalding hot water to clean any part of your body.  Do words not mean anything anymore?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, everyone is different. You say you don&#39;t have hair issues, that&#39;s great. </p>

<p>But know that I too thought I had extremely healthy hair. Every time I went to the barber, they would compliment my thick, healthy head of hair. </p>

<p>But then one suggested I try less shampoo when I wanted to grow the hair out longer and start styling it more. I listened, tried doing it once a week with conditioner every now and then between, and now my hair is even better than before. </p>

<p>So even though I probably did have healthy hair before.. it&#39;s better now. Daily shampoo is not necessary or recommended for everyone. Only certain people need it. </p>

<p>The experts agree: Only a small group needs to shampoo daily, like those with very fine hair, someone who exercises a lot (and sweats), or someone living in very humid place, Goh says.
“If you have oily scalp, then daily washing is needed,” she explains.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, people think they have dry scalp because they have dandruff, but in those situations, more frequent washing is also helpful.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have always washed my hair only once a week. With the exception if I had been doing dirty work and/or got all sweaty, of course. But since I go most days without getting all dirty and sweaty, I haven&#39;t the need to wash my hair everyday. I&#39;ll go a week, or until my hair begins to &quot;clump&quot; together in thick sections, before washing it. As a result, my hair is silky smooth and soft to the touch, and I get compliments on how shiny my hair is. It&#39;s a good thing.</p>

<p>Neither that nor using less shampoo was ever any better for my hair.</p>

<p>Basically, avoiding parabens and sulfates and as many other complicated organic molecules is the best you can do for your health.  Our hair will naturally become drier, brittler, and less voluminous as we age.  Life is as it is and cannot be fixed until we have a more thorough understanding of genetic engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really hard to avoid the parabens and sulfates. I did the no-poo thing and my hair looked awesome, but I felt like it was never clean (and my hairbrush agreed, it was full of woolybears).</p>

<p>I found through trial and error that methylisothiazolinone and methylpropothiazolinone (not checking that I got those right, pretty sure they&#39;re wrong, but anyone who&#39;s read a shampoo bottle knows what I&#39;m talking about) cause me to have acne, so cutting down shampoo/conditioning to once a week clears up my skin. But good luck finding shampoo and conditioner without those chemicals. And if you do, it&#39;s always got wax or something that also reacts.</p>

<p>So my shower looks like an insane person&#39;s, I&#39;ve got 15 different types of shampoos and conditioners in an attempt to find something I don&#39;t react to. </p>

<p>Bar soap or Dr. Bronner&#39;s and apple cider vinegar in water work a treat, actually, but then my head inevitably smells like a salad when I sweat.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a serious market for a mass-market hair cleaning product that doesn&#39;t cause more problems than it solves. Proof: the amount of money people spend on Wen (which apparently causes people&#39;s hair to fall out. For me, I did lose a handful AND have a breakout. Thanks, guys!).</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/778248">Skin commensals are required for the development of protective immunity against a cutaneous pathogen.</a></p>

<p>Skin is sterilized because you don&#39;t want to introduce those commensals beyond the dermis ... and because hospitals carry some very ugly pathogens.  However, those commensals are vital components of a properly functioning immune system.  Culture them, don&#39;t kill them.</p>

<p>As for the human digestion, we encode about 20 enzymes for digesting carbohydrates, but the rest are expressed by bacteria in our gut.  Furthermore, a wide range of vitamins and other compounds are produced predominately by bacteria in our gut from the food we eat.</p>

<p>If we were herbivores, closer to 100 percent of our digestion would be facilitated by bacteria.  As it is, only 60 percent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly!   After everything i typed out Its weird to see people still saying &quot;i have to wash my hair everyday because its Oily&quot;...  the whole point is that most people dont know their natural oil levels because they&#39;ve never experienced them!  Try shampooing once a week for 2-3 weeks and THEN see how much oil your head produces.  I highly suspect your oil levels will go down, leaving you with naturally healthier hair! :) </p>

<p>And what exactly do you use instead of soap?  What alternatives are there to soap?  Rolling around in the dirt like an animal with thick, grey skin and tick problems?  Tallow soap has been around for hundreds of years.  It cleans things when you get it wet and scrub really, really hard.  It&#39;s one thing to take the reasonable position of being against antibacterial soap.  But you absolutely need to use a surfactant/detergent solution to remove dirt and detritus from your body on a regular basis for proper hygiene and health.</p>

<p>I can compare this to the excessive medication of the USA population, now that is a way more severe issue: <a href="http://www.thefix.com/content/america-consumes-80-all-prescription-painkillers">http://www.thefix.com/content/america-consumes-80-all-prescription-painkillers</a></p>

I read an article a while back, which i am far to lazy to track down for

I believe that with the presence of antacids, the body stops producing natural antacids. I stopped using them and now I never use them. And I still eat the same greasy shit that I did before.</p>

<p>Also, deodorant.  Google the loufa method to cleanse your pits.  Years of using antiperspirant have probably clogged your pores.
