<p><a href="/u/fck_off_reddit">/u/fck_off_reddit</a> </p>

<p>Dude reading through your comments, I think it&#39;s not what you said, it&#39;s how you said it. You went against the grain, but you did it like a total dick.</p>

<p>&quot;The only consolation I receive from reading the stupid in these threads is that I am too old to be drafted and most of these fucktards are going to wake up to reality right around the time a bullet flies by their face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, I don&#39;t want war, but if the people in the US are going to be so fucking stupid and fooled again and never fucking learn, then maybe they deserve to be cannon fodder for the oligarchs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, a person with a brain and an accurate world-view.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is truly amazing and sickening to watch the mental-gymnastics of the people on this website.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds about right for a typical user of this sub.&quot;</p>

<p>You started off just stating your opinion(albeit strongly) and just ended up with conterversal marked comments within a few points +/- 0. Then you went all apeshit and got condescending.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that deserves a ban, but it&#39;s up to the mods of the sub, and if you state an unpopular opinion to a crowd that doesn&#39;t want to hear it, then get rude and insulting when people don&#39;t agree, what do you expect?</p>

<p>You will never effectively change minds being vitriolic and rude.  There are different people and opinions, and to sway them, you have to appeal to them, not put them off.  Really, going at them like that, then posting it here just serves to prove what they believe, that you are a nutter and a dick.  </p>

<p>If you stated your opinions respectfully, and gave thoughtful responses, you might actually make some people think.  But instead you just invalidated everything you said by being a douche about it. </p>

<p>I get frustrated too, but I understand people, and to a degree, how to reach them.  This is not the way.</p>

<p>For clarity, I&#39;m not discussing whether you are right or wrong at all, just that you presented yourself in a way that was begging for someone to get pissed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, but you gotta realize if you want to play on their turf, you gotta play by their rules.  </p>

<p>If you want to sway opinion, do it from inside the community, not barging in and smashing around.  </p>

<p>Be subtle, be smart, be charming, be convincing.  </p>

<p>Being a dick is literally causing the opposite outcome to what you want.</p>

<p>Imagine the difference between someone coming to this sub and calling us nutjobs vs someone coming here and just posing questions and respectfully disagreeing.  One would get downvoted to hell and never seen, the other would spawn a real discussion.</p>

<p>That is not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">objective premise</a> because some may have valid reasons to lay some responsibility on Russia for this mess whether you agree or not.</p>

<p>For instance, Russia interfered with an unprecedented trade deal between the Ukraine and the EU before Hunter Biden became a director on the board of a holding firm that owns Ukrainian oil companies.  The world would be pissed if the U.S. interfered with Canada&#39;s trade with the EU in that manner.</p>

I mean, I don&#39;t want war, but if the people in the US are going to be so fucking stupid and fooled again and never fucking learn, then maybe they deserve to be cannon fodder for the ogliarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anyone wants to read the chronological list of events of what actually went down in Ukraine and how the US/Russia play in all this, I&#39;ve been assembling info for the past year and a half:</p>

<p>tl:dr; US sponsors coup to install a pro-western leader in Ukraine. The east of Ukraine who are all very pro Russian don&#39;t like this and want to separate since this new president does not represent them. Same with Crimea who have been begging for Russia to &quot;annex&quot; them since 1991. Russia annexes Crimea. The east of Ukraine pleads for Russia to do the same to them, but Putin does not for some reason. The Ukrainian government then sends in the army to kill any of the civilians talking about separatism in the east and so the civil war breaks out. Russia helps the eastern separatists. Ukraine bombs cities full of civilians for months on end, but Russia is somehow labeled the bad guy for helping civilians defend themselves against their own Ukrainian government who keeps shelling their cities and killing them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit is a controlled source. The rich and powerful know how to use the internet in a way common users would never think to do. People are predictable, and can be manipulated through media. While most know this, the newest generation seems to think that they are beyond bias because they can read what they want and have their beliefs constantly reaffirmed. </p>

<p>So you end up with what Reddit is now. Controlled, calculated, and safe. Dissenters are easily silenced, and the guys with their heads in the sand get little breathing tubes so they never have to take their heads out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahahahhahahahahahahahaha wait you&#39;re still under the impression that reddit is about free speech and opening eyes to important issues? Reddit runs on a karma system, a point value system with inherent flaws. The atmosphere created by this system does only ensures that mainstream thought is allowed to exist as well as creating a mob mentality. Only very popular ideas and whatever is meme relevant will be accepted, and the way the site is run ensures that content is filtered by individuals not held to any actual standards and can easily filter to pander to their agenda. Long live reddit! </p>

<p>Here&#39;s some tips to get tons of karma and avoid being banned.</p>

<p>1)defend gay rights 
2)women&#39;s rights 
3)anything hipster 
4)weed 
5)talk shit on the government 
6)get outraged anytime anyone else does 
7)CONFORM - ANYTHING AGAINST THE GRAIN WILL BE DOWN VOTED INTO OBLIVION OR BANNED. REDDIT RULE TO TRUMP ALL OTHER RULES, DO NOT THINK FOR YOURSELF. CONFORM. UP VOTES ARE LIFE, THE COLLECTIVE IS KING. </p>
