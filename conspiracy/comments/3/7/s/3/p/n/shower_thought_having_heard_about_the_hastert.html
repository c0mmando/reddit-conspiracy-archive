       Now admittedly, I'm not a conspiracy theorist. First time here really. I just know that I googled this and nothing came up and I wanted a place to share my crazy speculation, have you guys heard about the 1980s/90s Washington DC pedophile ring conspiracy? If you haven't, the gist of it is that high ranking republicans took part in a child sex ring and covered it up. There was this mentally unstable woman that brought a lot of this to light, but due to her fragile mental state it's hard to know if she was just crazy. She alleged that her son was kidnapped and sold into sex slavery (I believe this part to be true.) she then talks about how she believes that he worked at the White House and was given a new life (this is where she loses me, I believe she had a mental break or something and lost it.).
      </p>
      <p>
       What's shocking about the story though is that you can, like a good conspiracy, tie the dots together and find some nuggets of truth in the story.
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations">
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_child_prostitution_ring_allegations
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone was allegedly assassinated and you have a bunch of "witnesses" who claim to know the truth. It's a very intesting story regardless. See Sword and Scale Episode 5 for the whole story. or just google it.
       <a href="http://swordandscale.com/sword-and-scale-episode-5/">
        http://swordandscale.com/sword-and-scale-episode-5/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway that whole story got me thinking about how around the same time you had the British taking part in a similar child sex ring. Assuming this alleged one existed at all. But yeah, it's all but proven that the British had a child sex ring going during this time period. I've heard it's alleged and likely that Thatcher covered up child sex abuse in her government even.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now Hastert has been indicted on corruption and giving money to strange sources. Allegedly to a minor at the school that he used to work at. Now okay, the conspiracy could be bullshit. Likely is. But there is a lot of coincidence here you know what I mean?
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do you think? Is my idea silly? I suppose time will tell, but given things of this nature you can't help but wonder if the unnamed former student will have an accident or something like that, to prevent further secrets from spilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR it's all bullshit, no offense. But I really like the connections that probably don't exist that kind of do here. Watcha think?

       Well, the thing is - a lot of this stuff is in plain sight. The Franklin scandal has been extensively documented, we know a little bit about what goes on in DC, but not a lot, a lot's still underground, but dig around and you'll see plenty of newspaper stories that cover this kind of scandal. Then there's the UK, holy hell...Great Britain appears to be riddled with a cancer that sounds impossible to be cut out. Who's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       involved in government and the BBC there? And that's the big stuff...poke your nose around local police departments wherever you are, in old money areas specifically...
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish this stuff wasn't true. I hope it isn't true. But evidence keeps appearing. No one does anything about it for why? We do so much to "protect children," we use that as a banner for all kinds of atrocious things, yet we still allow children to be victimized by these monsters because they have money, they have power, they have connections, and the whole thought that this stuff is actually happening, that it is commonplace in certain high levels of Western society, is so repellent it hurts us to look at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to think about, another thing I often think about is - we have this "surveillance state." They interrupt and record our phone calls, they look at our boobies and laugh, they monitor our network transmissions, filter and sift and cc: foreign nations...and yet no one appears to lift a finger to stop the most repellent crime committed by the elite (and the murders of whistleblowers who have tried to do something about it).
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is complicit in the cancer and the system is composed of people. Very compromised people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't think it's odd that someone told someone else everything - they literally are not afraid. As you say further down, "that unstable lady," right? No one wants to believe this kind of evil is true - tell that unstable lady anything you want, no one will believe her. They'd rather believe she was unstable than that such evil is real. I know I would.

       i think that is an over-simplification on the part about the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       point one: you seem pretty dead-set on her being unreliable, so why pursue it?
      </p>
      <p>
       point two: The NSA is good for something,
       <em>
        just not good for its citizens
       </em>
       . the sooner that people realize that the US Intelligence apparatus is used predominantly for Corporate interests, the sooner people can give the United States, back to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       ps. the NSA and the other Intelligence services are chock a block full of well meaning people, but the way its compartmentalized, means that those well meaning people dont know about the damaging effects of their efforts.

       Care to elaborate on these names?

       Edit: Jeff Gannon is the alleged son of that unstable lady right? I'm sorry man, like I said in my OP she loses me on that part. Still awesome story absolutely.

      <p>
       I'm not someone who is into conspiracies and it's probably mostly the S&amp;S episode that sold this one to me, but I do think this one believable. Just not the part about her son still being alive. Sadly I imagine her son is dead.

       And as far as my interest in conspiracies, I used to believe a lot of them. Then I decided that a lot of them are ridiculous, no offense. I suppose you can say I am interested from a storytelling standpoint a lot. Tabletop games like Cthulhu and World of Darkness deal with conspiracies and esoteric knowledge and I like them a lot. So 'real life' inspiration is interesting.

       Esoteric as in Cain and Abel were of different bloodlines which is why Cain killed Abel. Also, the serpent in the garden didn't tempt eve with an apple, but with his boner in her hoo hoo. (the serpent wasn't a snake). This made Adam and Pappa pretty mad. Free Masons and many occult societies teach this.

       That's the problem. You should never believe in anything, that's where people fail. You should always be trying to prove your beliefs false which is the key to knowledge.

        WMR's State Department sources have also reported that the visits of Hastert and other congressional leaders and staff members to certain Southeast Asian nations and the Northern Marianas should come under the scrutiny of the House Ethics Committee, now officially investigating "Pagegate." The Northern Marianas became infamous in the scandals involving Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff because of the presence in the US slave labor territory of Asian children being used as prostitutes. Conveniently, Foley co-chaired the House Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, which would have had authority to investigate charges of child prostitution in the Northern Marianas.

        Hastert was a teacher and wrestling coach in Yorkville, Illinois between 1965 and 1981 before entering politics. Federal prosecutors indicted Hastert on Thursday for lying to the FBI about $3.5 million he agreed to pay to an undisclosed person to "cover up past misconduct."
       </p>
       <p>
        A federal law enforcement official confirmed to CNN early Friday evening that the former student was a male and a minor when the alleged abuse took place. Federal law enforcement officials also said that investigators decided not to pursue a possible extortion case in the matter.

       But also we have sources saying they've been preparing to do this for two years. Meaning that if this is part of a coverup of any sort, the offending action was a while ago. Slow revenge? Seems weird to me you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly more likely that some good people just caught on. Maybe it isn't even connected to a conspiracy.

       Here's another angle - since the dalliance with boys was presumably known about for some time and no one ever did anything about it until now, what has Hastert been up to lately?
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting to note that he's one of the top lobbyists to Turkey:
       <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/how-lobbyists-still-fly-through-loopholes-20140110">
        http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/how-lobbyists-still-fly-through-loopholes-20140110
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's he been working on lately? Wonder if this is related to any of the other scandals we've seen lately? FIFA? Clinton foundation? Who knows, but worth pulling some threads, I sadly suspect we'll find something and it won't be about protecting kids, it'll be about protecting money somewhere...
