Not as an ecylpse of any of that ofcourse, I mean I watched this vid and a guy flew this ballon up...here let me just link it...<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGW9bIx_e8">Source</a>, anyways, if the earth is flat like the flat earth model shows then you could show me the sun, and then pan and show me the moon, right? So, I ask seriously now, if those that hold the flat earth view could either a) show me this, that would be cool, or b) explain why that&#39;s not how it works. I ligit want to know, and thanks for your time in advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstand the timing of the earth&#39;s rotation and moon&#39;s revolution. The moon isn&#39;t always on the opposite side of the earth from the sun... it&#39;s movement doesn&#39;t align to a 24hour period. Sometimes it&#39;s up for half the day and half the night, it varies.</p>

How much more clearly do I need to make this? It&#39;s not a call out, I really want to know, because if the earth is flat, and ya want to prove it, that picture does just that.</p>

<p>--If the earth were flat, and the sun and the moon moved around in a path over it like in your video, then the moon and the sun would get bigger as they go overhead and smaller as they move away over another part of the disc. They do not change sizes like that.</p>

<p>--<a href="http://i.imgur.com/2XmmBd5.jpg">Here&#39;s a photo I took at sunset in March</a>. Do you know what those long shadow lines are?? Those are shadows cast by objects (mountains, or possibly clouds) that are beyoud the horizon but when the sun goes away, <em>around</em> the curve of the earth, enough to no longer shine on us, it is still illuminating the sky above us, as it could only in a round-Earth model. Except it can&#39;t shine through those mountains, so the &quot;stripes&quot; in the sky.</p>

<p><strong>THE EARTH IS NOT FLAT!</strong> Geez</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are going to have to think harder and give us more than saying &quot;are not correct&quot;.</p>

<p>I have watched the ball of the sun, and the moon, rise from behind the horizon and set behind the horizon dozens of times if not hundreds.</p>

<p>In your flat-Earth model in the video, that would be impossible. The sun and moon would always be <em>up</em>. How would &quot;the distance involved&quot; make that possible???</p>

<p>Dig in, my friend, and give me your reflection on that.</p>

<p>Maybe you would claim that as one gets further away it gets lost in the haze, can&#39;t shine through that much atmosphere. Okay, but like I said, I&#39;ve seen it go behind the <em>land</em> and the <em>water</em> on cloudless horizons, I recommend trying to take a look someday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was more clear. But I don&#39;t understand how you would achieve a picture like that even in the flat earth model. How could you get a picture that showed all of that detail at the same time? No camera can see that far and in that wide of an angle at the same time. Even if the earth were flat it would still be huge. You&#39;re asking the impossible.  </p>

<p>Just to clarify I don&#39;t believe in flat earth. But I also don&#39;t agree with your theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>now that&#39;s what I&#39;m talkin about. Can we get one from a higher altitude? Higher the better, as it&#39;s harder to refute, certainly because if the flat earth model is true, then the sun and moon are the same size, for the most part, so a high alt. shot would provide both orbs. It&#39;d be the nailed it, right? I&#39;m just sayin&#39;, if i wanted to prove without a doubt the earth was flat, that&#39;s what I&#39;d do. But I don&#39;t personally have resource like that, and I get that&#39;s part of the deception, thus why I presented my question on reddit, so those with better resource than me can perhaps settle my mind on this thing once and for all. I know no one is obligated to, and other than the saran wraps, I&#39;ve really appericated everything in the thread so far. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe in a flat world. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnzUgKZ8m2k">high altitude horizon shot</a> alongside the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLlNKy5j_O8">superior-mirage</a> (as they call it) is all the evidence one needs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously flat and the only way around that is denial. Cognitive dissonance is incredible.</p>

<p>EDIT: <strong>The high altitude balloon linked to in this post provides a view of the sun and the moon higher up.</strong></p>

<p>I applaud you for even having the idea to fly your own balloon up and pan around.  You will have to research more mathematics to understand why this won&#39;t work. I think the small angle approximation might be worth considering as a basis for determining how high to fly the balloon.  I would do this before jumping to a conclusion on this issue based off of some youtube video and an internet forum post. </p>

The curve would be huge at that height, which is exactly why this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f-K-XnHi9I">Red Bull Jump From &#39;Space&#39;</a> uses a GoPro to fake a curve (which, in this case, is far too much).

<p>At 100,000 feet the curve becomes apparent.</p>

<p>Generally photos below that height don&#39;t see the curve because... It&#39;s a very very very big sphere and the amount of curve is almost indistinguishable. They also lack the correct FOV to see it. Of course at that heigh the horizon becomes quit obscured and many &quot;measurements&quot; that people do (i.e. photoshops of lines) are measuring a guess at where the horizon is.</p>

<p>If the Earth were flat I could see farther than the few miles to the horizon.</p>

<p>If the Earth were flat I could see the Rocky mountains fron the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p>There is no curvature at 100,000 feet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true at all. It&#39;s actually a rather small sphere and the curve should be obvious at 10,000 and 20,000 feet based on the dimensions we&#39;re given. At 100,000 feet the horizon should be far below eye level and drastically curved if it&#39;s a ball, but it&#39;s always eye level and flat because it isn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can, with the aid of some sort of magnification. I already linked to an example previously,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure, but they&#39;re so far away that you can&#39;t distinguish them from the horizon... Not to mention there&#39;s stuff in the way and you would need some incredible lenses.</p>

<p>No, not &quot;drastically curved&quot;. 25,000 miles in circumfrence.</p>

<p>HAHAHAHAHAHA.</p>

<p>Get a load of this guy.</p>

<p>Let me break out my telescope, which I regularly use to look at the moon and check out some mountains- oh wait.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, but they&#39;re so far away that you can&#39;t distinguish them from the horizon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. That&#39;s complete bullshit. The rocky mountains are HUGE and would be readily apparent from both the naked eye and &quot;magic telescoping vision machines&quot; long before they actually are if the earth were flat.</p>

<p>But they aren&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>. Not to mention there&#39;s stuff in the way and you would need some incredible lenses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What, like the wide open plains?</p>

<p>In the whole middle of North America there&#39;s nothing but flat land for miles. And yet... no Rocky mountains- even with my magic telescope i use to look quite closely at <em>the moon</em>.  Staring into the horizon from the midwest the horion is nothing but flat. That horion is nothing but prairie and sky. There&#39;s no rocky mountains getting muddled in there. It&#39;s also why climbing <em>up</em> something, like a mountain or tall building lets you see farther.</p>

<p>Same goes for coastal mountain ranges viewed from the Pacific. I can&#39;t see them becuase they&#39;re obscured by the earth but because they&#39;re &quot;too far away&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wanna be sent up, like we all do. Sadly, that wont happen.  Like I said, low earth orbit !== space travel. So do we have GPS satellites, yeah. But, have we been to the moon or beyond the Van Allen Belt? Just asking questions, homie, and playing devil&#39;s advocate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say how far humans have gone, but I&#39;m pretty damned sure we&#39;ve sent probes to the far reaches of the solar system. The Van Allen Belt has always been a bit of a problem for me, especially since that statement last year about finally working out how to survive getting past it or whatever he said. But back in the day, they just slapped up some mylar and said, &quot;that should do it!&quot; </p>

<p>Astronauts have actually talked about seeing things as particles shot through their brains....  But I never looked at the numbers for cancer in apollo astronauts, so I have no idea if there&#39;s a correlation or not.</p>

<p>All this said, we were talking about whether the earth is flat, and whether humans have left orbit doesn&#39;t really have a bearing on that, because even low earth orbit requires a spherical earth.</p>

<p>This is an important point.</p>

<p>The particular video everyone refers to as saying &quot;we can&#39;t go past the Van Allen Belts&quot; never actually says anything like that.</p>

<p>The point the speaker was addressing is that yeah, this isn&#39;t the 1960s anymore. We need <em>better</em> methods of doing it. People got by in the past because the exposure time was so brief.  Whatever our <em>current</em> model of space-exploration craft is needs to meet a modern metric of safety and design.  Back in the 1960s we realized we could launch people to the moon in rickety tin cans. However, we&#39;ve moved beyond that and want to find a <em>better</em> way of doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>At 100,000 feet the curve becomes apparent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no curvature at 100,000 feet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Generally photos below that height don&#39;t see the curve because... It&#39;s a very very very big sphere and the amount of curve is almost indistinguishable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true at all. It&#39;s actually a rather small sphere and the curve should be obvious at 10,000 and 20,000 feet based on the dimensions we&#39;re given. At 100,000 feet the horizon should be far below eye level and drastically curved if it&#39;s a ball, but it&#39;s always eye level and flat because it isn&#39;t.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Earth were flat I could see farther than the few miles to the horizon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can, with the aid of some sort of magnification. I already linked to an example previously,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the Earth were flat I could see the Rocky mountains fron the Atlantic ocean.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but they&#39;re so far away that you can&#39;t distinguish them from the horizon... Not to mention there&#39;s stuff in the way and you would need some incredible lenses.</p>
