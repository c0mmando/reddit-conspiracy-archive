    <div class="md"><p>Ross Perot helped Clinton win the election. It didn&#39;t really matter though, as Clinton was vetted as compromised (sexual predator,) and had been working with Bush and the CIA on cocaine running in Arkansas that tied into Iran Contra. All that mattered to Bush was that Perot didn&#39;t end up as President, which would have temporarily stymied his lifelong quest for a New World Order.</p>

<p>I remember as a kid the press portrayed him as not being hip as Clinton after having played the sax on Arsenio. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clinton delivered NAFTA is why. Bush Sr. publicly complained that the main problem with stealing wealth was that you tend to destroy it at the same time. It seems the correct strategy was employed up to and including the bail outs of the banks and subsequent concentration of wealth in the upper classes who, later, Shrub called his base laughing drunk in front of the engineers of 911 and multiple wars that followed, and that continue today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure. But they planned to get the office back by 2003. ZetaTalk explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Starting with the revelations learned after the Roswell era, when the secret government, MJ12, and their many members in the corporate community, ultra wealthy, heads of some other countries like Britain and Russia, learned of the approaching passage of Planet X and its consequences, they started laying plans.Is it any surprise that Dubya is in the White House at this time, seeing his father&#39;s grip on many aspects of how the government works over the decades? It was all planned!</strong> Check back to the Reagan era, when the same crowd was behind getting Reagan into the White House - Cheney, Rumsfled, Schultz, Pearl, and the like. To put restrictions into place too soon raises suspicion, so it was laid out to occur after a terrorism incident, so as not to look like what it was - a determination to control the populace. The OK City explosion, the downing of TWA800, all pre-runners to 911, as they were determined to have a cause for martial law and civil rights restrictions. </p>

<p><strong>They aimed for 2003, as we have consistently stated this would be the year of the pole shift, leading them to stretch out too early with these moves.</strong> Now there is resistance to the restrictions they wanted to impose, and many are being lifted or at least resisted. All part of our plan, when we issued the White Lie about &#39;shortly after May 15, 2003&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, those guys are really self-important.</p>

<p>So, from what I can tell they&#39;re claiming they made a &quot;white lie&quot; about a polar shift occurring in 2003, and given that some nobodies like Zetatalk are onto the &quot;real deal&quot;, the evil government believed this, despite having access to thousands of scientists, equipment and resources, whilst Zetatalk has... nothing as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>...and the government &quot;fell for it&quot;?</p>
