       is the manual presented to local governmental leaders explaining some of what will be going on. The manual says it will start July 15th, but I have read a significant number of other sources stating that it will start today, a month early. I posted 6 additional sources on some user's comment to "Put them here." so just look for a snide comment and follow the thread down.

       I was in the Coast Guard from 2003 on. RIMPAC wasn't a big deal. It had more external agencies cooperating, but at just over 18,000 individuals participating, and not on mainland America, it was really nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       1200 'service members' are supposed to be in compact areas of Texas alone. That doesn't account for the civilian and other agencies involved in one single area. Add to that the fact that hard figures of participants, with some even being considered clandestine or hostile, are non existent, and we don't have a solid figure with Jade Helm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point is that there are an extraordinary number of law enforcement agencies involved here, and this is all taking place on mainland soil, with certain entire states being considered hostile. Just look at the PDF that was released: there are insurgent and compliant states, with others leaning one way or the other on the peripheral, and pockets of insurgent groups within compliant states. This can only be training for how to deal with Americans on American soil. The PDF even states that the training is to give participants the knowledge of how to fight in new, urban areas. I mean, come on.

       So? If there's a large scale civil disturbance, preparation and coordination are required to minimize loss of life. The current government wouldn't just roll over in the case of a civil war 2 and being prepared is what the military is all about. The fact that this large scale of coordination hasn't happened yet is surprising. There are all kinds of disaster drills that don't require the same level of response as a civil war would and with all of the rioting and unrest that's been happening lately, it makes sense to have a plan in place that can be executed quickly, especially if things go wrong quickly. What happens if a cartel/terrorist organization gets a hold in the US? Territories get taken over and have to be deemed hostile. This isn't about fighting Americans, it's about being prepared to fight enemies, foreign and domestic. As a member of the military, you should know better than to stir the pot when you don't have all the facts instead of contributing to the overall level of panic and paranoia.

       Wow, that's insane. I was flying a helicopter in Arma 3 last night and I blinked, and it was like the power flickered. I wonder if it's related. Government using Arma 3 players to control the real world confirmed!?!?!??&gt;?!

       Conspiracy theories are like doomsday theories, the dates keep changing every time after nothing happens. "Obama changed his mind, he is invading Texas next month!" To believers, keep a log of the   theories, and after they miss 3 dates, just stop worrying about it.

       I wouldn't have thought this administration would do a lot of what has already been done, so who knows? I understand where you're coming from, but doesn't it seem like they are becoming more and more brazen in how they do things?

       I agree, OP set me straight. After all, one year ago, if you told me Obama was gunna tell the most powerful union by influence, that is, the truckers' union, that the government overrides thier union codes, I would've laughed in your face. "A Dem tell any union off, much less the truckers???? LMFAOUID (laughing my fucking ass off until i die)" And yet, today, we have just that. God only knows the moves by now, because everyone, and i do mean everyone, is fuckin crazy.

       I'm confused. Where is it confirmed it's starting a month early? That 'concerned citizen' just gave a statement with no source, and the screenshot said that emergency drill for police, fire, and medical was yesterday at 6:00PM. I don't see anything in the link that explicitly states it's starting today
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I did some digging, I just see a lot of blogs making claims of this with nothing substantial. Also, looked into the EMP and nothing really jumps out to me as conclusive...

       George - it was the first document of its kind that enshrined the accountability of everyone for their crimes, including monarchs. It set out the law saying that the king, or your local landowner could not send his henchmen to barge into your home without legal authorisation. It also set out how a person accused of a crime would be judged - by trial by jury, rather than some local bigwig deciding you should be hanged, drawn and quartered because, er,  they have toothache dammit.

       If you don't know what's going on. This is a drill. Then we get the next 9/11 they're preparing and clearly laying breadcrumbs for. Then it's not a drill.

      <p>
       It's on for 3 months, we're almost guaranteed to see the attack by the end. Must be over a month since the "we will burn America" propaganda video. Now IS is out there making all kinds of threats against the US and we keep getting told they have: Chemical weapons experts, the capability of building a dirty bomb, capability of making chemical weapons. We also saw dirty bomb drills in April. It's been a year this month that Cheney said not only is it coming but it will be far deadlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there's more than that out there. I'd like to think maybe this won't happen but clearly we're being told it will and they need this to pass the authorization for war. Then they can get into

       Well we've seen tons of military assets transported all over the country and more troops are ready for what's coming. I don't know what they're going to do with Russia in Syria, looks like they're trying negotiations first. Since it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it won't happen. They've laid many more breadcrumbs since then.

       They are in no rush. Exercises will continue until there is an actual event. Martial Law is a very real possibility for most Western countries and it's clear our governments want increased control over us and see us all as a potential threat. Back in 98 we didn't have the Patriot Act. It's like the frog in the boiling pot of water. It's a slower process, in our case it's decades.

       How am I talking out of my ass? Martial Law was declared in Boston. Justified or not, it happened. Martial Law will be declared in the future somewhere. Am I talking out of my ass saying that they exercise to practice drills for real events? The whole point of exercises is to prepare for real events and situations that they think are probable. Hmm looking at Baltimore, I wonder why they would be worried about civil unrest. I'm just talking out of my ass using real world examples like the patriot act.

       No it was not declared in Boston. I don't even think you know what Martial Law even means when you say stuff like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was declared in Boston was called "Shelter in Place" which is 100% voluntary.

       Martial Law is the imposition of the highest-ranking military officer as the military governor or as the head of the government, thus removing all power from the previous executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.

       Ok, granted I was mistaken with Martial Law. The media hype blew the Shelter in Place out of proportion. From what I witnessed with the lock down and amount of police, it looked like martial law. I don't think anything is going to happen in September and will agree that it is not a conspiracy. However, they always learn something and the tactics they practice be applied domestically and internationally. Flexibility is a good thing. I don't know USASOC purpose with Jade Helm and I guess most domestic military operations or exercises could be seen as threatening to some.

       Thank you for clarifying your beliefs. 
While distrust in government can be healthy at times, seeing domestic military exercises in this matter is nothing novel or new. 
Some people take their distrust to dark places and confirmation bias 
and echo chamber discussions do nothing to ease the distrust.
      </p>
      <p>
       This exercise has been blown way out of proportion by the conspiracy theory crowd, and wild accusations and claims run rampant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can only hope the credibility of those who are certain Martial Law will happen via Jade Helm, receive the tarnished reputations they deserve.

       You have a point. These types of exercises have been going on for decades. Can you really say that nothing happened in 1998? Did you have unrestricted access to San Francisco's public works, political offices, and all Armed Forces involved with the Op? Just because Alex Jones was wrong (again) does not mean nothing happened. I mean, I'm sorry, but it seems to me that because YOU didn't see anything change, you truly believe that nothing did.

       It's your exact attitude towards any Gov action based on your responses of late. "Well the US didn't turn into
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       in the first 24 hours so it's all bullshit". That is very limited thinking. You are completely unwilling to even entertain thoughts about it because you think it's so absolutely batshit crazy of a claim, when in fact, it's not at all. Every single ruling body and government in history has been corrupt on some level. Humans abuse power. Calling people idiots for thinking about it and discussing it is absolutely useless and only serves your Ego.

       I've been wondering why I've been seeing SO MUCH military activity in my area (I live in a town Near Ft. Carson in Colorado). Being that close to a military base, I've seen some motion before in the previous years. But in the past month or two, I've been seeing convoy after convoy come through the entire Southern Colorado region. I travel through the southern area of the state a lot and about a week ago, I saw this really long convoy pulled over on the side of the highway and they were all patrolling (?) the grounds near the highway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see them almost every day now, and it makes me wonder what's really happening, because something is changing. We wouldn't be seeing all of this military activity for no reason. Through this thread, some rather interesting light has been shed...

       I live in Pueblo and commute to Canon City and Springs often for work and other activities. Over the past week I've seen the same huge convoys. No idea what they are doing. Been looking for some answers but haven't seen anything. It's kinda off putting.

       I also live in Pueblo, but commute to Fowler. I saw a huge one today on the interstate going north over by the City Center exit... It was so long and there were pallets upon pallets of supplies wrapped in plastic. They were thin too, like they were food or clothes. Hell, could even be guns, but it was really different from the tanks and larger vehicles usually being carried

       Super strange. We probably saw the same one today then. I passed them entering the highway from 50 east exit. Also saw a giant convoy on Saturday out near the P-west walmart.

       Our eyes are open. We are watching and listening as much as we can and I think we can collectively band together in a way to be sentinels of truth and wisdom, yet we are witnessing activities mimicking alarming military scenarios. Why rehearse for a show you never plan to perform? Especially when the rehearsals are extensively widespread as of late.

       well actually like a month ago Indiana supreme court ruled that in that state they can enter homes without a warrant.
which is very intriguing being that with the 'shooting' in TN then they decide to arm national guardsmen in that state along with Florida, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas...etc ohhhh the irony i guess right? lol

       Umm, no. You can't enter someone's home without a warrant.
Even if the supreme court did say that, and i doubt it very much,
It's a constitutional right to be secure in your person, possessions.

       That story links naturalnews, and a broken link as sources.
It does not say cops have the right to enter your home without a warrant,
what it says is that people don't have the "right" to resist their possibly illegal attempts to enter the home, and only have the "right" to protest it in a court of law, later. Which is still bullshit, IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's safe to say the 4th amendment trumps the Indiana supreme court.
Ultimately YOU decide who you let invade your home, and people should
defend their constitutional rights, with violence, if necessary, but for god
sake if you do, make sure you are in the right.

       I'm in NC and live next to an airpark that's back in the woods a bit, but only a mile and a halfs walk from my house. We frequently see hot air balloons, prop planes, farming planes, and people's personal hobby/antique planes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently it's been all helicopters (some are the double rotor ones that look super badass, and can be used to move tanks and houses) and small military craft. The run way isn't long enough for a commercial sized airliner, so I haven't seen any cargo craft, other than the massive choppers. There have been black hawk-looking helicopters too.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I'm hearing, there is increased military traffic all over. If somebody
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       up to something, it could be a classic slight of hand move, so while everyone is watching the west coast, something happens on the east coast. Then, when attention is on the east coast, the personnel already in place back on the west coast could make a move, effecting a pincer attack/whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just food for thought, if you like random speculation.

       I'm not the guy you were originally replying to fyi, I just grew up in Michigan and felt like chiming in. So that delicious vitriol in the above post is a lil misguided
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind of see where you're coming from, but Nevada and California are a bad example because the UP and Michigan are
       <em>
        the same state
       </em>
       . If you had used the same argument but had used SoCal and NorCal, I might have agreed with you and moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look back at my first post above. The only thing I'm disagreeing with is that the UP and mainland are not "entirely different geographic area of the country." Thats just bad semantics. I grew up there.
       <strong>
        A helicopter like people are discussing elsewhere in this thread could get from Marquette to Mt. Pleasant in ~2 hours, so for this argument your opinion that they are "entirely different geographic area(s)" is especially moot.

       Except now most of the "insurgency" America will put up can still be tracked, monitored, and surveilled. If they wanted to, they could create dossiers on anyone they deem a threat and sweep them up before anyone has time to react.

       Respectfully, but does any of this seem familiar from the Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier movie plot?  If this was what was really going to happen, do you think they would have just let a mainstream movie come right out and show it?  I'm not trying to heckle here, I'm genuinely wondering about this since I first heard about the JH15 stuff. Thanks.

       Yes they would. Its called predictive programing. They play a sick little gsme where they tell the truth about their plans through "fictional" movies and tv shows, then use the publics lack of resistance to said plans as consent.
      </p>
      <p>
       In june or july of 2001 the pilot epidsode of "the lone gunman" (an x-files spin off) was about a plot to fly a airliner into the wtc.

       But only a small amount of people even saw that ep of The Lone Gunman, and it's not likely they would have taken a fictional show as gospel truth to be riled up over enough to mount a 'resistance', so how could that have been taken as any kind of consent?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that sometimes there seems to be a prophetic element that pops up in stories/movies/etc sometimes, but that could just be an aspect of the human collective consciousness picking up on certain things occasionally and expressing them in those stories.  Or it could be that whomever came up with the 9/11 plan was inspired by that episode.  idk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if 'predictive programming' were true in the way you mention, the fact that the majority of people on a constant and perpetual basis are desperately striving to live and to protect their children should overrule any supposed 'consent' to a small specific plan that was only put forth to a very small amount of people.  There would be a larger mass of non-consent on general principle by the world population at large.

       I know some local sheriffs that would stand up against military actions against Americans. I think that's why it will be military, and not law enforcement that plays any active role in any potential action against American citizens. I'm a veteran and know first hand how easily the military can brainwash recruits to believe pretty much any scenario. Law enforcement, on the other hand, is not as heavily indoctrinated into the patriotic aspect of service.

       In my mind, it would make more sense to send the military overseas to fight a pointless war, then use private contractors or foreign troops on the citizens. I would bet that the police would side with the government too, for awhile at least, until they realize that their families were killed by the aforementioned mercenaries or foreign troops.

       I did think of this too and there have surely been signs leading up to other events. However Jade Helm has caught a significant amount of attention. I just think if they are going to pull something now, it would have to be big and followed up with more. A lot of resistance from groups like us that were suspicious of it before the fact.

      <p>
       -Edit: They fly extremely low too. Not your normal news chopper altitude. More like if I got a few firetruck ladders together I could touch it, chopper.

       Checking in from central Florida and I can confirm this. I have seen 2-3 huge military helicopters flying towards the east coast. You can tell when its military also. They have a distinct sound and they do fly low. That's no joke.

       I live in Ocala, Florida. 352 area code. We have 600-700 soldiers at one of the high schools (West Port High School). They have set up a military base. I counted probably 15-20 huge trucks that could carry 10-15 people. I saw maybe 10!humvees. And a multitude of very generic white vans. I just drove by 30 minutes ago and they were being very active. Multiple cars moving around. They had very few lights set up but it was around 245 when I drove by. Maybe I can get you guys some pictures when I drive by in the daytime.

       I took these from inside of a car in a staff parking lot across the field from "their" parking lot. This is where I went to high school, it's a pretty big school, More than 2500 kids now. Every spot in that parking lot was filled with either one of the large trucks carrying the white trailer that says 
"US ARMY RESERVE"
"HAZMAT"
"DECON" 
On the side of them, or one of the really large cloth covered trucks that can carry many people. There were humvees lined up in the corner and I couldn't get a good angle on them. And there were a few sheds in some parking spots as well.

       Also, for those who didn't see the article I included in my last post from a local news site acknowledging the military presence in the upwards of 600 personnel.

       Wow, thanks for the pics. The students are out on break, I assume?And have you seen any personnel walking around? If not it makes me think it's a staging area, just waiting to do
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I just read that article, and shit is it interesting. First off, the reporter wrote that the military
       <em>
        occupied
       </em>
       the town, not that they are performing training/etc. And upon looking up info on "Operation Guardian," I found no specifics; only news articles that it will culminate on the 25th of June...

       That story links naturalnews, and a broken link as sources.
It does not say cops have the right to enter your home without a warrant,
what it says is that people don't have the "right" to resist their possibly illegal attempts to enter the home, and only have the "right" to protest it in a court of law, later. Which is still bullshit, IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's safe to say the 4th amendment trumps the Indiana supreme court.
Ultimately YOU decide who you let invade your home, and people should
defend their constitutional rights, with violence, if necessary, but for god
sake if you do, make sure you are in the right.
