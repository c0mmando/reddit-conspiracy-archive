    <div class="md"><p>to me...I don&#39;t understand how any human being in this country can NOT see all major media networks as propaganda or symptoms of social sickness/illness/diseases..</p>

<p>we have 1 family, CIA director, making his son president and his other son governors.. then his other son president... and in between this, his business partner Clinton, and now his business partner Clinton&#39;s WIFE, Clinton II, will be &quot;running against&quot; Bush the Third...........in a <em>&quot;free and democratic election&quot;</em>..............hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaahahahahahah (laugh until I&#39;m out of air..then die inside and give up).</p>

<p>It&#39;s like... how do NONE of these talk show hosts or news anchors think to mention the fact that this is obscenely corrupt and undemocratic?</p>

<p>NOT EVEN RUSSIA IS THIS FUCKING CORRUPT...IMAGINE if the KGB director became president there, then his son, then his  other fucking son in a &quot;free and democratic election&quot;....<em>hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha</em>.</p>

<p>Not defending plutocratic familial handover of the US Presidency from one to the next here, but Putin did hand over his presidency to Medvedev for one term due to constitutional limits on holding office more than twice consecutively. Whereupon Medvedev appointed Putin &#39;Prime Minister&#39;, claimed he wasn&#39;t merely place holding the Presidency for Putin, and then did everything Putin told him to do. Including standing down for reelection so Putin could step right back in after the end of one term.</p>

<p>That&#39;s pretty corrupt too. </p>

<p>So we&#39;re both handing over the presidency to shill office holders. But Russians happen to like their puppet more than we do. </p>

<p>Let me just say it a third time for emphasis. The US has basically shit blossomed and any idiot can see the clear effect of the US Government&#39;s abuse of all people.</p>

<p>Every new fucking law is designed for corporate benefit. Healthcare. What a fucking joke. Now every rich person&#39;s quality care is paid EVERY FUCKING MONTH by the poor peoples&#39; shitty insurance coverage. SO THAT THE POOR PEOPLE CAN AFFORD EVEN FUCKING LESS. </p>

<p>UNITED STATES INSURANCE PAYS BACK LESS THAN WHAT YOU&#39;VE PAID INTO IT, AND IF THERE&#39;S AN EMERGENCY <strong>THERE IS NOTHING TO PROTECT YOU FROM DEBT</strong>, INSURANCE IN THE US MEANS ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING EXCEPT AS A VEHICLE TO PAY FOR THE RICH&#39;S TREATMENT.</p>

<p>THE US FUCKING ELITES HAVE CONTRIBUTED <strong>LESS TO THEIR OWN FUCKING COUNTRY THAN THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR OWN WEALTH CONTRIBUTED BY YOU</strong>. AND AS LONG AS THE US FUCKING GOVERNMENT IS BEING LEAD BY THE FUCKING BASTARDS WHO CONTRIBUTE LEAST THEN WE WILL ALL CONTINUE TO SUFFER.</p>

<p>AND SOME PEOPLE GET NOTHING FOR THEIR GREATER CONTRIBUTION EXCEPT FOR DEATH AND MISERY.</p>

<p>EVERY FUCKING THING THE US GOVERNMENT HAS DONE IS FOR THE CORPORATIONS. THIS IS <strong>NOT</strong> A GOVERNMENT THAT IN ANY WAY EVEN FUCKING RESPECTS ITS OWN FUCKING FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF <strong>PEOPLE</strong>.</p>

<p>YOU ARE ASKED TO PAY, AND SUFFER, AND SACRIFICE <strong>!!!MORE!!!</strong> JUST FOR THE INCREASED OPULANCE OF THE FUCKING US EXPLOITATIVE GOVERNMENT!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it baffling how people don&#39;t see any of this....it really, really frustrates the hell out of me. But at one time I was blind as well, mainly do to subliminal brainwashing we receive from day 1 through education, tv, etc. However, at some point you gotta realize how obviously corrupt pretty much EVERYTHING to do with the government / corporations is. Jeb god-damn Bush is seriously running for president and a lot of regular citizens are actually supporting him....good lord. </p>

<p>The elite isn&#39;t the problem, we are. If we ALL don&#39;t wake up we can&#39;t do shit about it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>that&#39;s because Russians need a strong leader who can handle fucking business for Russia instead of letting the west rape and loot it as happened after the fall of the USSR...dude, the CIA and associated financiers looted and raped the Russian economy causing the ruble crisis, buying up the resources and industrial heavyweights...everything was looted by western intelligence.</p>

<p>Putin at least provides the facade that &quot;someone sees this and will not stand for it&quot; - so Russians support him, because they see him as &quot;supporting Russia&quot; rather than being a western puppet. Personally I don&#39;t know and don&#39;t have an opinion about that either way, I don&#39;t know who he is, but he seems to be one of the great statesmen and diplomats of our time - he is very obviously rational and has some extreme intelligence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the republican leadership is well aware of Jeb being the golden lamb. He&#39;s running against clown shoes like Cruz and Sanatorium.

    <div class="md"><p>Neither does anyone like the US Government behavior except we have a society which has become desensitized to the violence. So when it happens they&#39;re like whoa, just someone getting tazed.</p>

<p>It is John Kerry who had an opportunity in his position to help that boy in that time. Any US Politician could.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton could have avoided having Ray McGovern dragged off and held just for keeping his back to Hillary in silent protest.</p>

<p>But they are the people who <strong>could</strong> have done something.</p>

<p>Now... There are protestors, and there is that boy, and there&#39;s Ray McGovern, and there&#39;s the people inside the US Government which ought to be a trustworthy source about it.</p>

<p>The US System whether it&#39;s planned or not, has shown disregard for people. It&#39;s actually something that happens in every tyrannical government. It happens every time they destroy the patent system (&quot;first-inventor-to-file&quot; versus the pre-2012 &quot;first-to-invent&quot;), or they spray chemicals in peoples&#39; faces for sitting on a park path, or when they take a greater percentage of your income than they do of their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I bet many of you know about the Business Plot, a fascist coup formulated by the richest men in America, among them Jeb&#39;s grandfather, Prescott Bush. It was supposed to pressure FDR into serving the 1% he was born into after several bank regulations among other progressive policies began to anger the American oligarchs. It bears repeating that Prescott&#39;s son was a corrupt CIA director, VP, and President who oversaw things like the Iran Contra scandal. His son, Bush 43, stole the election in 2000 thanks to his brother, who is now running for office against a close personal friend on the Democratic side.</p>
