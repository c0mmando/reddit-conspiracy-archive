       According to the anti-cult Cult Awareness Network, a cult is
       <em>
        "a closed system whose followers have been unethically and deceptively recruited through the use of manipulative techniques of thought reform or mind control."

       <em>

       ...our american culture decidedly meets criteria for
       <em>
        culthood
       </em>
       .  They say their mission is to maintain order but their version of order looks a lot like chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       One criteria up for debate is
       <em>
        'closed system'
       </em>
       .  When scaled up to the size of nations and looking both at geographical and cultural boundaries, America could still be considered a closed system--with the exception of bollywood, not much foreign stuff gets through save for a carousel on netflix.  Scaled up means it's not just a cult but a megacult.  I'm not playing with the words
       <em>
        cult
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        culture
       </em>
       , I'm actually saying america has since Nixon become a cult in the same way as we think of scientology.

       Statism has always been a cult. Borders are just arbitrary lines drawn on a map by those who run the human farms that now cover the world. Pray to the God of Democracy at the voting booth every few years if you like, but it won't have any more effect than praying to the gods of any of the other religions/cults out there.

       In the loosest of uses yes. Typically a cult involves a set of rules (dogma) and a single "charismatic" leader. Jim Jones,  Koresh,  Jesus, Bhudda, Allah...and so on.

       It was a cult before being a cult was cool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus was a slaveless, yogic vegan who ate mushrooms and traveled the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then his cult was infiltrated by squares and wicked popes who killed their wife and son and it was all over.

       Makes me think of when I was young and ABC news decided to begin a late-night news program:
       <em>
        NIGHTLINE
       </em>
       . The purpose was to update Americans on the U.S. Hostage Situation in Iran. Every day the news media counted off how many days the situation had gone on: DAY 100...DAY 200...DAY 300...DAY 400...the number was on the Front Page of the newspaper and included in every newscast--the nation was at a fever pitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       But NOT ONCE do I remember any newspaper or news program mentioning that the Hostage Situation was BLOWBACK for what the U.S. did in 1953 when the CIA helped to Overthrow Iran's government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't used as a template for study within the Pentagon-CIA...How easy it is to get an entire nation to HATE.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know the Pentagon-CIA work with Hollywood and the "news" media--what if CNN and Fox "news" were actually created
       <em>
        from the very beginning
       </em>
       with input from the CIA-Pentagon? If they do it with movies--why not extend the reach and do it with cable news?

       Whats disgraceful about the Iran hostage situation is that so many years later its made public that the Reagan/Bush team worked behind the scenes to delay the freeing of the hostages until the election of Reagan. What mainstream media source has mentioned this? I certainly don't remember Fox News mentioning that Saint Reagan was as corrupt as the rest. Not even MSNBC has mentioned it (to my knowledge). Poor Jimmy Carter, who has cured actual diseases with his humanitarian work, is stuck with the disastrous reputation that came from that crisis.

       I posted up one of Robert Parry's articles on Iran-Contra in r/politics one time--just as you said the user comments by claiming its a loony conspiracy, then the user bashed consortium.com (even though Robert Parry worked for the
       <em>
        AP

       Otherwise, the masses will just continue consuming--and the U.S. will continue with the Endless Wars for Profit.

       Just watched this interview Michel Chossudovsky did with James Corbett--he made some comments on the media:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       "We are dealing with a media apparatus which turns realities upside-down...presents the western quest and military adventure as a peace making undertaking...which lies in regards to the casualties of war...which presents the war criminals as protagonists of human rights...and that in itself is the pinnacle of this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without the Main Stream Media and war propaganda this New World Order agenda doesn't have a leg to stand on. In other words, without these media lies the military agenda, the economic agenda would collapse like a deck of cards. And that is why it is absolutely fundamental that--within the realm of independent media and alternative media--
       <strong>
        we wage a war against the main stream media
       </strong>
       ."

       It sucks that Edward Bernays was right and people will believe anything.  Here's all you need to know about TV from the film Network
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So, you listen to me. Listen to me! Television is not the truth. Television's a god-damned amusement park. Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troupe of acrobats, storytellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, sideshow freaks, lion tamers, and football players. We're in the boredom-killing business. So if you want the Truth, go to God! Go to your gurus. Go to yourselves! Because that's the only place you're ever gonna find any real truth. But, man, you're never gonna get any truth from us. We'll tell you anything you wanna hear. We lie like hell. We'll tell you that, uh, Kojak always gets the killer and that nobody ever gets cancer at Archie Bunker's house. And no matter how much trouble the hero is in, don't worry. Just look at your watch. At the end of the hour, he's gonna win. We'll tell you any shit you want to hear.
       </p>
       <p>
        We deal in illusions, man. None of it is true! But you people sit there day after day, night after night, all ages, colors, creeds. We're all you know. You're beginning to believe the illusions we're spinning here. You're beginning to think that the tube is reality and that your own lives are unreal. You do whatever the tube tells you. You dress like the tube, you eat like the tube, you raise your children like the tube. You even think like the tube. This is mass madness. You maniacs. In God's name, you people are the real thing. We are the illusion. So turn off your television sets. Turn them off now. Turn them off right now. Turn them off and leave them off. Turn them off right in the middle of this sentence I am speaking to you now. Turn them off!

       I've experienced it countless times, you tell someone something, then you hear them tell that same thing to someone else but wrong. I can only imagine how diluted it gets further along the whisper circle.

       The money we see is only ever that which is lent as interest on a debt and debts are bonds, hence bondage. So no they don't need cash to do their evil deeds but to control us it's paramount.

       Um, cult and culture are both derived from the latin word, cultus. Literally cut from the same cloth. But yeah I guess you could make the connection that culture has cult in it...

       That word I believe means 'place' or 'location' or something like it.  So
       <em>
        cult
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        cult
       </em>
       ure,
       <em>
        cult
       </em>
       ivate are all pertaining to something happening in a locale.  So with the ancient mystery cults they were confined to a place and people would travel from afar to join in ceremony.  You cultivate a specific place.  And culture develops in an area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now here's a trixy question, are the gypsies and nomadi people 'a cult'?  We know the mennonites are and pennsylvania dutch (amish--because they are in pennsylvania).

       Yes, this is an important point and in some sense, languages are the ultimate cult tool. They litteraly bore concepts, words, patterns of thought into your brain. The English language and the US culture are parts of the closed system of the cult.

       There is/was no organization called the " anti-cult Cult Awareness Network" - it was the "Cult Awareness Network", an organization that operated a kickback scheme involving deprogrammers (kidnappers for hire) and maintaining lists of organizations they described as cults (without having any sort of scientific basis to their claims)

       I used
       <em>
        anti-cult
       </em>
       as an adjective not a nomenclature.  I'm bad at commas.  Sorry bout that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking to tribalism, I agree with that idea generally.  But my point was that propaganda and willful cryptostrategies have united us--the ideologically disparate
       <em>
        tribes
       </em>
       --under a kind of oppression that would have us put our focus, intention, attention, and money into the wrong ideological tropes, trends, causes, and political efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the recent Dixie flag removal as an example.  You have liberals that've always been against it.  You have southern conservatives that decry 'heritage, heritage'.  It's being taken down now after a shootem up of blacks.  We are all ideologically united in this
       <em>
        rite
       </em>
       for different reasons.  Liberals get to honor minorities, conservatives get to look less like butthurt dicks "in a time to heal our state"--blah blah blah.  My point is sinister forces pressed that mass shooting racism outrage gun violence button yet agin, and mind controlled that kid to kill a bunch of blacks at a most apropos time for the nation to concede to give up more of our liberties for an even stronger police force / more restrictive gun laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe those sinister forces didn't plan this and it's all just following a realtime emergent pattern.  But historically it will look planned in light of the other evidences.
