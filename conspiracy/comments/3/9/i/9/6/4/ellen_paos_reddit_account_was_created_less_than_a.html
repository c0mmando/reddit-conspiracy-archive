       In the wake of all the recent mess that's been going on, I was curious about how long Ellen Pao had actually been around on reddit. I have been here over 5 years, and I don't even consider myself a senior member. I joined right before the Digg v4.0 exodus.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found that her account is 2 years old. She is massively under qualified to be CEO of a reddit that she has only even been a member of for a fraction of the time that a large portion of its users have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking for something to gauge this by, I wondered if she'd even been here since before Aaron Swartz died.

      </p>
      <p>
       Coupled with the fact that about a year prior, Aaron Swartz and reddit were a huge factor in the success of

       This isn't about body shaming. It isn't about sexism, or homophobia, or stopping piracy, or child porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is 100% about gaining control of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of Pao's history shows that she is not at all to be trusted. Ponzi schemes, frivolous yet massive lawsuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Events like what has been happening in the past 24 hours here don't happen on accident. They are planned years in advance.

       The guy was suicided or at least driven to a no-touch-suicide by coming down on him with the judicial hammer for a petty "crime" on an MIT honey pot network so grossly under-protected it just had to be a set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The arrogant government prosecutors who, in effect, murdered Aaron, as well as the irresponsible academics who shrugged their shoulders in indifference and the various media outlets that casually reported on his arrest, should think carefully about the lack of proportion in the American criminal justice system, and the devastating impact it can have on real lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authorities in New York have undertaken a similarly disproportionate assault on Internet freedom and academic whistle-blowing, arresting and prosecuting a blogger who sent out “Gmail confessions” in which a well-known New York University department chairman appeared to be eccentrically accusing himself of plagiarism. Again, there appears to be nothing but silence from the relevant communities."
      </p>
      <p>
       Pao is the equivalent of a cointelpro plant. Her job was to hijack the brainchild and turn it into the exact opposite of what it was meant to be ... Assuring Swartz wouldn't be yet another renegade who got away with challenging the establishment succesfully and peacefully.

       Looks pretty straight-forward to me.  MIT is not a bank, the level of openess on their network, (DHCP wihtout authentication, not using sticky-mac on network ports, etc.) is in line with how a lot of university and business campus networks are run.  He doesn't mention a honey-pot anywhere in the article.

       His plan was to make a huge database of knowledge available to the third world for free. The database represents almost all of the west's accumulated knowledge from the past 200 years. That was every single scientific paper written in American Universities since their foundation. As it stands this database is something you have to pay for before you can use it.

       Easy to give it to Americans for free, they'll never look at it. The third world would pour over it and every detail. So give it to the people who want it, need it.

       DAE Muricans r stoopid? This is asinine bullshit. You think the average citizen of a third world country are gonna "pour over" JSTOR when most of them are illiterate? You do realize it was Americans who write all the papers in the first place, right?

       Watch this documentary. It's also available on Netflix I believe. He was a smart guy who's presence is definitely missed. He also contributed to the development of this site along with a ton of other massively influential pieces of technology.

       He is someone you should definitely familiarize yourself with.

       Saying he was a smart guy is a massive understatement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im my opinion he was one of the greatest minds of our times. He had a creativity , ideas and an understanding of internet technologies that may not ever be seen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I finished watching "the internets own boy" with a massive sense of loss and sadness.  Its an enormous shame that he's no longer with us.

       The owner of Advanced Publications (reddit's parent company) is billionaire Mr Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr- the 47th richest American and 'Buddy of George H Bush'. He has form for interfering with the editorial independence of his publications, infamously ordering a hit piece on Obama in the New Yorker (which he also owns).

       Could Reddit get themselves into legal trouble if they were found to be secretly buying their product 'Reddit Gold' in large quantity and giving it to users to spur others to buy Reddit Gold, like falsely inflating their own company?

       I took that screen clip last night after seeing my whole front page melt in this miasma of Fattening commentary. I've never seen the gold goal meter go higher than 105% in my time here. And with the apparent outrage over the bannings, why would it even top 75%?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either the admins dropped the goal to inflate the percentage, or they are pouring money in to to accomplish the same goal... Or last night marks the beginning of an influx of SJWs to the internet's newest hug-box.

       I personally think it's darker than that.  I don't think the admins dropped the goal or gave themselves free gold to rain down on supportive/ironic comments, I think it was bought by those who are thrilled that the alleged harassers have been banned (allegedly), and are dancing as what reddit once was crumbles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact reddit is seeing any sort of support is sad.

       Another steaming pile pulled straight from a redditor's ass and dumped into the forum like it made any kind of sense. The delusions are simply amazing. People who have absolutely no objective standards of evidence for anything they believe. There is literally zero reasoning in your post.

       They don't want you to be able to say anything anonymously, because if you are anonymous, then they can't punish you for what you say, they can't impose consequences to control your speech. They can't control the narrative; and power comes only from the gun (which they also want to take away) and control of the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If politicians and media cannot control the narrative and cannot control the guns, then they have no power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider this recent quote from career narrative controller, Bob Schieffer, bemoaning the current state of the nation:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “We now don’t know where people get their news, but what we do know is they’re bombarded with information 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Most of the information is wrong and some of it is wrong on purpose,” Schieffer said. “It is our job, I think, in mainstream journalism to try to cut through this mall of information and tell people what we think is relevant in what they need to know. That is the job of the journalist and I have to say it’s harder and harder.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <a href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/05/29/schieffer-we-now-dont-know-where-people-get-their-news/">
        http://washington.cbslocal.com/2015/05/29/schieffer-we-now-dont-know-where-people-get-their-news/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole system was based on the idea of controlling the news source, and controlling the opinions people could derive from that news source. Present the story, then present option A and option B to give people the illusion of choice to feel like they are forming their own opinions, thinking for themselves, being real free individuals, when in reality their possible choices were already chosen for them. The internet mucks all that up. The narrative can't be controlled anymore, except through these hugely controversial stories that are regularly put on megablast and follow the same formula: sex, perversion, death, hate, and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next big policy change for reddit will be the end of anonymity. The powers that be want reddit and anything like it destroyed, or at least made impotent. It will be very difficult to ever again attract this number of users to one platform.

       Again, ever noticed the amount of AskReddit threads dedicated to getting you to give up your most valuable secrets?

      <p>
       "What's the one secret you never told anyone?"

       Like how 'selfies' suddenly became the hottest thing ever in history. Random people were taking photos of themselves and posting them on the net forever, but then, all of a sudden we had this brand new concept 'the selfie' and that is all the media and the usual celebs talked about for a straight month,
       <strong>
        and now everyone must take selfies of themselves or something is wrong with you get with the fad everyone is doing it, all my fav celebrities even
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, thank you all for supplying the NSA with a complete database of faces. They had a hard time collecting and isolating that data before, but after the media-fueled selfie craze all the gaps in their database were instantly filled.

       I just started on this whole Ellen Pao thing and Holy shit, I just went down the rabbit hole with this one and ended up contributing $20 I don't have to Bernie Sanders and volunteering to do a house-party and data-entry for his campaign.
I feel like I'm coming down off of shrooms. I've read court transcripts, seen lots of Ellen Mao/ Chairman Pao jokes, lots of facts about Hillary and finally ended up on a pledge to Bernie site.
Fuck me that was a ride.

       edit: btw, don't think I've ever been to a house-party, or at least what would be considered one by today's standards and I'm pretty sure if they do call me on the data-entry my daughter just found her summer job.

       You shouldn't let yourself be so easily led. There is no magic bullet that will solve all or even a majority of our problems, least of all in the form of Bernie Sanders. If you believe he is the answer you have learned nothing at all.

       I am not easily led but I am open to people's opinions.  I can tell since you said 'least of all' that we probably have differing ideas on how best to fix this broken country.  I would love for you to point me to a couple of possible fixes or explain to me what you think.

       Because things are going bat shit crazy in this country and I don't want corporations having a hand in every policy this country makes; and he's the only one I know not starting a SuperPAC.
       <br/>
       I'm tired of seeing my country going to shit. I'm 42, have voted across the spectrum, and this current crop of candidates scare the hell out of me. I don't trust big corporate money in campaigns,  on either side.
       <br/>
       We are a country of people who are different.  We need a give and take on everything we decide on.  I don't know that all this private business money in politics is the sole reason, but I do know it isn't good for us.

       I don't think Rand, Hillary or any if the rest if them give a hill of beans for thus country as a whole, I think they are traitors.

       I've been there man.  I felt the same about Obama right after Bush 2.0.  Only took me about 3 months to realize we had been completely duped, and all of his pleasant sounding rhetoric was a ruse to get into office.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point I'm of the mindset that you can only trust 3rd parties after doing your research on the particular candidate you like.  Personally I'm excited to see how Rand does/gets treated as I am an idealist when it comes to him, and have a feeling he is just wearing the wool of a political sheep to get into office before he reveals himself to be a completely Libertarian Wolf and going on a political warpath through the corrupt and the evil.
      </p>

       But I'm probably not going to be voting for him.  He's been very sketchy recently

       I don't know where to go.  There is so much blame to go around in the media and government officials, but also the apathy of the people.  I know that I can rally behind the ideal of taking corporate money out of politics, no Super-PACs.  A corporations interest is to its shareholders, not the country it happens to be based in; and that's not something I feel, it's a fact.  That alone should give people pause before they start to back the legality or righteousness of this subject.  I believe once people stop getting rich (not stupid-rich, just wealthy) from being in office, it may just go a good ways to enlisting superior people for the jobs.

       Pipe dream?  Probably :(

       How do people not question all these suicides, car accidents, and early deaths. This doesn't even make sense. I know that there aren't always signs of suicide, but it is hard for me to believe. I'm starting to feel like everything is a damn conspiracy.

       His girlfriend stated that he wasn't depressed and even proposed two months prior, which doesn't correspond to the method he chose: hanging. Nearly only severely depressed and long time suicidal people take that route. Take Robin Williams f.e. That's at least an indication for me to consider him being 'suicided'.

       You don't hang yourself on a whim. You'll try other methods first that are less aggressive when you're panicking like OD's.

       I live in a European country which's name went in infamy globally because of a huge child abuse scandal very much congruent to what's happening in England as we speak. Several key witnesses, about 36 or so, ranging from prosecutors to Police colonels over underworld infiltrants with tape evidence ended up 'suicided'. They were either found hanging in their basement or crashed against a bridge post on a highway.

       It would be certainly more nefarious if he was murdered. To me it seems he probably wasn't, but it's still flat-out evil the criminal pressure that the prosecutors applied. The threat of decades in prison at the mercy of a judge or jury against a prosecutor who is hell-bent on unreasonable penalties is cruel and crushing to almost anyone. JSTOR didn't support the extreme charges. But even if they did, and he had destroyed JSTOR's business, the potential punishment was ludicrous. No doubt he played with fire, but his life was most likely snuffed out by heinously over-reaching criminal prosecution. If he'd survived, and felt obligated, he could have easily paid any damages via further innovative business ventures. Facing the charges he was against, the possibility to atone, or even contribute to society, must have seemed bleak to him. I'm not saying I know that he wasn't murdered (I doubt it) or even that the suicide was 100% caused by the prosecuting attorney. But it's easy to see how the suicide was incited or accelerated by the prosecution team AND anyone who had little to lose but didn't speak out against the charges: plenty of comfortable MIT faculty and staff in the latter group.

       The degree of 'nefariousness' is one of those media ploys to get us onto a hamster wheel. It makes no major difference how much of a direct role the needed to take. All that matters is that the job got done, now we're currently enjoying the fruits of their handiwork. The fact is that someone was snuffed out so that reddit could become co-opted or destroyed. Clearly that's where things stand right now. Do we have all the proof? No but we're also not prosecuting these people. We're learning how they operate. The information we've seen is enough for us to tentatively assume that he was targeted. The more reddit starts broadening its use of censorship and starts acting like the government, the more likely this hypothesis is correct.

       It's probably Belgium and he is talking about the Marc Dutroux case.

       Are you not an American or something?  American's love CEO's who don't know a thing about their products.  Same with politicians who avoid the constitution.  it makes no sense, but it's observable and perpetuates.

       With all those financial issues she'd be easy for a government (or any "private investor") to manipulate her, especially now that she's lost her court case.  This goes for any rivals that reddit may have, too.  If you have any future plans that would be helped by controlling how reddit operates, now is the right time to make her an offer.

       Always thought that post was very interesting, especially with the Sandy Hook map in the movie. Sandy Hooky body count? 26. 2 injured. Marathon is 26.2 (Boston).

       No it seemed like he commited suicide. IIRC at the end of the movie, a bomb is going to explode so Batman uses the Batmobile to fly the bomb all the way out to the ocean where it explodes, but since he brought the bomb there, he dies aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then in the end it turns out he wasn't in the Batmobile because when Alfred visits a cafe in Florence (Which Bruce visites multiple times in the past), he sees Batman sitting at a different table, thus proving that he didn't commit suicide in the end.

       Twitter removed the discover tab here recently.  that changed how you can view new tweets and they altered how the site shows new users info too.  I'm thinkin that lined up with this and all the facebook revelations, they've definitely had this planned.

       Damn, just watched the documentary and it was indeed sad. Brilliant guy, a shame our government is so fucking cruel. Honestly he doesn't seem like the type of guy to kill himself though, Because even if he did go to prison I don't think that would have stopped him from trying to change the world. Sketchy indeed.

       Yup these kind of events are planned years in advance but you caught on to them because of such a silly mistake,making an account 5 days before suiciding Aaron Swartz, the proof is in your hands,just go to any court and present them the proof,I'm sure they will arrest Ellen Pao. Oh my what an amateurish mistake they made,thank god you caught onto her before she gained control of all 100% of the internet

       The last 24 hours? Did they close down R/conspiracy or a group dedicated to 9/11 truth? From what i saw they shut down 2 hate groups. Why are you lumping that with this other more serious stuff. I cannot wrap my mind around the fervor over some childish bigots. Free speech lost nothing there.

       Define hate speech exactly. The term is often used to stifle debates in much the same way as when people say conspiracy theorist,  or racist. The term is ambiguous and not defined most of the time.

       I don't know how you can take yourself seriously. You basically just dumped a pile of delusions into a post. And yet you seem to totally believe what you're saying. It's fascinating that people can invent fantasies like these and believe them almost like they had evidence.
