        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you&#39;re wondering why so many people are suddenly so passionate about the shape of the world around them, please take the time to understand where they&#39;re coming from and why they believe what they do.</p>

<p>You can start by familiarizing yourself with a basic version of the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/bCVQG">Flat Earth model</a>, it should answer many of the questions you&#39;ll no doubt have due to your government programming. If you&#39;re a reader, <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/earth/za/">literature from over a century ago</a> is still very relevant as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">independently reproducible proof of non-curvature</a>. If you prefer to watch something,  you can start with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFjG4jpUhQI">feature-length documentary</a> that will prime you on the subject, and there are many more that you can discover. If you&#39;re the hands-on type, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGW9bIx_e8">all amateur attempts</a> to reach as high an altitude as possible show a flat horizon at heights NASA material shows curvature. In short, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PyaY8gn.jpg">Flat Earth is flat.</a></p>

<p>Need more evidence? <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35q8m7/the_statue_of_liberty_in_new_york_stands_326_feet/">Lighthouses can be seen at distances that should be occluded by curvature</a>, if it existed. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35bkup/surveyors_engineers_and_architects_are_never/">Railroads span hundreds and even thousands of miles without taking into account any curvature</a>. <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/35c86b/airplane_pilots_and_sea_navigators_fly_and_sail/">Sailors navigate by plane sailing</a>, mathematically assuming a Flat Earth to compute their heading. Again, the truth of Flat Earth is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">easily reproducible by anyone</a> who has the courage to take it seriously.</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to explore Antarctica and what&#39;s beyond, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System">the combined militaries of the world will stop you.</a> In a century of constant warfare, it&#39;s the only thing they can agree on. That&#39;s as far as our current observations and explorations have taken us. NASA was created to continue the spherical Lie and everything they put out is a hoax, starting with Operation Paperclip&#39;s Dr. Werner Von Braun&#39;s phallus rocket fetish. The higher in altitude you climb, the lower the density of the air and the less effective rocket propulsion becomes. NASA has not gone to low-earth orbit or any higher because <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3qri3">rocketry does not work in a vacuum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">Here</a> you can view many useful datasets on different map projections, comparing them on a spherical (orthographical projection) and flat (azimuthal equidistant projection) model. <a href="https://youtu.be/_mfJXp4ePu0?t=12m43s">Here</a> is someone showing you some examples of how the data fits a flat model more cleanly.</p>

<p>Obligatory &quot;why is this a conspiracy&quot;: If you believe in a spherical earth,  you literally believe down is up and up is down.  You have been indoctrinated into a state of helpless ignorance; you are already a slave to lies in your mind,  completely lost,  and easily controlled. </p>

<p>Not only has the government has lied to you but you now have proof in your pocket to fight it. It changes your perspective completely when you really get it. You are no longer some tiny ant crawling on a remote dust speck in an infinite mess of stars and planets. The sun, moon, and stars rotate around you. Since day one, you have been told you are a piece of shit nobody, a nothing to adhere to rules like a good robot. No, you are the reason for this place. This is incredibly empowering when you really grasp it.</p>

<p>It will also let you know very quickly who you are dealing with when it comes to truth. If they talk satellites, galaxies, globe etc. you know they are either ignorant or putting forth the NWO agenda willingly or not.</p>

<p>When you have your entire worldview built of lies on top of lies, is it any wonder people are so confused, lost, and easily controlled? Is it really surprising everyone thinks everyone else is really stupid?</p>

<p>Everyone is hurt by this mental slavery, and everyone can see that things aren&#39;t right. Even the childrens&#39; movies that we create nowadays paint a picture of a dystopian world where everything is just <em>wrong</em>. It&#39;s the most common theme nowadays, a worldwide depression of the human spirit, and I believe your life and all of our lives would change if we opened our hearts and minds to truth. As long as we instead choose to cling to comforting illusions, illusions will be all that we have to comfort ourselves.</p>

<p>Well, see here:</p>

<p><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodensee#Erdkr.C3.BCmmung">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodensee#Erdkr.C3.BCmmung</a></p>

<p>Sadly, this paragraph is only contained on the german page. It describes that you cannot see the bank in in southeast-northwest direction, because over this length of 65km(= 40 miles) there is a <em>bulge</em> of 80m in the water, that would be 262ft.</p>

<p>Since it is the <em>bulge</em> that is cause by earths curvature, one needs to recalculate this for a length of 40miles to fit it to the prediction of the graphic, I&#39;m too lazy right now, feel free to try yourself. Since the &quot;far height&quot; is normalized to the earth&#39;s surface, you can get a triange if the distance is short enough (40 miles is short enough), but not a right-angled one, so it may not be very easy, depending on your knowledge in geometry.</p>

<p>See above. Also, if the earth was flat, you would see mountains everywhere around you on the horizon, even at the sea. How come you don&#39;t?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Replying to my own post because I don&#39;t want to edit it just to add something I missed the first time.</p>

<p>About the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodensee#Erdkr.C3.BCmmung">curvature that can be observed in the Bodensee in Germany</a></p>

<p>The whole distance  from one bank to the other is 65km = 40 miles. The <em>bulge</em> in the water is 80m = 262ft <em>high</em> and of course, the highest point is in the middle. With this we can use the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">graphic</a>, not going the fill distance, but half of it: 20 miles, which gives us a value of 266 feet for the &quot;fall&quot; which is the height here. Only 4 ft difference, a bit more than 1m - I&#39;d say we got quite near to the expected value.</p>

<p>By the way, paying closer attention to the whole sheet and not only to the graphic itself, I noticed the hint about the &quot;Old Bedford&quot; and this was sufficient to find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Level_experiment">Wikipedia page about the experiments</a></p>

<p>Interesting. I have never heard that atmospheric diffraction would cause light or a line-of-sight to get bent towards earth <em>when very near to the surface</em>, but not when set 13 feet (4 m) above the water. It makes no sense to me, so, according my current level of knowledge, this seems to support the idea of a flat earth, indeed.</p>

<p>Yes, the heliocentrist explanation for the phenomena of being able to see further than curvature should allow is a combination of mirage and refraction. The truth is that these effects only mirror and copy and could not create entire views of new information for us to see, and more and more examples are being pointed out every day.</p>

<p>At this distance, the curvature of the earth would put the city approximately 1,900 feet below the visible horizon. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t check the calculation, let&#39;s assume it is correct. Then, still the 1900ft are only valid when seen from 0 inch above the ground. If you bring your own height into the calculation, it looks a bit different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I believe the bottom of the buildings to be obscured by the reflection of the water.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the earth would be flat, this reflection on the water should show you the full length of the buildings upside down, in fact, it would subjectively <em>double</em> the perception of the far away buildings. Since you don&#39;t look from exactly floor level, but from a position that is heightened by the height of your body (at least, maybe some more), the reflections on the water would be unable to obscure anything.</p>

<p>False. You can &#39;circumnavigate&#39; east-west and end up in the same spot, and this is consistent with the Flat Earth model. However you can <strong>not</strong> travel north-south and circumnavigate the world, and this too is consistent with the Flat Earth model.</p>

<p>What is the point of making people think the world is flat, when there are already so many other lies they use to control the population at a much more efficent level in terms of effort and cost?</p>

<p>Two questions. If you&#39;re so interested in enlightening others, just share your opinion. I&#39;m explicitly even saying I&#39;m only interested in how YOU think of these: not what some documentary says, nor what mathematical model supports these ideas. Just your opinion.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t. I believe in what I can see with reproducible evidence which, at that point, makes it not really a theory. It&#39;s a fact. But more importantly, why 3? What would it matter? Why does it have to be a conspiracy? This is such an arbitrary question you&#39;re just using as a shitty way of not answering questions.</p>

<p>Like let&#39;s say I said &quot;Oh I believe that oranges give off a low frequency hum that&#39;s been killing bees&quot; (I don&#39;t). Now you go &quot;Oh this guy&#39;s a nutter, I&#39;m not telling him shit because it&#39;ll hurt my cause to have that guy trying to inform people&quot;! </p>

<p>So do you want three things I believe in? I believe anyone who believes they are qualified to run a civilization is the last person who should. I do not believe in a God, although I&#39;m open to the universe being created. I believe that there is live out in the universe somewhere. They&#39;re not facts, these are just things that I feel are correct. </p>

<p>what does the horizon look like near you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m in a city, the horizon is about 50m (150ft) away and looks rather edgy :D</p>

<p>At the sea, it would look rather straight, and this fits perfectly to a horizon on a ball, here&#39;s why:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Imagine a huge ball.</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine yourself standing on it</p></li>
<li><p>look in one direction (doesn&#39;t matter which direction, we define it as the &quot;0-degree-direction&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>measure the distance to the &quot;edge of the ball&quot; as seen from your position</p></li>
<li><p>Turn 90 degrees to the right (we call this the 90-degree-direction.)</p></li>
<li><p>measure the distance to the ball-horizon again. You will find that it is the same distance.</p></li>
<li><p>try any other direction. You will always find the same distance.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Since the ball is smaller than the earth, you will probably notice that the level of the horizon is below your feet. And this is the only information you get about the (in the case of a huge ball, very prominent) curvature, you would see very little of the curvature itself. </p>

<p>In case of the earth, the &quot;ball&quot; is so huge that you won&#39;t even consciously notice that the level of the horizon (when looking at the sea) is below you feet. Or do you? If you do, the difference between a straight line of sight and and the horizon is your information about the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>While writing this, the Question &quot;how far away is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon">horizon</a>?&quot; appeared to me. And lo &amp; behold, the question is answered - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon#Distance_to_the_horizon"><strong><em>it is different,</em></strong> <strong>depending on how far above ground you are!</strong></a> And here the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon#Effect_of_atmospheric_refraction">atmospheric diffraction (that I did not know about before)</a> is mentionened. It is obvious that this effect prolongs the distance to the (optical) horizon by some extend, how much is less clear, the page uses the value 8% which woudn&#39;t be much, but also mentions, that this effect &quot;can allow light to follow the Earth&#39;s surface for hundreds of kilometres.&quot;</p>

<p>But specifically, there are a few example distances given:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For an observer standing on the ground with h = 1.70 metres (5 ft 7 in) (average eye-level height), the horizon is at a distance of 4.7 kilometres (2.9 mi).</p>

<p>For an observer standing on the ground with h = 2 metres (6 ft 7 in), the horizon is at a distance of 5 kilometres (3.1 mi).</p>

<p>For an observer standing on a hill or tower of 100 metres (330 ft) in height, the horizon is at a distance of 36 kilometres (22 mi).</p>

<p>For an observer standing at the top of the Burj Khalifa (828 metres (2,717 ft) in height), the horizon is at a distance of 103 kilometres (64 mi).</p>

<p>For an observer atop Mount Everest (8,848 metres (29,029 ft) in altitude), the horizon is at a distance of 336 kilometres (209 mi).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is something I find interesting: </p>

<p>Given that the earth is flat, why would my position above ground make a difference at all? Especially at sea, where my view would not be obstructed by objects higher than my line of sight? On a flat world, the horizon should be several 100 kilometres away, regardless of your position above ground.</p>

<p>Is there an explanation why this is not the case?</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave it at that for today. Please note that this is the view of science which is the view I trust so far. Because, so far, all it tells me makes sense.</p>

<p><sup>By the way, I&#39;m also curious about the amount of downvotes I shall get for this. So far I have not downvoted anything in here, but I got some. I&#39;m rather interested in a serious communication about a (for me</sup><sup>)</sup> <sup> &quot;surprising&quot; subject, but if the downvotes pile up more, I can start downvoting, too.</sup></p>

    <div class="md"><p>not saying this is correct at all, but one explanation to consider...</p>

<p>Lets say that earth is flat, imagine a circular plane lying directly in the center of an imaginary spherical bubble around it.  But the circular flat plane (earth) is lying North to south-rather than east to west-if that helps you imagine it.  Essentially like a quarter standing up on its side.  Now lets assume we still rotate the way we believe and (imagine you spinning the quarter now) and what we would perceive in a shadow situation is a spherical shadow.  </p>

<p>Just for consideration </p>

<p>No you haven&#39;t, <a href="/u/lordberric">/u/lordberric</a>, another redditor who previously only posted in mainstream entertainment sub-reddits, and it won&#39;t take long to prove that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Explain the cameras people send into upper atmosphere in balloons</p>

<p>I already did; this is from the second paragraph in the OP:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re the hands-on type, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGW9bIx_e8">all amateur attempts</a> to reach as high an altitude as possible show a flat horizon at heights NASA material shows curvature.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll answer your other question to show how easy it is to answer (and you would have found this out if actually did any research), but it&#39;s for the audience and not for you. I&#39;m not going to pretend that I believe that you&#39;re genuine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In every medium, objects that are denser than the medium sink, while objects that are less dense rise. This holds for every medium and explains all of our physical observations without any &#39;theory&#39; necessary.</p>

<p>The capital-T Theory of Gravity is everything necessary to have the above statement remain true if we also exist on a sphere in an &#39;outer space&#39; of &#39;flying spheres&#39;. It&#39;s an attempt to explain how anything would be magnetically stuck to the surface of a ball, when that is counter to every single physical observation of a sphere we can reproduce. We don&#39;t need a spherical rationalization at all to explain a Flat Earth, we just need the statement of the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>We also have never been able to reproduce the gravitational attraction of the Theory of Gravity in a laboratory, no matter how many times we put a massive dense object next to a miniscule object.</p>

<p>In short, the capital-T Theory of Gravity is just pseudo-science ball-shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s just think about some simple experiments we can all do to evaluate the shape of the Earth.</p>

<p>Take some binoculars and go to the coast and watch the ships appear and disappear over the horizon.  What do you notice?</p>

<p>When you travel to different parts of the World look at the night sky. Do you notice a change to visible constellations?</p>

<p>Get a friend a long way (a few timezones) away to make a sun dial and then you make an identical one as well.  Call them up and compare the results.  Also call someone who is a number of time zones away and ask them how long ago sunrise was?</p>

<p>Finally are we saying that gravity is wrong?  Because gravity pulls you toward the mass (in the case of a globe down)  on a plane then the further you were from the centre the more the pull would be slanted towards to the middle of the plane.  Do pendulums tilt at places like Alaska?</p>

<p>Gravity doesn&#39;t make any sense when taking an objective look at it. How can it be strong enough to hold planets in orbit, our moon in orbit, and yet weak enough not to crush us? </p>

<p>It makes no sense for rockets to work in a vacuum and it&#39;s easily tested. Get a vacuum container and set off a scale rocket inside; observe results... </p>

<p>If the earth was a ball then it would only make sense to launch space missions from the highest altitudes feasible and not from sea level at an angle that greatly increases fuel consumption. Straight out from any point on a globe is a shorter distance than an arc, basic geometry right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m interested in the question as well; the short answer is that there isn&#39;t a satisfactory explanation under any model. The observations of the eclipses, while predictable, have never fit within the ball Earth model, and we&#39;re forced to start over from the beginning.</p>

<p>&quot;According to the globular theory, a lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth, and moon are in a direct line; but it is on record that since about the fifteenth century over fifty eclipses have occurred while both sun and moon have been visible above the horizon.&quot; -F.H. Cook, &quot;The Terrestrial Plane&quot;</p>

<p>As early as the time of Pliny, there are records of lunar eclipses happening while both the Sun and Moon are visible in the sky. The Greenwich Royal Observatory recorded that &quot;during the lunar eclipses of July 17th, 1590, November 3rd, 1648, June 16th, 1666, and May 26th, 1668 the moon rose eclipsed whilst the sun was still above the horizon.&quot; McCulluch’s Geography recorded that &quot;on September 20th, 1717 and April 20th, 1837 the moon appeared to rise eclipsed before the sun had set.&quot; Sir Henry Holland also noted in his &quot;Recollections of Past Life&quot; the April 20th, 1837 phenomena where &quot;the moon rose eclipsed before the sun set.&quot; The Daily Telegraph recorded it happening again on January 17th, 1870, then again in July of the same year, and it continues to happen during lunar eclipses to this day.</p>

<p>&quot;It is alleged by the learned that at a lunar eclipse the earth casts a shadow on the moon, by intercepting the light of the sun. The shadow, it is alleged, is circular, and as only a globe can cast a circular shadow, and as that shadow is cast by the earth, of course the earth is a globe. In fact, what better proof could any reasonable person require? ‘Powerful reasoning,’ says the dupe. Let us see. I have already cited a case where sun and moon have been seen with the moon eclipsed, and as the earth was not between, or they both could not have been seen, the shadow said to be on the moon could not possibly have been cast by the earth. But as refraction is charged with raising the moon above the horizon, when it is said to be really beneath, and the amount of refraction made to tally with what would be required to square the matter, let us see how refraction would act in regard to a shadow. Refraction can only exist where the object and the observer are in different densities. If a shilling be put in the bottom of a glass and observed there is no refraction. Refraction casts the image of the shilling UPWARDS, but a shadow always downwards. If a basin be taken and put near a light, so that the shadow will shorten inwards and DOWNWARDS; but if the rod is allowed to rest in the basin and water poured in, the rod will appear to be bent UPWARDS. This places the matter beyond dispute and proves that it is out of the range of possibility that the shadow said to be on the moon could be that of the earth.&quot; -Thomas Winship, &quot;Zetetic Cosmogeny&quot; (78)</p>

<p>Whatever is causing these phenomena, we aren&#39;t going to be able to understand it until we shed our incorrect assumptions and beliefs.</p>

<p>When we look up at the stars, we can see that they rotate around Polaris, the pole star at the North Pole. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsb39_6QF0">The star trails that we can observe are proof of a Flat Earth</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the heliocentrists claim we are constantly moving through outer space at extremely high speeds, with our direction changing wildly regularly. And yet our view of the stars remains mostly unchanged, and so they have introduced orders of magnitude of more millions of miles in between their theories. The stars are just so far away now, that like everything else bundled under relativity, they don&#39;t appear to have the movement they should!</p>

<p>If that is really true, maybe you should focus on something that people can actually do something about, like preventing and curing cancer or abolishing the state. At the very least accept the evidence of concavity and stop peddling nonsense.</p>

<p>The only evidence that you can produce of hollowness or concavity is an experiment that is not reproducible, based on assumptions that are not tenable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You keep saying that it isn&#39;t reproducible, which is a lie. The experiment is 100% reproducible, it simply has never been reproduce since it was originally conducted, which I find very telling. And it isn&#39;t based on ANY assumptions - the Rectilineator could be used to provide evidence for ANY curvature or lack thereof. The results of the experiment support concavity, not the assumptions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your claims about flight times are vague and unspecific</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t make any claims about flight times, I asked you a fucking question. Here, I&#39;ll ask it again so you can fail to answer it again:</p>

<p><strong>How does Quantas run a 787 between Santiago, Chile and Auckland, New Zealand on a DAILY BASIS in 11-13 hours nonstop in a flat earth model? Wouldn&#39;t the distances involved require massively higher air speeds than that aircraft is capable of attaining?</strong></p>

<p>and you previously have presented purely false information (a southern pole star). </p>

<p>Your failure to understand the rotation of the stars around a southern central pole is not my problem but yours, and you continue to fail to address this critical flaw in flat earth theory.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to convince you of jack shit, you are the one trying to convince people of a flawed theory that cannot account for the problems that I have raised. I will continue to raise these issues as long as you continue to post a flawed theory and fail to address them.</p>

<p>What reproducible, measurable experiments can be done to support a flat earth hypothesis?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A copy of the book &quot;Lighthouses of the World&quot; and a calculator are all you need to prove that the Earth is Flat and no curvature exists. Trying to cover this up by claiming that light bends around the curvature of the Earth in just the exact proportion so that we can not observe any curvature is extremely weak damage control.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">Michelson-Morley experiment</a> is proof that we are stationary and not spinning at who know&#39;s what speeds (no one can ever calculate our total velocity).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference">Eratosthenes&#39; experiment</a> proves that the sun is much closer than millions of miles away, when you evaluate the results without his assumptions of a spherical Earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afsb39_6QF0">Star-trail time lapse photography</a> is proof that we are not constantly spinning and rotating throughout outer space, rather the constellations are rotating above us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your failure to understand the rotation of the stars around a southern central pole</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no southern central pole that the constellations rotate around; the closest approximation is the southern cross, but there is no southern pole star.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How does Quantas run a 787 between Santiago, Chile and Auckland, New Zealand </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t; try booking that flight, you won&#39;t be able to get a non-stop. Once again though, as I&#39;ve said to you before: whatever the true shape of the world around us, the evidence for it will be easily reproducible and abundant. There is easily reproducible and abundant evidence of flatness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha, you are honestly saying that the daily flights in the southern hemisphere, that anybody can look up and book, somehow do not exist? That&#39;s hilarious. I like one of your buddies&#39; responses better:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You see it&#39;s fairly simple thanks to the flat earth&#39;s magnetic field near the edges. This creates a perceived time dilation among passengers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That at least uses a bit of imagination. You are just a &quot;flight times denier&quot;, sticking your fingers in your ears and shouting &quot;I can&#39;t hear you&quot;. You still haven&#39;t outlined an actual experiment to measure flatness, just something about lighthouses and a calculator? But you accuse me of being vague? And I never denied that the earth is not rotating, or that the sun isn&#39;t much closer than astronomers claim, or that the heavens rotate above us - that is all part of the concave earth model, which you clearly have still not even bothered to attempt to understand. Pity.</p>

<p>Not only do flights in the southern hemisphere disappear off of GPS for the majority of their flight time, but their routes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNVgzk3tbl0">prove the Earth is Flat</a>.</p>

<p>Your objections are weaker and weaker with each post.

<p>11 hours from Auckland to Santiago. Absolutely impossible on a flat earth, and you will never, ever be able to get around this cold, hard fact. The TWO axes of rotation of the stars as well, in the north (Polaris) and the south (Sigma Octantis / Southern Cross), but you seem too dense to even grasp that argument, so I shant continue to bother.

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any proof that satellites exist? I&#39;ve summoned satellite technicians who never post in this subreddit but need me to believe in satellites before with this question. When I ask them for a complete schematic of a satellite so that I can independently reproduce one of my own, they are forced to admit that they don&#39;t have any complete schematics.</p>

<p>GPS is done via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station">repeater towers</a>, which explains why your coverage drops off as you venture away from them. If there were thousands of satellites in orbit, you should have an amazing signal in the middle of nowhere with no interference. But we&#39;re talking about electromagnetic signals here, which get exponentially weaker with distance. Which is the more likely source of the signal, something dozens of miles away at most that is powered off of a grid with enormous capacity, or something that is hundreds of miles overhead with a self-contained power source of much less capacity?</p>

<p>Back to your fuzzy image, it doesn&#39;t invalidate <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">independently reproducible proof of non-curvature.</a> It matches the same character as the rest of the NASA mythology, i.e. it is only reproducible by a small cabal of people and it matches the current level of our ability to create illusions with special effects.</p>

<p>Even moreso, the entire concept is nonsense. At the distance the ISS allegedly floats above Earth, somehow compelled by Gravity to never actually fall, it&#39;s impossible that we could see it at all, much less find it and image it in any resolution when it is allegedly moving at thousands of miles an hour. Also, without an independent light source focused on it, it would not be visible at all. The brightly glowing glob of light that NASA tells us to track as the ISS can not possibly be the Sun reflecting off an object the size of the ISS at the altitude claimed.</p>

<p>These are all obvious to anyone who actually looks into the claims seriously, but I bet you still believe the moon landings are true, unable to tell the difference between <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UkWZuha.jpg">1960s special effects</a> and reality.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re just going to repeat the same things I could find on wikipedia or <a href="/r/space">/r/space</a>, you can save your time. Do you have any reproducible proof of curvature that you can present?</p>

<p>It&#39;s physically impossible for that to be the ISS; at that distance, the ISS wouldn&#39;t be able to be seen, nor would it appear as a glowing glob of light. NASA and independent &quot;amateur&quot; astronomers associated with NASA are the only ones who can produce a photo of something that looks like the &quot;ISS&quot; (the symbol for Baphomet).</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s Gravity, with a capital G as in Freemason, a theory that was only created to continue the spherical Lie. There is no reproducible evidence that it exists; no matter how many times we try to put a massive spherical object next to the smallest object we can, we cannot observe or reproduce any &quot;gravitational&quot; pull from mass.</p>

<p>The much simpler explanation is density. In every medium, including air, denser objects sink. That&#39;s all that is necessary; it&#39;s only when you try to claim that we exist on a ball that you need an explanation for how everything isn&#39;t flung off the ball by centrifugal force.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_experiment">lololololol</a> And yes, you can do that yourself. I helped my brother set up a science fair experiment for it. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>So why do things still fall in a vacuum? Again, this isn&#39;t some conspiracy, you can build your own vacuum chamber with a glass jar and a pump and test this.</p>

<p>And, Density does not determine fall speed. You can get a roughly equal sized stuffed animal and rock, and drop them at the same time. They&#39;ll fall at the same speed, despite that the rock is much more dense than the stuffed animal. (At least that&#39;ll be the case til they&#39;re at a speed where air resistance is a big factor). </p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to say that it doesn&#39;t matter, as long as it&#39;s <em>more</em> dense than air, why wouldn&#39;t the inverse be true? Hydrogen is a better lifting gas than helium, after all. </p>

<p>Lastly, why does buoyancy exist in the first place in your model? In conventional science it&#39;s because of a pressure gradient which arises because of gravity. </p>

<p>Experimentation is often the bane of this sort of conspiracy. </p>

<p>I never said it did; that&#39;s partly a property of the medium through which the falling is occurring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I challenge you to build your own Cavendish experiment. I&#39;ve reproduced the results. Why don&#39;t you give it a try? Here&#39;s a youtube video of a basic setup some high schoolers built: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgWaYng2eRg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgWaYng2eRg</a></p>

<p>If you can&#39;t try that yourself, well, then you&#39;re just burying your head in the sand. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We can only create a &quot;near-vacuum&quot;, and because of density, for the same reasons.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what&#39;s the mathematical basis for your model of falling? If it&#39;s near vacuum, the pressure gradient that&#39;s able to be exerted on an object will be smaller. And yet, things fall just as fast inside a vacuum chamber. Why is that? Is all of newtonian dynamics wrong? Does f =/= ma? Because that&#39;s extremely easy to demonstrate experimentally, so you&#39;d better have some damn good proof if you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s wrong too. </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Density does not determine fall speed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said it did; that&#39;s partly a property of the medium through which the falling is occurring</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So then WHY do lighter gases produce a stronger lifting force? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s the explanation, no spherical Gravity required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You missed the part where I said the pressure gradient is there because of gravity. In conventional science, the material above the level you&#39;re at is pushing downwards, creating a pressure gradient. Where does this pressure gradient even come from in your explanation? Why does it exist? If it&#39;s all bouyancy, then how do zero-G plane dives work? The air inside is at rest, but things still float around. In your explanation, they&#39;d still be pushed down just as hard as before. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t sound like you&#39;re interested in actually learning more though.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m trying to learn more about how your worldview works by asking the ever-important question, &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>The motion observed in the video was not caused by gravitational attraction. They did not (and could not possibly) observe acceleration of a 2 kg torsion balance from a pair of 50 lb free weights. </p>

<p>Assume they are two point masses just 5 cm apart. </p>

<p>F = G m M/ R<sup>2</sup> </p>

<p>The force is G<em>2</em>45/0.05<sup>2</sup> = 2.4 x 10<sup>-6</sup> Newtons (This is a gross overestimation of the force involved.) </p>

<p>The affect of 2.4 micro Newtons of force on a 2kg mass would accelerate it at a rate of (a = F/m)  1.2 x 10-6 m/s/s </p>

<p>If the video is sped up 5 times, the third bounce on the video takes about 15 seconds. In that time the mass would be accelerated (v = 0.5<em>a</em>t<sup>2)</sup> from 0 to about 0.3 mm/sec.  The initial velocity in the video is about 0.5 m/s. <strong>It&#39;s not reasonable to say that they judged a difference in speed of just 0.003 m/s.</strong> The one minute period of the oscillation of a torsion balance this size suggests that the fishing line is very stiff. It will take a lot of force to twist this away from its equilibrium position. Try it again with a line as light weight and long as possible. Then look for a difference in the equilibrium position as you move the masses. The forces are too small to observe an acceleration directly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet, the pendulum moved away from it&#39;s equilibrium position and to a new equilibrium, due to new forces becoming involved. What could that force possibly be? </p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re not very good at judging times and distances, it seems. Here&#39;s another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA2Xn7nfKds">cavendish experiment</a> in real time. The above video is considerably faster than 5x. You have to remember, gravity isn&#39;t the only force acting on the pendulum. The torsion of the string is a factor, but it&#39;s a small number. The period of the oscillation is large because the forces at work are very small. With the long lever arms, the weak gravity can counteract the torsion of the line. There is air resistance and other forces keeping it from just accelerating towards the weights freely. But, the equilibrium position is clearly changed by the introduction of the weights. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what the levers are for. The force twisting the pendulum is amplified by the force of the lever arms. So fully, you have the force of gravity exerting a tiny twisting force on the pendulum, and you have the torsion of the string trying to oppose that twist. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s how you should set up your experiment. Hang up the pendulum.  Let it come to rest in it&#39;s equilibrium position. Place two weights near the ends of it, like in the video, and observe what happens. I&#39;ll bet they come closer to each other and come to rest at a new equilibrium position where they&#39;re closer to the weights. If it&#39;s not gravity then what IS it? </p>

<p>I notice you&#39;ve also dodged my other questions, so I&#39;ll repeat them. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve already responded to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IEcAo8G.jpg">This</a> and by extension the railroad one. I&#39;ve taken you on in the whole gravity and ISS thing by responding that you can, in fact, observe the evidence of the round-earth theory. I suppose I can keep going. Rockets work in vacuum because of newton&#39;s third law. You send gas out the back of your rocket at speed, there&#39;s an equal and opposite reaction sending you forward. You can observe that the moon is a sphere by just looking at how light falls upon it, unless it&#39;s some sort of projection. You can make out details of Jupiter and Saturn with a 50 dollar telescope, including seeing rings and orbiting moons which you can observe in motion around them. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some other batshit explanations too. There&#39;s the stellar parallax one. Thing is, stellar parallax is observed, it&#39;s just that the distances are so great that it&#39;s hard to do so (But still possible with a digital camera). </p>

<p>But you&#39;re rage quitting, so I guess that means I win. </p>

<p>GPS is done via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station">repeater towers</a>, which explains why your coverage drops off as you venture away from them. If there were thousands of satellites in orbit, you should have an amazing signal in the middle of nowhere with no interference. But we&#39;re talking about electromagnetic signals here, which get exponentially weaker with distance. Which is the more likely source of the signal, something dozens of miles away at most that is powered off of a grid with enormous capacity, or something that is hundreds of miles overhead with a self-contained power source of much less capacity?</p>

<p>No, the vast majority of them are just gullible specialists who work on compartmentalized components and are prevented from ever seeing the big picture.

Anyway, do you believe that some illuminati type group imagined satellites based on their ideas of what hypothetical technology might be possible if the earth were round and under the influence of gravity? 
These people then somehow trickled this satellite idea into the mainstream where society grabbed a hold of it, advanced it (or was made to believe they did), validated it using their, apparently incorrect view of the universe (physics, gravity etc...) and modern technological capabilities?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satellites were first dreamed up by Arthur C. Clarke, a science fiction writer. This is credited as the first time science fiction &#39;predicted&#39; the future, but it&#39;s not much of a prediction if you know it will happen because you&#39;re planning it. There are many authors who have written extremely prescient predictions of the NWO agenda, and many of them were probably working with inside knowledge, preparing the masses with predictive programming.

<p>FYI, you need to ski for several miles to get to the station at the geographic south pole. Everyone or at least someone carries a compass for that. You think they don&#39;t? You don&#39;t think there are any compasses there at all? You think scientists and tourists are all part of a scam? Are the walls closing in on you?</p>

The ocean is curved; there&#39;s even an equation to determine/confirm where the horizon begins from your point of view (usually ends around a few miles, depends on your height/altitude). Go do some research now. Not going to waste my time confirming what I&#39;ve already confirmed. Not going to convince you that you&#39;re wrong; only you can do that. </p>

<p>Well, you can&#39;t see into infinity, but you can see farther than should be possible were the Earth actually curved. There are many examples of this, but a copy of &quot;Lighthouses of the World&quot; and a calculator are all you really need to prove that no curvature exists.</p>

 I did read it and parse it out, but you refuse to acknowledge that. Curvature IS easily observable through science.....lol. What&#39;s wrong with that &#39;paper&#39; is that it proves nothing about flat earth and acknowledges curvature whilst having undertones of denying curvature, and it&#39;s unsourced! What I&#39;m getting from this at least is....flat earth IS NOT observable through science or even literally, or else I&#39;d see friggin mountain ranges in the direction of the ocean. </p>

<p>Any explanations on the mountain range issue? Or can we move on?</p>

<p>False. You can &#39;circumnavigate&#39; east-west and end up in the same spot, and this is consistent with the Flat Earth model. However you can <strong>not</strong> travel north-south and circumnavigate the world, and this too is consistent with the Flat Earth model.</p>

<p>So since the very first link in this post was a model of the Flat Earth <em>that shows the edges of our exploration</em>, you have now admitted that this is your <strong>second</strong> comment in a thread which you didn&#39;t even read!</p>

<p>General consensus is the enemy of reason.  Have you seen the information regarding social media propaganda campaigns?  Eglin air force base?  If you want to know the truth about anything you must read and use your own reasoning.  This topic specifically involves things that you can test yourself.  Spend the time and actually consider the arguments before dismissing it.</p>

Are you assuming that scientists down there don&#39;t have compasses? You want me to go down to the South Pole for you?

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t begin to solve your problems. </p>

<p>Consider: </p>

<p>The photo you are referring to was taken from Grand Mere state park in Michigan. </p>

<p>The distance between these two points on a map is 55 miles. </p>

<p>The tallest building in Chicago is the Sears Tower standing 1,451 feet. </p>

<p>At this distance, the curvature of the earth would put the city approximately 1,900 feet below the visible horizon. </p>

<p>What explanation can you provide as to why it is not only possible to see the Sears Tower, but the entire city skyline except for what you propose is the bottom of the buildings (I believe the bottom of the buildings to be obscured by the reflection of the water.) </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t check the calculation, let&#39;s assume it is correct. Then, still the 1900ft are only valid when seen from 0 inch above the ground. If you bring your own height into the calculation, it looks a bit different.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(I believe the bottom of the buildings to be obscured by the reflection of the water.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the earth would be flat, this reflection on the water should show you the full length of the buildings upside down, in fact, it would subjectively <em>double</em> the perception of the far away buildings. Since you don&#39;t look from exactly floor level, but from a position that is heightened by the height of your body (at least, maybe some more), the reflections on the water would be unable to obscure anything.</p>
