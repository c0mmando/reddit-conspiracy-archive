I&#39;m not much into conspiracy theories and generally consider myself a skeptic, but a friend of mine is.  I&#39;m not sure if he visits this sub-reddit or not, but I think he would like it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s my question:
He&#39;s been on a Freemasonry kick for awhile, and while we are on good terms, we tend to not speak about issues like this (he can get pretty offensive and rude if you don&#39;t agree with him, regardless of how tactful I try to be).</p>

<p>Could someone give me a rundown of some of the modern freemason conspiracies?  I&#39;d like to at least know what he&#39;s talking about.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Nietzsche may have been a sort of scribe and philosopher for freemasonry</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Not a Brother.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a few photos of him with his hand reaching into his jacket, which symbolizes membership.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That gesture predates Freemasonry quite a bit and is tied up in two historical elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>The right hand has always been associated, in the West, with the good and/or spiritual side of man.</li>
<li>The heart was originally thought to be the seat of intellect and reason (the function of the brain was unknown, but the heart noticeably responded to emotional and intellectual stimulus).</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore the association developed of placing the right hand over the heart as a gesture of dedication, fidelity and honesty. In fact, the phrase &quot;hand on heart,&quot; came to mean honesty for this reason.</p>

<p>But, like any other gesture that becomes common in formal situations, it became less specific over time, and eventually was seen as merely an &quot;honorable&quot; gesture and was as common in portraits and formal settings as the peace sign gesture is in Asian selfies today. In essence, it became a meaningless, &quot;I&#39;m having my picture take,&quot; gesture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of people that might have been Masons. There&#39;s no reason to believe that he couldn&#39;t have been, just no evidence to suggest he was.</p>

<p>A better example is Isaac Newton, whose ideas were much more in line with early Freemasonry, but other than the fact that he definitely knew and associated with some people who <em>were</em> Freemasons, we just don&#39;t have enough evidence to say that he ever joined.</p>

<p>Early records are almost all lost, so all we can do is speak in terms of probabilities in most cases.</p>

<p>Pretty amusing, but not true. This is a modification of an actual claim, not against Freemasonry, but by the Catholic Inquisition against the Knights Templar when they sought to confiscate the Templars&#39; wealth for the King of France. Their inquisitioners tortured the Templars until they &quot;admitted&quot; to urinating or spitting on the cross among a long list of other made-up charges.</p>

<p>Nope. Many of my Brothers are (along with a smattering of every other mainstream religion and a few generic believers who don&#39;t have a religion to hang their hat on).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think Freemasonry is all that connected to anything, and being so decentralized, especially in the US, the logistics of such involvement would be horrendous and messy. Perhaps at one point, in the US, politics and Freemasonry were deeply entwined, but the anti-Masonic period (early-mid 19th century) brought that to an end. During the Golden Age of Fraternalism (late 19th, early 20th century) I think that the connection was much more social than anything else, but Freemasonry was too blue collar and there were too many fraternal organizations for Freemasonry to be a true nexus of anything. We don&#39;t have a name for the boom in membership from the mid to late 20th century, and during that period, the Fraternity wielded far less influence than during even the Golden Age of Fraternalism.</p>

<p>Today, membership has shrunk and there&#39;s just no way that the Fraternity as it is could be at the center of such control.</p>

<p>That said, I do think that there are powerful people who, as individuals, seek control over vast territories of human endeavor, but I&#39;m not convinced that any of them bother joining our Fraternity...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of people that might have been Masons. There&#39;s no reason to believe that he couldn&#39;t have been, just no evidence to suggest he was.</p>

<p>A better example is Isaac Newton, whose ideas were much more in line with early Freemasonry, but other than the fact that he definitely knew and associated with some people who <em>were</em> Freemasons, we just don&#39;t have enough evidence to say that he ever joined.</p>

<p>Early records are almost all lost, so all we can do is speak in terms of probabilities in most cases.</p>
