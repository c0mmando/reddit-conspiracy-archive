        The Mystery of Thermite reside and Molten Steel // 700c+ Hot Fires in the WTC rubble

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What are the official/mainstream explanations for the persisting heat at ground zero, and the inability to put out the fires for so long?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       AFAIK, there is no
       <em>
        official
       </em>
       explanation. For every supporter of the official conspiracy though, you'll receive on average 2 to 3 hypotheses involving some exotic chemical reaction between steel, concrete dust, gypsum wallboard, water and aluminum that somehow formed a self-assembling galvanothermitic kiln or somesuch, and in a stroke of luck, it did not also result in spontaneous biogenesis of space-faring fungi civilizations.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Some conspiracy theory sources reason that this was because thermite makes it's own oxygen and can be used under water.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Some
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite">
        scientific theory sources reason
       </a>
       that thermite is
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a pyrotechnic composition of metal powder fuel and metal oxide. When ignited by heat, thermite undergoes an exothermic reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction. Most varieties are not explosive but can create brief bursts of high temperature in a small area. Its form of action is similar to that of other fuel-oxidizer mixtures, such as black powder.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thermites have diverse compositions. Fuels include aluminium, magnesium, titanium, zinc, silicon, and boron. Aluminium is common because of its high boiling point and low cost. Oxidizers include bismuth(III) oxide, boron(III) oxide, silicon(IV) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, iron(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, copper(II) oxide, and lead(II,IV) oxide.[1]
       </p>
       <p>
        The reaction is used for thermite welding, often used to join rail tracks. Thermites have also been used in metal refining, demolition of munitions, and in incendiary weapons. Some thermite-like mixtures are used as pyrotechnic initiators in firework.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       IOW, thermite
       <em>
        by definition
       </em>
       does not "make" its own oxygen - the oxygen is already present in the thermite in the form of an oxide (for example, rust), and thusly does not require a steady, external oxygen supply like, for example, the well-known combustion processes of hydrocarbons.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Unlike the official "jet fuel" explanation, the abundant presence of thermitic nanocomposites as explained by
        <a href="/u/WTCMolybdenum4753">
         /u/WTCMolybdenum4753
        </a>
        is consistent with the observation of sustained heat pockets in the absence of an external oxygen source.

       NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.

         Early in 2002, Barnett and two WPI colleagues published an analysis of a section of steel from one of the Twin Towers, along with sections from WTC 7, as an appendix to FEMA’s 2002 World Trade Center Building Performance Study

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire. Yet metallurgical studies on WTC steel brought back to WPI reveal that a novel phenomenon – called a eutectic reaction – occurred at the surface, causing intergranular melting capable of turning a solid steel girder into Swiss cheese.

        A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.

          In May 2004, the RJ Lee Group issued a report, entitled “WTC Dust Signature,” at the request of the Deutsche Bank, in order to prove (to its insurance company) that the building was “pervasively contaminated with WTC Dust

        Underground fires burned at temperatures up to 2,000 degrees. As the
huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed.
        <strong>
         OSHA called in Mohammad Ayub and Scott Jin, structural
engineers from its national office, to assess the situation. They recommended a
special handling procedure, including the use of specialized rigging and instruments.

       The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible

       <strong>
        NIST admits the falling debris did not initiate the collapse of WTC 7. NIST also admits that they have "no evidence" to support the theory that the falling debris caused the fire.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST's statements are unproven theories.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fires couldn't be fought because the water mains were wrecked...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       NIST specifically mentions that there have been high rise fires without the aid of sprinklers. And no global collapses.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Proximate cause was found to be long-span horizontal beams on some upper floors that were very vulnerable to heat expansion,
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       NIST never proved this theory. They released a computer model as "proof" and withheld the data from anyone asking to test it. Also, NIST's peers stated that the information they did release about the creation of the model was "unrealistic." Stating that NIST didn't heat slabs when they should have. This caused tension in the slab. NIST then completely removed slabs from the model once they reached a certain tension. This caused a lack of lateral support for the beams. Causing them to buckle. NIST then completely removed beams from the model once they buckled.
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST also ignore that the building would act like a giant heat sink, they do not factor this into any model. Absolutely ridiculous
      </p>
      <p>
       "Unrealistic."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Regarding the large-scale finite element analysis using ANSYS, it appears that the failure criteria for the slab may underestimate the true performance and be responsible for initiating the failure (although failure limits used for the studs are not clear in the report) Concrete strain limits of 0.15% in tension or 0.4% in compression are applied at the slab mid-depth, after which the slab element is completely removed from the grid. For slab elements near beams, this removes the lateral support to the beam. When the beam subsequently buckles, it is also removed from the analysis. Failure then progresses. This is quite unrealistic."

       This is evidenced by the fact the four simulations that NIST performed with their "global LS-DYNA model" (WTC7)  None of the computer animations look anything like the actual observed collapse, the models and alleged simulations are not based in reality

       I stand corrected!  I didn't know progressive collapse was a well-defined technical term.  It only occurred in WTC7 according to your source:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The failure of WTC 7 was an example of a fire-induced progressive collapse.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also this is what caused WTC1 and 2 to collapse according to the same source:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [..] the WTC 1 and WTC 2 failures, which were brought on by multiple factors, including structural damage caused by the aircraft impact, extensive dislodgement of the sprayed fire-resistive materials or fireproofing in the impacted region, and a weakening of the steel structures created by the fires.

       If that was the case the collapses wouldn't have taken 15 to 20 seconds  in the case of WTC 1 and 2 with the collapse front lagging behind the falling debris, and the WTC7 penthouse wouldn't have collapsed 5 seconds before the rest of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of WTC7, the exterior frame accelerated at close to free fall only for 2.5 seconds because the interior had already collapsed; when the exterior met the interior it slowed down.
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC7 was 175m high and free-fall time from that height is 4.22 seconds; 2.5 seconds is only 60% of that.

       If they were nanothermite, they would have, by definition of thermite, contained elemental, that is non chemically bound aluminum.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Niels &amp; Harrit document doesn't demonstrate that.  Nothing in their paper indicates that the aluminum in the scans isn't simply chemically bound aluminum silicate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, it is most likely kaolinite, a common paint ingredient, which has a characteristic hexagonal pellet shape, as can be seen in the scans.
      </p>
      <p>
       More to the point, James Millette's, the author of the report I linked to, and who is an actual forensic scientist, examined the WTC dust following the selection instructions given in the Niels-Harrit document that you just cited, and could find no trace of elemental aluminum.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was just no thermite.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you know all this since people have already pointed this to you multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR.  Truthers made nanothermite claim, got paper published in shitty open access journal god knows how, leading to two editors of that journal resigning; years later forensic scientist checked these claims and found them to be false.

       "Steel primer paints must be resistant to fire and withstand temperatures well over 700 C, so we know that the diversionary claims about primer paint are not true...Millette’s samples “ashed” at or below 400 C and therefore are not only not red/gray chips (which ignite at 430 C and form spheres identical to those from thermitic reactions) but are also not primer paint from the WTC. But he pretty much admits that." - Kevin Ryan

        According to Dr. Jones: "The paint and the red/gray chips have a distinctly different appearance (see for example recent photos by Jon Cole which confirm this fact) and different behaviors in the MEK solvent." He states that "the red/gray chips (still wet with MEK) remained very hard, easy to pick up with forceps without deforming." Jones emphasizes that all the tested paint chips, including the primer chips, "become very flexible and limp after soaking and still wet with MEK," concluding that "[t]here can be no mistaking the distinction, despite what the JREF'ers say."

         According to Millette, his chips are primer paint from the WTC, but he has not matched them to any primer paint that was specified for the Towers. NIST studied the Tnemec primer-paint that coated the steel frames of the Twin Towers, but Harrit rules Tnemec out in a  paper dedicated to this issue in particular. Harrit notes that Tnemec displays "strong signals" for zinc, chromium and magnesium, while their red/gray chips lack signals from those elements "in intensities significantly above the baseline noise." Coincidentally, Millette agrees in his preliminary report and also eliminates Tnemec as the source for the chips because, "..none of the 177 different [Tnemec]coatings are a match for the red layer coating found in this study." Harrit adds that another reason to rule out Tnemec is the fact that it does not ignite given the same temperature as their chips: "Notice, that the primer paint – being basically a ceramic material – is chemically stable at temperatures up to 800 C."

         Mark Basile´s ignition experiments reveal why Millette avoids the ignition test: If Millette is investigating the same chips as Harrit and Basile, the ignition result would reveal the molten iron spheres and most likely Millette´s inability to explain them without confirming the "active thermitic material" hypothesis. And if Millette is in fact studying the wrong chips as we suspect, the ignition test would also reveal that fact by exposing the inactive chips, and invalidate Millette´s paper. Another way of spotting Millette´s transparent failure to address Harrit´s challenge for a "prosaic substance," is realizing that if paint could actually replicate the active chip ignition results, Millette could refute Harrit´s paper with a simple demonstration of some known type of paint igniting with a flash and leaving molten iron spheres. As one commenter on a forum asked, "Do you think Millette et al. can swing a few bucks for an oxyacetylene torch, a graphite block, and a pair of tweezers?" Similarly, John-Michael stated on May 3rd 2011, "Of course 'debunkers' could easily prove the paper wrong, in part, by simply getting an oxy-acetylene torch and burning up some primer paints." They have not carried out any such experiments, but Mark Basile has tested three samples of confirmed paints, including a sample of WTC primer-paint: Basile heated all samples beyond the ignition point of the active red/gray chips, but none of them even ignited - so obviously the paint chips are hardly capable of leaving molten metal spheres of any kind, see video below.

        Oystein and Kminek propose that the chips are most likely LaClede primer paint, which is an aromatic epoxy resin with an amine curing agent according to Kminek. But Zugam points out that unfortunately for them, Millette compares his chips to an epoxy spectrum that does not represent an aromatic epoxy. In response, Zugam complains that "Milette should have chosen FTIR for [the] primer paints in question." He goes on to say that Millette´s revised report "should include FTIR for LaClede since that is the only paint option left, even though his paper so far kind of rules it out..." Zugam then points out that a good report should also demonstrate and compare the spectra for known sol-gel super-thermites that have an organic matrix: Since energetic nano-composites are available fully organic and in hybrid metallic variations with a substantial organic matrix, no competent researcher could evaluate the FTIR data without noting those hybrid forms of superthermite. Millette´s data are ultimately flawed due to the poor match to a spectrum that does not represent the correct epoxy-paint, and the lack of data to represent the hybrid varieties of superthermite - so this portion of Millette´s paper is inconclusive, at best. And as we have noted, Millette´s preliminary report is perhaps invalid and irrelevant because the data may not represent the correct red/gray chips:

        The existence of elemental aluminium in the red chips is proven by the formation of the microspheres in the DSC, largely iron. What else can start to rip the oxygen out of iron oxide at below 400 deg C, then have a runaway temperature increase at least to the melting point of iron? Those who dispute this on the grounds that oxygen was present, and that the energy came from the combustion of organic material, must provide an explanation for why such special conditions are required in a blast furnace to produce iron. The idea that you could heat a little kaolin and coke and iron oxide to a mere 400 deg C and see it suddenly run away and produce molten iron is clearly a fantasy

       Wikipedia documents the official explanation about heat &amp; thermite.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        NIST released its final report on the collapse of 7 World Trade Center on November 20, 2008. Investigators used videos, photographs and building design documents to come to their conclusions. The investigation could not include physical evidence as the materials from the building lacked characteristics allowing them to be positively identified and were therefore disposed of prior to the initiation of the investigation. The report concluded that the building's collapse was due to the effects of the fires which burned for almost seven hours. The fatal blow to the building came when the 13th floor collapsed, weakening a critical steel support column that led to catastrophic failure, and extreme heat caused some steel beams to lose strength, causing further failures throughout the buildings until the entire structure succumbed. Also cited as a factor was the collapse of the nearby towers, which broke the city water main, leaving the sprinkler system in the bottom half of the building without water...
       </p>
       <p>
        NIST also concluded that it is unlikely that the quantities of thermite needed could have been carried into the building undetected. Demolition advocates have responded that they do not claim that thermite was used, but rather that nano-thermite, far more powerful than thermite, was used. Finally, the theory that fires from the large amount of diesel fuel stored in the building caused the collapse was also investigated and ruled out.

        Marvin Bush 9/11 Security and the Planting of Explosives
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       We now know beyond any doubt that the three WTC towers were part of a controlled demolition, this inevitably leads us to the fact that thousands of pounds of explosives would have had to have been planted in and around the buildings' core columns and throughout its internal framework, how could this have been done?
      </p>

       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratesec">
        Stratesec (formerly known as Securacom and Burns and Roe Securacom)
       </a>
       was a security company founded in 1987 and based out of Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. The company went public on October 2, 1997 on the American Stock Exchange[2] and was delisted in 2002.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       A company named Stratesec had an ongoing contractor to handle security at the World Trade Center "up to the day the buildings fell down" according to CEO Barry McDaniel. The company, formerly named Securacom, acquired an $8.3 million World Trade Center contract in October 1996, according to SEC filings. The company also provided security for Dulles International Airport and United Airlines between 1995 and 2001. Two of the commandeered flights on September 11th were United Airlines', and one took off from Dulles
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Marvin Bush joined Securacom when it was capitalized by the Kuwait-American Corporation, a private investment firm in D.C. that was the security company's major investor, sometimes holding a controlling interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       KuwAm has been linked to the Bush family financially since the Gulf War. One of its principals and a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, Mishal Yousef Saud al Sabah, served on the board of Stratesec.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Marvin P. Bush, the president’s younger brother, was a principal in a company called Securacom that provided security for the World Trade Center, United Airlines, and Dulles International Airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       He took this position the day after Bush took office in 2001, Marvin P. Bush was handed a $50 million plus contract to handle security of the Twin Towers and Dulles Airport. He had absolutely no background to indicate he could handle such a contract, or the job it entailed, but this is how all the Bushes got rich, with government contracts given to them by other Bush family members.

       Jet fuel can't melt steel beams, so why was there molten metal at the WTC collapse sites?
      </p>
      <p>
       NIST claims that WTC 1&amp;2 collapsed due to jet fueled fires (just normal offices fires for WTC7) which were not hot enough to produce molten steel or iron, but also claim that if there had been molten steel or iron in the debris afterwards, it would have been irrelevant to the cause of the collapses. The evidence of molten steel or iron cannot be called “irrelevant,” given the fact that the building fires, as NIST pointed out, cannot explain it.

        Steel – which has a melting point of 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit – may weaken and bend, but does not melt during an ordinary office fire.

        A one-inch column has been reduced to half-inch thickness. Its edges – which are curled like a paper scroll – have been thinned to almost razor sharpness. Gaping holes – some larger than a silver dollar – let light shine through a formerly solid steel flange. This Swiss cheese appearance shocked all of the fire-wise professors, who expected to see distortion and bending – but not holes.

huge cranes pulled steel beams from the pile, safety experts worried about the
effects of the extreme heat on the crane rigging and the hazards of contact with the
hot steel. And they were concerned that applying water to cool the steel could cause
a steam explosion that would propel nearby objects with deadly force. Special
expertise was needed.

       The fact that the rubble contained steel or iron that had been melted shows that the buildings were destroyed by something other than fire and airplane impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all of this physical evidence is combined with the testimony about explosions from many types of professionals, the claim that the Twin Towers were brought down by nothing other than the airplane impacts and resulting fires is simply not credible

       Because there's no way thermite can explain it.

       My personal assumption is that the pile of debris, with oxygen fed in through subway system, created a furnace. But then the extent and composition of molten metal in the debris is very unclear anyway.

       The point being, I see the "molten metal" issue brought up frequently as some sort of point against the
       <em>
        official version
       </em>
       yet it's no more consistent with any conspiracy theory (other than Judy Woods' perhaps) than it is with the official version.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither thermite nor conventional explosives would explain molten metal days or weeks later better than the official version of events.

       If thermite were present and responsible for the collapse it would long since have cooled. No thermite reaction is going to continue for
       <em>
        three weeks

      </p>
      <p>
       For the patent you cite to be relevant you'd have to be proposing that these explosives were applied, were rapid enough to create the collapse sequence that some claim is impossible by gravity alone, yet were either slow enough to still be reacting three weeks later, or had for some reason been intended to stay stable for some number of days or weeks after the collapse (and survived the collapse to do so).
      </p>
      <p>
       What explains the molten metal is exceptionally high temperatures within the debris pile. I can see no reason that those temperatures couldn't be achieved with fire, and I can see now way to explain how thermite or some similar substance could, were the fires unable to, be generating that heat days and weeks after the collapse.

       "The occurrence of such extreme, sharp spikes in VOCs in air at GZ indicate something other than the behavior of a typical structure fire. Oxygen influx as a result of shifting of materials within the pile might have created an increase in combustion of material in localized areas. But these spikes in VOCs, at levels thousands of times higher than seen in other structure fires, suggest extremely violent but short-lived fire events. Probably the most striking spike in toxic air emissions, found in EPA monitoring data, occurred on 9th February, 2002. Note (Table 1 ) that this was nearly 5 months after 9/11, and after nearly all the debris had been cleared from GZ. In fact, the levels of some species, like toluene and styrene, were some of the highest observed at the site. But the levels of benzene and propylene detected on that day were far above previous measurements, at 610,000 and 990,000 ppb, respectively. Other VOCs were measured at their peak levels on this date, including 1,3-butadiene at 400,000 ppb." "EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite"

       Thermite is a relatively fast combustion material, it completely consumes it's fuel in a short time and the reaction ceases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how you can have it both ways - if thermite were used to demolish the towers it apparently had to be powerful and exact enough to destroy dozens (or hundreds, depending on who's claim you're looking at) of columns with very precise timing. Yet somehow it's still expected to be reacting and causing molten metal weeks later?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is that I can't see how the molten metal claim, when we are talking about things that happened within the debris pile days and weeks later, are supportive of the thermite claims.

       So now we're claiming that massive deposits of thermite were spontaneously combusting within the debris pile one, two and

       months later?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's clear that Jones, Ryan and Gourley have preconceived ideas about what took place at the WTC, and I think this paper is a result of that. I can't possibly concede that their explanation is the most likely. It's literally positing that large amounts of their supposed
       <em>
        nanothermite
       </em>
       were reacting an exceptionally long time after the collapse.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say that these measurements are entirely uncharacteristic of typical structure files, which is true, but there was nothing typical about 9/11. No other structure fire has involved the contents of two 110-story office buildings burning a huge debris pile for months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The readings they cite are also not typical of the result of buildings that have been demolished by thermite, because there is no history of that. They discount one theory based on not-entirely-relevant history in favour of another theory based on no history whatsoever.

       Claiming all of thermite burned at the exact same time is a ridiculous assumption based on no data. The unignited chips that were discovered work against your theory. Again, if fire can do it, so can fire combined with "the   presence   of

       But I'm not talking about the Ryan (et al) paper. I'm talking about the other paper you like to cite every chance you get: "Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe"
      </p>
      <p>
       The editor of that journal said she didn't review it before it was published. This supports
       <a href="/u/thinkmorebetterer">
        /u/thinkmorebetterer
       </a>
       's implication that there were pre-conceived ideas about what took place on 9/11 and adds to it, suggesting that there was a political viewpoint behind its publication.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of a scientific journal publishes a paper without being reviewed by the Editor in Chief?  How can this possibly be considered "peer reviewed?"
      </p>
      <p>
       But going back to the Ryan paper for a second, Here's what the EPA had to say about the spike in VOC's from their published paper that Ryan uses to argue:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition, the compound 1,3-diphenyl propane [1',1'-(1,3-propanediyl)bis-benzene] is found in significant concentrations. This species has not previously been reported from ambient sampling. It has been associated with polyvinyl chloride materials, which are believed to be in abundance at the WTC site.
       </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a later peer-reviewed and published paper that also explains the spike in VOCs:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In addition, the compound 1,3-diphenylpropane- [ 1',1'-(1,3-propanediyl)bis-benzene] was observed, and to our knowledge, this species has not previously been reported from ambient sampling. It has been associated with polystyrene and other plastics, which are in abundance at the WTC site.

       So you blatantly topic shifted. And you continue to do so for the first half of this comment. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you still fail to account for the VOC spikes as the PM had already died off.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        EPA also monitored very fine particulate matter (PM) and other sizes of PM. PM is probably the most reliable indicator for the activity of structure fires, as such fires are generally known to burn incompletely, and produce PM that drifts up and outward from the source. EPA data from the West Broadway sampling site, the location closest to GZ where PM was monitored, show the following trend in very fine PM (PM 2.5 , or all particles \ 2.5 l m) in October and November 2001 (Fig. 4 ). These data show that the peaks in levels of very fine PM near GZ correspond to different dates than the peaks for the previously discussed combustion products. The five stron- gest peaks in PM 2.5 levels are centered on 23th, 26th September, and 3rd, 10th, 20th October, closer in time to the events of 9/11. None of these dates correspond to the dates of five peaks in VOCs noted above. Additionally, it is clear that the levels of PM 2.5 emissions rose more gradu- ally, and died down more gradually, indicating slower fire dynamics as might be expected from the burning of the organic materials previously thought to exist in the WTC. These data suggest that the greatest level of fire activity, associated solely with the typical fuel sources expected in the WTC, was completed by the third week of October. That is, the materials expected to burn (incompletely) in a structure fire, producing PM, were largely burned off by mid- to late-October. Therefore, the extreme spikes in air concentrations of the five VOCs noted above, particularly on 3rd, 8th November, and 9th February, point not to other sources of typical combustible materials but to other forms of com- bustion. Such forms of combustion appear to be violent and short-lived, and thus similar to the effects of energetic materials, like thermite"

       No PM = VOCs aren't from the official story combustion. Sorry. Why'd you even bother responding if you were planning on topic shifting/not addressing the paper?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: it really helps if you actually read the paper/my quote. The quote is in reference to benzene/polystyrene. Not the 1,3. Try again. Also, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons paper is directly linked, and refuted in the paper I provided.

       you didn't read the paper. It's worse than I thought.

       The argument is about a different paper. In a different journal. With a different publisher. Topic shift confirmed. A paper you just failed at refuting. Which is why you're still trying to talk about the other one, rather than the one in question. You going to refute it? Or continue stalling?
