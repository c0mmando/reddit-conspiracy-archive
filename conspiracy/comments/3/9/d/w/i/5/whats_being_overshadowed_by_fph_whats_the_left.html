       The timing of this is suspect. Let's take all the people on reddit who give a shit about fundamental aspects censorship and put the blinders on them. I haven't seen this level of gunuine eddit activity since thefappening.

       I think the influx of users from reddit is something voat's servers can't handle at the moment.  Pretty much just a constant 503 since yesterday.

       I was wondering this myself and I think it's less of 'what the left hand is doing' and more 'let's see what happens if...'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet as a whole, and the whole 'social networking' thing specifically, has really been nothing more than a loosely controlled experiment in progress.  Being able to glean metrics from how information flowed and through what channels strengthens one's ability to both repress the information and how to help 'move it along organically', regardless of what the actual information is- in this case, the banning of FPH.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a site-wide level, there's now good data points on subscribers reaction to acting on new policies to better counteract the push-back when a larger sub goes dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a, we'll say system-wide level, data points can now be collected on how it spread through all the other mediums (twitter, facebook, chan sites, etc) and fed into itself and the over-all media newscycle.  It is these data points that the larger beasts of burden feed on.  Think of it like putting food colouring into a river to see how the currents flow.  They want to be able to control the flow of the river without the river knowing it was moved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little shitstorms like this are a data-analysts wet dream.

       Great metaphor for how this spreads, too. Super concentrated at the source and then disapaits as the current takes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of it is, "see who those involved are". Almost like a test to see who really gets riled up. An online version of provoking a crowd and seeing who steps up and in what capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be the "loose canons" who just react.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "provocateurs and those they entangle" (creation FPH2, FPH3, FPH8,etc. Like handing people bricks to throw, keep the event going).
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be the "skirt the edge to see where the line is drawn" group, I kind of was here last night, made

       Spot on!  Reddit is able to now curate a list of users/IP's that 'fanned the flames' and were probably able to silence the most vocal/active proponents through banning, while tag others 'to watch'.
      </p>

       Now, when they move to shut down larger subs, they will have a more up-to-date playbook from which to maneuver.
