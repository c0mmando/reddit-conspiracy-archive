<p>But yes, I agree with you.</p>

<p>The timing of this is suspect. Let&#39;s take all the people on reddit who give a shit about fundamental aspects censorship and put the blinders on them. I haven&#39;t seen this level of gunuine eddit activity since thefappening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering this myself and I think it&#39;s less of &#39;what the left hand is doing&#39; and more &#39;let&#39;s see what happens if...&#39;.  </p>

<p>The internet as a whole, and the whole &#39;social networking&#39; thing specifically, has really been nothing more than a loosely controlled experiment in progress.  Being able to glean metrics from how information flowed and through what channels strengthens one&#39;s ability to both repress the information and how to help &#39;move it along organically&#39;, regardless of what the actual information is- in this case, the banning of FPH.  </p>

<p>On a site-wide level, there&#39;s now good data points on subscribers reaction to acting on new policies to better counteract the push-back when a larger sub goes dark. </p>

<p>On a, we&#39;ll say system-wide level, data points can now be collected on how it spread through all the other mediums (twitter, facebook, chan sites, etc) and fed into itself and the over-all media newscycle.  It is these data points that the larger beasts of burden feed on.  Think of it like putting food colouring into a river to see how the currents flow.  They want to be able to control the flow of the river without the river knowing it was moved.</p>

<p>Little shitstorms like this are a data-analysts wet dream.</p>

<p>Great metaphor for how this spreads, too. Super concentrated at the source and then disapaits as the current takes it. </p>

<p>I think a lot of it is, &quot;see who those involved are&quot;. Almost like a test to see who really gets riled up. An online version of provoking a crowd and seeing who steps up and in what capacity. </p>

<p>There will be the &quot;loose canons&quot; who just react. </p>

<p>The &quot;provocateurs and those they entangle&quot; (creation FPH2, FPH3, FPH8,etc. Like handing people bricks to throw, keep the event going).</p>

<p>There will be the &quot;skirt the edge to see where the line is drawn&quot; group, I kind of was here last night, made <a href="/r/fathumansarefat">/r/fathumansarefat</a> </p>

<p>There will be organizers (&quot;flood r/pics&quot;)</p>

<p>Recruiters  (&quot;come to voat&quot;)</p>

<p>Etc.</p>

<p>Spot on!  Reddit is able to now curate a list of users/IP&#39;s that &#39;fanned the flames&#39; and were probably able to silence the most vocal/active proponents through banning, while tag others &#39;to watch&#39;.</p>

<p>Now, when they move to shut down larger subs, they will have a more up-to-date playbook from which to maneuver.</p>
