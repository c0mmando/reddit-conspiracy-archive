<p>Yea, I would. My grand parents and parents were probably kinky as shit, just like I am ( we all enjoy sex, and the sexual fantasies of opposite genders). We are sexual creatures.</p>

<p>They fucked, so you could be here. Don&#39;t be so naive. BTW, your parents still fuck when you are not home, and your grand parents do too, if they are alone and the hard is on ;). Dude/dudette, grow the fuck up. I clearly remember my dziadek ( grandpa -&gt; Polish) saying how hot my grand mother (German) was in her early years. Then he said don&#39;t let your wife get fat. This is clearly not PC, but the truth and shows character. </p>

<p>Will you answer my fucking question now? What is your point you are trying to make? This is not a conspiracy. If you think it is, elaborate, or GTFO.</p>
