    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to twist statements to mean things that they don&#39;t mean. It won&#39;t work.</p>

<p>First, &quot;The parents weren&#39;t allowed to see their dead children&quot; is not the same claim as &quot;the parents never saw the bodies.&quot; Which claim are you making? They can &quot;not see&quot; the body while still being &quot;allowed&quot; to&quot; (meaning, some of them may have opted not to see the mutilated remains of their child.) So what exactly are you claiming was the case? Be specific.</p>

<p>But either way, the medical examiner is referring to the identification process on the first day. You&#39;re just cherry-picking quotes and ignoring context. After the bodies were identified, they went to the next of kin.  </p>

<p>I mean, you <em>do</em> know that several of the victims had open-casket funerals right? The ones whose heads were intact?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps this will clear it up. There are two facts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Parents were not permitted to view the remains as part of the identification process</p></li>
<li><p>After identification, parents had control over their child&#39;s remains, which of course includes seeing them.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>/Lie.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a lie, there is video of the parents saying they weren&#39;t allowed to see their children.</p>

<p>/But probably even dumber than that is the combination of &quot;the parents should have been hysterical&quot; with &quot;they didn&#39;t get to see their children.&quot;</p>

<p>When you say this, you are compounding false logic. Both are true, yet you take them as false and assume it is somehow natural to do so. </p>

<p>/So, the parents are in on it, but they aren&#39;t?</p>

<p>This is your premise, or strawman. In general, to people who believe it didn&#39;t happen, but was merely a staged event to direct policy, then of course the &quot;parents&quot; were in on it. Saying they couldn&#39;t see their children doesn&#39;t suggest they weren&#39;t, it suggests that as much was kept from public view as possible. If you had staged a hoax, you would want as little hard evidence available as possible. For example, releasing the autopsy of the &quot;Boston bomber&quot; showed the holes in their narrative. Literally. </p>

<p>You created a strawman in your head and rolled with it into ever murkier scapes. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting places to start, to me, is the blood. Supposedly 26 people died in a couple of rooms in that building. To clean up the blood, you need to file a permit with the state health department, the EPA needs to be notified, and one of a handful of EPA-certified hazmat companies can do the clean-up. A bunch of people did FOIA requests and directly called both the EPA and the CT state health department. They also called every EPA-certified clean-up company in the surrounding states. There is no record of any blood clean-up or even a permit application. For the companies contacted - no one admitted to doing the clean-up, nor knew who did.</p>

<p>Another falsehood by Hoaxers.</p>

<p>Clean Harbors, Inc cleaned Sandy Hook as listed in Book 2 198991. <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/00198991-pdf.7627/">PDF</a></p>

<p>Aftermath Specialists did Yogananda.  Book 2 198985</p>

<p>[Edit] Oh, look: downvotes. Guess the hoaxers are really the ones trying to hide the truth!</p>

<p>From another forum:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clean Harbors, Inc. got the job to clean up Sandy Hook Elementary, but they also had huge volume of stock trading in the days after the shootings.</p>

<p>I see that 13 of their corporate officers sold shares of stock on 12/15/12. This totaled just about 597,000 shares of company stock. There hasn&#39;t been that type of action since.</p>

<p>But the strange thing is...in Book 2 / 00198991.pdf (page 3) The job wasn&#39;t bid out....they were simply assigned by the FBI to do the clean up of the scene.</p>

<p>Workers arrived and were told to NOT bring cameras, phones, or other electronic devices in the school.</p>

<p>On January 4, 2013, they removed 63 boxes of &quot;biological waste&quot;.</p>

<p>Clean Harbors indicated the items would be secured at their facility and then shipped for disposal to Oklahoma and Arizona.</p>

<p>Going to need a verifiable citation for that.  Not least because December 15, 2012 was a Saturday, so the market was closed... Also </p>

<p><a href="http://www.insider-monitor.com/trading/cik822818.html">http://www.insider-monitor.com/trading/cik822818.html</a></p>

<p>shows a trivial amount of insider e.g. by the directors, etc. In December 2012 AND January 2013, there were only 500 shares sold, not the 597,000 claimed, and no indication I can see of any unusual activity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I would recommend you to not use Google. It&#39;s the most used and widely available search engine, and in my opinion the most prone to &quot;fuckery&quot;. It has its uses, but for something like that you may have better luck with duckduckgo. </p>

<p>The most widely recognized name regarding &quot;alternative research&quot; I believe is Wolfgang Halbig. If you look him up you should be able to find his material regarding alternative theories and probably counterpoints to his. </p>

<p>Another word of advice: don&#39;t take his, or any one else&#39;s, word for anything. Question everything, and when someone offers sources CHECK THEIR SOURCES. Without checking, you won&#39;t know if it&#39;s a legitimate source or if the link is even still valid. A lot of people everything at face value when a hyperlink is involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also interpret the censorship of the results of Google as more evidence of their working hand-in-hand with the United States Government and its directives. It&#39;s also been reported that their executives have very very frequent(2-3x a week) meetnf with high level White House officials. They also have representatives present at the Bilderberg Group meeting. </p>

<p>Knowledge is power in a lot of facets, and they hold the keys to the largest collective wealth of knowledge in the history of humanity. They choose how the citizens of dozens of powerful countries get their knowledge, and it would be a necessary strategy for the survival of the government itself to suppress and promote news stories at will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Google introducted a search engine were popularity of the masses choices using certain key words dictated what the search engine of Google thought it should deliver as results.</p>

<p>So if someone put in something like A hard days night , then google would return the most popular choice other users selected as the most like information you would want as well.  Which means they would put up the results of the Beatles as the top hit.</p>

<p>The search engines before Google changed the way we searched for information used a search criterion of counting how many times those words showed up in a websites content as well as the information inside the header of a website as key words (called meta tags) that the public does not see.  The web pages that included the words most often was delivered as the top choices.  </p>

<p>To get choices based on key words would mean you will needto use an older search engine.  I believe that <a href="http://www.excite.com">www.excite.com</a> is still available to the public and (seems to me) is still operating as they use to.  Your results may be different because of the differences in how the search engines function.</p>

<p>Does anyone else have a link to a different search engine that doesn&#39;t operate like Google?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Video guy here.   The fact that not one camera operator on the finish line bridge, moved to zoom in and capture the bombing footage speaks volumes all in itself.  There is only one camera that released footage of a time-laps of the footage, and it was sped up so bad that almost none of it was useable.  it also never changed position.  Total controlled media. </p>

<p>Find the relevant photos of casual-hoody-sunglasses-anon-guy and watch his actions from the first photo you find. Which should be one of him crouching against the wall near the site before the bang.</p>

<p>Our district will be implementing a security system in all elementary schools as part of  our ongoing efforts to ensure student safety. As usual, exterior doors will be locked during the day. Every visitor will be required to ring the doorbell at the front entrance and the office staff will use a visual monitoring system to allow entry.&quot;

Why weren&#39;t first responders allowed on the scene...it goes on and on.

<p>nope. Choppers have prep times. It is far from the fastest, when a car is already on scene and the hospital is a short distance away. Please stop spreading this disinformation.</p>

<p>You read wrong. The FBI did no such thing. You really should stop reading sources that are demonstratably lying to you if you have any self respect at all.</p>

<p>Because 26 people were slaughtered there and they had money to build a new school. Also it has not yet been rebuilt.</p>

<p>So why was anyone who tried to investigate it threatened and intimidated by cops ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one has, at least not that I&#39;m aware of. Wolfgang Halbig claims he was, but he&#39;s a well-known liar and fraud, in addition to being an evil lunatic. No police visited him. Ask him for badge numbers if you don&#39;t believe me. </p>

<p>Apologies if that&#39;s not who you were referring to, I have not heard of any other cases.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And do you have any proof for your counterclaims?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which ones require proof? They were mostly based on common sense and the axiom that claims presented without any evidence require no evidence to dismiss. For example, &quot;helicopters are the fastest way to transport victims in all cases&quot; is just pure horseshit. It does not reflect reality. There&#39;s no need for a source, just like there&#39;s no need to cite a source for the number 3 coming after 2 and before 4.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about the one about the parents just laughing and not looking sad? You conveniently ignored that bit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is more a matter of life experience and intelligence. If you believe traumatized and grieving parents are weeping 24 hours a day, then you will have some unpleasant realizations if you ever find yourself in the position to know first or even second hand. PTSD, shock, and the grieving process are complicated. Losing someone inspires both sadness and gratefulness that you knew that person. Where do you think the concept of a &quot;celebration of life&quot; ceremony comes from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heh. Yeah. Ever since President Obama did his AMA, some things have been off about Reddit. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easier to start a controversy in subreddits that have absolutely nothing to do with the main page or modern topics. I frequent <a href="/r/ArtisanVideos">/r/ArtisanVideos</a>, which is about blacksmiths making knives, potters making pottery and cooks cooking. I&#39;ve seen people start calling each other out over censorship in that sub, and mods jump and ban people for little things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once posted a write up on &quot;Oil Train Car Derailments&quot;, an analysis on said incidents occurring within the United States and Canada, with more focus on those regions around the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, in order to determine whether or not there was an active conspiracy being engaged in to purposely derail oil tanker rail cars in order to garner support to pass the Keystone XL pipeline.</p>

<p>I can not find this information online anymore, no search of my username and any combination of keywords, or even keywords alone, provides me with a result which is the post I was maintaining detailing these things.</p>

<p>I feel it was deleted, as I definitely posted it, but by whom, I do not know and do not seem to be able to determine.</p>

<p>I feel that as you are stating about this Sandy Hook information, that there is a grand conspiracy being enacted right now, to remove information from the internet.</p>

<p>This is why people need to keep hard copies of information that is really that important.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nice that the KJV bible is online, but I still have my physical KJV bible just so that I know that I have a form of the text which is guaranteed to always have the same words on the page. You can hack a website, but you can&#39;t exactly hack a book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad you came forward. As someone who has looked into the issue, it seems to be pretty clear that the incident was a false flag attack, and I was beginning to wonder if anyone connected to Sandy Hook noticed any inconsistencies. </p>

<p>I would highly recommend that you watch the first 40 or so minutes of each of these two documentaries:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsiNMnW0t0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMsiNMnW0t0</a>
It&#39;ll probably only take you about 40 minutes because after that, you will likely be fairly convinced that it didn&#39;t happen. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTafqejV6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxTafqejV6k</a>
This second documentary goes into further depth and assumes you already know some of the inconsistencies of what happened. This documentary focuses more on WHY they would fake such an incident. </p>

We seem to get along OK here and have less massacres than you guys. Do you honestly think that the people toting gun control laws for the US are all in collusion to create a situation whereby the government turns into a dictatorship? What good would that do them? Business would suffer profits would suffer, malcontent would reign, the country would ultimately suffer. What sort of end goal is that?

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so by the last sentence I can see you don&#39;t get it. I&#39;m not American either but I know why the second amendment exists. To stop the same exact thing that is happening now. Of course I don&#39;t think that everyone is in on this. That&#39;s absolutely ridiculous. They&#39;re doing it for their reasons, some are pushed along by those that do not want a people that can defend themselves. </p>

<p>What good? They don&#39;t have to shoot everyone, they just knock on their door and take them. You want to take control of everyone and you don&#39;t think this would be top priority? They could and would all ban together and fucking shoot you. Then you would understand this is one of the most important things they need to deal with.</p>

<p>You think businesses have a say? They&#39;ve been writing thousands of laws restricting what you can purchase. The people who want this done don&#39;t need any fucking money. They make the money. </p>

<p>Finally, you don&#39;t understand when this would matter. By the time they would have to deal with gun owners, the dollar would&#39;ve collapsed already. There are no profits at that time, the businesses are trying to stop looters. </p>

<p>The end goal is control. I thought everyone knew you can&#39;t control an armed country. <strong>That is why the second amendment exists.</strong> Do some research into the past and the economic collapse we&#39;re in and maybe you&#39;ll have enough puzzle pieces to understand this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch &quot;We need to talk about sandy hook&quot;, also while many have had doubts as to his legitimacy, Wolfgang Halbig has been making some progress with FOIA requests etc - he also caught something I didn&#39;t through the school photos, the whole place was full of mold which adds to the theory of it not being a working school.  One of the bigger issues for me remains the police declaring everyone dead instead of allowing EMS to do their job.  Obviously you&#39;re most interested in SH being a teacher but you should look at other events as well which may make this easier to accept - it&#39;s a bit of a process for some to learn the world is a whole lot more corrupt than we are led to believe.  eg. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95rreUsziEc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95rreUsziEc</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuAct1BxHU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWuAct1BxHU</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cia+media">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cia+media</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright can someone answer a few things for me? Assuming everything is a conspiracy, why would sandy hook happen? what benefit was there for whoever it was (besides who they say it was) to shoot up a school. Also the same questions thrown at the boston bombing. I cant figure it out but maybe im looking at it wrong, i see no possible benefit from these things. Can someone clearify why these are conspiracys?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gun control makes no sense to me, With a large revenue coming in from selling guns and alot of gun manufacturers in the US, youd think theyd be roped into all the other businesses that are part of &quot;conspircays&quot; with trade agreements and what not. The only thing i can think of is that it was a test to see how population would react to gun control and to put minir laws in place for a bigger law to come. It appears to be a way to lower our defenses so we have no power to fight the government. But of course this is just my wild speculation, it is still unclear to me the exact reason. And if its for fear, then what for? Its need to be a much larger scare to rally people behind something. As for the boston bombing, i dont get it, i really dont. If it was to &quot;increase hatred of the middle east, then it failed, cause theyre are still high tensions from 911 and now isis, they dont need the bostom bombing to induce hatred, so why? usually someone has come up with reasons like with 9/11 and well every other conspiracy, but why dont these? why is there no possible reasoning? I hadnt really thought of any of this til now when i saw your post and now im curious and ima try and do some research. But so far, with everything in this country, i might just move to finland to become a sheep herder and get away from it all. :P</p>

    <div class="md"><p>gun control is a huge statement of power mentally. I didnt realize how big of a deal it could make until i lived in Enlgand for a few months. The only people who have guns is your government it sends a big message.</p>

<p>The girl i lived with, her boyfriend was in the royal army, anytime she visited the base she would go through the ECP where there was armed guards with semi automatic weapons. Just seeing the gun made her extremely uncomfortable and frightened.  </p>

<p>That speaks volumes to me. Its a power move and a really big one to see your government with weapons and you cant have one.</p>

<p>Imagine in the future they keep getting us more and more scared of things and remove our right to bear arms. Then something tragic happens nationally. The federal government initiates martial law for &quot;our safety&quot;. Army bases in the middle of our cities. They patrol with 50 cals vehicles and M16 patrol men.</p>

<p>You have no weapons now. You is in the power of position? Its supposed to be our duty to defend the country against a corrupt government if we have to. And if we cant then what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can completely understand this but in a country where we already outgun our military (i think by 9-1? someone correct me on that) a gun ban is litteraly impossible, guns are already into our society, britain works that way because theyve had hundreds of years to keep weapons away and make it part of the culture. Here tho having weapons are a part of the culture, so gun control is a lost cause. I can see what theyre trying to do but it will not work so why try? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I strongly believe people should live facing the fear to be truly free. But constantly having people afraid of weapons and events like sandy hook do make a lot of people believe guns are bad and they kill kids.</p>

<p>Also with the word terrorist being thrown around freely it will be so easy to label anyone with a weapon a possible terrorist. With mass media people will be scared of weapons and spun the right way your neighbor will turn you in for owning a weapon. Your kids will innocently report you to their second grade teacher who has just left college.</p>

<p>It would take time but this is what makes the most sense to me.
Guns kill kids. With the recent events they are painting the looming fear, &quot;Even Americans can be terrorists and they dont have to be muslims. They could be that quiet white guy!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See i hate the argument &quot;guns kill kids/people&quot; cause although its true, it isnt, its the person behind it. If you have someone responsible they will save lives then take them. If guns kill kids then so do cars and we should ban them too. I agree guns make it easy but if we take gund away from those who use them responsibly then only those who use them iresponsibly will have them because they will either obtain them illegaly or hide them away. If you look at switzerland, it has one if the lowest crime rates because Everyone has a gun, why would rob/attack someone that you know has a gun? I firmly believe if everyone has a gun then theyre will be less violence because no one is going to attack or rob someone they know have a gun. Ontop of that, if someone really is intent on killing/shooting a bunch of people, no law will prevent it.</p>

<p>Gun control is huge in Australia and it somehow worked well for them. Probably because they have a more trustworthy government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you saying &#39;assuming everything is a conspiracy&#39;?  Do you realize how many shootings etc happen without getting a mention?  Anyway, Sandy Hook seems clearly about gun control, Boston seems to be just one of many staged plots to ensure the intel agencies keep their terror budget, they usually use Muslims, not sure if just because it&#39;s only considered terrorism when they&#39;re Muslim or because inciting hatred for them is good for the war business.

<p>I think I wrote something like &quot;let&#39;s blow up our budget from last year, like the world Trade Center&quot; or something similar.  Not very smart looking back on it. </p>

<p>Sandy Hook however, I literally cried several times when I saw the parents &quot;crying&quot; over their &quot;dead kids&quot;. I fell for the Sandy Hook pysop hook,  line and sinker.

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy conspiracies but I&#39;m a natural skeptic. Of all of them, the only two I find actually credible are JFK and Sandy Hook. The more you read about Sandy Hook, the more you realize how easy it would be to cover up everything, and then discredit anyone who questions the official story with &quot;CHILDREN ARE DEAD HOW DARE YOU ASK QUESTIONS&quot;.</p>

<p>One thing that I think I found that certainly points to green screen technology being used at Sandy Hook. Watch this video, specifically starting at the 20:20 mark.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7dnJFq7lJU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7dnJFq7lJU</a></p>

<p>Right in the middle of the frame is a bigger guy in a light blue coat, and a blonde lady holding some papers in a navy blue coat. Watch the lady. She goes off to the left, and at that moment another man in a brownish coat walks in front of the camera momentarily blocking her. </p>

<p>But for one little moment - you need to rewind the video a couple of times to see it because it&#39;s so fucking brief - but her leg covers up part of the planter she&#39;s supposed to be walking behind.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/k8lg4hp">Here</a> is a freezeframe of the moment in question. The brown planter is clearly being covered up by the blue of her jeans, but she doesn&#39;t stub her knee or anything, instead her leg glides through the planter as if she were a ghost.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Virtual Private Network. It is a way to make it look like your accessing other computers on the internet (like web servers that host google) from a location other than your own. People of other repressed societies often resort to using a VPN to learn about atrocities in their own country/state/area. For instance, people in China have their search results filtered by google, to help the people in power keep their citizens ignorant of what the rest of the world knows about rights abuses. The Chinese citizens that want to be informed often use a VPN service to reroute their requests through another country so the results are no longer filtered.</p>

<p>What got me to thinking Sandy Hook was a domestic propaganda exercise was the absolute nonsense in pictures of the aftermath of the Boston Bombing.</p>

<p>This guy clearly was already an amputee with prosthesis on. A trauma doctor looking at these photos will come to the same conclusion:</p>

<p>People with an open mind can see that there there is something terribly wrong the with official Sandy Hook &quot;disturbed teenager school shooting&quot; narrative. Your difficult task is now to get as close to the truth as you can without letting the myriad disruptors and disinfo merchants putting you off the scent.</p>

<p>This is a highly contoversial and oft-brigaded subject on reddit. A subreddit dedicated to Sandy Hook was banned some time ago, but you may already know about that...</p>

<p>Searching reddit for links is not practical - the site is deliberately set up with the world&#39;s worst search engine.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a couple of good sites with multiple Sandy Hook stories are:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.insanemedia.net/">http://www.insanemedia.net/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was banned for doxxing, supposedly (revealing information about individuals). This may have been done deliberately, to discredit Sandy Hook conspiracy researchers.</p>

<p>Right from the beginning, the official story was riddled with inconsistencies. The fact that two &quot;shooters&quot; were initially identified (one of them apprehended alive), called Ryan and Adam Lanza, then just Ryan, then just Adam, got everybody very suspicious. Then the creepy Gene Rosen with his conflicting and frankly unbelievable stories...</p>

<p>For the first couple of months I thought Sandy Hook was a genuine atrocity, with Adam Lanza fitted up as a patsy. But after having spent hundreds of hours looking into Sandy Hook, I no longer think that - the truth is very much weirder, but you need to find as many sources as you before you make up your own mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll come to realize its a one way system. </p>

<p>Real life example. The so called &quot;protectors in government&quot; can deem anyone with what they &quot;label&quot; as a cult or &quot;militia&quot; (hence: <a href="http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=137">Waco</a>, <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_cooper10.htm">William Cooper</a> and more) and sending the troops to take them out. But these same governing people run and operate their cults or what they label as &quot;secret society&quot;.</p>

<p>God forbid you can have your own secret society!</p>

<p>Lie.</p>

<p>But probably even dumber than that is the combination of &quot;the parents should have been hysterical&quot; with &quot;they didn&#39;t get to see their children.&quot;</p>

<p>So, the parents are in on it, but they aren&#39;t?</p>

<p>Find the video of the finish line site watch the flags as the &quot;blast&quot; aka smokebomb goes off. Now tell me if that wind velocity could tear the top off a rice pudding let alone arms and legs.</p>

<p>Find the relevant photos of casual-hoody-sunglasses-anon-guy and watch his actions from the first photo you find. Which should be one of him crouching against the wall near the site before the bang.</p>
