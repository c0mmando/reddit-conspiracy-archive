<p>But I&#39;m sure you guys saw that Courtney Love tried to stop the movie from getting shown.  Take a look at the IMDB page, I checked before I saw the movie and it had a 5.8, and now its absolutely plumetted in the time it took to see the movie down the street at the independent theatre by me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3253624/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3253624/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve never actually watched something like this happen live...</p>

<p>If you read the professional critic&#39;s reviews, they&#39;re all bad.  But the user comments speak a very different story.  IMDB&#39;s comments are like that too; everyone&#39;s raving about it. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a professional critic&#39;s bad review, and the comments are vilifying him: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I paid for it for that reason also.  But if you are sincerely broke I think Kurt would be ok with you watching it for free because it&#39;s more important that the info gets out than anything.  Pretty sure the producers will recoup their investment with all the buzz it&#39;s getting.  But you are right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like really? Do you <em>really</em> think <strong>all</strong> of the movie critics in the world are involved in some sort of conspiracy to suppress who killed Kurt Cobain... <em>for Courtney fucking Love</em>?</p>

<p>Seriously. Think about it for a second. She isn&#39;t worth a shit ton of money. She has barely any social status what so ever. People think she is fucking disgusting, and somehow magically she has turned the entire movie critic industry in her favor in order to hide the fact that she killed her husband?</p>

<p>I am not saying that she didn&#39;t have some sort of role in it. In fact, it is my opinion that she may have. I haven&#39;t seen this movie, but I will soon.</p>

<p>Courtney Love is a has-been nobody. Some of you people are fucking kooks. Go outside for a while and get some fresh air.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK, first and foremost, I would like to thank the Academy for the down votes. <em>Kidding</em>. I know I am treading on ground where people feel to look into things deeper. I am not saying that is a wrong thing to do, but one that I am not exactly familiar with. I suppose I should tip toe around here and choose to listen before speaking.</p>

<p>That being said...</p>

<p>I saw some replies to my comment regarding &quot;reputation management&quot; companies. I have heard of them but have never really delved into what it is they exactly do. I was always under the impression that they help take down mugshots, add comments to YouTube, Facebook etc. posts in order to combat the negative feedback.</p>

<p>I guess I really never looked at it from the &quot;mass media&quot; perspective. I suppose writing articles that will flood search engine results would work. In fact, now that I put more thought into it, it WOULD work.</p>

<p>On to the conspiracy itself...</p>

<p>I have read a ton of shit online in the past 10-15 years regarding this &quot;plot&quot;. I was 20 years old when Kurt passed on. Did it affect me directly? Kind of, but not really, seeing I was a kid that grew up on Nantucket Island. More of a Ralph Lauren Polo/Khakis kid rather than a flannel and jeans guy.</p>

<p>I have read the wikipedia articles, the fan based theories. Yeah, I believed that she (Courtney Love) had something to do with his death. I still do, but here is where the movie changed me...</p>

<p>The movie definitely has an agenda. I get it, I understand it. The PI was hired by Love to find Kurt and make sure his whereabouts could be reckoned. </p>

<p>Here is my problem, and I think that the film (regardless of their agenda) over solidified it.</p>

<p>I think the suicide/murder scenario comes down to a few things. Hang with me a few. I have been thinking about this so feel free to point out where I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Kurt Cobain was young, introverted and even worse? A junkie. This is not a secret. He grew up in Shithole, USA and there were some witness accounts within the movie that stated how many people that have committed suicide.</p>

<p>Kurt was a quiet kid with a &quot;talent&quot; that was thrown into a very large movement in rock and roll history. He was discovered at the right time and: BOOM : instant stardom. I am not sure Kurt wanted that, but that is what he got.</p>

<p>Being the fragile, now huge superstar (and may I add JUNKY) quiet kid that he was? Now here come the dealer in Vegas throwing him down his next card. The dealer flips it over... it&#39;s a Courtney Love card.</p>

<p>Kurt at this point is fucked. The movie even goes on to portray her as a manipulating douche bag. She was over boisterous every step of the way during those times. </p>

<p>I just honestly think that a guy like Kurt... he was somebody that didn&#39;t belong in the limelight. Couple that with the fact that he just about met the worst possible YING to his YANG that he possible could have? It was a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>As far as the shot gun shell being on the wrong side of his body, or the alleged stool barricading the room in? Shoddy police work. The PI himself was pointing out how inconsistent the cops were by jumping the proverbial gun and calling it a suicide.</p>

<p>As far as the amount of heroin he had in his body? Would that make him incoherent and pass out immediately? Maybe, maybe not. We are dealing with somebody that has drugs at his disposal with no monetary blockades in the way.</p>

<p>Maybe that is why he didn&#39;t blow his head cleanly off? Maybe he took his lethal dosage, placed the shotgun in his mouth and started to nod off/fall over right before he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Either way he was dead.</p>

<p>Depression is real. </p>

<p>Did Courtney Love have something to gain from Kurt&#39;s death? </p>

<p>Yes she did, given the prenup shit. </p>

<p>But did she do it?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that bitch could tie her own shoes, nevermind mastermind this kind of thing.</p>

<p>A) Kurt checked himself into rehab
He left. Why? 2 reasons I could think of. Either he was being mistreated by Docs or staff? Or he needed a fix.</p>

<p>B) He was an introverted, silent type that most likely kept his feeling repressed. </p>

<p>C) Most importantly? He was a heroin addict. </p>

<p>Again, I think if anything, the movie portrays Courtney Love as an incoherent cunt, and actually exonerates her. She is what she is. She constantly fucks things up in her life. You can get that from the myriad of TMZ articles surrounding her.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and the shotgun shell being on the wrong side of his body? They already discuss what terrible police work was done at the scene. Is it inconceivable that a town deputy may have walked into the scene (knowing where he was or just being awestruck at the situation) and, say, kicked it? Then was like, &quot;Oh FUCK&quot; and picked it up and placed it somewhere?</p>

<p>Again, the movie tears the police there a new asshole. It is indeed possible that something like that happened.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Courtney Love was just an extremely overly manipulating cunt that more or less took a quiet kid with a severe drug problem, fed him more drugs, mentally abused him and in a round about way forced suicide upon him.</p>

<p>Is she innocent? Kind of, but it is her fault and she benefited from it greatly. Enjoy your billions, Courtney.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ha!! I see what you did there!</p>

<p>Seriously, not dissing Nirvana or anything, but they were the two most overhyped yet disappointing live shows that I&#39;ve <em>ever</em> seen. They were truly terrible, and I was expecting greatness--especially after listening to &quot;The &#39;Priest&#39; They Called Him&quot; something like 16 trillion times. I shouldn&#39;t have said that they were &quot;absolute shit&quot; because they were not. Their music set trends for songwriting for years to come. The <em>live</em> shows (that I saw) were terrible--but it could have just been two &quot;off&quot; nights. I&#39;ve been playing in a band almost my entire life and god knows we&#39;ve had some nights where &quot;off&quot; would be putting it extremely nicely!</p>

<p>The &quot;Priest&quot; They Called Him...maaaan, that was some great stuff there. While I&#39;m on that subject I should tell anyone that reads this to RUN out and buy the Burroughs album that was done with the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. I believe that it was called &quot;Spare Ass Annie?&quot; AMAZING.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, no way Grohl was alone on it. He was their designated death angel like the Olsen Twins vs Heath Ledger. Keep in mind, Cobain wanted out of the music business and that wouldve take a lot of money out of some peoples pockets. So you kill him and reap the rewards of legend status. Same thing happened with Jimi Hendrix&#39;s manager. Was he alone in hiring the wine bottle goons or was th CIA involved and pissed because of the Black anther support in a recent interview?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right; exactly. I&#39;d like to find more about the Olsens and Heath Ledger. I remember seeing something about it once but when I google now, there&#39;s not much. But, yeah, those creepy junkie-looking billionaire gals have their hands in all sorts of evil shit, I&#39;ve little doubt. </p>

<p>Cobain needed more friends. Instead, the people he ostensibly should&#39;ve been able to trust the most killed him. I think Grohl is a serious Satanist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shotgun shell ejection was pretty poorly presented. </p>

<p>They said that on the moment of death, a persons muscles lock in place so the shotgun must have been placed in his hands after someone shot him. The shell ejection direction was opposite to how the gun was found.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaveric_spasm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaveric_spasm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>is a rare form of muscular stiffening that occurs at the moment of death,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was it confirmed to be a spasmic lock?</p>

<p>Much more likely that the shotgun spun after firing and settled, then rigor mortis took hold and gripped it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is about Montage of Heck, and maybe this is a little far fetched, but the director did not get Dave Grohl into the film (nor any friend of Kurt&#39;s who Courtney didn&#39;t like). His explanation was very long-winded and seemed like BS. Why go through with filming it if he knew there was no room for him? And if he knew that he wasn&#39;t going to make a DVD extra? I just wonder if Courtney didn&#39;t like something he said. The director is for sure going to listen to her so the movie can be released.</p>

<p>Courtney supposedly didn&#39;t have anything to do with the movie, but there was hardly anything bad said about her in the film (besides her doing heroin while pregnant) and it fits basically exactly what everyone thinks of Kurt. I also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she went through the archives before she let the director in and got rid of things. If you watch her talk about the Rome incident in MOH, you can clearly see that she&#39;s lying or at least being a huge narcissist. I have to wonder how much control she has because she&#39;s shutting down showings of Soaked in Bleach. I suspect that she&#39;s a sociopath (her father is) and I have a feeling that Frances only keeps up appearances with her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She is an idiot in a lot of ways, such as presenting herself as a respectable and likeable, charismatic person. People like that can very, very often be brilliant liars, deceivers, and schemers. She was a sociopathic narcissist with issues and drug addiction. Desperate for fame and relevance, which possibly spiraled out of control from an initial desire simply for love. It&#39;s all desperately sad. I like Hole&#39;s music, in a nostalgic sort of way, but I&#39;m going to have a hard time ever listening to it again, after watching Soaked In Bleach. And I don&#39;t even have a horse in this race.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is sad.  I really like Nirvana and think Cobain was incredibly talented.  However, watching Montage of Heck was maddening.  His drug usage around an infant was irresponsible and pathetic.  I get it that he was an addict, but don&#39;t be around your kid while you are being a fuck up on heroin.  Buzz Osbourne was correct when he panned Montage of Heck.  It is not a flattering portrayal of Cobain.  And Courtney love just comes off as a liar in MOH.  Cobain wouldn&#39;t have died in 1994 if she wasn&#39;t in his life.  I believe she drove him into misery and depression and he said fuck it.  A small part of me also buys the conspiracy.  But again, I think Courtney is too fucking dumb to pull something like that off.  Regardless, he&#39;s gone and it&#39;s just too bad he couldn&#39;t get his shit together, put out a mediocre record to get everyone off his ass, and grow old and bald like everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree with most of that. I think Nirvana&#39;s music is a little overrated, though I like the music nostalgically.  I think he really was a beautiful person. Not in a &quot;I worship him&quot; or &quot;he&#39;s a genius!&quot; way at all. And unfortunately he as a person was exactly the type to get dragged into the shit of someone like Courtney, and I can see how she controlled and ruined him. I do bot believe it was suicide at all. This is all, of course, speculation from an outsider, after watching only one portrayal of facts (or &quot;facts&quot;, who knows?) on an issue that has no relevance to my life.
