        Barnett: Kurt was leaving Courtney, and Kristen was getting out of Seattle and both her and Kurt died. Kristen seemed to be upset about Kurt’s death. When Kristen died, the medical examiner was Nikolas Hartshorne, the same guy who examined Kurt. Hartshorne was a friend of Courtney’s from years back. The Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that Hartshorne wasn’t going to comment on the cause of Kristen’s death for two weeks as he wanted to conduct toxicology tests. But why didn’t Hartshorne apply that caution when Kurt died? Hartshorne wasn’t clear on his criteria for a proper investigation.

         Erlandson

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        King County Chief Medical Examiner
        <strong>
         Dr. Nikolas Hartshorne was an old friend of Courtney Love and her ex-husband, James Moreland
        </strong>
        . During the late ’80s, Hartshorne was in the business of promoting punk rock groups and happened to book Nirvana at the Central Tavern in Seattle in 1988. Nirvana eventually became the opening band for Leaving Trains, which was headed by Moreland.
&amp;
Within months of Kurt Cobain’s death,
        <strong>
         Detective Antonio Terry was killed
        </strong>
        in a strange shooting incident, the first Seattle police officer killed on duty in nine years. Terry was soon followed by
        <strong>
         Courtney Love’s guitarist, Kristen Pfaff, who died of a bizarre heroin overdose the day before she was planning to move out of town
        </strong>
        . While it is open to speculation why these and other people close to Courtney Love have a habit of dying mysterious deaths, one thing is for sure, as long as she stays in Seattle, Courtney Love will always remain above suspicion.

        On
        <strong>
         June 4th 1994, narcotics Detective Antonio Terry was murdered
        </strong>
        . According to Grant, he is the first Seattle police officer to be murdered in the line of duty in nine years. Grant has read the news reports, and it doesn't appear that Terry's murder is connected with the Cobain case. However, being a private investigator (and a damn good one at that), he'd like to know more. If you recall, Antonio Terry was the officer Courtney was in contact with from L.A. while Kurt was missing, the officer she called from Grant's car on the trip to the Carnation property, and the officer she admits on tape Audio Clip dealing with to try and get people she didn't like, such as Caitlin Moore, busted. Obviously their relationship was a bit more than Courtney just being a good citizen trying to rid the neighborhood of drug dealers. With her own drug related problems in the media on a regular basis at the time, Detective Terry had to have known he wasn't dealing with someone that had a squeaky clean record.

         June 15th 1994, Hole bassist Kristen Pfaff is found dead of an alleged drug overdose

       <p>
        Grant says he's very suspicious of the circumstances of Kristen's death. Simply because of the similarities between her death and Kurt's.

         Kurt was apparently leaving Seattle and Courtney when he ended up dead. Kristen was also leaving Seattle and Courtney when she ended up dead

        . Both with heroin overdoses in their system and "barricaded" in rooms. Kurt in the greenhouse; Kristen in the bathroom of her apartment. Kristen had a U-Haul trailor packed and loaded, and was leaving the next morning. Sadly, she never got out of Seattle alive.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Courtney Love dialed 911 after Kurt Cobain overdosed on heroin. The Seattle police and fire departments arrived at the Cobain residence and discovered that Cobain had “injected himself with $30-$40 worth of heroin.”
        <strong>
         Curiously, the police report contains an entire paragraph that has been blacked out
        </strong>
        . Normally, certain incidental information such as names, addresses and phone numbers are redacted from reports to maintain privacy, but the paragraph in question describes Love’s “attempt” to “save her husband’s life.”
        <strong>
         Tom Grant, Love’s former private investigator, was successful in uncovering the redacted information
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The information in question describes how
        <strong>
         Love forcibly administered Buprenorphine, Valium and Tylenol laced with Codeine to “save her husband’s life.”
        </strong>
        This lethal combination of drugs surely aggravated Cobain’s condition and
        <strong>
         could easily have killed him and yet the Seattle police did not investigate Courtney Love for possessing illegal drugs or for spoon-feeding them to a man who had already overdosed. In fact, they deliberately concealed her criminal actions from the police report released to the public. Why the special treatment for Courtney Love?

       Wow. Above all else this last bit of info really gives me pause. The guy is having a slight OD and she gives him bupe (similar to methadone) and BENZOS!? (Valium). Anyone with any real opioid/heroin experience knows that mixing heavy doses of opiates/heroin with benzos is a quick and easy way to put yourself into a coma/grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       So many questions here now. For instance 1) What the FUCK was Courtney thinking? And (more importantly) 2) How and why the FUCK was this info redacted from the report!?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been following the case and conspiracy theories since Kurt died and have been seeing it talked about a lot lately in the wake of the two new docs. Admittedly I have no real strong feelings about the possibility of homicide, but always thought the info/theories were at least interesting and slightly plausible.  This development/bit of info however, is the first thing that is really giving me the creeps and making me feel like it may be shifting my considerations/personal feelings about what may or may not have happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wow.
