<p>He did not commit suicide.</p>

<p>I am working on transcription for an interview with John Potash which provides many insider details into Courtney Love&#39;s background.</p>

<p>Montage of Heck , is a Universal Pictures film about Kurt, that came out recently as well.</p>

<p>It has received criticism from some of Kurt&#39;s longtime friends. MOH is artistic, poetic, musical and emotional. It is not however a crime / investigative documentary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3912jp/new_radio_interview_author_john_potash_discusses/">http://www.np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3912jp/new_radio_interview_author_john_potash_discusses/</a></p>

<p>Discussion regarding Courtney Love begins @ <strong>57 minutes</strong> followed by a  commercial break @ minutes 61-65, where the revealing interview continues. [Definitely worth a listen]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember reading the book Who Killed Kurt Cobain when I was 13 and being pretty thoroughly convinced that he was suicided. The amount of heroin in his blood at the time of suicide was well over the lethal dose, which the book said meant he could not have physically held the shotgun to his mouth. The shotgun did not have any of his prints on it.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.datejesus.com/sermons/cobain/note.jpg">suicide letter</a> appears to have the last few lines added by someone else, and they are the only lines that mention suicide. Up until that, it reads as a letter that he is quitting the band, and there was apparently a bunch of evidence he was planning to quit Nirvana and divorce Courtney. I remember there was evidence of Courtney learning of this and trying to hire a hitman. Anyways, I read this over ten years ago so I&#39;m fuzzy but it&#39;s an interesting story. I had never heard of the MK ULTRA connection with Courtney, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>On that note, I highly suggest looking into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUF3lMCh7hA">Dave McGowan</a> and checking out Jan Irvin&#39;s site as well for more on the MK ULTRA connection to pop music. Fucked up times we live in brothers!</p>

<p>Let me review the evidence....  Yes, I have concluded that Courtney Love is pretty stupid. Thanks for the video, I saved it, and for the explanation. I&#39;m interested in the MKULTRA connection, do you think you could summarize what the conversation you linked is implying regarding that?</p>

<p>Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany to Montreal every week to work at McGill&#39;s Allan Memorial Institute and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKUltra experiments there. In addition to LSD, he experimented with various paralytic drugs and electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power.[citation needed] His &quot;driving&quot; experiments consisted of putting a subject into a drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple statements. These experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression; many suffered permanent debilitation after these treatments</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus fucking christ. Can you imagine going into some Montreal hospital for anxiety, and being put into a drug induced LSD coma for three months? What the fuck is WRONG with these people</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;m saying is it scales upwards. One addicts tolerance is totally different than another. As long as you had the money it can just keep going up and up. If you keep using more and more your body adapts to more and more and with rock star money I imagine his was pretty damn high. There were rumors in Seattle that he cooked his dope in a fondue pot and I&#39;ve heard of someone who claimed to see it. Doubt it was true but regardless, it keeps getting higher there isn&#39;t really a designated lethal dose that covers everyone. I&#39;ve watched an everyday user fall out and have to be revived from a .1 which wouldn&#39;t normally kill a first timer and I&#39;ve seen someone do a 3.5g shot and not even pass out. Its funny that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok... And how do you suppose the Nirvana brand is worth more now?  There is no Nirvana.  How is that worth more?  Instead of a new album every year or so for the last 20 years you got a handful of albums and a couple of documentaries.  You can&#39;t actually think that is worth more to anyone than worldwide tours and fresh material being released.  Concert tours is where all the money is made.  There have been none since Kurt died.  Nirvana fans just moved over to listening to Pearl Jam who is still around and still making a shit ton of money.  They also moved on to the Foo Fighters who are still around and still making a shit ton of money.  Much much more than Nirvana.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>false because the Nirvana of that timeline is corny, hackneyed and done to death and the brand has no value anyways from overexposure. The fad would have died and &quot;killing&quot; him preserves the brand at LEGEND STATUS giving you this ILLUSION that all this money would be made off them if they were still going.... </p>

<p>This very scenario has been played out countless times with other contracted talent and the brands they are operating under. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not dismissing your assertion out of hand. I do believe that deaths can be faked so people &quot;disappear&quot; and reinvent themselves. Certainly, the family members of the Challenger explosion would give one pause, and there is much talk in the deeper levels of the conspiracy crowd of &quot;off-world&quot; civilizations and the like that, while I don&#39;t presently believe, have not completely written off, either -- it&#39;s clear that govt. commandeered Nick Tesla&#39;s technology ideas, and have likely leapt from his original work into things far deeper.</p>

<p>All that being said: If Cobain and Nirvana were a creation -- which I think they were -- of the intelligence community, but the guy was really a junkie and involved with that totally fucked up chick, is it more likely he got offed or more likely they just faked it and put it elsewhere? Isn&#39;t it EASIER to just kill him? Unless, of course, they don&#39;t mind the extra work, they just like fucking with us. Which is, of course, entirely possible.</p>

<p>What you say fascinated me, and I don&#39;t dismiss it out of hand. But it seems like the more difficult of two scenarios and I don&#39;t see their upside, particularly when we&#39;re talking about a heroin addict with bipolar issues who was also likely raised in a Luciferian situation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>as mad as all this sounds the more ridiculous part is where she uses 1000 hits of acid to destroy the music scene in the uk - someone that was born in 1964, someone so young compared to the british drug scene she could have listened to Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Piper at the Gates of Dawn as a three year old... </p>

<p>A thousand hits of acid would barely cause a ripple on the stones tour-bus, let alone in the dublin music scene! the biggest drama it&#39;d cause is hippy sound engineers and session musicians panicking they&#39;ve not got enough!  </p>

<p>I mean you get similar conspiracy stories relating to amy whinehouse, like omg she managed to get hooked on smack in the camden music scene?! sorry but Kurt developing drug dependencies in Seattle&#39;s sub-culture and then not being able to deal with the media pressure is not something that&#39;s the least bit shocking, i mean look how he identified with Frances Farmer and similar characters - &#39;I miss the comfort in being sad&#39; a reference to his common theme of feeling lobotomised and defective, robbed of his humanity and forever set of a path of dissociated suffering -this is an incredibly common sentiment for people who obsess over suicide. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so lonely, but that&#39;s okay, I shaved my head ...<br/>
And I&#39;m not sad<br/>
And just maybe I&#39;m to blame for all I&#39;ve heard ...<br/>
But I&#39;m not sure<br/>

But I don&#39;t care<br/>
I&#39;m so horny, but that&#39;s okay ...<br/>
My will is good   </p>

<p>These are the lyrics of an incredibly intelligent and tender person&#39;s self reflection through the lens of serious self-hatred and depression, he&#39;s using his considerable poetic skill to present the rolling waves of hopelessness and dislocation he feels - certainly when put in the context of his other music we simply can&#39;t help but see the same themes running through his work.  </p>

<p>One of the last things he did was put together a performance of acoustic songs the legendary MTV Unplugged album in which pretty much every song contains haunting allusions to death and suicide - about a girl and come as you are presenting a forward arc possibly symbolic of his early life, certainly of naivety, then jesus don&#39;t want me for a sun beam and man who sold the world illustrate the emotional landscape of feeling unwanted and consequently learning not to want [the same symbolic motif used at the end of come as you are when he repeats the refrain &#39;i don&#39;t have a gun&#39;] - this is a standard character development arc as seen in many of the great poetic works Kurt loved, as he said of his near obsessional love of Patrick Suskind’s Perfume he kept rereading it “Cause I’m a hypochondriac (and) it just affects me–makes me want to cut off my nose.” - certainly he loved the way literature and music could tell an emotional story and enjoyed the process of a developing story-arc. </p>

<p>Pennyroyal tea about how &#39;i&#39;m a liar and theif, i&#39;m anaemic royal royal tea...&#39; a very clear thematic continuation of the man who sold the world and it&#39;s affects on his soul &#39;steal the life that&#39;s inside of me...&#39; which leads to the sublime affirmation of his dislocation and an acceptance of is post-human experience in &#39;dumb&#39; which leads somewhat neatly into what could be considered the counter-point of the album as it changes up to &#39;polly&#39; a song about emotional distress and emptiness with an almost exactly opposite energy to dumb, the one being a passive acceptance of bliss the other a passive acceptance of hell...  Curt even mentions this similarity in a joke with the audience &#39;the reason we didn&#39;t want to play these songs back to back is they&#39;re exactly the same song...&#39; they have very similar music structure and theme &#39;let me take a ride, hurt yourself..&#39; contrasts so strongly with &#39;i think i&#39;m dumb, maybe just happy&#39; and it&#39;s a truly poetic and beautiful juxtapose of the two even but opposite sides of his perspective on himself, a dislocated and biploar image of the human condition and the post or fractured-human condition which he identified with. </p>

<p>We then enter the classic second half of the arc, generally in literature similar events happen at similar distances from the arc or counterpoint, thus &#39;on a plain&#39; and be compared and contrasted to &#39;man who sold the world&#39; and unsurprisingly we seen a strong link, one about the man who was selling the world [i.e. himself] now after the moment of shift we see the character post-sell out, we see the man who now loves himself more than the world.. </p>

<p>The next song jumps back to a reference to his childhood, &#39;underneath the bridge topp has sprung a leak..&#39; this is a direct refference to his traumatic upbringing when his parents kicked him out of home to try and &#39;help&#39; him get over his mental problems - something courney would latter talk about in regards to his suicide note calling the tough love concepts of the 80s bullshit. &#39;something in the way.... mmmm... hmmm....&#39; draws images of the character represented in the album&#39;s emotional blocks, he&#39;s sold the world but there&#39;s something in the way to him really feeling good - topp has sprung a leak, he simply can&#39;t find the joy he was expecting to when he sold out everthing and it&#39;s too late because the deal is done... </p>

<p>Interestingly the aside between &#39;something in the way&#39; and Plateau talks about a Christian kids show and he points out how unchristian it was for the character to wish harm upon sinners... how strikingly apropos.   </p>

<p>the three meatpuppets songs then come, Plateau &#39;nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds, see a lot from up there but don&#39;t worry, who needs actions when you&#39;ve got words...&#39; he&#39;s risen to this magnificent plateau we say on a plain and dumb, yet it&#39;s just if not more so empty and desolate than any other point his in his life... &#39;i don&#39;t have to think, i only have to do it....&#39; &#39;oh, me&#39; yet there is continuation from this dislocated position &#39;but that&#39;s old news...&#39; there&#39;s always more &#39;i can not see the end of me, formulate infinity inside of me...&#39; that feeling that this dislocation and angst will only ever increase and expand... an almost blissful hopelessness. </p>

<p>Lake of fire starts with the line &#39;where do bad folks go when they die?&#39; and tells the story of a woman bit by a rapid dog and dead before her time, of course it&#39;s easy to transpose one arc onto the other and see the rabid dog as a metaphor for that dislocativie angst which set the protagonist on a path to destruction - that classic faustian decline... </p>

<p>The final nirvana track comes now, all apologies - a song didicated to Francis Bean and Coutney, &#39;what else should i be but all apologies, what else should i say but everyone is gay, what else should i write i don&#39;t have the right, What else should I be All apologies...&#39;  containing lines like &#39;Everything is my fault, I&#39;ll take all the blame&#39; which frankly couldn&#39;t be more akin to a suicide letter, which is sort of the point of the song originally he&#39;s talking about his &#39;&#39;soul death&#39; with references to his youthful problems and how he realises he&#39;s responsible for his issues and they&#39;ve already killed him but it&#39;s kinda too late, or too hate...  </p>

<p>the final song is a traditional melancholy folk song, leadbellys version of where did you sleep last night, a folk song decended from &#39;the longest train&#39; - this song is about a woman who doesn&#39;t know why her husbands away, in the original she witnesses a long train passing which lets her know he must be dead.. in this version the dichotomy is between the woman asking where he slept and getting the answer &#39;in the pines...&#39; it&#39;s ostensibly the story of a man who&#39;s head was found in a driving wheel, but as a final note of confused and angry anguish it finishes the tale perfectly. </p>

<p>So yeah, curt was obsessed with suicide and saw it as inevitable for him, most of his career and life seems to suggest this - it&#39;s sad but he&#39;s certainly not the first genius to follow that route. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>dang, this is really weak but i just spent close to an hour writing a detailed response only to lose it! don&#39;t have time or inclination to write it all over again but i&#39;ll try to make some points. </p>

<p>Firstly all authors and poets shrug off the dumb question &#39;what&#39;s your music about&#39; in the same way scientists all shrug off &#39;why do magnets attract each other&#39; they&#39;re dumb questions, writing is an expression of the self and reflection of our internal and external biases - you can keep going back and saying &#39;why did you say that&#39; but whatevers said just opens up another question &#39;well what do you mean by that?&#39; and eventually just as with magnets we need to get to the point where we say &#39;look just shut up already, magnets is magnets - it&#39;s just all just magic!&#39; or &#39;words is words, it&#39;s just how i feel at the time i write it!&#39; because of course it is, kurt isn&#39;t some god that can just step outside himself and say &#39;oh yes, i do this because of a complex emotional trauma...&#39; what we see is the effects of that trauma upon his perception and expression. </p>

<p>A person is somewhat like a musical effects rack, we&#39;ve each got some inputs and from these we suck up the culture and reality we experience to be edited and shaped by our brain before being output through whatever means - we don&#39;t need to intend to express something, everything we do is automatically an expression of our self. </p>

<p>As for Kurt and Courtney, they came from different places and had different mentalities for sure - the seattle grunge scene and la punk scene that bore them couldn&#39;t have been more different yet also intrinsicly similar, that pop-rock industry they ended up in simply highlighted their differences and drove them ever more apart - as is so often the case people coming from different places pass through the same spot and fall in love only to drift apart again and never again their souls to meet...  </p>

<p>I think many people kinda see Kurt as representing the most tender and sweet side of the same coin upon which Courtney represents all that is gross and foul - Kurt suffered a brutal childhood as did Courtney and he came out an angle, she a devil; this of course isn&#39;t even close to reality but it&#39;s a pretty image and us &#39;umans love a pretty image... I think maybe that&#39;s what makes the murder story so compelling, like it just stands to reason that of course the evil one killed the good one, iike cane and able, rite? except that&#39;s not what happened then either... Kurt lived in an idealised fantasy world, so did Courtney - so do most people actually, in this case as is so common Kurt couldn&#39;t live up to fantasy and it caused him a lot of pain, he saw himself becoming all the things that&#39;d caused him to be like this and decided his only option was to escape the cycle -- it&#39;s easy to only pay attention to the first part of his letter, the more famous section to his fans, to boddah, and to say he only intended to quit Nirvana but that isn&#39;t true, he was quitting the dream, the ideal, that&#39;s why he mentioned Freddy Mercury -he&#39;d lost that energy, that one hope he had of making it to a point he could be a rockstar but not for the money or fame, he wanted that emotional strength which characters like Freddy seemed to present but as he&#39;d risen through life it became impossible to envision this, he lost that one last hope and he lost everything... </p>

<p>&#39;I have it good, very good, and I&#39;m grateful, but since the age of seven, I&#39;ve become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Empathy! Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess.&#39; </p>

<p>That jesus condition he started to associate with, that suffering person who took on the burden of the world for love alone - he saw himself as becoming the continuation of that machine which had made him, </p>

<p>&#39; I can&#39;t stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I&#39;ve become.&#39;  </p>

<p>and it wasn&#39;t just Francis, it was everyone - he couldn&#39;t live as a fraud, he couldn&#39;t pretend everything was fine and lead more hapless youths into the same convoluted deathtrap he&#39;d been suckered into... </p>

<p>as for Curt having a huge tolerance to heroin, yeah, that&#39;s what generally happens to junkies - just read any autobiography of a famous junkie and you&#39;ll hear them talking about the heroic sessions they used to partake in, despite what some people like to claim Kurts blood morphine level was not impossibly high - take <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09595230096129">this study from Australia</a>,  The median blood morphine concentration of cases was 0.39mg/l (range 0.05-4.5mg/l) - there were people with four times the level Kurt had. And just as Janis Joplin managed to go buy cigarettes before falling into a coma so he could have taken a few moments to prepare himself and blow his brains out, combined suicide methods is very common. </p>

<p>So yeah, those articles you post have a lot of words and some bold statements but none of it really makes sense or fits together - the redacted police report simply says that someone, presumibly Love phoned the police worried about kurt, however when kurt was spoken to he claimed to be fine -- of course he did, he was speaking to the police - everyone pretends to be fine when dealing with an authority figure, &#39;me officer? causing a disturbance? no, of course not i&#39;m in perfectly sound mind and should be allowed to carry on with my business....&#39; it&#39;s very likely though that curt was having some form of bad mood and locked himself in the room he keeps his guns after mentioning suicide - this is the sort of thing depressed people do. </p>

<p>I mean honestly the evidence boils down to &#39;dude was acting a bit crazy and irrational, had some issues in his life, seemed kinda lost.&#39; and the conclusion being drawn is &#39;yeah that&#39;s not normal, therefore it can&#39;t be true he killed himself and actually there must be a complex conspiracy where a junky of questionable musical talent and fading looks somehow is in charge of the police and media...&#39; </p>

<p>sorry but there really is nothing in these theories, Tom Grant especially relies on nothing but the most absurdly easy to explain mysteries - someone planning to commit suicide generally does not mention this fact to friends or on official documentation, rather they say something which seems totally believable like &#39;home protection&#39;. Finding someone that brought a gun shortly prior or blowing their head off with it and saying &#39;oh they told people it was just a safety precaution&#39; is not a smoking gun, it&#39;s a sign you&#39;re clutching at straws desperate to make a name for yourself and get hits on your shitty websites...  </p>

<p>geeze i really don&#39;t think i have two and half hours to set aside at the moment but i would love to talk about the music industry and conspiracies within it - what youtube channel does this radio station broudcast from? </p>

<p>you&#39;re confused, you probably haven&#39;t realised that reddit is not a standard forum yet - it&#39;s something better, a regular forum has one long stream of argument but reddit has many, this means you make a statement and someone can come and talk about an aspect of it which starts up a thread which can then split again in other areas - here i wanted to talk about the absurd argument often made that kurt didn&#39;t want to kill himself and point out that it&#39;s pretty darn obvious he did. </p>

<p>at no point have i said this is all i&#39;ll talk about or the only things that are important however it is one thing which is very important - why you&#39;re not willing to touch it is anyones guess, personally i assume it&#39;s because it kinda does ruin your theory. </p>

<p>yes, well no, actually i barely moderate at all i just chat to friends in mod mail and help run micro-communities i&#39;m a member of. but what is your point? i mod subs thus i have to do any radio interview someone invites me to do?</p>

<p>then why did you previously post loads of stuff trying to prove courtney killed kurt? you seem desperate to control the conversation and only allow things which agree with you, one moment i&#39;m not talking about enough the next i&#39;m talking about too much - you demanded i address the question of police evidence and i did, then you totally ignored all that and pretended i was some terrible agent of the music industry working with the CIA to introduce heroin to a nation that&#39;s fought wars to protect their opium industry... </p>

<p>I mean you talk about heroin being used to put down the socialist revolution yet you seem to be ignoring the fact even Marx&#39;s most famous quote that &#39;religion is the opium of the people&#39; contains a reference to the opium craze among intellectuals and artists... </p>

<p>Textbook Topic Dilution &amp; Forum Slide technique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes and pretending everyone who disagrees with you is some form of shill or decepticon is textbook disinfo agent too. </p>

<p>I presented a simple strand of argument, if you can&#39;t face that argument then fine but pretending i presenting the wrong argument is silly. Kurt, as anyone thats listened to his music could tell you, was very much depressed and quite clearly somewhat obsessed by suicide - for a character like tom grant to simply wave his hand and say &#39;nah, kurt loved life silly!&#39; isn&#39;t just silly it&#39;s absolutely absurd. </p>

<p>I am not some evil agent of a system out to oppress you, i do work in the music industry though so maybe in your mind that does make me an agent? just like Kurt Loder rite? and Courtney Love... </p>

<p>i mean honestly what the hell do you think is the big plan here? how many of us are working on this secret project? Drugs and art have gone together though out history, the stones didn&#39;t invent getting high, heck even the Beatles didn&#39;t invent getting high - psychadelics have been used for thousands of years, in recent history the drug culture and artist culture got combined into a concept of bonhom living popular in the victorian era and established into the hippy, beat and other counter-culture movements of the last century through to the scenes of today.. There was no need for the CIA to introduce drugs to Britain via Courtney love, it&#39;d be like smuggling sand to the sahara.  </p>

<p>As for where the drugs come from, they&#39;re not hard to make - heroin of course is largely smuggled along the hippy trails up until the 80s when it corporate drug smuggling started through bonded warehouses, by the start of this century synthetic Chinese heroin was flooding the markets smuggled in via consumer electronics... </p>

<p>Drugs aren&#39;t some new invention, europe has loved drugs and music since at least the celtic era - if you&#39;re trying to suggest that america invented music and drugs then you&#39;re as mad as a box of frogs. Sure LSD is a fairly new invention and MDMA too, but Curt was a junkie addicted to one of the oldest known psychoactive compounds on the planet - a drug so completely synonymous with the tortured artist and pained heart it&#39;s impossible to point to a time when this wasn&#39;t so, i mean when the London scene started it was already an established trope;   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Not poppy, nor mandragore,<br/>
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,<br/>
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep,<br/>
Which thou ow’dst yesterday.’  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>did the CIA get to Shakespeare too? </p>

<p>and seriously, you think that drugs culture has ruined the left wing protest movement? most of it only exists because of the drug culture - i mean fuck without the zines and nights organised by hopped-up-hippies you&#39;d have nothing but mainstream authoritarian culture&#39;s voice - we&#39;d all be souless disney robots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our society has grown and/or been shaped to idolise and worship a pantheon of celebrity, billions of people copy their fashion and lifestyles, and follow their ideas to the letter. They are often more influential than writers and philosophers, more loved than saints and are a guiding force in global social relations.  In most cases, the dominance of a handful of media companies mean these personae are carefully manipulated puppet façades which are designed to fulfil the social objectives of a handful of media moguls in service of the military industrial complex.  </p>

<p>The untimely deaths of many of the most outspoken celebrities of the past 50 years has long been hypothesised to be a form of societal manipulation, intended to create a psychological &quot;framing effect&quot; which limits the scope of public discourse to exclude topics which threaten the status quo.  In most cases the people in question were outspoken on leftists issues, often to the extent of calling for revolution, and their deaths were under suspicious circumstance which are allegedly linked to the US intelligence agencies.   Examples of artists include Bob Marley, John Lennon, Tupac Shakur, Jimmi Hendrix and Curt Cobain, among many others. Non-artists are also often attributed to this grouping, including JFK, Princess Diana, Malcolm X, Martin Luther Kind Jr, </p>

<p>If proven, this hypothesis would indicate the powers that be have been routinely assassinating many of the most influential leftist political minds of the past several decades, with the presumed goal of keeping western nations from adopting more socialist political ideas which would threaten the established economic order.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is in no way indicated or implied by me, your hasty conclusion is based on a tiny list of celebrities, a handful out of the countless ones who have died without suspicious circumstances.  Keep in mind, these specific celebrities were far more influential than most, their circumstances in some cases included documented death threats from intelligence agencies, and that being shot at point blank range is rarely accidental.  </p>

<p>That said, the frequent capitalisation and general tone of your comment appears deliberately abrasive and argumentative so I shall have no more to do with this conversation, Good day to you. </p>

<p>And I&#39;m not asking that idly.  I feel most people don&#39;t care enough about courtney love and kurt kobain to do anything stupid about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All right, let&#39;s get right into it then:</p>

<p>Project MKULTRA is very well documented to have have existed, and resulted in a few deaths by OVER-LSDing otherwise responsible people.</p>

<p>Subproject 68 was a bullshit attempt to cull positive results from negative data, and it DID hurt people.</p>

<p>Now, you&#39;re dating back a LONG ways citing that shit.  it proved out to be LESS effective than what the CIA does now with its prisoners.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not ignorant, merely intolerant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No.  I don&#39;t appreciate your comment.  I stand by my statement and any interview he&#39;s given shows what an utter scumbag he is.  My opinion of him is not a dispute about Courtney&#39;s character or theories people have posted here.  I think he goes along way to explaining her personality.  He is a cunt, might not be classy, but I never claimed to be and neither is he. </p>
