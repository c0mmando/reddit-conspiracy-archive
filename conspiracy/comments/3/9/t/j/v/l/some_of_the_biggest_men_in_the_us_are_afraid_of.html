<p>They know that America is not a place of which it can be said, as it used to be, that a man may choose his own calling and pursue it just as far as his abilities enable him to pursue it; because to-day, if he enters certain fields, there are organizations which will use means against him that will prevent his building up a business which they do not want to have built up; organizations that will see to it that the ground is cut from under him and the markets shut against him. For if he begins to sell to certain retail dealers, to any retail dealers, the monopoly will refuse to sell to those dealers, and those dealers, afraid, will not buy the new man&#39;s wares. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there might be some confirmation bias at work here that some folks in this thread are allowing themselves to fall into. With this expanded context it becomes much less sinister. He&#39;s not saying there is one such organization that all of these men are afraid of. He&#39;s talking about the difficulty of entering into competition in industry/manufacturing when there are already large capital forces at work in those industries.</p>

<p>The paragraphs following the above add some sdditional context that adds to this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And this is the country which has lifted to the admiration of the world its ideals of absolutely free opportunity where no man is supposed to be under any limitation except the limitations of his character and of his mind where there is supposed to be no distinction of class no distinction of blood no distinction of social status but where men win or lose on their merits.</p>

<p>I lay it very close to my own conscience as public man whether we can any longer stand our doors and welcome all newcomers upon terms American industry is not free once it was free American enterprise is not the man with only a little capital is finding harder to get into the field more and more to compete with the big fellow Because the laws of this country do prevent the strong from crushing the weak is the reason and because the strong have the weak the strong dominate the and the economic life of this country man can deny that the lines of endeavor more and more narrowed and stiffened man who knows anything about the development of industry in this country can have failed observe that the larger kinds of credit are and more difficult to obtain unless you them upon the terms of uniting your with those who already control the industries of the country and nobody can fail to observe that any man who tries to set himself up in competition with any process of manufacture which has been taken under the control of large combinations of capital will presently find himself either squeezed out or obliged to sell and allow himself to be absorbed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adolf Hitler wanted a united Europe; you find from the Memoirs of Winston Churchill&#39;s Personal Secretary (John Colville), who wrote The Fringes of Power, he said that Winston Churchill&#39;s view, and his dream was to have a united Europe. Hitler and Winston Churchill both had the same dream and they both hoped that World War Two would bring it about. Behind that too, you had big banking organisations, which operated in neutral countries, financing all sides of this thing. They also had banks too within the warring countries, investing through IG Farben and keeping the war machine going in Germany in World War Two. You have this incredible loophole, which allows banks to, somehow, be untouchable and even those who do the trading too, the big corporations that formed IG Farben and other groups, to be almost untouchable. People don&#39;t know that the United States, backed by the Big Foundations, and the Rockefellers and big families, who helped fund IG Farben, sent dozens and dozens of top lawyers over to the trials (the Nuremberg Trials in Germany), to do with the prosecutions against people who had set up the war industry, the machinery for the Nazi Regime. Their job was to get them off and they were very-very successful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Churchill wanted a United Europe to come out of World War II.  But he wasn’t in on everything.  When he found out that the Lord Milner Society, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, HAD been writing… and he said this and I’ve read it on the air, from Churchill’s own quote.  He said, “It’s incredible to think that a small group of very rich people have run the history and written the books,” the textbooks for schools, the books for universities, giving a false history Britain for the last 150 years, he says, “that is a power that no people should have.”  So they constantly go back and they rewrite history and rewrite history and give a completely fictitious history.  They always HIDE THEMSELVES when they’ve taken the front in anything, they’ll put themselves in the background or OUT OF THE BOOK ALL TOGETHER so that you don’t even suspect they exist.  That’s what Orwell had with his ‘memory hole’.  Everything suddenly goes down the ‘memory hole’ and they give you a new history.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Our government has been for the past few years under the control of heads of great allied corporations with special interests. It has not controlled these interests and assigned them a proper place in the whole system of business; it has submitted itself to their control. As a result, there have grown up vicious systems and schemes of governmental favoritism (the most obvious being the extravagant tariff), far-reaching in effect upon the whole fabric of life, touching to his injury every inhabitant of the land, laying unfair and impossible handicaps upon competitors, imposing taxes in every direction, stifling everywhere the free spirit of American enterprise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nevertheless, it is an intolerable thing that the government of the republic should have got so far out of the hands of the people; should have been captured by interests which are special and not general. In the train of this capture follow the troops of scandals, wrongs, indecencies, with which our politics swarm.&quot;</p>

<p>So, same old same old.</p>
