        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is just a brief list of some relatively recent conspiracy theories that were eventually proven true, that even the sanitized and propagandized Wikipedia can&#39;t dispute.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">Project MK Ultra</a>: In the 1950s to the 1970s, the CIA ran a mind-control project aimed at finding a “truth serum” to use on communist spies. Test subjects were given LSD and other drugs, often without consent, and some were tortured.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">Operation Mockingbird</a>: In the 1950s to ’70s, the CIA paid a number of well-known domestic and foreign journalists to publish CIA propaganda.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project">Manhattan Project</a>: The codename for a project conducted during World War II to develop the first atomic bomb. Entire towns were built for short periods of time, employing people, all under secrecy and top national secrecy at that.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos#Discovery_of_toxicity">Asbestos Toxicity</a>: Between 1930 and 1960, manufacturers did all they could to prevent the link between asbestos and respiratory diseases, including cancer, becoming known, so they could avoid prosecution.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal">Watergate Scandal</a>: Republican officials spied on the Democratic National Headquarters from the Watergate Hotel in 1972. While conspiracy theories suggested underhanded dealings were taking place, it wasn’t until 1974 that White House tape recordings linked President Nixon to the break-in and forced him to resign.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment">Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment</a>: The United States Public Health Service carried out this clinical study on 400 poor, African-American men with syphilis from 1932 to 1972. During the study the men were given false and sometimes dangerous treatments, and adequate treatment was intentionally withheld so the agency could learn more about the disease.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_%28testimony%29">Gulf War &#39;Incubator Babies&#39;</a>: A 15-year-old girl named “Nayirah” testified before the U.S. Congress that she had seen Iraqi soldiers pulling Kuwaiti babies from incubators, causing them to die. The testimony helped gain major public support for the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio">Operation Gladio</a>: The clandestine NATO “stay-behind” operation in Italy after World War II, intended to continue anti-communist resistance in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion of Western Europe.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>: COINTELPRO (an acronym for Counter Intelligence Program) was a series of covert, and often illegal, projects conducted by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) aimed at investigating and disrupting dissident political organizations within the United States.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair">Iran Contra Affair</a>: In 1985 and ’86, the White House authorized government officials to secretly give weapons to the Israeli government in exchange for the release of U.S. hostages in Iran, and in hopes that they would use the money to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. The plot was uncovered by Congress in 1987.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International">Bank of Credit and Commerce International</a>: Investigators in the U.S. and the UK revealed that BCCI had been “set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection.”</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_drug_trafficking">CIA Drug Trafficking</a>: The CIA <del>was</del> is pretty naughty.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident">Gulf of Tonkin Incident</a>: This was also the single most important reason for the escalation of the Vietnam War, but looks like it was a false report.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot">Business Plot</a>: In 1933, group of wealthy businessmen that allegedly included the heads of Chase Bank, GM, Goodyear, Standard Oil, the DuPont family and Senator Prescott Bush tried to recruit Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler to lead a military coup against President FDR and install a fascist dictatorship in the United States.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat">1953 Iranian Coup d&#39;état</a>: The US and Britain overthrew a democratically elected President of Iran and backed a Shah, because they wanted oil.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Snow_White">Operation Snow White</a>: The Church of Scientology managed to perform the largest infiltration of the United States government in history. Ever. 5,000 of Scientology’s crack commandos wiretapped and burglarized various agencies. They stole hundreds of documents, mainly from the IRS. No critic was spared, and in the end, 136 organizations, agencies and foreign embassies were infiltrated.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip">Operation Paperclip</a>: Operation Paperclip was the code name for the 1945 Office of Strategic Services, Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency recruitment of German scientists from Nazi Germany to the U.S. after VE Day.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a>: In the early 1960s, American military leaders drafted plans to create public support for a war against Cuba, to oust Fidel Castro from power. The plans included committing acts of terrorism in U.S. cities, killing innocent people and U.S. soldiers, blowing up a U.S. ship, assassinating Cuban émigrés, sinking boats of Cuban refugees, and hijacking planes. The plans were all approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but were rejected by JFK.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Conspiracy theories are all about misdirection and disinformation. By invoking the magic words and calling something a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, a subject is associated with crazy and discussion can be directed away from the topic at hand.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t know <a href="/u/Serps450">/u/Serps450</a> posting history, and I couldn&#39;t be bothered looking, but what I see in this thread is someone who made what I thought was a very obviously sarcastic, but also very relevant, comment about the nature of conspiracy theory. It appears that you have latched on to a single part of a single sentence, while missing the sarcasm entirely. That&#39;s how the conspiracy theory meme works. It directs you to put a topic into a basket full of crazy shit with the expectation that some of that shit will rub off. The topic then reeks of crazy shit and gets dismissed. Those that continue investigating said topic are covered in shit and nobody wants anything to do with them because they&#39;re crazy. Problem solved.</p>

<p>For example: Did George Bush steal the 2000 election? There&#39;s lots of evidence that something funny was going on. </p>

<p>&quot;Voting irregularities&quot; in Florida during the 2000 Presidential election are &quot;nothing but a conspiracy theory&quot;. Conspiracy theories Vare all about things like shape-shifting aliens anally raping innocent farmboys in spaceships. People who believe in things like that are nuts. If you believe in the conspiracy theory that there was voter manipulation in Florida, then it logically follows you must also believe in baby-eating Jewish Satanists who want to steal our souls to power their transdimensionl warp engines. Do I really need to tell you how crazy it is for someone to believe that little grey aliens rigged the election of the President of the United States so that they can harvest us for people pate? George Bush won the election fair and square, don&#39;t listen to the conspiritards.</p>

<p>Note how viscerally you reacted to the stupidity of a flat earth while ignoring his comments about 9/11 in the post you replied to. It&#39;s worth remembering that, before becoming president, George Bush Snr was head of the CIA, an organisation that shows up with conspicuous regularity when it comes to conspiracy theories. What happened on 9/11 that you would waste so many words being indignant over someone saying &quot;flat earth&quot;? I&#39;m not trying to in/validate anything either of you said, and I&#39;m not accusing either of you of intentionally doing anything. Maybe that other poster is a Flat Earther, but if so, you should ask why. You should also ask yourself why you reacted the way you did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullshit. Conspiracies aren&#39;t real and Wikipedia is a truther site that anyone can edit. They&#39;ve never taken children by the thousands. They never forced them to endure more than the <strong>maximum</strong> amount of pain a human can handle in an effort to split the personality. Mockingbird is BS, the CIA would never pay anyone. They came up with Manhattan Project at Bohemian Grove, actually. Which doesn&#39;t exist. The list goes on and it&#39;s all a lie.</p>

<p>Attempting regime change in Iran? Absolutely ridiculous. Why would they want control of a country just because it has the 4th largest oil reserves and is a direct threat to the petrodollar? The CIA would never touch drugs to rake in billions and billions for their black budget. Absolutely ridiculous. Secret deals with Israel? Like the ones constantly going on with other countries? Featuring weapons and tactics tested on the captive Palestinian population? Absolutely ridiculous. </p>

<p>You really think the <em>military</em> would want the extremely valuable knowledge obtained by Nazi scientists through war crimes? The military isn&#39;t interested in advanced forms of warfare, mind control, weather control, scalar EM weapons, anything that would incredibly useful in a war. No. Absolutely ridiculous. </p>

<p>A coup attempting to install a fascist form of government, kind of like the one they have now? Absolutely ridiculous. <a href="http://www.ellensplace.net/fascism.html">http://www.ellensplace.net/fascism.html</a></p>

<p>A false flag to justify a war that would overthrow Castro, who they then tried to assassinate over 600 fucking times? Absolutely ridiculous. This is all complete bullshit, I can&#39;t believe anyone is dumb enough to believe absolute facts. The government and the TV are the only real sources of information and if it&#39;s not on the TV it&#39;s not real. </p>

<p>Why would somebody even do something illegal secretly? To get away with it? You think they would kill Americans, who they&#39;ve proven they do not care about, just to further their own interests? In some cases it being the only option? Yes. <strong>You conspiracy nuts with your tin foil hats and legitimate facts are the crazy ones.</strong></p>

<p>Okay...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26015492">Impact of aspartame and saccharin on the rat liver: Biochemical, molecular, and histological approach.</a></p>

<p>In addition to a significant reduction in the body weight, the AS-treated groups displayed elevated enzymes activities, lowered antioxidants values, and histological changes reflecting the hepatotoxic effect of aspartame and saccharin. Moreover, the overexpression of the key oncogene (h-Ras) and the downregulation of the tumor suppressor gene (P27) in all treated rat groups may indicate a potential risk of liver carcinogenesis, particularly on long-term exposure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25681123"><strong>Longer period of oral administration of aspartame on cytokine response in Wistar albino rats.</strong></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>CONCLUSION:</p>

<p>The findings clearly point out that aspartame acts as a chemical stressor because of increased corticosterone level and increased lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide level induce generation of free radicals in serum which may be the reason for variation of cytokine level and finally results in alteration of immune function. Aspartame metabolite methanol or formaldehyde may be the causative factors behind the changes observed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I don&#39;t think MSG is a problem, it occurs naturally, and it&#39;s generic so no organisation has an overwhelming vested interest in defending it. Aspartame is a different kettle of fish.</p>

<p>The origins of aspartame and the distinctly unscientific way in which it became FDA approved is sketchy as hell. Also there have been recent studies which have found real problems with artificial sweeteners and how (despite having virtually zero calories) they are correlated with long-term weight gain and Type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>I find the parallels between tobacco and aspartame quite striking. There is no good reason for humans to consume either, so why take the risk? Because the manufacturers assure you it&#39;s safe? Big Tobacco maintained their lies for about 70 years before the real science caught up with their tame scientists. </p>

<p>The issue is whether those studies are genuinely independent or not. </p>

<p>Aspartame has no nutritional value, and no know health benefits. It also doesn&#39;t taste of much - it&#39;s just incredibly sweet. Not consuming aspartame is not a hardship. </p>

<p>Aspartame and other artificial clearly have fewer calories than sucrose/fructose, and I used to assume that this meant it was a &quot;healthier&quot; option. I don&#39;t any longer, and since there is no good reason to consume aspartame, it&#39;s no loss for me to have given it up. There a plenty of elderly smokers who used to believe that cigarettes were safe because they believed the &quot;science&quot;.</p>

<p>I not only dropped MSG and sodas, I also went gluten free.  Not because I have a reaction to gluten or because I&#39;m a pretentious asshole who likes to make people around me uncomfortable, but because I found it was the easiest way to eat healthy.  Cutting out gluten and dairy basically forces you to eat healthy.  Dropped 25 pounds in 3 months, and my joints stopped aching.

<p>No.  </p>

<p>2 weeks into my diet (before losing any significant amount of weight) my joint pain was pretty much gone.</p>

<p>For instance, I was in a very bad car wreck a long time ago.  For 15 years I wasn&#39;t able to turn my head to the right without discomfort or sometimes even pain.

<p>All we know is that numerous drugs which have at one point been passed as &quot;SAFE&quot; have later been withdrawn because of serious/fatal side effects.</p>

<p>The length of this list demonstrates beyond doubt that the so-called &quot;gold standard&quot; of clinical trials and peer review is not sufficient to prevent harmful drugs hitting the market. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Find me a stick of gum at the convenience store that doesn&#39;t have aspartame. Check the milk companies trying to add it to kids&#39; milk in schools.</p>

<p>I honestly could care less about aspartame if it was something a regular person could avoid. You should be able to choose what you consume and make your own health decisions for you and your children. The problem with aspartame is that it&#39;s easy for me to avoid, not so easy for a child, for whom it has the potential to cause greater harm.</p>

<p>But this is a derailment and not the point of the argument above. The argument above was a user saying that aspartame is safe and that there is no evidence that aspartame can cause harm. That user is wrong.</p>

Abstract Title:
Increasing brain tumor rates: is there a link to aspartame?</p>

<p>Abstract:
In the past two decades brain tumor rates have risen in several industrialized countries, including the United States. During this time, brain tumor data have been gathered by the National Cancer Institute from catchment areas representing 10% of the United States population. In the present study, we analyzed these data from 1975 to 1992 and found that the brain tumor increases in the United States occurred in two distinct phases, an early modest increase that may primarily reflect improved diagnostic technology, and a more recent sustained increase in the incidence and shift toward greater malignancy that must be explained by some other factor(s). Compared to other environmental factors putatively linked to brain tumors, the artificial sweetener aspartame is a promising candidate to explain the recent increase in incidence and degree of malignancy of brain tumors. Evidence potentially implicating aspartame includes an early animal study revealing an exceedingly high incidence of brain tumors in aspartame-fed rats compared to no brain tumors in concurrent controls, the recent finding that the aspartame molecule has mutagenic potential, and the close temporal association (aspartame was introduced into US food and beverage markets several years prior to the sharp increase in brain tumor incidence and malignancy). We conclude that there is need for reassessing the carcinogenic potential of aspartame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about MSG causing long term damage. But it definitely triggers really bad migraines for me. Up to 20mins - 2hours after I consumed MSG (in &#39;normal&#39; quantities, ie a chinese meal or few sticks of beef jerky I ate one time) then I will have severe visual disturbance (to the point where I can&#39;t see) and debilitating headache!  So I stop eating it and I stop getting those sudden acute migraines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but it&#39;s something else triggering your migraines, not MSG.</p>

<p>MSG is a naturally occurring salt compound of glutamic acid. When I say naturally occurring, it&#39;s present in a vast majority of foods you would eat every day, especially meats and cheeses ... oh and your own body produces it, further more it&#39;s present in your own blood, <strong>and your own brain</strong>. Do you like parmesan cheese? Yeah? Well guess what, it&#39;s roughly 1.2% natural MSG.</p>

<p>Next, due to naturally occurring MSG (bound glutamate) in your own brain, the blood brain barrier regulates the flow of many nutrients including MSG, and unless you are specifically impaired, MSG does not cross the blood brain barrier, if it is, then this suggests a metabolic impairment, which will further suggest MSG is not the cause, but a symptom of a potentially more serious condition.</p>

<p>MSG is perfectly safe and natural, anyone who suggests otherwise is a nutjob, pure and simple. Anecdotal evidence from a sample of 1 (yourself) and a bunch of others who kinda blame it because of &quot;chinese food syndrome&quot; crap, cannot compete with the mountain of empirical double blind scientific studies which has conclusively determined MSG is perfectly safe and does not adversely affect healthy people in any way.</p>

<p>MSG is one of the most studied food additives in the world, if there was actually a problem with it, countries around the world would have banned it years ago ... the MSG industry isn&#39;t &quot;big pharma&quot; they don&#39;t have the political clout to bust past scientific study to stay on the market.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say MSG was not safe and natural.  I said MSG triggers my migraines. I think it is a trigger for many migraine sufferers.  I would be interested in reading the empirical scientific studies, but unfortunately, telling me that I am a nutjob for saying MSG triggers acute migraines does not really help me.  I would like to know why then, foods that contain those higher levels of MSG, trigger my migraines.  I don&#39;t know if I have some serious condition beyond simple migraines, as far as I&#39;m aware, I don&#39;t.  I eat normally and poop normally.  It seems like people have put this issue to bed so there is no point in me arguing without someone actually studying what happens to my body if I eat a bag of beef jerky.</p>

<p>And I never eat parmesan cheese - other kinds of cheese have been a trigger for me in the past though, also caffeine - we know those are safe things to eat, but doesn&#39;t stop it being a trigger for me. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spend some time on scholar.google.com researching MSG, focus on publications in the more respected journals.</p>

<p>It&#39;s simple, MSG is safer than table salt. In studies with mice, they had worse reactions sooner with ordinary sodium chloride than they did with MSG.</p>

<p>The bottom line is MSG is present naturally in many foods you already eat, if MSG was causing your migraines, you would have a very limited diet available to you, and the scientists would be clamouring to study you.</p>

<p>Once I ate several sticks of beef jerky and about 40 minutes later I had the same symptoms, aura with visual disturbance.  After I checked the bag out of curiosity it had high amount of MSG added.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, conspiracy theorists (or people who question known liars) are ridiculed because of the teachings of Edward Bernays. Even though I think of him as completely evil he was nevertheless correct.</p>

<p>Bernays created the fields of Public Relations and of Propaganda. The synopsis of his theory was that, people will believe absolutely anything that&#39;s repeated  to them by &#39;experts&#39; no matter how implausible.</p>

<p>His theory was proven in the 1920&#39;s when he caused millions of women to start smoking by having experts in newspaper and magazine articles repeat that cigarettes were &quot;torches of freedom&quot; </p>

All you did was look google the prevalence of Alzheimers. Find me a study that actually links the increased prevalence of Alzheimer&#39;s with increased metal ingestion, and proposes a potential mechanistic explanation.

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for actually posting links. I haven&#39;t gone through the first link, but I have gone through the second and I do have to cautiom you AGAINST using case reports to infer/generalize any conclusions to anyone other than the SINGLE patient involved. Case-reports are the lowest study type on the evidence-based medicine hierarchy, because they are observational, involve no cohorts, and no control groups. The <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124652/">ncbi hierarchy</a> doesn&#39;t even mention case reports (which are usually LOWER than case series), as it is pretty obvious that the scientific community does not make conclusions off of this very weak evidence.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is interesting that you have posted a case report on this topic, as case reports are usually conducted for cases that are especially interesting or rare (medically speaking). Just goes to show you that what you assert about metals causing Alzheimer&#39;s is probably suspicious at best, as this has been found to be rare and interesting enough to be reported on in a case report. If this was such a common occurence as you insinuate, there would not have been a case report on the topic. If you still can&#39;t accept how hilariously wrong you are, then please take a second learn about what you are actually posting, how methodologiclly strong or weak it is, and what conclusions are appropriate given the limiations of the data.  </p>

<p>Haven&#39;t I already warned you about the dangers of making strong conclusions off of case reports, especially after you blatantly stated that you &quot;don&#39;t contend it constitutes proof of anything&quot;.</p>

<p>Why are you being hilariously hypocritical? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It has been <strong>suspected</strong> of contaminating the pituitary for nearly a hundred years so I&#39;m pretty sure that idea has validity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suspected is completely different then proved. A suspicion is equivalent to an UNTESTED hypothesis. How can you be so sure that something that is untested, and suspected, has validity? Is it because it has been suspected for 100 hundred years? Are you that naive to believe in the truth of an idea simply because that idea has been believed (potentially foolishly) for a long time. Would you also be sure that my hypothesis that you are a fucking moron is valid without first testing it? </p>

<p>You&#39;re clearly scientifically illiterate and have no understanding of how research is conducted and interpreted. If all you have to confirm your suspicions are your own anecdotal experiences in the 1950s, then you have no basis for which to push your claims.</p>

<p>Also, I really don&#39;t give a fuck about what you were or were not sprayed with in 1959. I want hard, cold systematic reviews concluding that these metals can cause Alzhemiers. If you cannot provide that, you can shut the fuck up and return to St Louis.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are ow routinely injected with and treated with lead </p>

<p>Please tell me when in the actual fuck you have ever been injected with <strong>pure</strong> lead, yet alone on a &quot;routine&quot; basis. </p>

Do you mean someone got a tax break, or what? Because if that&#39;s all it takes to be &quot;government sponsored&quot;, then I&#39;m government sponsored, thanks to that cushy federal homeowners tax credit.</p>

<p>What cognitive state is pushing you to fight the thought that maybe, just maybe, rich people trying to get richer do bad things to not rich people out of greed, with or without government? I know, that&#39;s quite a crazy idea, isn&#39;t it? The thought that some rich people who own companies might get together at the country club and work out a deal that increases their wealth at the detriment of other people. Who knows... could the government be one of the things they manipulate to achieve those ends, rather than vice versa? Whoah, get out the tinfoil for that one!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is that they are an integral cog in the wheel. The crazy will always be there because the machine doesn&#39;t work without it. Quoting myself from earlier in this topic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did George Bush steal the 2000 election? There&#39;s lots of evidence that something funny was going on.</p>

<p>&quot;Voting irregularities&quot; in Florida during the 2000 Presidential election are &quot;nothing but a conspiracy theory&quot;. Conspiracy theories Vare all about things like shape-shifting aliens anally raping innocent farmboys in spaceships. People who believe in things like that are nuts. If you believe in the conspiracy theory that there was voter manipulation in Florida, then it logically follows you must also believe in baby-eating Jewish Satanists who want to steal our souls to power their transdimensionl warp engines. Do I need to tell you how crazy it is for someone to believe that little grey aliens rigged the election of the President of the United States?! George Bush won the election fair and square, don&#39;t listen to the conspiritards.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s worth remembering that, before becoming president, George Bush Snr was head of the CIA, an organisation that shows up with conspicuous regularity when it comes to conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Several conspiracy theories have been proven true before. We have a nice long list here. But that also doesn&#39;t mean that the Bush family is secretly a dinosauroid aliens.</p>

<p>Several conspiracy theories have remarkably little evidence in their favor - or sometimes excellent evidence of a contrary &quot;mainstream&quot; theory - to back them up despite being very popular. We landed on the moon, but that doesn&#39;t mean the government can do no wrong ever.</p>

<p>Indeed. My sole concern was as I stated, your name seeming like a subtle reference to an organization that seeks to disenfranchise the topic of conspiracy theories. That, and while I myself am always willing to read about even the most outlandish of hypothesis, many others may find their brows furrowing when they notice your frequent posts about &#39;Flat Earth&#39; as your pet theory, whilst posting certified ones as listed ITT.</p>

<p>In short, it may be perceived by some as a form of over-saturating good content with bad.</p>

<p>When you said &#39;we&#39; you left out <em>me</em>.  Please enlighten me on the Church of the Subgenius.  I know what it is, but please tell me who (or who you think) is behind it.  I always thought it was an absurdist form of discordianism (Robert Anton Wilson and his contemporaries), for punks and college kids with longing for consciousness expansion with the void of a nearly psychedelics-free 80s.  Fast forward to now, and I&#39;ve suspected it was a PR campaign by either communists, anarchists or by the corporate shadow gov to discredit and ferret out dissidents....or it could just be what it is, a kind of zany, anticorporate, culturejamming antireligion performance art tradtion.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to know what you know about this movement.</p>

<p>I was maybe exaggerating when I said no one had heard of it.  It&#39;s not unknown, just lesser known.  Our media has not mentioned it once.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reconnaissance_Office">Wikipedia National Reconnnaisance Office</a>--they mostly operate surveillance sattelites and gather data for the other 3 letters.  They are ceiling cat, watching you masturbate, even as we speak, using advanced hyperspectral video tomography with deep infrared penetration.  I made that last part up but it sounded so right.</p>

<p>This is what is actually &quot;intellectually dishonest and extremely dangerous&quot;, because it is ignoring all of the conspiracy theories that turned out to be false--whether they be 10 or 1000. What the parent post has demonstrated is nothing more than an informal fallacy (cherry picking) in order to advocate for their implied position that we should be more trusting/believing/less dismissive of conspiracy theories (since his position his implied, it may be any of the above or something that I may have missed). </p>

<p>To clarify, I did not assert anything about the relevance of conspiracy theories and whether we should trust them or not, I just pointed out how the author may be fallaciously attempting to convince you to be more accepting of conspiracy theories. You have no idea what my position on conspiracy theories is, and for that matter you don&#39;t even need to know, because it is not relevant to the scope of my comment. </p>

<p>I understand. And I disagree. The parent post is a small sample of some &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; that are now accepted fact and does not imply that &quot;we should start to believe conspiracy theories more often&quot; or to &quot;be more accepting of conspiracy theories&quot;, but that we should dismiss &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; <em>less</em> often in a pavlovian reflex just because they are labeled &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; and are only allowed to be discussed in this sub. </p>

<p>And of course it is hand-picked, sweet cherries, a dessert for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. I don&#39;t see the criticism. A list of debunked &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; will be upvoted elsewhere. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry are you a mind reader? I&#39;m surprised at how you manage to know, with what seems like full certainty, what the OP was implying with his <em>implication</em>. His conclusion is <em>implicit</em>, which means that any reasonable interpretation of the OP&#39;s post is acceptable, given the entirety of what was included in the post. </p>

<p>I would like to think that both of our conclusions are within reason, and apply to different categories of readers: the less critical are easier swayed with these posts, and will come to accept their perceived implication (that we should be more believing of conspiracy theories) as truth. What you pointed out applies to the more critical, who will most likely interpret the post in a different manner.</p>

<p>But, yet again, I must stress that this is besides the point I was initially attempting to make, which addresses the fact that the author is using a fallacious argument to further his own agenda (his agenda being your or my interpretation of the post, or any reasonable one thereof). Whether or not we agree or disagree about the intention and implications of his post is irrelevant to the scope of my criticism--again, this is that this post is ultimately, and most likely intentionally, flawed in order to further some agenda. Bias is not only present in the media.  </p>

<p>Hence, your argument that </p>

<p>is wrong, because OPs &quot;argument&quot;, if there is one, is that some &quot;crazy conspiracy theories&quot; were eventually proven true, nothing more, nothing less. Your interpreting it as &quot;we should be more believing of conspiracy theories&quot; insinuates much more about the intentions and implications of OP than my interpretation &quot;we should not discard <em>everything</em> labeled as &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; because not few of them proved true&quot;, therefor I decided to respectfully, but decidedly, counter your argument. </p>

<p>Maybe our disagreement takes root in different approaches. Some believe everything they are told, some believe nothing anymore, and some try to inform themselves and weigh arguments for and against as best and honest as possible before they reach a (preliminary) conclusion.

<p>I just told you in my last comment that I think both of our interpretations are reasonable (&quot;I would like to think that both of our conclusions are within reason&quot;), and did not compare the two with respect to how much they account for OPs intentions and implications (because one cannot do so accurately without actually talking to the OP).

<p>You are re-iterating my exact explanation for the differences in our conclusions that I provided in my last comment, with your first category aligning with my first (&quot;the less critical&quot;) and last category aligning with my second (&quot;to inform themselves and weigh arguments for and against as best and honest as possible before they reach a (preliminary) conclusion.&quot;). I specifically went onto to assert that this is why these two interpretations are reasonable, as they most likely apply to different categories of readers. Again, it seems like you aren&#39;t reading my comment in its entirety. Your last sentence, however, summarizes nicely what my interpretation is getting at. Unfortunately, it is more likely (and I may be wrong) that the first category (&quot;the less critical&quot;) is much more abundant within the pages of reddit as well as our population. THAT is why I was trying to point out the fallacy in the OPs implicit argument--it is very subtle, and if not noticed, will lead to a rather dangerous confirmation of one&#39;s pro-consipracy views, much as you see in the comments section.  </p>

<p>We make up X conspiracy theories. Y turn out to be true. V conspiracies REALLY happen, U turn out to be true. Of U + Y, OP makes a list of Z theories that turned out true.

There are too many that are &quot;the less critical&quot;, I agree, but that problem will not be solved by <em>not</em> making posts like the one OP made or by adding, each time, also a list ten times as long of conspiracy theories that have been utterly debunked just so nobody gets any ideas. </p>

<p>Speaking of OP, he should absolutely chime in, since it is his intentions we are riddling about. <a href="/u/high-priest-of-slack">/u/high-priest-of-slack</a>, u lurkin&#39;? What&#39;s your agenda?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>THAT is why I was trying to point out the fallacy in the OPs implicit argument--it is very subtle, and if not noticed, will lead to a rather dangerous confirmation of one&#39;s pro-consipracy views, much as you see in the comments section. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is the core of our misunderstanding, it seems. What is inherently dangerous about confirming one&#39;s &quot;pro-conspiracy views&quot;, and what does that even mean? That people who believe in some conspiracies suddenly start to believe in <em>more</em> conspiracies, even those that aren&#39;t true? Don&#39;t you worry, them conspiracy theorists don&#39;t call it the rabbit hole for nothing. You start with Elvis lives and turn out suspecting that there is massive weather manipulation going on in many parts of the world. A friend of a cousin of my neighbor&#39;s aunt got 9/11. He really <em>got</em> it. It totally changed his mind on the moon landing too, you can imagine. </p>

<p>As <a href="/u/CelineHagbard">/u/CelineHagbard</a> (relevant username!) <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/39xa2l/what_are_you_telling_me_that_youre_one_of_those/cs7tks2">said</a>: an educated conspiracy theorist will see that there is a pattern in how officials, criminals etc will lie, deflect, evade, cover up and deny and from that <em>extrapolate</em> how certain other, not yet 100% Wikipedia-true true conspiracies might have played out.</p>

<p>To wrap it up: I still stand by my opinion that your argument was weak. The ratio between conspiracy theories proven wrong and conspiracy theories proven right has no significance for the evaluation of conspiracy theories about alleged conspiracies going on now, or whether OPs alleged implications or lack thereof are meaningful or the list is merely a statistical inevitability. It was a bowl of very tasty picked cherries that show how media, politicians, industrials, scientists, officials, bankers and religious leaders have conspired in the past against the interests of minorities, the public, against nations and humanity itself, OF COURSE implying, insinuating, that they <em>still</em> are up to some pretty shady shit and have not suddenly given up their scheming because they collectively found peace and love and understanding in their hearts or so - and that is why we must keep educating ourselves, even if it leads to some pretty far-out, unbelievable, spooky paranoia X-Files bullshit like that crazy scientists are trying to reprogram personalities with drugs and torture.</p>

<p>You previously stated that his argument should be taken at face-value (my inference from your comment), yet you now state that he is in fact giving off connotations. I pointed this out last time, yet you failed to address this point. I&#39;m still confused as to what your position on this is. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This rebuttal has no relevance to the point I was making when I talked about reading between the lines. I can agree with this statement, which is why I find it peculiar that you seem to think OP&#39;s original post lacks connotations. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I disagree with yours, and that is why we are having a civil, public, fair and enlightening discussion about it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that the discussion is enjoyable, but I also disagree with the fact you think you disagree with me. As explained above, we are offering interpretations of OPs post that are aligning with different categories of readers. If you must, directly rebut this point, and why you think this is NOT the case, instead of blindly asserting that my interpretation is wrong and countering with yours without explanation. Again, we have no way of knowing, as we (I assume) are defining &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; as relative to the OPs implications (both intentional or unintentional).We cannot know his intended implication of writing this post until we talk to him, and the unintentional implications are left up to our own opinion--of which, again, we both offer reasonable interpretation. So if you do not think the latter is the case, please explain why. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We make up X conspiracy theories. Y turn out to be true. Of Y, OP makes a list of Z theories that turned out true. W conspiracy theories are proven false (meaning nobody adheres to them anymore). Can we infer any statistical meaning about the veracity of conspiracy theories by comparing W, X, Y and Z statistically?
Hardly so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the contrary. We can frame this into a statistical scenario (using your variables), wherein X is the total population of conspiracy theories. We would then have two groups, true theories (Z), and false theories (W). Assuming that we have this data (or a representative sample of this population), we can conduct a z-test of proportions (see <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/math/statistics/univariate-inferential-tests/test-for-a-single-population-proportion">here</a> for a more detailed explanation of the test), where we would specify a hypothesis difference between Z and W (as a proportion) that is determined by an arbitrary threshold that we consider to be meaningful (in terms of the usefulness of conspiracy theories), and compute the z statistic to determine if the observed proportion of Z to W is statistically significant. Now, where all this comes in is in the <strong>representativeness</strong> of the sample. If we cherry pick and take a highly unrepresentative sample of X (i.e. we over-represent Z and under-represent W) we will most likely end up with significance in favour of Z. We would then erroneously conclude that Z makes up a statistically significant proportion of X, which would lead us to assert that most conspiracy theories are true. This is misleading, as if we take a more representative sample of X, we may observe a statistically significant difference in favour of W (i.e. that most conspiracy theories are false). We have no way of determining the actual proportions of Z to W unless we take a representative sample of X, which this post does NOT do. The fallacy in the post is that it nonetheless takes this cherry-picked data and presents it with an implication that the Z is a significant proportion of X. We do not know whether this is the case UNTIL we compute the above test--the ratio of Z to W could be 1:2 or 1:100, and this would significantly change the results, and what we can conclude from the results. The FALLACY is that the OP is insinuating a conclusion that is based on incomplete data. This is very similar to this case here, which should hopefully paint the scenario more objectively in the event that you are biased in favour of conspiracy theories: <a href="http://imgur.com/fIlaOY1">http://imgur.com/fIlaOY1</a>. This post suffers from the same issue. It gives Z, but no W or X, and the conclusion is left to the reader to implicitly determine.  I would guess that most people would fall for the fallacy and erroneously conclude something along the lines as &quot;men are douchebags&quot; or &quot;men are so rude&quot;, etc, etc, and confirm their bias that there indeed exists an oppressive patriarchal society. This flaw in that &quot;experiment&quot; scenario is analogous to this one, except in this case the general confirmation bias favour pro-conspiracy theory views. </p>

<p>So you do not deny the existence of this fallacy, yet you fail to consider its implications. </p>

<p>I&#39;m am not trying to account for &quot;stupid&quot; people. I am trying to point out fallacious reasoning to the <em>less</em> critical, who may not notice--<strong>everyone</strong> falls for fallacies, me included, but not everyone believes they can dry their cat in a microwave. Fallacies in language and communication are often subtle and constitutive, and as such, are very hard to pick out. I&#39;m not degrading anyone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We would then erroneously conclude that Z makes up a statistically significant proportion of X, which would lead us to assert that most conspiracy theories are true. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>OP never even mentions X, or makes any statement about X except that the propability that another subset of theories NOT YET Wikipedia-true, but will turn out to be, is &gt; 0 if Z &gt;&gt; 0. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is misleading, as if we take a more representative sample of X, we may observe a statistically significant difference in favour of W (i.e. that most conspiracy theories are false).

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, by being &gt;&gt; 0, it <em>is</em> significant. Which is why my initial objection was that it matters not whether Z/X &lt;&lt; 1, Z/X = 1 or Z/X &gt;&gt; 1, because it must be assumed that of X - (Z + W), still a portion &gt;&gt; 0 WILL one day turn out Wikipedia-true. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not know whether this is the case UNTIL we compute the above test--the ratio of Z to W could be 1:2 or 1:100, and this would significantly change the results, and what we can conclude from the results. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, as explained in my initial objection: &quot;No matter what the ratio true/false may be, 1000:1, 1:1 or 1:1000: discarding all &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; as BS is obviously, clearly wrong, intellectually dishonest and extremely dangerous, because then the conspirators just have to circulate some easily debunkable narratives to cover up their true schemes to discredit potential whistleblowers and investigators.&quot; We can just fill up X with bunk to show Z has no meaning. From the ratio Z/X no meaningful deduction can be made about the true/false of X - (Z + W), only that the number of positives is very likely to be &gt; 0 and we have to keep our thinking hats on to find out which. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FALLACY is that the OP is insinuating a conclusion that is based on incomplete data. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fallacy is yours, as I have shown, by insinuating OPs list was meant to be a significant portion of X (again, technically it is by being &gt;&gt; 0) when all it claimed was to be a sample of Z. If you find W underrepresented, it would be your job to provide a meaningful sample. Speaking strictly communication theory, you also do not take context into account: this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, not <a href="/r/askreddit">/r/askreddit</a> or <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a>. </p>

<p>As a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot; myself, I am relatively knowledgeable about confirmation bias, as I encounter it often. There is a National Geographic video of a steel beam heated in a jet fuel fire with a point load in its middle that starts to buckle and shed its weight. It led many to confirm their bias that &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; are dumb and stupid if they don&#39;t agree that that means a tall, slender, free-standing structure will inevitably collapse vertically, progressively, rapidly through and out of itself from top to bottom when its top fourth free falls on the lower three fourths. </p>

<p>So if your criticism is &quot;people with a bias towards the idea that some more conspiracy theories might turn out Wikipedia-true might have it confirmed&quot;, it misses the point and the context, as it is clearly and implicitly and by proxy directed at people who have a bias <em>against</em> the idea that any conspiracy theories in circulation today will ever turn out Wikipedia-true, which is the far more dangerous fallacy than the ones those commit who read a &quot;believe all the conspiracy theories!!!&quot; implication into OPs list. </p>

<p>We are working from different premises, it seems. I think it is wrong to chain up the strong ones so the weak ones don&#39;t get hurt, as they do sometimes, because then the strong ones cannot come to aid the weak ones if they bring themselves into trouble, as they are statistically more likely to. The list establishes a baseline for the weak ones to calibrate their less-critical beliefs to. Flat Earth? Why not, but we&#39;re not quite there yet. 9/11? Hmmmmm... Operation Northwoods is on the list, not <em>that</em> unlikely, it seems, not at all. Total Orwellian surveillance? Highly likely. Aliens? Pretty out there still, so allow me to be agnostic about this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, but you must agree that the way this small sample of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; was presented is misleading.

I think that most people will innately interpret your conclusion as the former, which is what makes it misleading.

If I was questioning whether or not the conspiracies on your list have been proven true or not, than you may have more leeway, but even then, you have no idea what proportion of my life I spend learning about world events--you have no idea who I am, what my occupation is, and what I know about conspiracies. I could have been studying conspiracies for the last 10 years. I could not have. You CANNOT tell from the limited sample that is my user history--you DO NOT have a representative sample of how I spend my time. This is precisely the issue that is plaguing your OP.</p>

<p>Please, if you want to side with <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/Akareyon">u/Akareyon</a>, let HIM do the talking. Your responses are childish and nonsensical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s OP&#39;s implicit argument in the post as I see it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>P1: People who believe in conspiracy theories are referred to as &quot;crazy&quot; by many in the general population.</p></li>
<li><p>P2: Some of these theories have eventually been proven true.</p></li>
<li><p>P3: We should not call someone &quot;crazy&quot; <em>solely</em> for believing something which is proven true.</p></li>
<li><p>C1: We should not call someone &quot;crazy&quot; solely for believing in one or more of these proven theories.</p></li>
<li><p>P4: In the past, some have been called &quot;crazy&quot; for believing some of these theories which have subsequently been proven true.</p></li>
<li><p>C2: Those people were unfairly labeled &quot;crazy&quot; if labeled so on the <em>sole</em> basis of believing one of these theories.</p></li>
<li><p>P5 (as inferred by me): Being called &quot;crazy&quot; can have a stigmatizing effect on some people, potentially causing them to not investigate or discuss conspiracy theories.</p></li>
<li><p>P6: Pointing out that people in the past have been labeled &quot;crazy&quot; for believing something later proven true can have the effect of mitigating the stigmatizing effect of the label &quot;crazy&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>C3: (My inferrence) A list of proven conspiracy theories can act as a countervailing force to the ridicule and stigma often heaped on those who would pursue conspiracy theories in general.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="/u/high-priest-of-slack">/u/high-priest-of-slack</a> would have to confirm this was his intention, but I think I&#39;ve given him a fair reading. First, I would ask if you have any disagreement with any of these premises. Then I would ask if there is any fallacy in the derivation of any of these conclusion. If not, we can proceed to your assertion of fallacious reasoning to promote an agenda.</p>

<p>You claim that &quot;It gives off the connotation that, &#39;oh look at all of these conspiracy theories that turned out to be true...let&#39;s start to believe some more,&#39;&quot; and that this is how &quot;most people will innately interpret your conclusion.&quot; This is an assertion you have made, yet have not actually demonstrated. I find your contention somewhat paternalistic and belittling, as if you can &quot;read the minds&quot; of many people whom you have never met, and need to look out for these easily swayed readers.</p>

<p>I might actually approach this from another tack, in which OP was actually responding to a fallacious implied argument floating in the ether, one that goes roughly:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>P1: Some conspiracy theories--a supposition of a conspiracy--are rightly considered to be &quot;crazy,&quot; or outside the scope of what should even be considered.</p></li>
<li><p>P2: Theory X is a conspiracy theory.</p></li>
<li><p>C: Theory X is &quot;crazy,&quot; and is therefore outside the scope of what should even be considered.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t think I need to find examples of this argument in different forms for you, but I will if necessary; it is quite prevalent. This argument can be easily classified as a &quot;Sweeping Generalization.&quot; It assumes that since many or most conspiracy theories are &quot;crazy,&quot; a premise which I would likely agree with, that any one specific conspiracy theory is &quot;crazy.&quot; What OP&#39;s implicit argument does, therefore, is to offer a counterexample to this fallacious argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firstly, thank you for actually taking the time to write your response out coherently and intelligently (I cannot say the same about the OP with what I observed during our brief exchange). </p>

<p>In regards to the list of premises and conclusions that you have laid out above, I would like to remind you that this is all that OP included in the post (excluding the actual list of true conspiracies):</p>

<p>The title: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>What, are you telling me that you&#39;re one of those crazy conspiracy theorists?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And one introductory sentence: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is just a brief list of some relatively recent conspiracy theories that were eventually proven true, that even the sanitized and propagandized Wikipedia can&#39;t dispute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are left to piece together OPs intentions using a combination of what little information we have, as well as the tone within which it was written. With this in mind, I will agree with P1 and P2, which are very clearly implied in the title and first sentence. P3 is an assumption on your end, and may or may not be true. P4 is another assumption of which no evidence is presented, so I do not have full confidence in the validity of C2 (which rests on this premise). In the case that people were labelled crazy, if at all, for believing in conspiracy theories, how do you know it was <em>solely</em> because of their belief in one or more of these proven theories? How do you know it wasn&#39;t a mix of proven and unproven theories? Or that they were labelled crazy for some other, possibly related reason? As you mention, P5 is also an inference that is very stretched (logically speaking). You have two cause and effect statements here (X--&gt;Y, Y--&gt;Z), and as such, are asserting causality twice without evidence. I am not inclined to accept this premise. P6 and C3 rest on the premises and conclusions that I am reluctant to accept, so I cannot evaluate their validity without first evaluating the validity of P4, C2, and P5. Even in the case that I assume C3 to be true, and I assume it to be your main conclusion, I would still re-iterate that the content and implications of OPs post are our of scope to my initial criticism. My initial statement only points out that the way OP represents the data is misleading and fallacious. Please see my countless exchanges with OP as well as the first user who raised a similar point to yours, for clarification.  </p>

<p>However, if you insist on inferring conclusions from the list of premises that I can accept currently (i.e. P1 and P2), I would caution you to analyze the statements in conjunction with the <strong>tone</strong> within which these two premises were delivered--in my opinion, the title as well as the introductory statement of the OP come off sarcastic and indicative of a distaste towards &quot;propagandized&quot; entities (such as Wikipedia). To me, it seems as if OP is using the list of proven conspiracy theories to sarcastically mock those who are anti-conspiracy, as if to say &quot;huh, you&#39;re calling me crazy? Well look at this list....&quot;)--this may reasonably be interpreted as a ridicule towards this anti-conspiracy group, who are &quot;<em>crazy</em> for not believing conspiracy theories when so many of them are true&quot;. Again, this is my interpretation of the premises, in <strong>conjunction</strong> with the tone of the title and the introductory sentence. The mistake you seem to be making is inferring conclusions from these premises without consulting the tone or relevant contextual factors (i.e. reading in between the lines). </p>

<p>Hopefully this clears up the first part of your post.  </p>

<blockquote>

I find your contention somewhat paternalistic and belittling, as if you can &quot;read the minds&quot; of many people whom you have never met, and need to look out for these easily swayed readers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you didn&#39;t take this statement out of context, you would realize that this is ONE of the two potential interpretations of OP I gave--the other, proposed by u/Akareyon, being that &quot; let&#39;s not dismiss them as conspiracy theories and critically think about them&quot;. This was literally a single sentence that you cut in half and inserted into your response to paint me in a negative light. Second of all, I have repeatedly stated that this was my <strong>interpretation</strong> of the situation. I do not have statistics on the proportion of Reddit reader&#39;s (or internet users) that would be categorized under the &quot;less critical&quot; category. This is because this data does not exist, and would be impossible to retrieve. I never alluded to this statement as a universal fact, and only presented it as a possible hypothesis as to what may be going on. I stated multiple times that I may be missing things, and that alternative explanations may be more accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I find your contention somewhat paternalistic and belittling, as if you can &quot;read the minds&quot; of many people whom you have never met, and need to look out for these easily swayed readers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the contrary, I don&#39;t profess to give a shit about the majority of people in our society. I am just not impressed when people willfully mislead in order to further their own cause. No, I cannot read people&#39;s mind, but I would still go so far as to stay that most people are less than critical (this is my opinion, and is based on both anecdotal and life experiences). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I might actually approach this from another tack, in which OP was actually responding to a fallacious implied argument floating in the ether, one that goes roughly:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is too much of a logical leap in your inference for me to accept, and is pure speculation, as you don&#39;t know what the OP was thinking when he made the post. Also, what &quot;ether&quot; are you referring too? I would appreciate it if you wouldn&#39;t be so vague. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>P1: Some conspiracy theories--a supposition of a conspiracy--are rightly considered to be &quot;crazy,&quot; or outside the scope of what should even be considered.
P2: Theory X is a conspiracy theory.
C: Theory X is &quot;crazy,&quot; and is therefore outside the scope of what should even be considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually I would argue that your hypothetical argument, as well as OP&#39;s post, constitute more of a &quot;hasty generalization&quot;, in which one fallaciously concludes something about a population (i.e. conspiracy theories in general) from a limited, biased, and/or unrepresentative sample (i.e. the list of true theories provided by OP, or the sample in P1 of your argument above). Hopefully you realize that I am not advocating for either side, but rather, simply pointing out that both sides will happily employ fallacious reasoning to further their cause--one to discredit conspiracy theories, and one to advocate for them. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>The number of conspiracy theories that turn out true is less important than the provable histories of conspiracies themselves. If all it took to discredit any conspiracy theorizing was to come up with hundreds of ridiculous and untrue theories, we can bet that any would-be conspirator would do so. In fact, I surmise this has happened and likely still does.</p>

<p>What these actual conspiracies do show us is a pattern of not only covert and illegal behavior within and around government entities, but a pattern of denial and obfuscation when questioned, until that point where denial becomes untenable. </p>

All I was pointing out in the original comment was that the OP is cherry picking to further his own agenda, and this makes it easier for people to fall into the whole confirmation bias problem of confirming their already pro-conspiracy theory views. I intentionally did not comment on whether OPs implied agenda was justified or not, as this was not my point. </p>

<p>Think about it this way... CIA assets are a part of a black project, they rig the building and complete their task. Their friends, family and coworkers know they are working for an intelligence agency, but do not know what they do exactly. </p>

<p>The CIA sends a hitman/hitmen out to get them and succeed. The hitmen won&#39;t say a damn word, because all he/she knows is that they have an order to neutralize a target, they do not know about what that target did and plus, they are professional killers.</p>

<p>After, the family is told they were killed over seas performing honorably on project X. They tell the coworkers that knew them, the person died overseas working on project Y.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not too hard to think about, when everything in the military/CIA/FBI/etc is so heavily compartmentalized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know how to make a nuclear bomb? That&#39;s a secret that&#39;s been pretty well kept for over 70 years.</p>

<p>Lots of people can keep a big secret for a long time, and doing so is not in the least bit unusual. Remember what you did that day when you were 7? You kept that a secret, didn&#39;t you? What about what you did with that blonde beachbabe five years ago? Are you ever going to tell anyone what you two really did?</p>

<p>Intelligence agencies want people who can keep a secret. So do organised groups of people that get together and agree to do something in secret for mutual benefit. Just because sometimes someone can&#39;t keep a secret, doesn&#39;t mean that a secret can never be kept. </p>

<p>How many hundreds, or thousands, of people kept the secrets revealed by Edward Snowden?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the secrets of how to make a nuclear bomb got out (to the Russians) just as soon as our scientists discovered them.  There were spies right inside the Manhattan project.  And yes, I DO know how to make a nuclear bomb, you can read about how to do that on the internet.</p>

<p>&quot;Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.&quot;</p>

<p>The Snowden case is a little different.  Hundreds, maybe thousands of people knew what the govt was doing.  But they all (mostly) thought it was legal and patriotic and the right thing to do and that the American people wanted them to do it.  That was their whole career, working at NSA.  And the American people have always known the govt is spying domestically, back to the days of Hoover&#39;s FBI.  What&#39;s new with Snowden is he revealed the details of how thoroughly NSA is spying on our electronic communications.  Which is important info, and was very secret.  But &quot;govt is spying on us&quot; was not a secret conspiracy.</p>

<p>And Snowden, when he revealed this conspiracy, gave us EVIDENCE.  Specifics, documents, etc.  If he had popped up with no evidence and just said &quot;they&#39;re spying on us&quot;, he would not have been such big news.  As an inside administrator who personally saw the data, he would have been far more convincing than, for example, these ex-CIA or ex-military guys who pop up and say &quot;I think 9/11 probably was an inside job&quot;.  They give neither hard evidence nor personal knowledge.</p>

These guys are all US citizens living on boats, some in Florida, some around Caribbean islands.  Some of them are normal-looking; a couple have been wild-looking bearded types who are semi-hermits.  Some were worse than others, but they all believed MANY different theories about many different events, all knew the REAL TRUTH about these events and big conspiracies etc, said most reporters and media were controlled, etc.</p>

<p>What cause do you care about <a href="/u/nyza">/u/nyza</a>? I already asked you for 3 conspiracies that you believe in and why; it doesn&#39;t sound like you care about anything other than FUTMobile, so it&#39;s no wonder why you&#39;re confused here.</p>
