<p><strong>WHY BUILDING 7?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Why was WTC 7 intentionally demolished? A very good case can be made that evidence against the corporate elite would be destroyed and could not be used against them in a court of law. The destruction of Building 7 meant the destruction of evidence. Which housed 1000’s of documents relating to numerous SEC investigations.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Ongoing SEC Investigations</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/010917nylawyerwallstreetsecfiles">SEC &amp; EEOC: Attack Delays Investigations</a></p>

<p><a href="http://911blogger.com/node/19242">SEC: No Records Whatsoever Regarding Destroyed WTC 7 Investigation Files</a></p>

<hr/>

<p>There were a series of seven actions undertaken by the Federal Reserve during the days and weeks that followed the attack on the WTC which served the purpose of covering-up the settlement and refinancing the fraudulent 10 year Durham/Brady Bonds which came due on September 11. Those actions include:</p>

<ol>
<li>the Commission for the first time invoked its emergency powers under
Securities Exchange Act Section 12(k);</li>
<li>SEC lifted “Rule 15c3-3 – Customer Protection–Reserves and Custody of Securities” which allowed them to suspend all reporting and identity security controls;</li>
<li>The SEC temporarily injected $300 Billion into the US money supply while
settling the fraudulent securities;</li>
<li>Government Securities Clearing Corporation sent a memo to banks encouraging them to make security ‘substitutions’ on “immediately maturing collateral;”</li>
<li>Government Securities Clearing Corporation treated the ‘fails’ as two separate groups, suggesting there was a large group of trades that required ‘special treatment’ for “other” problems;</li>
<li>GSCC issued another memo allowing blind broker settlements. A “blind broker” is a mechanism for inter-dealer transactions that maintains the anonymity of both parties to the trade;</li>
<li>SEC held an unusual “snap” auction of new ten-year securities to facilitate sale of government securities probably used to refinance the fraudulent Durham/Brady Bonds.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>“On that fateful day, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared a national emergency, and for the first time in U.S. history, invoked its emergency powers under Securities Exchange Act Section 12(k) easing regulatory restrictions for clearing and settling security trades for the next 15 days. These changes would allow an estimated $240 billion in covert government securities to be cleared upon maturity without the standard regulatory controls around identification of ownership.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/25/nyregion/25TOWE.html">Experts Urging Broader Inquiry in Towers’ Fall</a></p>

<p>The New York Times revealed in November 2001 that Building 7 was the location for a secret CIA office and Sensitive Compartmentalized Intelligence Facility (SCIF). SCIFs are where the most sensitive intelligence information is stored. These facilities are routinely swept for electronic listening devices. They may even have bullet proof windows, air filtration, and independent water supply. Operatives would routinely meet following a classified operation in a SCIF to debrief and identify loose ends to maintain program integrity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The SEC has not quantified the number of active cases in which substantial files were destroyed. Reuters news service and the Los Angeles Times published reports estimating them at 3,000 to 4,000. They include the agency’s major inquiry into the manner in which investment banks divvied up hot shares of initial public offerings during the high-tech boom. The EEOC said documents from about 45 active cases were missing and could not be easily retrieved from any backup system.”</p>

<p>Was it carelessness, ignorance or just oversight that NIST neglected to mention with any detail the significant build out by Salomon Brothers, which leased over 64% of the building? <strong>Was the addition of over 375 tons of steel, used to reinforce girders and create ‘a building within a building’ deemed an insignificant factor in the integrity of the building?</strong></p>

<p>From the NIST report:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Footnote 4,</p>

<p>Renovations were made in 1988 and 1989 to the space leased by Salomon Brothers Inc. in WTC 7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From a NY Times article dated February 19, 1989:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/19/realestate/commercial-property-salomon-solution-building-within-building-cost-200-million.html?src=pm">COMMERCIAL PROPERTY: The Salomon Solution; A Building Within a Building, at a Cost of $200 Million</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Before it moves into a new office tower in downtown Manhattan, Salomon Brothers, the brokerage firm, intends to spend nearly two years and more than $200 million cutting out floors, adding elevators, REINFORCING STEEL GIRDERS, upgrading power supplies and making other improvements in its million square feet of space.”</p>

<p>”We built in enough redundancy to allow entire portions of floors to be removed without affecting the building’s structural integrity, on the assumption that someone might need double-height floors,” said Larry Silverstein.</p>

<p>“More than 375 tons of steel – requiring 12 miles of welding – will be installed to reinforce floors for Salomon’s extra equipment.”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Other Suspicious Circumstances</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>Salomon Smith Barney: leased over 1 million square feet in building 7. The firm was under investigation for its stock ratings and alleged securities fraud. Settled for $400 million in 2004. (Source)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Jack Grubman, Smith Barney’s former telecom stock analyst, resigned from his position in August 2002, due to professional and personal hardship brought on by investigations into his stock ratings. Grubman maintains that he acted in line with fair dealing standards and published ratings he believed to be accurate. His ratings had a history of being highly respected and trusted by investors. However, as telecom stock values fell, his bullish ratings were accepted with growing hesitation. By the time Grubman lowered his ratings of nearly worthless stocks from “buy” to “neutral,” investors had lost millions. In one telling example, Global Crossing, which was rated at “buy” until October of 2001, went bankrupt only four months later (January, 2002). Grubman’s ratings of WorldCom also remained high during the telecom bust and were not dropped until March of 2002, just months before the company’s collapse. In April of 2003 Grubman was fined $15 million and barred from serving in the securities industry by the SEC and other regulators.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other companies given strong buy ratings included:</p>

<ul>
<li>24/7 Media</li>
<li>Adelphia Business Solutions</li>
<li>Enron</li>
<li>FLAG Telecom Holdings, Ltd.</li>
<li>Focal Communications</li>
<li>Global Crossing</li>
<li>Level 3 Communication, Inc.</li>
<li>McLeodUSA, Inc.</li>
<li>Metromedia Fibre Network International</li>
<li>Quokka Sports (Ibid)</li>
<li>Webvan</li>
<li>Williams Communication Group</li>
<li>Winstar Communications</li>
<li>WorldCom</li>
<li>XO Communications Group</li>
<li>Smith Barney Settlement</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“Global Crossing was brought public in 1998 by Smith Barney. The company, which aimed to lay global fiber-optic telecom cables, received frequent advising from Grubman. He advised Global Crossing on its purchase of Frontier Communications, its attempted takeover of US West, and its choice of Robert Annunziata as CEO. Grubman continued to publish ratings on Global Crossing stock, even though he was personally involved in the company. He has faced intense criticism and even lawsuits because he gave the company “buy” ratings, apparently out of a conflict of interest, through nearly the entire length of the its collapse. These “buy” ratings weren’t dropped until October of 2001. Shares were valued at one dollar by this time. Global Crossing declared bankruptcy in January of 2002.” (Ibid)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even more interestingly, Citigroup, which owned Smith Barney, had <strong>Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfield on its Board of Directors until January 2001. Citigroup experienced 45 times its normal trading volume in the days leading up to 911</strong>*</p>

<p>The FBI office in WT7 was investigating insider crimes within the FBI and irregularities into MF Global, World Com and Enron. JFK, Inslaw, Enron, Missing Pentagon Money, 9/11, Afghan Heroin War. Nothing new under the sun going back to before Napoleon.</p>

<p>Dont worry too much about 9/11. Yes it is bullshit. They have been doing bullshit like this for hundreds of years. If it was not this group, it would have been another group.</p>

<p>If government was not a scam for elite rule and actually served the public interest, people would just ignore it and not fight for power or influence. You have to go back to Napoleon and the propaganda they were putting out before the revolution to see how much our culture is soaked in this bullshit and for how long.</p>

<p>I have been thinking of what world without elite rule would look like and its not good. We would probably fall back into a lower level tech level and North America would look like Africa. So all the evil that has occurred was necessary to keep moving forward.</p>

<p>The problem is not even the genocidal elite, but that there are enough humans that are stupid enough to be susceptible to this kind of manipulation. Necessary evil.</p>

<p>Africa is in the state it is in because of neo-colonialism, western coups, and corrupt elites who have sold the land and resources out to western interests.</p>

<p>If you want to see what the world would look like without corrupt elites look back to the wealth, innovation, and stability of pre central bank America.</p>

<p>The evil was not necessary and has in fact kept humanity at a standstill. </p>

<p>The elites have a vested interest in co-opting or subsuming technological innovation as unfettered innovation and creativity are one of the biggest threats to their control. A good example is Tesla and others like him. His discoveries still amaze us even today. His discoveries were stolen to be used by the elites to be used mind control, secret weather modification, and geo engineering. Imagine if instead we had used his findings to be able to make it rain when we wished, to stop hurricanes and storms in their track. The world would be completely different.</p>

<p>Not only that but tesla found a way to harness the energy of the universe and would have given the world the ability to power their homes and devices for free, with no reliance on the government or the elite. That is why he had to be silent and that is why, decades later, we still rely on power grids to power our homes.</p>

<p>Another example is the robber barons of the industrial age who made their wealth through equal parts technological progress and equal parts cold bloodedness. They were a threat to the elites because they managed to amass huge sums of wealth completely out of the hands of the ruling class. You seem to have mistaken modern elites for those of earlier ages who actually did something.</p>

<p>The elites of today only hold us back.</p>

<p>To see how the elites hold us back one has to only look at the lengths they go to to keep us stupified while they rob us blind. Fluoride, the dumbing down of school, the corruption of culture and mass media. Sports, music, celebrity culture. On and on it goes.</p>

<p>In business they buy out or crush any competitors and use taxes, regulations, and laws to keep budding businesses from posing any threat.</p>

<p>That is why you have seen no innovation in medicine, energy, automotives, or any of the things that really matter, even though it is widely acknowledged that there are free sources of energy such as Tesla described with his wireless energy.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let silicon valley fool you with their useless apps and tech bubbles. Innovation is dead and the elites have killed it. The elites have done more to hold humanity back than the catholic church and you call them a necessary evil? Ha!</p>

<p>Ummm, okay, so not that...</p>

<p>How&#39;s about, the insurance paid for that building too?</p>

<p>Too needy sounding? </p>

<p>Ummm.... okay then,</p>

<p>Seeing as how the other two lots were cleared, free of charge, Silverstein figured he&#39;d get that lot cleared too, free of charge...</p>

<p>It really is a bitch getting a demolition permit to drop a building in Manhattan...</p>
