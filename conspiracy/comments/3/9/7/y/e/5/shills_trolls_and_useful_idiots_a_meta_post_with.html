       Most people are aware of trolls. Most thinking people are aware of shills, but there are so very few thinking people these days. Many thinking people are aware of useful idiots, even if they didn't know the term.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most important reason to be aware of shills and useful idiots is that we are personally more able to stay on topic and not be deceived and distracted by them. Beyond our personal clarity, it's extremely helpful to the internet community as a whole to spread awareness of these deceptive and disruptive people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trolls used to be a terrible problem in internet discussions before we spread awareness of their existence and how to deal with them. Now, they barely affect discussions because most seasoned internet users easily ignore them and stay focused on the conversation. We can deal with shills and useful idiots in the same manner, but we need to keep increasing awareness of them for this to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to give some useful definitions of these terms here, then some supporting links that demonstrate that shills truly are a huge problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Troll: Enjoys disrupting conversations purely for the fun of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shill: Someone who has a vested interest in the subject at hand, much more so than the average person, without divulging such vested interest. Examples include those specifically paid to promote an agenda (the paid shill), employees of the company/government in question, those who hold stock in the company, and those with close family members or friends who are involved. A specific example would be a cop arguing pro cop points of view in a police brutality thread or an oil industry employee making pro oil industry comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the person is outstandingly unbiased, then they're not really a shill. It's the extreme bias that makes a shill a shill, because they're not really part of the conversation, so much so that it's often obvious to those who are aware of shills. They have no interest in finding nor expressing the objective truth. They're present only to do whatever they can to sway people to their side or disrupt the conversation if it's leaning too far to the other side. They employ dishonesty, troll tactics, emotional appeals, anything they can to get people to move closer to their side.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Useful_idiot">
        Useful Idiot
       </a>
       : Someone who has bought into the narrative of the shills and their masters on a particular subject. A useful idiot willingly takes up the cause of the shills even though the useful idiot has no exceptional vested interest in the subject. They have come to believe the narrative and may have even adopted the emotional strength they've witnessed in the shills. While for the shills, this emotional strength is usually fake, purely another tool, a useful idiot may be so affected by it as to feel an emotional attachment to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Useful idiots may also be emotionally attached to their view simply because they've been arguing the same thing repeatedly. A useful idiot usually has a parrot-like mindset in that they believe that repetition is the key to victory, that ideas that are repeated often must be true, and (paradoxically) that anyone who isn't repeating the same narrative they're hearing everywhere must be an idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockpuppet_%28Internet%29">
        Sockpuppet

       is another important type of deceptive user to be aware of, suggested by

       and
       <a href="/u/Mae-Brussell-Hustler">
        /u/Mae-Brussell-Hustler
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to shills and useful idiots, the problem is not that these people exist. There will always be those who support their employers or their in-group virtually to the death. The problem is that most people are not aware of their existence, and when it's brought up, the shills and useful idiots tend to attack (or defend) viciously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of attacking shills and useful idiots for existing, we need to adopt the proven successful method of dealing with trolls: Recognize them, and don't feed them. If we see someone feeding them, just like with trolls, simply point it out and move on. Stay focused on the topic and only respond to those who are genuinely trying to contribute usefully to the discussion, regardless of which side of the discussion they're on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of us know that large corporations employ shills. Also, corrupt corporations that make their money in underhanded ways tend to attract employees who would shill for them (without being paid specifically to shill) simply because they only care about money, and want the company that's paying them to do well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's often immediately obvious when a thread has been invaded by shills, because there's a sudden influx of dramatic voting in one direction, often accompanied by a slew of comments that all say very similar things, usually in an emotional way with little to no logic nor supporting information. Of course this can happen simply from a thread making it to the front page, but in that case, it's usually a flood of useful idiots rather than shills, which is often evident in a slight qualitative difference in the comments and a slightly less one-sided pattern to the new votes being added.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following link was recently posted to reddit. The article refers to these people as trolls, but they're actually shills:
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html?_r=0">
        The Agency
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       We know that many, likely all, major governments employ similar tactics. The JIDF is a great example. Many social groups, such as SJWs, also employ purposeful deception, disruption, and censorship.

       Honest question here: do you actually think "shills" post on this subreddit? What is the ratio of shills to people who just don't agree with your/my views on certain conspiracies? As we know, being a conspiracy theorist in general is a fringe view, most people don't believe in many conspiracies, isn't it more likely that people are just disagreeing with you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think calling anyone who adamantly disagrees with a post a "shill" is damaging to this subreddit.

       I agree with this concern. Calling someone a shill without it being very obvious that they most likely a shill is just as damaging to the conversation as calling someone a troll without that same certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with practice, we can learn to identify shills just as well as we identify trolls. You don't call someone a shill just because they disagree with you. There are many notable patterns to their behavior. I've seen many people correctly (imo) call out shills. I think there's only been one time I ever even implied that someone was a shill, because usually there just isn't enough certainty to make it a good thing to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if we never called trolls, they'd still be disrupting conversations all over the internet like they used to, and like shills currently do. When I see someone call out a shill and I agree that the person is most likely a shill, I upvote the call-out and move on, staying focused on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see shills and useful idiots in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       all the time. Reddit even has many subs dedicated to shills and trolls, and some, such as
       <a href="/r/conspiritard">
        /r/conspiritard
       </a>
       , are targeted specifically at
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Useful idiots are everywhere. It's usually best to just ignore them. There's not much point in calling them out. As I pointed out in my text wall, when an
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       post makes it to the front page, it's usually useful idiots that we see bringing in the negative comments and downvoting. The ratio might be something like one to 10 shills for every 100 useful idiots in this sub, and probably closer to one in ten thousand elsewhere.

       Thanks for the reply, I'm glad we're in agreement on that first point, unfortunately, a lot of other's aren't, it seems to be used as a sort-of defense mechanism a lot of the time here.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would qualify as enough certainty to call someone a shill though? Which exact mannerisms are you speaking of? That's what I'm most curious/concerned about. How do you differentiate between a shill and someone who just vehemently disagrees with you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think trolling is a lot easier to identify than "shilling", and even then, it's hard to know with absolute certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to be completely honest, I disagree with your assessment of trolls/shills compared to regular users. I don't think it's anywhere near that high. I think we're dealing with regular people who happen to disagree with certain things posted here, I think assuming anything otherwise sort of detracts from the conversation. If you're going to engage with someone, you should attack the merits of their argument and not the person. Even if someone is a proven shill, that doesn't nullify their argument.

       Isn't that just what normal people do online sometimes? I don't see how that's indicitave of someone being paid to defend a certain view point. It's a fallacy to refer to someone as a shill without proper grounds for doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just think we should argue what we can prove, and not just be presumptuous and label someone a shill just because we perceive them as being foolish.

       If shills are not posting content on here, they at least tinker with the votes. Only about 500 people are in this sub on average. However, 300,000 people subscribe here. That means 300,000 people, if logged on to reddit, see the top post here on their front page. In reality, perhaps only 50-80 thousand actually log on and see the post, but that is a massive amount of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is one employee and some software to manipulate the votes. It might take 10 minutes total per day. That's like 7 dollars to spread propaganda to 50+ thousand people, and the employee can do the same for many other subs during their shift.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you noticed that shitposts, such as an image with misleading text, tend to be the top post here? And the top comment usually debunks the image, making 50 thousand people think conspiracy theorists are idiots. The 2nd and 3rd top posts are usually great content, but only 500 people see it!

       picking up the intent of someone is definitely subjective matter, but there are definitely strong signs to pickup... if the sliding goes peanuts to strawberry jam, i'll be less inclined to see a shill than if the sliding goes from peanuts to ww2, racism, antisemitism, feminism or what have you... It could be that the peanuts to strawberry jam is a shill, but then it's a useless shill we don't have to care about...

       <p>
        I disagree with your assessment of trolls/shills compared to regular users. I don't think it's anywhere near that high.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I didn't give a comparison to the number of regular users. I only mentioned the ratio of shills to useful idiots. In total, they generally make up a small fraction of the number of users.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing wrong with disagreements, but when the sole reason a person is disagreeing is because of a vested interest, they're a shill. When the sole reason they're disagreeing is because they believe the oft-repeated mainstream or shill perspective without ever having done their own research, they're a useful idiot.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many observable traits of shills and useful idiots. One of the first things that makes a shill or useful idiot immediately apparent is that many of them will repeat catch-phrases you hear on the news or that the shills are saying regularly. This isn't something that someone who genuinely wants to convince you of their opinion will do. They're hoping that repetition itself will win their argument for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, in the case of useful idiots, they believe what they're saying simply because they themselves have heard it so many times and they have this belief deep down that if they just keep repeating it enough, you'll come to believe it too. More often, they think that maybe you just haven't been paying attention, or you're not very smart, that you must have missed this particular catch phrase, and once you hear it enough times, you'll get on board too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you an example of clear shill behavior I've seen several times in this sub. For a long time, anytime a thread about Monsanto was posted, obvious Monsanto shills would show up. They were so bad that the account might only be a month or two old with zero comments other than a handful of pro Monsanto comments. It still happens, but it seems that either it's died down some or they're getting stealthier. Even if all we do is force them to be more subtle, that's still a win, just as it is when the trolls work harder at their craft rather than just being blatantly disruptive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another easy example is in
       <a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut">
        /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut
       </a>
       . That sub has been rising in popularity over time as police brutality has been on the rise. There are many posts there that no one in their right mind would defend, like a video of a cop beating a defenseless woman bloody because she made a snide comment to him. Yet cops link to it from
       <a href="/r/ProtectAndServe">
        /r/ProtectAndServe
       </a>
       and go in there and defend the cop's actions. You can see a clear rise in pro cop comments immediately after the thread gets linked to.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that confuses a lot of people is when someone calls out a shill, they think the person is saying they're definitely someone who gets paid to make comments. Sometimes that's true, but more often, it's like the cop example. They're someone who has a vested interest that they're not divulging, a vested interest that's so personal that they will not be swayed by reason nor evidence. As I explained above, they're not really a shill if they just happen to have some mild connection with the subject at hand and they're not overly biased, but when they have clear and obvious bias and that bias is the main determining factor for them, such as the cop who defends another cop beyond any sane line of reasoning
       <em>
        purely because he's a cop
       </em>
       , that is a shill.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Even if someone is a proven shill, that doesn't nullify their argument.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That depends highly on the quality of the shill, and even more highly on the quality of the person who is acting as a shill. If their shilling means more to them than their humanity, they likely won't post anything worth replying to. I've had a few moderately decent discussions with shills just because they were at least trying to adjust their responses to what I was saying in a moderately thoughtful way rather than just repeating the same thing over and over. More often than not though, shills make garbage comments with no reasoning nor support. They often rely on the listener having absorbed and accepted some previous premise touted by the media or other shills, premises that have not been proven, and they don't offer proof themselves.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       has a policy of encouraging these users and diluting it. It allows the sub to be dragged down to the lowest common denominator. Some users have the same copy/paste attacks on dozens of threads but are never stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attacks show up when you spread facts that are verifiable. Someone shows up and responds with some emotional bullshit to cast doubt, without making any statements. Encourage speculation, attack facts and verifiable information.

       Yes! This makes sense as it gives them a way to have much tighter control over the flow of this type of information, and the evidence certainly fits this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of the types of posts you mentioned get deleted from the main subs regardless of quality, and regardless of compliance with the sub's rules. Even when they cite a rule violation as the reason for deletion, it's usually a rule that's highly subjective, and you can easily find several posts on the sub that break the same rule to a far greater extent that were not deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, I'm starting to see more of these types of posts hitting the main subs and staying up, I think almost entirely due to dramatic increases in volume and awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also starts to negatively affect a sub, and reddit's reputation in general, when these types of posts (about government corruption, etc.) consistently end up in
       <a href="/r/undelete">
        /r/undelete
       </a>
       , so they may be responding to that by allowing a few to stay up every now and then.

       If they are breaking the rules by name calling or being abusive... using racial slurs... then by all means report them and something will be done about them.  But we aren't going to ban people because they don't agree with your theory.

       I agree with the sentiment, but they'll just switch to an alternate account. I don't think banning solves anything -- you end up playing whack-a-mole. I'm happier to just call them out, which serves to educate the audience to their pervasive presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually I'm happiest to inform them (depending on context) that they are complicit in mass-murder and ask them, wrapped in a hypothetical, what the appropriate punishment should be. I have this illusion that there's some humanity left there, and if not humanity... fear.

       There are so many reasons for corporate, social, and governmental interests to have a hand in the flow of public discussion. Sometimes the concern is valid, maybe they want to stop a campaign of disinformation started by a rival. But like most people, most of them also want to be seen in the best light always. It can get all Rashomon in a thread!

       I have a problem with the shill thing in this subreddit. A person disagreeing with you doesn't make them a shill. A person asking for evidence doesn't make them a shill. A person posting their own evidence to a claim that is opposite of yours doesn't make them a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few times I've asked, genuinely because I wanted more information, why a person believed something, or the evidence they had to backup a claim, and I was basically called a shill. I want to know how you came to the conclusion that you did. Like not getting full credit for not showing work on a math problem. Fantastic, you have an answer (which may be correct or incorrect), but how did you get it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: another problem, this post being downvoted. In what way is my post not contributing to the discussion? This pushes people away.

       .

       What do you think about Eglin Air Force Base being the

       What are you looking for? A shill that posts an image of his paycheck?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is going to admit to being a shill and the companies/governments that hire shills are not going to leave evidence behind as long as they are not mentally retarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence is this: google around and familiarize yourself with the mainstream media reporting on shills. There's tons of articles. Then ask yourself why no shills would be on the 3rd largest social media website in the US. They are obviously on reddit, again, unless these companies and governments are full of literal retards. The question we have to answer after that is whether they are on this relatively large subreddit. I'd say yes just because of the content here, at least on the top post which can be seen by tens of thousands of people.

       This is a section of another comment I just made:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll give you an example of clear shill behavior I've seen several times in this sub. For a long time, anytime a thread about Monsanto was posted, obvious Monsanto shills would show up. They were so bad that the account might only be a month or two old with zero comments other than a handful of pro Monsanto comments. It still happens, but it seems that either it's died down some or they're getting stealthier. Even if all we do is force them to be more subtle, that's still a win, just as it is when the trolls work harder at their craft rather than just being blatantly disruptive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another easy example is in
       <a href="/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut">
        /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut
       </a>
       . That sub has been rising in popularity over time as police brutality has been on the rise. There are many posts there that no one in their right mind would defend, like a video of a cop beating a defenseless woman bloody because she made a snide comment to him. Yet cops link to it from
       <a href="/r/ProtectAndServe">
        /r/ProtectAndServe
       </a>
       and go in there and defend the cop's actions. You can see a clear rise in pro cop comments immediately after the thread gets linked to.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing that confuses a lot of people is when someone calls out a shill, they think the person is saying they're definitely someone who gets paid to make comments. Sometimes that's true, but more often, it's like the cop example. They're someone who has a vested interest that they're not divulging, a vested interest that's so personal that they will not be swayed by reason nor evidence. As I explained above, they're not really a shill if they just happen to have some mild connection with the subject at hand and they're not overly biased, but when they have clear and obvious bias and that bias is the main determining factor for them, such as the cop who defends another cop beyond any sane line of reasoning purely because he's a cop, that is a shill.

       But why bother, when a post on TIL or worldnews takes the same effort, both of which have over
       <strong>
        eight million
       </strong>
       subscribers, and were a top post will be seen by maybe a million people or more? It seems simply logical: you're going to allocate your resources to where they can have the most impact. That is just not
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in the strong collective consciousness here, which doesn't have much tolerance for views contrary to its standards [translated: the hivemind here downvotes to fuck things with which it disagrees] plus the generally low reputation, sad to say, of the subreddit, and it would seem an extremely low priority target for manipulation. People may want to think otherwise, but this place doesn't matter that much.

       So you're basically saying the governments which hire shills on reddit are extremely efficient? That's contrary to popular opinion, which I guess I have to commend.

       Ok, so say government x, y, and z hire shills which frequent reddit. What is the one group of people these governments want to discredit the most? Anti-government subs, I think, would be pretty high on the list. The last thing they want is for this sub to gain any credibility whatsoever.

       Heh. I don't think they have to be extremely efficient to figure out the biggest subs. As long as they aren't the "literal retards" you mentioned, that should be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The discrediting thing is interesting. I agree that may be the most common government shill use of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , in particular by promoting some of the lunatic fringe conspiracies (whatever you may consider those to be!). But I don't see many shill accusations on those topics: it's mostly leveled at people who support the official narrative (which I do in some cases, and have been called a shill for it). This doesn't do anything much in the way of discrediting /r./conspiracy. It'd be dumb to discredit
       <a href="/r/atheism">
        /r/atheism
       </a>
       , say, by going in and arguing for the existence of God. Arguing for the official narrative here is the same thing, because not believing, to some degree, the official narrative is
       <em>
        who we are
       </em>
       .

       The problem is, how do you distinguish someone arguing for a lunatic fringe theory to discredit the sub, from someone who genuinely believes it. Because I've been around the conspiracy community long enough, since well before 9/11, to know some people believe anything. But to me, it just doesn't matter WHY someone has a viewpoint. You should always stick to debating the facts, regardless.

       I've seen this tactic resurface quite a bit recently.  It's similar to contemporary juries requiring DNA evidence to convict somebody when all the circumstantial evidence points to them being guilty.  Television and cinema display scintillating tales with black and white details that constitute the world even most supposedly well-educated people believe in.

       Wow, I knew that corporations, governments, etc. were doing things like this, but I didn't know it was this easy for
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       to manipulate the voting here. I was thinking people would at least have to put a little effort into making multiple accounts and such.

       lets be clear when someone gets called a shill here it does not automatically mean we think they are a paid professional most are just useful idiots parrots trolls repeaters zombies sheep reality deniers or sleepwalkers arguing from ignorance

       Exactly. So many people immediately become indignant when the word shill is used simply because they think it always means a person specifically paid to write comments. Every example you gave counts as a type of shill or useful idiot (which is really just an unknowing shill).
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of sheep, it's amazing how effectively this term was discolored by shills and parrots through inappropriate use and overuse. It gained popularity quickly, then was dismantled to the point that most people shun it now. It's certainly appropriate here.
