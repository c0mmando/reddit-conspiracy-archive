    <div class="md"><p>Whats even worse, is like most people in 9-5 they are wasting most of that time doing little to no constructive thought. So many people on Reddit at work. And in school children are forced to fit in the block but out for them by the stage. Drawing a picture or writing a poem are met with punishment in the era of common core. The so called schools today barely teach anything but repeating what ever told by authority. Not to mention the food they feed children, how do they expect them to think and do math after a half gallon of sugar water. The public schools are seriously fucked. The people they produce are driving us into the ground and loving every minute of it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My cousin used to be home-schooled.</p>

<p>Way ahead of everyone else in his age group, and most of his peers. Bright guy, fairly critical thinker.</p>

<p>Then personal matters ensured that his family was no longer able to do so. Sole education coming from public school.</p>

<p>Spend six to seven hours a day learning jack shit, because the teachers can&#39;t be fucked to adequately explain anything and inject their own political commentary where it is not wanted or needed.</p>

<p>Comes home tired then spends another four to five hours trying to actually learn in his own time what the teachers were supposed to teach him at school.</p>

<p>Keeps up high academic achievement. Zero social life or time for hobbies, and starts sucking in all of the politically charged social justice horseshit they feed him at school.</p>

<p>Public schools are propaganda outlets. They are not designed to teach you independent thinking - they are designed to shove mainstream approved thinking down your throat. Secular schools are usually the worst in that regard.</p>

<p>A false dichotomy on an already edge-case scenario. Why are you wasting time with these hypothetical?</p>

<p>If it were my family member who was widowed with young children, or if I were running a charity to support widows of young children, I would provide financial support and try to work with the mother and the children to provide an educational environment that was actually conducive to learning what the kids wanted to learn, probably using a Sudbury-type method. What I wouldn&#39;t do would be to demand money at the point of a gun from local property owners in order to build and staff government indoctrination prisons to lock the kids inside of, which is how our current system works.</p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TrofimLysenko.html">TrofimLysenko</a> 2015-06-09</p>
    <div class="md"><p>I told you what I would do to help someone in that situation. What would you do?</p>

<p>To be more precise, if I were in the incredibly tiny minority of people who had one or more young children and absolutely no family or friends to help support us so that I could find a way to give them the opportunities they deserve without sticking them in a government indoctrination prison, and I had no savings or life insurance to support my family (which would be a pretty big lapse in responsibility in my opinion, especially for a parent), I would likely reach out to a charitable organization whose mission was to help people like me, like the <a href="http://www.mawcharities.com/">Mothers Abandoned or Widowed charity</a>.</p>

<p>As far as the gun, you do realize that if people don&#39;t pay for these prisons, other people in silly costumes will come to their house with a gun and <strong><em>murder</em></strong> them if they fail to follow orders and pay what they &quot;owe&quot;? You get that right? That&#39;s how &quot;taxes&quot; work, and in this case most &quot;schools&quot; are paid for via &quot;property taxes&quot;, which is just a shakedown of local property owners.</p>

<p>Let me guess: you have children in school, or you are a school teacher. I bet you are not a widow though. You are obviously trying to justify your participation in this evil system. I&#39;m not going to be able to give you a pass here, sorry. I will admit that the system and the social pressure to lock up your children are seductive, especially when we must work so much more than we used to in order to pay the ever multiplying &quot;taxes&quot; that we owe.</p>

<p>That is no excuse for shitty parenting. Neglect is abuse, and sending your children to these government prisons for over ten thousand hours is at the very least neglect, and definitely abuse. Future generations will look back on us as we do on slaveowners and racists, and ask themselves how we could possible be so backwards.</p>

<p>Uh, you probably won&#39;t believe this, but it&#39;s true -- a startling number of parents would happily sign their kids entirely over to the school system if given the chance.  This isn&#39;t happening by accident.  A sickening number of parents want their kids raised by the school system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing&#39;s being DONE because people aren&#39;t DOING anything. That&#39;s why. A lot of people who might do something are clueless as to what is even going on. All they know is, their kid is at school. There are tools and information out there, but a lot of it is behind pay walls, or not easy to get a hold of. For instance this A.C Sutton title &quot;How The Order Controls Education&quot;, paperback(!) is going for around a couple thousand USD: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0914981013/ref=olp_tab_used?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;condition=used&amp;amp;qid=1433832464&amp;amp;sr=1-1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0914981013/ref=olp_tab_used?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;condition=used&amp;amp;qid=1433832464&amp;amp;sr=1-1</a></p>

<p>The &quot;good&quot; titles are systematically stolen, destroyed, mutilated or downright voted out of libraries. Decent titles that the 99%&#39;ers could get some use out of are priced out of their range, or results listings on search engines show zero results for specific requests on relevant or any real useful data. Have you noticed how search engines no longer show &quot;real&quot; results, only bullshit? We are being tricked, the education scam has been a long process and many very sophisticated people have made it their life&#39;s work to create this system. The ordinary guy doesn&#39;t want to believe that there exists a fraud put upon the American people of such a  magnitude. The media does a fine job of deluding dum-dums who can&#39;t think for themselves and believe the &quot;sneer factor&quot; aimed toward parents who DO give a shit, using time-honored tricks like ridicule and lies. I am old enough to remember the parents marching on Washington in a manifest against &quot;sex ed&quot;. Truth is- they weren&#39;t <em>against</em> sex ed, they were against sexualization of children. But the media lied and made these good people into a bunch of raging lunatic religious nuts. Ridicule DOES work. Many people are not intelligent enough to look past things nor smart enough to ask the right questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I don&#39;t think our education system is adequate or even functional, school isn&#39;t a place for belief, and it is a place to get away from any irrational or institutional beliefs carried through a family. It&#39;s a good thing that families don&#39;t heavily influence their children (at least the children that attend school and can think for themselves), frankly, some families are friggin nuts. Some of our schools may be turning into something worse though (especially in the bible belt).</p>

<p>It&#39;s likely that most schools (as long as it&#39;s a secular school) will actually challenge reinforced beliefs, not reinforce them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO the state has no business compulsorarily teaching children anything beyond reading, writing in one language and maths. They are the only skill a child needs to be taxed. The trouble is schools are prisons for children to stop them robbing cars etc they are guilty without being proven innocent, they have no rights and if they leave police will bring them back for truancy. If they do not cooperate they will be held back until they come of age. Every child should be paid the minimum wage for their time, anything less is slavery or a violation of human rights. Every child should be free to leave school and enter employment at any age of their own free will, if they can get anyone to employ them or be self employed.</p>
