        Caveat: I know about the paid Israeli internet shill/trolls.  I know about the paid Russian "perception management" teams.  I know about the US government's "active use of social media".  That's not what I'm talking about.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When a PC-loving thought policing liberal SJW disagrees with someone online, but wants to avoid having to rationally defend their beliefs, what do they say?  Usually, "it's not my job to educate you", "you're just a stupid white republican male", "you're just ignorant", etc.  Not only is it fallacious logically (it's ad hominem), but it's a crutch that allows the SJW, who's preaching to the choir, to avoid having to rationally defend their statements by trying to undermine the standing of the person who is arguing against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub, and conspiracy theorists in general, have a similar crutch: the shill accusation.  If every shill accusation on this sub were true, 30% of its members and 50% of reddit's user base would have to be shills.  Clearly that's not the case, and in reality, this is an overused buzzword that undermines the credibility of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more importantly, treating anyone who disagrees with you as if they must be an agent of some larger conspiracy, or brainwashed (because if they were truly capable of rational thought, they'd surely agree with you) is not only paranoid and delusional, but it goes against everything conspiracy theorists claim to believe in: it's anti-open dialogue, anti-free speech, anti-free exchange of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone who doesn't tow the majority line is immediately met with a chorus of "shill!", then you don't have open honest debate and dialog, you have a circle jerk echo chamber that refuses to let it's ideas be subjected to rational scrutiny and debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        If a shill wanted to sway public opinion, and they tried to do it by posting to this sub, they would be fired for incompetence.
       </strong>
       Reddit's conspiracy sub is not where shills are expending their energy.  But if you took every claim of shilling here seriously, you'd think that this sub is just a constant battle between Mossad agents and freedom fighters.  It's not.  It's a place that claims to want debate and a free exchange of ideas, but instead treats anyone who doesn't agree with the majority as if they're a poor, pitiful victim of propaganda, or a paid agent of the NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to like this sub.  Even though it's generally the same few topics getting rehashed over and over, like Alex Jones, I held out hope that maybe there'd at least be interesting commentary on some of those topics.  Instead, what I see is a bunch of people who have already made up their minds, and view anyone who disagrees with them as flawed, a victim, stupid, or intentionally lying for nefarious purposes.  It's as close to group-think as what goes on in mainstream politics, although I'm sure you'll refuse to see it that way, and it comes off as cultish.  This behavior has turned me off from this sub for good, because I know you won't change.  But just realize that you aren't open-minded if you assume that anyone who disagrees with you must be ignorant, brainwashed, or lying, just by virtue of the fact that they're disagreeing.  You may look down on SJWs for their group-think, herd mentality, and aversion to rational debate, but in this respect, you're no different.  Call them "bigots" or call them "shills", it's still just that: name-calling, and it doesn't help debate, it stifles it

       I definitely agree, I've been called a shill more times than I can count and try very hard to refrain from thinking anyone else is a shill. I'd say shills make up less than 10% of people who comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good way to see if someone is a shill is gauge their past post. You would be surprised how some users who defend Israel tend to comment on similar Posts and topics, the same goes for Russia.

      <p>
       I've been checking this subreddit out on and off for the last month or so. There are many times that I have questions about things but don't ask them because I see how people who ask questions or don't 100% agree with each other are treated around here, and it's not worth dealing with that crap to find out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say, I finally did ask a question last night and was pleasantly surprised at the results. So maybe I'm wrong. But as an outsider, this place looks incredibly intimidating to someone who's just looking to try to figure some stuff out.

       If people here really are interested in convincing others or bringing about change or whatever, many of them need to lighten up.

       neophyte to be upset that your mainstream brainwashing doesn't cut it here, and you won't be the last.

       Totally agree. Now speaking of shills, let's take the example of somebody who is spreading lies to conceal the real criminals of 9/11. They are, in fact, aiding and abetting the murder of 3,000 people, after the fact. Just like somebody who lies to the police to protect a murderer, times 3,000 -- and they're doing it for money. What should their punishment be?
      </p>
      <p>
       It'll be trivial to track these people via bank/blockchain records once this criminal system crumbles. This is a national conversation that needs to be had. I reckon there are thousands of guilty parties.

       You're one of the prime offenders, Mr. "I can smell a shill just because I said so." Look at your post history and see how many times you've used that word. How many times have you made that accusation to avoid defending or supporting your beliefs?

       Eh, I'm just tryin to help you guys out. There are going to be thousands upon thousands of very, very angry families very shortly. And we may be looking at a literal, grassroots house to house witch-hunt. Surely you've let it slip to a few buddies what you do for work, easy money chatting on the internet right? All it takes is one mistake. And that's before any sort of formal investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the hell is going to happen? I really don't know if it will be contained. And, given the supposed criminal justice courts are utterly corrupt, that doesn't leave many options.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to look out for you guys, one of the only people that is. Think
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       about what you're doing. Think about the consequences. Think about your future.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess -- thanks for asking -- is that the PR shills will get a few years in prison. I could see it swinging either way though -- anywhere from total forgiveness to the death penalty. One thing I do know: The sociopaths in charge don't give a damn about you. They may even engineer a multi-national rage of revenge just as a distraction.

       Did you even read the OP? You call anyone who disagrees with you a shill or a liar. It only detracts from your own position.

       If name calling hurts your feelings, you have some growing up to do. You're going to be called a lot worse things when you speak the truth in public.  Toughen up, or shut up. Whining doesnt help debate,  it stifles it.

       Wow.  Not only did you miss the (not at all complicated) point, but you illustrated it perfectly with your childish name-calling.  Koudos for being so lacking in self-awareness that you actually proved my point without realizing it or understanding why.

       Go cry to someone else little baby. This is a place for adult conversation, not a place to showcase your insecurities and bring attention to your victim complex. It's a mean world out there, and this isn't your safe little corner to hide in. I'm here too, this is my place too, and I don't tolerate whiners. You need to be more self-aware yourself: you are a thin-skinned idealist, and you are going to be severely disappointed when you grow up and move out of mommy's house and face reality.
