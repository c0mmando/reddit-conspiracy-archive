    <div class="md"><p>“There’s a reason education SUCKS, and it’s the same reason that it will never, ever, ever be fixed. It’s never going to get any better, don’t look for it, be happy with what you’ve got. Because the owners of this country don’t want that. I’m talking about the REAL owners, now. The REAL owners, the BIG WEALTHY business interests that control things and make all the important decisions — forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. YOU DON’T. You have no choice. You have OWNERS. They OWN YOU. They own EVERYTHING. They own all the important land, they own and control the corporations; they’ve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State houses, the City Halls; they’ve got the judges in their back pockets, and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news and information you get to hear.</p>

<p>They gotcha by the BALLS. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying — lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want — they want MORE for themselves and less for everybody else. But I’ll tell you what they don’t want. They DON’T want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that, that doesn’t help them. That’s against their interests. That’s right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they’re getting FUCKED by the system that threw them overboard 30 fuckin’ years ago. They don’t want that.</p>

<p>You know what they want? They want OBEDIENT WORKERS. OBEDIENT WORKERS. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passably accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And now they’re comin’ for your SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY. They want your fuckin’ retirement money. They want it BACK. So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. And you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it ALL from you sooner or later — ‘cuz they OWN this fuckin’ place. It’s a big CLUB. And YOU AIN’T IN IT. You and I are NOT IN the big club. By the way, it’s the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long, beating you over the in their media telling you what to believe — what to think — and what to buy. The table is tilted, folks. The game is rigged. And nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care.</p>

<p>Good honest hard-workin people — white collar, blue collar — doesn’t matter what color shirt you have on. Good honest hard-workin people CONTINUE — these are people of modest means — continue to elect these RICH COCKSUCKERS who don’t GIVE a fuck about them. They don’t give a fuck about you, they don’t GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU. THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU — AT ALL. AT ALL. AT ALL. You know? And nobody seems to notice, nobody seems to care … that’s what the owners count on, the fact that Americans will probably remain willfully ignorant of the big red, white and blue dick that’s being jammed up their assholes every day. Because the owners of this country know the truth — it’s called the American Dream … ‘cuz you have to be asleep to believe it.” ~George Carlin</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct me if i&#39;m off but i thought Clinton and Obama were the &quot;youth vote&quot; winners? American voters are a sorry mess, they are uninformed, ill-educated and easily duped. The young voters expressly more so; older, more involved (but still wrong, imho) voters can list a litany of position points, and remember history. Young voters have swayed elections but voted for the same shit, believing rhetoric alone. Few people have the balls to think/vote outside the box enough to matter much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US electorate is very polarized, with or without Hillary.  Heck, look at Congress vs Obama the last 6 years.</p>

<p>Hillary absolutely will win the D primary, no chance of losing unless she has a crippling heart attack or something.  She&#39;ll probably win the general election, since the R&#39;s seem to be bunch of scary clowns.  Maybe the R&#39;s will come up with a decent candidate; not holding my breath.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. But I see this as a good thing. The straw that broke the camomiles back. Obama might get a ton of hate. But he is still a guy. If a woman did the same thing as just the last two potus has done the would eat her alive. (Note: I don&#39;t think that is right but it&#39;s the way things work from what I have seen.)And sadly it wont be because they all have it coming but because she&#39;s a woman.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Judging from <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Rand_Paul.htm">http://www.ontheissues.org/senate/Rand_Paul.htm</a> :</p>

<p>Anyone who harps about debt and balanced-budget amendment etc, without being able to say &quot;we need to cut the military budget&quot;, is trying to have it both ways.  He has said a few things about cutting &quot;waste&quot; in the military budget; that&#39;s an attempt to imply there&#39;s some free lunch.</p>

<p>&quot;End the Federal Reserve&quot; is a pretty stupid position.  Someone has to control the currency.  Who does he propose do it ?  Congress ?  President ?  And the Fed does more than just control the currency.  He&#39;s just pandering to the angry anti-govt wing.</p>

<p>He opposes same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>He wants to cut corporate tax rate.  He&#39;s against &quot;punishing the rich&quot;.  He&#39;s a supply-side tax-cutter.</p>

<p>Seems to be a climate-change denier and &quot;drill more&quot; guy, at least in terms of his stated positions/votes on legislation.</p>

<p>He thinks we should exit the UN.</p>

<p>I like his position on &quot;stop getting into foreign wars&quot;.</p>

<p>Seems to be against healthcare reform, in favor of the &quot;free market&quot; which led to 48 million uninsured.</p>

<p>His position on immigration seems semi-reasonable, but trying to avoid an &quot;amnesty&quot; tag.</p>

<p>He supports raising Social Security retirement age, says it&#39;s a Ponzi scheme, seems to favor privatizing it ?</p>

<p>Bottom line: I disagree with most of his positions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll touch on a couple of these. </p>

<p>He can&#39;t/won&#39;t end the federal reserve. Forget about it. </p>

<p>Regarding same sex marriage: He has to say that, but he doesn&#39;t care, just like Hillary Clinton and Obama were publicly against same sex marriage until very recently because the majority of their constituency didn&#39;t support it. He won&#39;t actually do anything about it. </p>

<p>As far as climate change goes, I think this is another distracting political issue. There is nothing the US can do to stop massive carbon emissions worldwide and halt the change to our atmosphere. Nothing. I&#39;m a realist/nihilist on this. The democrat party only achieves minuscule measures in this regard (raising fleet fuel efficiency requirements) that will have no real effect on our climate but win them political points. </p>

<p>With respect to the &quot;free market&quot; leading to 48 million uninsured, what we have now is not a &quot;free market&quot; in any sense of the word. American healthcare is severely regulated in many ways that increase costs and decrease access. We need to be either more truly free market (as in allowing individuals to buy any plan they want from their insurers without the gov. stepping in) or go full nationalized health care. The latter is a long way off, so at the moment, deregulation is what would help in the near term. </p>

<p>In short, what I&#39;m saying is that the things you disagree with the man on are things he mostly has to say because of political realities, but that he won&#39;t or can&#39;t act on. What he CAN and would do as president is roll back our foreign military involvement and domestic spying programs. I don&#39;t know about you, but those are my hot button issues. </p>

<p>Much respect regardless of how you choose to vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More like people shouldn&#39;t care as much about his positions regarding things he has no power over. Let&#39;s say he was staunchly anti-abortion. It doesn&#39;t matter because the president can&#39;t overturn judicial precedent unilaterally. I mean, on the left I&#39;ve heard people say things like &quot;I know Barack is really for gay marriage&quot; or &quot;he&#39;s not really a Christian, he just has to say that.&quot; If you&#39;re willing to make those concessions for a candidate running as a Democrat, why not the same for the other side? As far as Hillary goes, I could never vote for someone as outright criminal and phony as she is. Do you think she believes anything she says for a second rather than simply stating carefully researched positions in order to attain more power? Come on now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm, I don&#39;t agree about the positions-power thing.  Sure, president doesn&#39;t make the laws.  But he/she occupies a terrific bully pulpit, has fair amount of charge over massive bureaucracy, fairly direct control over military and foreign policy, lots of power in many ways.  No, given a choice, I tend to vote based on the stated positions of a candidate.  And I don&#39;t say those things about Obama.</p>

<p>Yes, I think Hillary really believes we should have voting reform, healthcare reform, fight climate change, supports gay rights, etc.  Sure, she&#39;s a politician.  Probably no better or worse than many others in terms of &quot;phony&quot;.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;s &quot;criminal&quot;.  Republicans have been trying to get her for about 25 years now, and haven&#39;t tagged her with anything serious.</p>

<p>I think she&#39;s going to be a pretty good president.  And I do think she will win the election.</p>

<p>I disagree with some of her positions, especially on military/security/NSA/war/whistleblowers, where she&#39;s much too hard-line for me.  But so is every other electable politician these days, it seems.</p>

<p>There are many things I don&#39;t like about Hillary.  But she&#39;s going to be the D candidate, and the R&#39;s are horrifying.  The R&#39;s are pandering to the religious, beating the war drums, denying climate change, obstructing progress on anything (healthcare, Wall Street regulation, immigration reform, etc).</p>

<p>There already exists evidence of wrongdoing though...
The law states that 
1. her emails were to be done on government servers. 
2. all emails/correspondence that is related to her job are to be kept by the government. 
She broke the law right off the bat by refusing to use government servers and government email. She broke it again by keeping her server at her home without government oversight. She broke it again when she deleted emails. </p>

<p>In Clinton’s defense, we should note that it was only after Clinton left the State Department, that the National Archives issued a recommendation that government employees should avoid conducting official business on personal emails (though they noted there might be extenuating circumstances such as an emergency that require it). Additionally, in 2014, President Barack Obama signed changes to the Federal Records Act that explicitly said federal officials can only use personal email addresses if they also copy or send the emails to their official account.</p>

<p>Because these rules weren’t in effect when Clinton was in office, &quot;she was in compliance with the laws and regulations at the time,&quot; said Gary Bass, founder and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is this: No one will likely ever know what was deleted from Clinton&#39;s server. Barring one of the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department being deemed &quot;classified,&quot; <strong>it&#39;s also unlikely she will ever be found to have violated the letter of the law.</strong></p>
