        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With all the talk of Reddit censorship and social justice warriors recently I think it&#39;s a good time to talk about the big picture. In 2011 one of the biggest protests in decades took place in the United States (and eventually the world) in the form of Occupy Wallstreet. These protests were primarily orchestrated by America&#39;s Left and they gained mainstream popularity and attention in their efforts to recognize the massive class and wealth gap. </p>

<p>It was later learned that these protests did indeed shake up the nation&#39;s top earners and the government itself. The peaceful protests were monitored by the FBI and DHS and there were even documents revealed that showed plans of assassinating Occupy leaders. Even though the effect of Occupy was downplayed in the media it was clear that the US government did not take the movement lightly. </p>

<p>After Occupy had continued on for longer than anyone had anticipated there were signs of a classic strategy at play: divide and conquer. A united Left that was fighting against the world elite were starting to turn on one another. Soon we saw some of the following tactics used to fracture the left:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The rise of 90&#39;s style radical feminism. This has an immediate effect of dividing the left down the middle with gender. </p></li>
<li><p>Dividing the left with race. NBC was caught red handed manipulating 911 calls to stir &quot;white man shoots defenseless black man in cold blood&quot; sentiments with the Zimmerman debacle despite that not being the case. The concept of &quot;white privilege&quot; entered the conversation left people at odds with one another due to skin color and perceived advantages and disadvantages outside the scope of class.</p></li>
<li><p>The social justice effect. This is the hot topic currently on Reddit. Whether it can be attributed to the Tumblr generation, radicals gaining popularity with social media, or higher education pushing radical ideas its effects are clear: speech will be shut down if it doesn&#39;t meet the narrative. The narrative is a constantly changing thing that promotes acceptance of fringe groups or ideas to be immediately accepted without question. Since this could contain dozens of subgroups fighting for relevancy and acceptance the Left further pushes each other apart.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>One thing that&#39;s missing from the current conversation is the anti-elite movement of Occupy. Rather than fighting against governments and corporations holding them down, a once united Left is now fighting one another. The timing of this just so happens to be after Occupy.</p>

<p>This can&#39;t be a mere coincidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish this thread was more talked about and elaborated on. 
That the American left was purposely fractured by generated divisions implies a nexus of planners and thinkers in the political-cultural media realm. That there is a network of editors and authors and journalists knowing what strategic things to say, publicize and report is unthinkable to most. But we have to think it and we have to consider it. 
The countries news outlets release information and news stories and we must be critical of everything.</p>

<p>To me this idea of a forcibly splintered left is what I was thinking for a while now. How convenient that as soon as something threatens to organize and tear the power structure down, it immediately gets torn and destroyed. Don&#39;t talk to the anchors on cable news about it because it almost seems like they are all on some kind of memo or command. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same has to be said about the American right/libertarian movement or the tea party. Which once was a grass roots campaign( yes it was coordinated by the elites much like occupy) but was later splintered and factions into sub groups which then destroyed the overall message. </p>

<p>Which ultimately led to Ron Paul becoming a nobody overnight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some really nasty things were discussed to discredit, ruin, or even &quot;indefinitely detain&quot; specific dissidents.</p>

<p>One person in particular comes to mind (her name escapes me at the moment but I&#39;ll add it when I think of it; if it helps, I know she tirelessly covered Chelsea Manning&#39;s trial and kept a blog about it...and she was also on &quot;Breaking The Set&quot; a few times as well). She was organizing a tangential Occupy event in Manhattan at the time but specifically related to Occupy and women&#39;s rights. I don&#39;t know if it was this event that caused TPTB to contemplate certain actionsâ€” or because she was intelligent, persistent, and also, to some degree, unpredictable. But she was definitely perceived as a threat</p>

<p>In the email dump of Stratfor (I believe), there is corresponce discussing an option to concertedly disseminate rumors that she was &quot;helping terrorists&quot; in some way that merely fit within the unbelievably broad Federal statutory definition of a &quot;terrorist&quot;. Once they could establish that (even if heresay), they could have disappeared her quite .</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Her name is Alexa O&#39;Brien...<a href="http://www.uchastings.edu/news/articles/2015/04/liberty_clinic_manning_cases.php">here</a> is a recent article that talks about her.</p>

<p>She was also in the lawsuit against Obama led by Chris Hedges as the main plaintiff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt many occupiers supported a right-wing approach (eg. further loosening Wall St. regulations with hopes of trickle down benefits). Especially given the banks were bailed out by taxpayers multiple times. Typically protests are about demands...like direct redistribution via taxation (leftist) or justice for those culpable (non-partisan). </p>

<p>Can you give an example of a right-wing Occupy demand that got overshadowed, because I&#39;m having a hard time imaging what that would be. </p>

<p>If this is what you think of when you think &quot;non-left wing&quot;, then no amount of explanation will help you. You have fallen for the left right division and the far left&#39;s definition of right wing. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes that is what happened, they taxed the people then redistributed the money to the banks. That is what the protest was against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Occupy was too vague a name. Media ate up the dumbs who couldn&#39;t articulate why they were there, save &quot;99% vs 1%.&quot; A name that casts the movement as exclusively economic wouldn&#39;t be so prone to gender/racial/social hysterics. I don&#39;t know what that name would be, though. Wealth Equality Now? Not so spiffy...</p>

...Throw in some footage of cops needlessly pepper-spraying/hosing protesters, and the media conversation will be completely removed from protesters&#39; original intent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am saying the exact thing you are: it was purposely fractured by the world elite. They saw that the left was united and these ideas were introduced to break them apart. The right wingers never got on board with Occupy and they sure haven&#39;t protested en masse to such a degree either.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re in the middle of the aftermath where those same people who united are in the middle of a wave of infighting. </p>
