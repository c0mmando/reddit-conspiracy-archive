       Everyone is very upset/excited about these subs being banned so you're welcome to discuss it all here in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately the massive volume of posts about the exact same thing has made
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       unusable for its regular users, so we are going to be removing all the FPH posts and we will leave this sticky here until its no longer necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one of you FPH8ers want to write up a huge synopsis that you feel covers this situation better than this sticky, COPY MY TITLE and I'll replace this sticky with yours.

       No one it's a spite campaign by plebbit shills and/or I suspect that the guilding system itself may be nothing but a front at this point and most guilding is just some money funneling operation by some umbrella corp owned by plebbit, and it just auto guilds anyone saying to stop buying reddit gold (test).

       I don't understand the consumer-side benefit to reddit gold.

       I mean, I get it enriches Conde-Naste and allows a level of propaganda management, but from a user level reddit gold is pointless because RES exists.

       It is absolutely fascinating watching the paranoid delusions run rampant inside your skulls, each new delusion amplifying the ones before it. If anything you don't like happens, it's proof of a vast plot to destroy freedom. Your world must be very interesting.

       It's not someONE, it's many people. There are far more people on reddit who support the banning of FPH than oppose it. And those people tend to be very amused by the meltdown among the far-right, pro-hate crowd. And they are openly mocking people they find detestable by giving them gold at the very point when they are advocating a boycott.

       it would also encourage people to buy gold.. maybe they are automatically guilding people to try and encourage people to buy gold as a funny joke type thing?

       No one it's a spite campaign by plebbit shills and/or I suspect that the guilding system itself may be nothing but a front at this point and most guilding is just some money funneling operation by some umbrella corp owned by plebbit, and it just auto guilds anyone saying to stop buying reddit gold (test).

       Yea it's happening all over the place in the past 2 days. Admins have the power to guild anyone at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the admins guild all the posts urging redditors to stop buying gold and start using adblock then it might catch on as a joke. Then the admins can stop giving it away for free and start raking in "lol so ironic" money

       It really isn't that simple, I think that's a cop out.  I will stay here, and voice how I think this is a bad idea and ruin reddit, and when it comes to the point that I don't care for reddit anymore, I'll just stop using it, and so will everyone else.  They're looking to sacrifice everything they had to change the business model to make this more profitable.  That's great.  But when you need to go against the very basis reddit was founded on, open discussion, you're basically killing your very own model and seeing what brainless retards are going to stick around to make you somewhat of a profit (which advertisers will quickly learn are the same doofy people that regurgitate everything that is spoon fed to them over and over).  I actually believe that a "safe space" is in violation of the 1st Amendment, but with the internet, no one wants to address how the Constitution should apply, and they're redefining what it means to redefine what they are "legally" allowed to do.  Slavery was legal at one time.  They just aim to make everything that they're doing their right, even though their "right" is openly violating millions of our rights.  This is what happens when falsely Corporations are deemed people, which is hugely Unconstitutional to begin with.

       Hate to be a cynic, but would Ellen Pao stepping down really mean much? If the lot of you arguing she is a plant are right, wouldn't they just put in a different plant? Are we all falling for the 'throw someone under the bus' gambit? A face to distract us from the fact the problems are obviously systemic?  Like it or not, we need a new reddit.  Voat isn't picking up steam quite fast enough sadly. And it is also centralized, so one day it could go the same way anyway. We're all just waiting a real alternative.

       So I guess I'll post this here. After r/neofag was removed the admins banned my sub
       <a href="/r/neoGAFInAction">
        /r/neoGAFInAction
       </a>
       . The only similarity between the two subs was that they were both critical of anti-gamergate and SJW haven forum neogaf.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely no rules were broken, hell,  I even setup an automoderator removing direct links to reddit and neogaf. Oh and btw, the sub was ~6 months old so they don't even have the excuse that I'm an alternative account that just created it to resurrect neofag.

       <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">
        /r/fatpeoplehate

       banning, but I guess I'll post it one more time since this is the mega thread.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why have years and years of this insidiously increasing censorship gone by without a single viable alternative website to Reddit gaining ground? I've heard of criticalthought.me and the quality of the content there really reminds me of Reddit's very early days, but it doesn't seem to have many users. Can we please all migrate there?
       </p>
       <p>
        Reddit has nothing to offer us anyway, we're the ones supplying all of the content. And censorship aside, the quality of discussion that most of reddit's users are even capable of having has plummeted to rock-bottom. I for one am really sick and tired of trying to talk to people seriously about serious world problems and getting nothing but stupid jokes, knee-jerk reactions, and butthurt in response. I remember when Digg entered the same phase reddit has been in for at least 7 years now, the only difference is everyone switched to reddit within one year when Digg's quality plummeted, most within the first half year. So what the actual fuck is going on here?

        It's like classic abusive relationship syndrome where we're not leaving even though we're being stomped all over. Can we please all organize and collectively say "FUCK YOU" to reddit and just be done with it? Like I said the only content that's here is what we provide, the only discussion that takes place is what we start, we can turn absolutely any part of the internet into that. We really don't need reddit, at all. Especially now that it's doing nothing but getting in the way of the content and type of discussion that most of it's users actually want .
       </p>
       <p>
        I wouldn't have posted this on any other subreddit,
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        is honestly one of the last places on reddit where users actually keep a critical mind about them. Hope you guys can hear me out.

       It does seem odd to me that the reddit software is open source and over the years people haven't established topic-focused sites using the same software.  I figured something like the Gamergate would have inspired people to at least have a second site with different management/owners.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also ponder the death of Usenet - here you had a peer to per protocol.  Why did people give that up? I mean I can understand that people didn't want to use special software - but why do people give up so easily on deep and serious conversations without corporate control?
      </p>
      <p>
       People criticize spelling mistakes - but not low signal to noise ratios.  I mean I understand it isn't unique to the Internet, what I don't understand is why people find it so difficult to recognize and change.  it really isn't that hard to fund a few people to setup an alternate reddit.  A lot of the hard work of the software was already completed!

       It really is
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       bizarre to me, mainly because Reddit's original rise was centered around Digg's userbase recognizing how the corporate control was hindering serious conversation there. That was the need Reddit capitalized on (the need for a space for serious discussion), and now
       <em>
        it's
       </em>
       users are facing the same need but acting like they can't do anything. Like you said it'd be so easy to create an alternate reddit, and reddit itself was nothing but an alternate digg in it's inception, it really makes no sense to me how long an alternate is taking to gain ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Blaming Ellen Pao is ultimate defeatism. Blaming Pao is like acting like she's the only one that can do anything about it, as if we don't all willingly choose to go to reddit instead of a different site.

       Not that the following text should dissuade anyone seriously considering a change, but let's say an alternative website to Reddit is created and becomes a huge success. Everyone migrates to the new site and Reddit is forgotten by many, now completely irrelevant. Now based on what I've learned, would you say that that new site will also eventually end up like Reddit? To the point of having to create yet
       <em>
        another
       </em>
       website to replace the site that replaced Reddit?

       So, I goggled 'neogaf' because I have never heard of it, and if I read it correctly it's about discussing video games? Unless there is more to it, what about it did the admins feel that it deserved to be banned? I mean, with FPH, I can kinda understand. But a sub about video games? I'm confused. Please forgive my ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Oh, and FYI, I in no way support or agree with the banning of FPH. Yeah, the users of that sub hurt a lot of fee-fees, but they could have easily just avoided and ignored that sub and its users.)

       I really wonder if the banning of the larger FPH was in some ways meant as a misdirection to draw attention away from banning the Neogaf related subreddits. Not that I agree with their justifications whatsoever, but they may have thought they had 'better reasons' for removing FPH than they would for the Neogaf stuff. Removing only the Neogaf stuff would expose them much more as taking a specific 'side'.

       Considering whats "legal" is always changing, I think its safe to say someone is choosing what "free speech" is since changing is it's constant. When i say pretty open free speech, it means with exceptions just like your legal exceptions.

       At the end of the day, reddit has the right to decide what it wants on its website, so on that principle alone I can harbor no disagreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply take issue with the soundness of such a management decision and conclude that reddit's time in the sun of boisterous discourse is over. This would not be such a big deal if such a trend wasn't happening in so many other venues these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoyed reddit, warts and all, it was a voluntary relationship. I could choose to avoid participating in conversations I did not like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could either surround myself with people who shared my opinions, or rush headlong into the entrenched debates with those who disagreed with me; all this was my prerogative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit's job was to keep blatant criminal activity out of the equation while giving people a forum for open discussions and comparative exchanges of life experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this naive policy shift will only bring with it an inevitable arbitrariness due to the nature of the politics involved. The contentious lines will quickly blur as ridiculous disputes and squabbles break out over nearly every conceivable slight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shifting sands of intolerance and tacit approval will create a chilling effect as the echo chamber solidifies into an irrelevant mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not envy reddit admins, but they will serve as the midwives to the birth of a lumbering monster.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit can not be a champion for the free flow of ideas while simultaneously abolishing specific ideas and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, reddit management will try, but they will fail and reddit will probably be in decline long before this "experiment" is over.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drops that fill the "bucket" will also drain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       MySpace and Digg should serve as good examples of how management decisions (or lack thereof) can kill off or retard the existence of once great things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, my personal tipping point has been reached and I will be deleting my account.

       Whether your stats are correct or not, I do not know. But I can tell just by looking at Reddit that the meltdown, the hysterical reaction, is limited to a small handful of far-right redditors. The rest of Reddit is more or less carrying on as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       And outside of reddit, this story is barely a blip on the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because the OP of this thread can't stop thinking about how freedom is being crushed by Chairman Whatever-her-name-is doesn't mean it's "a distraction," let alone a deliberate, planned distraction, from TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just face it: OP is one of those people who declares a conspiracy as a way of not facing reality. He's the kind of person who invents a conspiracy any time anything happens that he doesn't like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mad killer shoots up a school? 2nd Amendment fanatics don't want to face the fact that sometimes bad shit happens with guns. So it's easier to say "it's a plot by the government."
      </p>
      <p>
       FPH gets banned? It's a planned distraction from TPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       People start openly mocking the pro-FPH crowd by gilding them? The entire system of Reddit gold is a controlled conspiracy used to subvert dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's a problem. You have no proof. Of any of these theories. If you want to invent a conspiracy theory to protect your feelings, that's fine. But don't expect others to believe it unless you have evidence -- or unless they share your particular obsessions and fears.

       That data shows all mentions of reddit since 2004.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to see how much Reddit was mentioned on the internet in the past 7 days, go here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=reddit&amp;amp;date=today%207-d&amp;amp;cmpt=q&amp;amp;tz=">
        https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=reddit&amp;amp;date=today%207-d&amp;amp;cmpt=q&amp;amp;tz=
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see that it's lower this week that it was last week. So, sure, there are some articles about it this week, but there were other articles last week. The total volume of reddit mentions on the internet, however, has not increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the particular obsession of a very small group of very right wing people who are convinced they are aware of a giant, global plot to crush liberty, and they see almost everything that happens as part of that plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you know as well as I do that it's delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: The data does not include June 11 -- today. It may be that if we look at this tomorrow, we'll see a bump from today's activity.

       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       will probably be safe. People usually write this subreddit off as little more than tinfoil hat quackery, so I don't think it's taken seriously enough for anyone to ban it. Sure, there's a lot of anti-corporate content and discussion, but when people think "conspiracy," they think "reptilian jew illuminati." I don't think
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       seem mature enough not to do that kind of thing, which

       probably get a subreddit like this banned in the current climate of Reddit.

       Being obese has an effect on other people though. Healthcare costs increase. A fat person and I pay the same premiums but they spend more time and money getting care. How do you think insurance companies recoup that cost? By increasing premiums. Furthermore, everything we do (or abuse) as individuals effects other people. There's restrictions on everything. I don't agree with it but that's what society has decided. New York banned sodas over a certain size. Why? Because people can't control themselves and over-indulge. And now I can't buy an extra large soda because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: To be clear: I don't care what other people do either. But society does. And therefore it effects me. So I end up caring.

       "Among the 1905 birth cohort,
       <strong>
        those who were grandsons of Överkalix boys who had experienced a “feast” season when they were just pre-puberty—a time when sperm cells are maturing—died on average six years earlier than the grandsons of Överkalix boys who had been exposed to a famine season during the same pre-puberty window, and often of diabetes.
       </strong>
       When a statistical model controlled for socioeconomic factors, the difference in lifespan became 32 years, all dependent simply on whether a boy’s grandfather had experienced one single season of starvation or gluttony just before puberty. It appeared that Överkalix grandfathers were somehow passing down brief but important childhood experiences to their grandsons. Bygren knew that such a suggestion would be received by some of his peers as scientific treason. DNA sequences are passed down, experiences, after all, are supposed to die with the individual. Still, the longevity findings in Överkalix were so consistent and pronounced that Bygren and two colleagues began submitting them to scientific journals. But it would be over a decade before the report appeared."
      </p>
      <p>
       "In 2000, with his work still unpublished, Bygren contacted Marcus Pembrey, a clinical geneticist at the Institute of Child Health in London, and told him about the Överkalix data. Bygren had read Pembrey’s work on children who were missing part of the DNA sequence from chromosome 15. The baffling aspect was not that the DNA deletion caused a disease, but that which disease each child had depended on whether the DNA was missing from the chromosome 15 that came from the father, or the chromosome 15 that came from the mother.
       <strong>
        If the DNA deletion was inherited from the father, the child had Prader-Willi syndrome, which causes insatiable hunger and leads to extreme obesity.
       </strong>
       But if the identical DNA sequence deletion was inherited from the mother, it conferred Angelman syndrome, a severe mental impairment that leaves children unable to speak and with herky-jerky movement patterns. Somehow, the DNA deletion on chromosome 15 had a record of whether it came from mother or father. There was no difference in the DNA sequence at all, so something else—some memory of where the chromosome had been—was getting passed down. As with the Överkalix data, it appeared that something other than DNA was actually moving between generations."

       It doesn't take common sense (well apparently it does) to realize obesity causes heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, infertility, etc. Couple that with decreased physical activity and health care costs sky rocket. Obesity had been known to cause a 50% increase in cancer rates.

       But yeah you're right, obesity probably doesn't cause health care costs to increase.

       Clearly you read nothing that I listed as reason not to hate fat people.
      </p>
      <p>
       being poor is the biggest cause of heart disease, HBP, high cholesterol, cancers, mental disease, and obesity etc. I know as a fact a box of mac and cheese is cheaper than a bag of regular non organic apples.  But you don't see hate being promoted towards being poor.  Why? because it's socially unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then on the other hand you have science showing that fat is a symptom of a disease.

       I think you're trying excuse obesity. I don't care about the causes of obesity. I know plenty of poor and uneducated people that are not obese.
      </p>
      <p>
       My original point was that I don't care if someone chooses to be fat (and yes they choose it, ask any former fat person. It's a lifestyle choose). But the fact that it does effect me (because insurance premiums go up and isn't influenced by weight or physical activity) leads me to have some care in the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've derailed the conversation in an attempt to excuse obesity. I don't care what the cause is, but it does effect me. Whether I live in new York and can no longer buy a large soda or because my insurance premiums are higher, it has some effect on my life.

       Since you are using "well fat people raise my insurance rates" excuse to justify shitty human behavior. Do you think the same for teenage boys and car insurance? If it wasn't for all the dumbass behavior of teenage boys and their cars your rates wouldn't have been so high while you were in that age bracket! of course you don't hate them nor do you understand hatred towards them .
      </p>
      <p>
       I am trying to impart a humanistic view of a fat person. It seems to me you are trying to excuse abhorrent behavior. "It's ok to hate as long as the group is popular to hate on." "I hate so and so because of the way they look. "(you don't hate people eating unhealthy if they are thin). Most Americans are incredibly ignorant and either ignorant of their ignorance or proud of it. Many assume it's a lifestyle choice ignoring genetic facts, and socio-economic class issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are just seeking ways to justify the hatred. Society will reap what it sows. I didn't derail the conversation. I simply showed you information in hopes it would appeal to your human side. It is clear you value your ego more than anything else. Just like the haters.

       No, they pay higher premiums because they're higher risk. I paid $400+/month when I was 17-20ish. Fat people do not, even though they're higher risk. Good try though.

       It's absolutely amazing how you conclude that I hate fat people. Where did I ever say that? I simply said I don't care if someone is fat, but their lifestyle choices do have some impact on me.

       Hey. You know why FPH and the other seemingly random subs got banned? Because like it said in the announcement that everyone downvoted like angry little children, they harassed people/other subs/users, vote brigaded, and mod teams did nothing to try to stop it. You know why disgusting shit like /cuteabortions and /coontown werent? Because they didn't do that. They kept their horribly offensive shit in their own subs. So I guess you could say actions were banned, not ideas. Aka literally the opposite of "omg sjws censoring my free speech!"

       Oh my god how are you idiots missing why they were all banned? Many moderators of "curvy" subs have come forward and said publicly how much harassment they received and people in their subs did as well. Mostly by redditors from
       <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">
        /r/fatpeoplehate
       </a>
       and similar subreddits. They are NOT banning ideas, they are banning the harassment and bullying that those ideas have created. I was once part of fatpeoplehate, but when I realized all the brigading and bullying that was going on I unsubbed. Reddit.com is not the government and they have every right to do this.

       I understand that reddit is a company with the right to do what it wants to with its boards. It should have that right.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main point is well, immature as it may sound, I feel a little betrayed. I came to reddit and I wrongly thought that this was a place that was more for the fans and not for the profit. I wouldn't mind if Tumblr started censoring things because they never really advertised themselves as a free speech place. Reddit did.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a case to be made that reddit is also getting genuinely worse, or the quality of the site is going down. Every day there are more people on here and every day the general demographic of reddit gets farther away from reddit and closer to the general population.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing about free speech in this case is, while there is no legal or legitimate infringement on free speech, I felt as if I was led on into thinking reddit is where you can say anything. I thought that this was a place for "unlimited speech". I'm not saying people have to like something I say, I just felt for some reason as if there was some sort of social agreement between me and the site that unpopular opinions wouldn't be removed or deleted by force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is in my opinion about to take a steep turn for the worst. This place will go through a transformation comparable to when, long ago, /b/ stopped being an anime board and started being an everything board, and now it's full of shitposts and only that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Changing the culture of reddit to match everything that's not reddit only takes away its identity as a community. The only thing it seems they traded for profits was their integrity.

       I am personally glad it was deleted. I understand why people are upset, and the claims that it is infringing upon freedom of speech. However, they're just spewing hate. Harassment. Bullying. I find it disgusting and I think that reddit is a better place without that bullshit. And I'm not even fat. I was as a kid, but I'm not anymore. And even if I was? It's not anyone's FUCKING BUSINESS. Those people's incredibly cruel, judgmental, and cocky as fuck character (as self-proclaimed shitlords) is way worse than any fat person. Being overweight generally isn't a character flaw. The overweight/obese people I have met that were shitty people, it had nothing to do with their fucking outsides. It has to do with their insides. I agree that if someone is obese or overweight, and it isn't because of a health issue, they should make an effort to take charge of their health, but it's not always that simple. Especially in a society where the easiest and cheapest food is incredibly unhealthy, and there is little to no education about actual nutrition and obesity, and what causes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know someone personally who was posted on FPH recently MULTIPLE times. They targeted her on instagram, tumblr, youtube, and apparently even her public Facebook. I don't think that's okay, at all. This girl has a history of suicidal thoughts and impulses, and I was genuinely worried for her life when all of that went down, I was worried she would do something to hurt herself. I know that if it were me, back in middle school when I was chubby, I would have definitely wanted to die, especially after all the years of being ridiculed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, I get the bigger picture of why it's an issue. But I'm glad it's gone.

       FPH was an SJW trap, you were being led by the fat cunts you hated. Can any of you prove that the mods were who you thought they were? or did all you know about them come from what they told you on the INTERNET (cause no one lies on the internet)
      </p>
      <p>
       You dumb fucks walked right into the SJWs web and now they've got a million pieces of evidence that people on the internet are misogynistic harassers.

       You just fucked up the whole fight against them by being selfish little children.

       No Flytape, have you considered the opposite? Let FPH take over

        /r/conspiracy

       .. The admins will then be forced to delete

       as well..

       on top of this ongoing disaster, could be the best thing to ever happen to this subreddit. It could be the one-two punch that finally takes down this rotten site. Let's admit it, the administration here is a problem, and will continue to be a problem.

       I wasn't subscribed, I would have been banned for being a white knight. I did look through the top posts, it was a train wreck I couldn't stop watching. There wasn't much intellectual conversation, mostly crude, low brow insults and a circle jerk that produced chafing hands.
      </p>

       The hate was brewing and manifesting. 150k subscribers is 149k too many. I don't get off on shaming other people. I stick up for what I think is right and sorry, I don't like people putting other people down for petty shit. Some of you sick fucks are crazy and need to separated from each other.

       The problem here is that you are imposing your own views onto what
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       should be in the first place. On a site like Reddit there's millions of different viewpoints that think 'oh, x needs to be like this! That'll make it better!' when in actuality in only gets better
       <em>
        for you
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I think the proper response should have been to remove
       <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">
        /r/fatpeoplehate
       </a>
       from
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       just like
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is. Then peeps who don't want to see it won't and the shitlords still get their little corner to play in.

       Didn't I say they should have not been featured on All already? Problem is they couldn't stay in their little corner. They branched out to feed the hate beast. Reddit made the right call. I'm voicing my opinion, I don't care if you agree or not. It sucks that conspiracy has contracted some of the FPH scum. I hope it washes away soon.

       Does anyone else see this move of consolidation favoring reddit? Now we have one thread instead of 40? It reduces the impact of what people are up voting. It's just more FPH scrubbed under the guise of cleaning up the sub. Why not let the votes do the work of clearing space? When subscribers get tired of seeing tons of FPH here they will stop voting it up. By deleting all the threads and doing us the favor of cleaning up the sub, you're doing just what reddit wants, removing material. What's more impactful, 8 posts in the Frontpage on one subject or a single sticky?

       Real users hang out in the new queue, not /all. /all is as unusable as /new right now, but I don't really care about it, I care about the feed.

      <p>
       At least with the condensation, /new was legible again. But it looks like the mods have changed their minds as /all is back to being full of gamed threads and the modlogs show Flytape unstickied this thread from the front page and AATA unmarked-as-spam the gamed FPH threads.

       It wont, but my point was that it made more of a difference than an article about lead noodles and building 7. Conspiracy is probably one of the last free spaces on reddit where mods are pretty rational, if for a few days all of conspiracy was blacked out with "this censorship is shit", you're right, nothing else would get though, it wouldn't add to conspiracy, but it would give conspiracy a chance to walk the walk. To say, fuck this shit is annoying and clogging the shit out of our sub, but it's the will of the people and we will allow the will of the people even of it isn't what's optimal for conspiracy. Eventually FPH dies out and we're left with conspiracy the way it was before FPH shit all over the sub. It's less about letting the sub get polluted in this instance and more about the standing by the overall value that users determine where stuff comes out on the front page. If you browse new, sure, you're having a bad time with all the crap, but that, in my opinion, is worth it for the overall message it sends, basically, r/conspiracy doesn't interfere with posts just because they are annoying.

       I get what you're saying. At surface level, fuck, this is childish and annoying and ruins the sub. But somewhere in there it gave conspiracy a chance to be the sub that didn't interfere. Just let it play out.

       Agreed. The point here was that this was a flash in a frying pan, let the shit posts role in for 36 hours or 72 hours. Conspiracy will be the same conspiracy the other 362 days a year. The thing that bummed me out was that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       behaved just like a mainstream sub, deleting content and doing it under the guise that it was for our own benefit. Who's the joke really on when conspiracy is just as manipulated as r/pics or something similar.  We're sitting here holding r/conspiracy in such high esteem for being free thinking and against the grain, but when shit hit the fan, r/conspiracy fell into line with the rest of 'em.

       Would you belive I'm a regular here just posting under a different name since I knew this wouldn't go over well. I'd rather see 40 posts of shit for 3 days and let it die out on its own accord, than see mod intervention. It's just another form of reddit manipulation.

       Why would you man a sockpuppet for this comment? We disagree with each other all the time here, there's a lot of no harm, no foul.

       The sock puppet was to keep drama separate from a name I like to use in other subs. Didn't really mean anything because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that 3 days worth of the sub being full, top to bottom bitching about this censorship is worth missing some of the other stuff that is posted. Again let users vote the cream to the top. If something is super meaningful it will get voted up through the sludge of censorship posts. Mods deleting everything and putting it all into one posts lessens the visibility of disgust.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the police setting up designated "protest areas". How meaningful is a protest if it is structured to the request of those you're protesting against?

       Right, but when people post the same story over and over, they often get the repeated thread removed so that conversation can continue on the primary thread and so it can be upvoted.

       100 posts with "stop buying reddit gold" in the title and no content are shit posts - we only need one.

       Fatpeoplehate was definitely not my favorite subreddit, but what Pao did was fucked up; HOWEVER, screwing up r/conspiracy's front page is not cool. I'm sorry but banning a subreddit is not as important as lead being found in a popular food source in India, the regressive policies of TPP, or how Israel is blowing up dirty b0mbs.

       Considering whats "legal" is always changing, I think its safe to say someone is choosing what "free speech" is since changing is it's constant. When i say pretty open free speech, it means with exceptions just like your legal exceptions.

       Why not? You don't really need that many people. Just a beginning pranker, and then copycats. There doesn't need to be a conspiracy abut this you know.
