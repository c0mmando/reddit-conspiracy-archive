    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. People are bitching about it like it&#39;s some huge deal. If they don&#39;t want hateful places on Reddit, fine. It&#39;s not like they are literally taking away our right to free speech. Let&#39;s refocus on the real problems outside of Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bigger picture...hello. Boiling a frog starts with cold water [in this case &#39;unimportant&#39; reddit subs], then it moves on to ban more and more...
Better to nip it in the bud [or at least see through their long-term plans]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that perfectly.. but this is reddit. I&#39;m more concerned with actual important censorship and shifting focus back on that rather than letting people explode about a website. They want to distract you and they are succeeding, I was voicing my opinion to try to get people to realize that and to focus on the real problems again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a real problem. The tip of an iceberg that looks all small and stupid. Heck it&#39;s only one sub and it&#39;s full of hate anyway, right?
If you dive a little further, you&#39;ll see that it is merely a small part of a huge problem. You will hear more and more subs being closed for a variety of [seemingly &#39;caring&#39;] reasons. Then it is websites that are &#39;nasty&#39;. In the end we are left with only &#39;officially allowed&#39; sites you&#39;ll eventually have to pay for.
Not everyone can see that. What everyone understands is when their &#39;favourite&#39; sub suddenly gets eliminated. 
I think it is important that we make a fuss, even if it is &#39;only&#39; FPH. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I halfway agree. We still need to talk about the elephant in the room (no pun intended). Blatant from the hip censorship of whatever people feel needs to be banned. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t what reddit was founded on. Someone wanted to monetize reddit. It started with Yishan and the ramping up of hiring at reddit. Hell I even thought of wanting to work there with the uptick in new roles being offered. </p>

<p>For whatever reason, he parted ways and reddit put someone in charge to carry the torch. Pao now has the responsibility to make money for reddit. Whether Yishan took the wrong approach or wasn&#39;t happy banning subs to make it more lucrative to advertisers is the other topic people aren&#39;t mentioning. </p>

<p>Stepping on expression of speech in whatever form was on reddit, is something reddit better explain in an open forum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its great awareness to show how pollute imgur and reddit have become with corporate interest. They are doing a wonderful demonstration of internet rebellion using their system against them. If it continues for a week itll be glorious as reddit will lose revenue, be marked as censoring and lose some of its sjw members. Let~s push them out</p>
