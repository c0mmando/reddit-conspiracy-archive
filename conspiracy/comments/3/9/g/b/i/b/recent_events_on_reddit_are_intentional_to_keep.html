    <div class="md"><p><a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> recently started getting popular enough to make it to the front of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> about twice a day. Which caused reddit to get negative attention.</p>

<p>Imgur also recently decided, as a way to make their site more appealing, to stop letting NSFW posts and posts from <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> being visible on their front page. In response <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> put up a picture of members of imgur staff(from the imgur about page) on their sidebar to show that some of them are overweight. </p>

<p>The subreddit was then banned for &quot;harassment of individuals&quot;. A lot of people took that to mean that it was being censored for hurting the feelings of over weight people. So when 150k people think they&#39;ve just been censored there will be quite a few that attempt to fight back by posting as much of their content as possible. </p>

<p>Replacement subreddits were banned which caused more replacements. People believed the replacements were being banned for their ideas and not their actions. Large groups of people are also being shadowbanned. There was an entire thread of people shadow banned because Ellen Pao didn&#39;t post something correctly, and everyone who commented just ended up getting banned.</p>

<p>No. Stop spreading this please. Imgur only removed posts that were published to imgur&#39;s community. If something is published to Imgur&#39;s community is downvoted/reported enough times it is automatically removed. Uploading WITHOUT publishing will not get removed no matter the content. </p>

<p>Reddit is something that people use everyday and yesterday was a very real attempt by the admins to take away the &quot;free speech&quot; on reddit and people responded by making a metric fuckton of posts and subs about ellen pao and fat people hate. Those subreddits were getting banned and the message was getting snuffed out by the reddit police, so naturally they moved to a sub that was very unlikely to get banned.</p>

<p>Sure. But it&#39;s more complicated than that. They expected to pass it without any argument. But there was a perfect storm of tech companies rising up, and Aaron Schwartz inventing a completely new form of activism. </p>

<p>Now the tech companies are working with them, and Aaron Schwartz is dead. </p>

<p>Many of reddit&#39;s favourite topics of discussion are all wrapped up in that one article. I found it half way down r/australia while all I could see on the front page were posts about FPH. Don&#39;t you find it just a little bit suspicious that a story that should have been the major topic of discussion in at least a dozen subs is buried under mounds of butt-hurt fatty haters?</p>

<p>Suppressing freedoms happen in many, and often interesting, ways. We have to give up our freedoms because those people over there hate our freedoms and want to take our freedoms away from us. Net result +1 freedoms!!!!! It&#39;s doublespeak. It&#39;s a psychological trick. While people are bemoaning their freedom of speech being taken away from them, their lack of attention serves to suppress that very same freedom in relation to a topic that otherwise would have been one of the most discussed of the day. The story then turns up in r/conspiracy instead of people&#39;s front pages and it automagically becomes unworthy of attention.</p>

And of course they need us, who do you think keeps the machine running?

<p>No doubt. Half an hour on r/hailcorporate should be enough to convince people of that. </p>

<p>Not saying there aren&#39;t people screaming &quot;shill! SHILL!&quot; at random shit too, but there are still veeeeeeery obvious ads posted by &quot;users&quot; all the goddamn time.

    <div class="md"><p>whats all the hostility about? i wasnt being a dick about it. im just saying its not like congress gives a shit about what the people want. BTW where did i refer to him as an idiot? and where was i &quot;bitching about it&quot;? all i said it will no likely not have any effect how much we call them. you need to chill out man and stop being so hostile.</p>

<p>i would think congress would have a higher approval rating then 19%, if they actually listened to the people, just sayin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don&#39;t see ANY connection between the attitude that calling a congressman is a waste of time, and the typical political apathy that pervades our system? </p>

<p>And you don&#39;t think &quot;LOL&quot;-ing at someone encouraging political advocacy is a dick move? </p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right, congress has a low approval rating, but how can they be expected to &quot;actually listen&quot; to the people if the majority of them are running around with the attitude that even TRYING to talk to them is a waste of time? How do you expect them to hear your opinions?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be an asshole here man, but your attitude sucks! Yeah, you didn&#39;t flat out call anyone an idiot, but you can&#39;t tell me that saying</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you actually think that will have any effect? LOL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>isn&#39;t incredibly condescending, because it is. </p>

<p>And yeah, you&#39;re not bitching (I didn&#39;t say YOU specifically were in the first place), but there are tons of people in this country who have the attitude that our government sucks and absolutely nothing can be done about it, yet rather than accept the state of things, they still sit around complaining. You&#39;re a redditor for fucks sake, I know you see that shit regularly just like the rest of us. </p>

<p>So you can tell me to &quot;chill out&quot;, you can drop as many &quot;just sayin&quot;s as you want, but you were still being condescending, and you&#39;re still promoting an attitude of apathy in a nation that already has a serious issue with political ignorance and a lack of citizen involvement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, not just reddit, but a lot of Internet sites had a day where they shut down, and everyone called Congress, and that changed things real fast, stopped SOPA, or played a big role in stopping it. The point is just that it&#39;s not fruitless to call your Congressperson; it&#39;s a good thing to do. I called mine about TPP; he was on the fence. Sure, they don&#39;t listen to the average person as much as the big donors, but it does make a difference, and it&#39;s easy. (Another easy big hit for social change is writing letters to the editor of newspapers).</p>

<p>What happens when the TPP passes, which it will? I don&#39;t know, we&#39;re increasingly fucked. What do you mean what happens? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The subsidies point you make is unquestionably a form of protectionism and is what FTAs aim to prevent. </p>

<p>If you look at released negotiation documents you&#39;ll note that countries are very specific about what industries they want to liberalise trade on. Likely the final agreement won&#39;t include US or Japanese industries currently receiving heavy subsidies as it would require a thorough change (and they are the two most influential negotiators). Instead you&#39;re likely to see countries with a competitive advantage push for liberalisation. </p>

<p>This is why we see the US pushing for pharmaceuticals, New Zealand pushing for agricultural, Japan and US pushing back against agricultural. You&#39;re also unlikely to see the auto industry included in this, the final affected industries will be very specific. </p>

<p>The use of ISDS you should also note is not some threat to sovereignty. The rules established are self imposed and can be altered, the US has never lost a lawsuit and has the money to handle frivolous lawsuits. It&#39;s the smaller countries that have to worry about those provisions not the US.</p>

<p>Your point about not being able to do tax filings in a native language is farcical and not true in any way.</p>

<p>I speak from the side of those smaller countries.  Why Americans are concerned is a puzzle to me.  You hit the nail on the head regarding pharma. But it&#39;s not just equal footing for US pharma, they&#39;ll threaten any nation&#39;s FDA equivalent that dare say no to any of their concoctions.  My biggest fear, however is Japan&#39;s family owned farmland. I believe it is the last precious jewel in the first world crown and a major and  unspoken aim of TPP.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question. How could something that is barely a blip on the radar <em>even within</em> Reddit supposed to be a distraction from a major world news event?</p>

<p>I have an answer, too: It&#39;s not. Just because some tiny minority of very angry and very frightened Redditors are outraged that a private corporation has a policy on hate speech doesn&#39;t mean that the population at large -- on Reddit or elsewhere in the world -- is &quot;distracted.&quot;</p>

<p>Just because you choose to obsess non-stop for two days over something trivial doesn&#39;t mean anyone outside your tiny group is doing the same.</p>

<p>Hey, one other question: What kind of nerve does it take to make an assertion like &quot;events on reddit are intentional to keep TPP out of discussion&quot; when you don&#39;t have a single shred of evidence? This is exactly what is wrong with a certain kind of person: Just bypass all the intellectual rigor associated with proving your case and jump straight to the unsubstantiated conclusion.</p>

<p>I have a very important hint for you, OP: That&#39;s why people don&#39;t take anything you say seriously. If you&#39;re willing to state  your paranoid fantasies as if they were facts, people will INSTANTLY realize they can&#39;t trust you. </p>

<p>Let me put it more bluntly: You&#39;re not honest. When you claim as fact something you are only speculating about, you are lying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the sort of shit that gives conspiracy theorists a bad rap: baseless allegations based on abject speculation that vastly oversimplify the fickle nature of events.</p>

<p>That said I agree with the sentiment of your post. I won&#39;t deny that this sort of thing (and any number of others) serve to distract people from real issues. But to go so far as to say something to the effect of &quot;the reddit people sat down and decided to squelch our awareness of current events with a spectacle&quot; is absurd.</p>

<p>So I guess my answer is yes it&#39;s convenient timing but that&#39;s about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it really all that absurd though? I mean I agree with you, it&#39;s a pretty inefficient tactic (and yeah the whole baseless accusation thing definitely makes r/conspiracy look bad at times too). But that&#39;s the thing about tactics, right? You have to analyze the field as a whole, not just the individual movements in one area.  </p>

<p>So what if it&#39;s not just reddit? What if it&#39;s dozens of websites applying (equally inefficient) techniques, PLUS the mainstream media distracting, PLUS shills/sockpuppets clogging up websites, PLUS the general public getting in an uproar/tossing nonsense around like in this post? </p>

<p>Individually each smokescreen sucks, but together they could serve to throw the discussion off course for a significant percentage of individuals. Yeah, it&#39;s not gonna affect EVERYONE, but no distraction tactic will. Besides that, how many people don&#39;t even know about TPP to begin with?</p>

<p>So, weighing what stands to be gained vs what stands to be lost, these kinds of techniques are a pretty cheap way to distract. If it doesn&#39;t work, what did they lose? If it does work, then they&#39;ve gotten however many people to forget what is important and waste their time with discussions like these...</p>

<p>And on that note, I&#39;m out. lol</p>

<p>But yeah i dunno bout all that... The notion that the collusion of the elites is so subversive, secretive and comprehensive is so insidious as to defy plausibility. I&#39;ve always held that people are cast into roles that reinforce the status quo either tacitly or on accident and that the elites get involved after the fact and reinforce that behavior. </p>

<p>That is to say that the stuff you talk about in your second paragraph occurs not as a result of a preordained plot outlining specific actions but rather specific actions that are given rise by a culture of elites acting in their own self interest while misleading us as to what is are. </p>

<p>You&#39;re (basically) saying that you think it&#39;s more likely that people are more or less just taking advantage of situations as they arise, rather than directly manipulating circumstances? Right?</p>

<p>That makes sense to me. I just personally feel there is room for both opportunism and direct manipulation. lol I also think people overestimate how hard it would be to raise a little ruckus like this, and they underestimate how much time our government wastes manipulating opinion. </p>

As soon as someone makes a very clever eli5 animation - clearly explaining ALL the flipsides and consequences of said partnership, and then posts it on all the usual social channels, we may see some people waking up. Sadly, no one out there will read a wall of text these days. Actually, this would be a perfect fit for Trey Parker and Matt Stone. I bet they&#39;d do it for free.

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re posting in this sub because it&#39;s unlikely this sub will get banned. It&#39;s not a conspiracy. It&#39;s not some brigade of fucking shills.</p>

<p>Reddit is something that people use everyday and yesterday was a very real attempt by the admins to take away the &quot;free speech&quot; on reddit and people responded by making a metric fuckton of posts and subs about ellen pao and fat people hate. Those subreddits were getting banned and the message was getting snuffed out by the reddit police, so naturally they moved to a sub that was very unlikely to get banned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it really all that absurd though? I mean I agree with you, it&#39;s a pretty inefficient tactic (and yeah the whole baseless accusation thing definitely makes r/conspiracy look bad at times too). But that&#39;s the thing about tactics, right? You have to analyze the field as a whole, not just the individual movements in one area.  </p>

<p>So what if it&#39;s not just reddit? What if it&#39;s dozens of websites applying (equally inefficient) techniques, PLUS the mainstream media distracting, PLUS shills/sockpuppets clogging up websites, PLUS the general public getting in an uproar/tossing nonsense around like in this post? </p>

<p>Individually each smokescreen sucks, but together they could serve to throw the discussion off course for a significant percentage of individuals. Yeah, it&#39;s not gonna affect EVERYONE, but no distraction tactic will. Besides that, how many people don&#39;t even know about TPP to begin with?</p>

<p>So, weighing what stands to be gained vs what stands to be lost, these kinds of techniques are a pretty cheap way to distract. If it doesn&#39;t work, what did they lose? If it does work, then they&#39;ve gotten however many people to forget what is important and waste their time with discussions like these...</p>

<p>And on that note, I&#39;m out. lol</p>
