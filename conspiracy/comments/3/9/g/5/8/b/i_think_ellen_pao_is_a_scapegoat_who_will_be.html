        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit has been moving towards a more moderated, mainstream speech platform for a while now. I have neither interest nor opinion on whether that&#39;s a good thing or merits cries of censorship, but I have spotted a trend. Whereas other companies are often quick to circle the wagons and protect their leadership, the position of CEO at reddit seems to be the most dumped-upon. Reddit admins don&#39;t seem to defend their CEOs outside of token lines of solidarity; the administration at large is thus viewed much more favorably than the CEO.</p>

<p>To me, this makes it seem that the CEO is actually something of a scapegoat for the rest of the administration. Whenever they face backlash for changes made to reddit, the vast majority of the hate is against the CEO, even though we have no ability to discern where the idea came from or who&#39;s in support of it. We still blame the CEO as though that&#39;s the only person who is pushing the agenda.</p>

<p>Take Yishan and The Fappening, for example. He was the face of the shutdown, and people largely assumed that if he was ousted, such &quot;censorship&quot; would stop. Obviously, they did not. Shortly thereafter, he resigned due to disagreements with the rest of the administration. Other reasons were mentioned, of course, but the timing seems convenient, and certainly the hatred contributed to the high stress cited as part of his reason for resigning. And reddit rejoiced his departure and put a lot of the controvery behind us, even though complaints remained ignored.</p>

<p>I think what&#39;s happening is that reddit admins will continue to move reddit more towards the mainstream - most of the administration supports this (it&#39;s their paycheck from advertisement, after all). They&#39;ll make gradual changes, letting CEOs take heat and be discarded when sufficient heat has been taken. Removing the CEO makes it seem like there&#39;s new &quot;hope&quot; - a sort of convenient reset button. Our collective memories will be too short to notice that this trend is happening, and those who leave because they do notice will have their numbers more than replaced by more mainstream folks, arriving due to the changes in direction.</p>

<p>Thus, if Ellen Pao takes enough heat from this ban, she&#39;ll be ousted (&quot;resigns&quot; or replaced by a non-interim CEO) but the policy changes will remain in effect. And most of reddit will be assuaged anyways.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>

<p>Tl;dr - The reddit administration is behind the policy shifts for money/userbase expansion, and is scapegoating CEOs to focus hate at the CEO rather than the site. Discard CEO, leave policy in place, and reddit gradually moves towards more moderation with only a few hiccups and no mass diaspora.</p>
