    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen this sentiment posted a ton today all over reddit by individuals who were in a similar situation to yourself.  This is my &quot;throw away&quot; account and I frequented FatPeopleHate almost daily, but was mostly a lurker.  I&#39;ve never had an issue with my weight but I used it as motivation to get out the door to exercise.</p>

<p>Fat People Hate was never about truly hating fat people just because they were fat, it was about not coddling the &quot;special snowflake&quot; culture that has been slowly developing int he west - but as it concerned obesity.   Fat People hate saw obesity that was within everyone&#39;s power to rid themselves of, so the &quot;hate&quot; was at the laziness, excuses, subcultures of &quot;Acceptance&quot; and the often found hypocrisy of delusions and double standards.</p>

<p>When I read a story like your&#39;s I think to myself &quot;Fuck yeah! he/she gets it, keep going!&quot; but &quot;we&quot; can&#39;t cheer you on, you can get that anywhere and everywhere else, fat logic, fit, fitness, fatpeoplestories, dozens, probably hundreds more on the likes of tubler etc.</p>

<p>Fat people hate was tough love and HONEST - It was circle jerky, sure, but if you got over your own &quot;fee fees&quot; and looked objectively at it, it was hating fat people just because they were fat, it was hating everything that resulted in that.</p>

<p>Our societies are getting fatter by the year, and it&#39;s every single person&#39;s fault for their own weight, -It&#39;s damn frightening.  Where will we be in 5-15-30 years?</p>

<p>The banning had nothing to do with what they said it did, there was never any brigading or doxxing, and the banning had everything to do with &quot;your rights end where my feelings begin&quot;. Coupled with a side order of business planning.</p>

Some don&#39;t take kindly to the mass embarrassment on that sub, but its optional!

    <div class="md"><p><strong>A normal way to handle this would be to accept these subreddits - FREE SPEECH anyone???</strong> I am also overweight a bit currently and on a diet by the way (lost about 10 kg so far, another 10-15 kg to go, or maybe a bit more). And YES, it really gives some weird motivation when I visit a sub like FPH that talks freely about the health and social drawbacks of being overweight. It gives motivation to keep going on with my diet; I strongly recommend <a href="http://www.myfitnesspal.com/">http://www.myfitnesspal.com/</a> by the way, it is an excellent calorie tracker with a huge food database that can help to plan &amp; control the daily food intake and physical activity in order to lose / keep / gain weight, according the healthy BMI values or personal preferences.</p>

<p><strong>Censorship is wrong, because it kills free speech, and thus it kills the healthy, balanced online society.</strong> The conspiracy part is that when topics and subs like <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> get deleted / banned, then after some time people will NOT know about them; actually in some months many new Redditors won&#39;t even know that it ever existed. So we lose opinions, facts, comments, ideas. If you don&#39;t like something, do not read it. Just because you don&#39;t like a food, drink or book shall we ban it? What about the preferences of other people?</p>

<p><strong>Also, what is next? Will they ban everything that can be offensive for someone?</strong> We won&#39;t be able to talk negatively about politics? Religion? Conspiracies? Computer games? Music? What if I say one day on Reddit that <em>&quot;I fuckin&#39; hate the music of Eminem / Britney Spears / Tiesto&quot;</em>? (they are all pretty talented musicians by the way I think). Will I get also shadowbanned because of some fans won&#39;t accept my &quot;offensive&quot; opinion?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. Needed some damn good motivation for years. That did it. Well, that and the doctor also saying that I was on my way to obesity if I didn&#39;t stop. Both things made me realize I had to stop and get my life in order and my body in shape. </p>
