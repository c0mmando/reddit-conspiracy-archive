       I just read somewhere else on here that voat.co is ran by literally one person who just within the last few days announced he would be on vacation for a week or something. Bad timing for a vacation and server going down, but it happens I guess.

       I guess it's that. The site is a reddit clone, the code could be a simple fork but admins said that it was difficult to deploy. If you have one guy handling everything, and no replicated server or CDN or whatever, we'll have the slowest web site on the planet.

       I agree....I'm afraid the atmosphere will be quite negative for quite a while to come.  Eventually it should calm down, though.  If I can ever get back on the site, I'll still hang in there with them.

       That is a very self-centered viewpoint. The concern isn't for you, a random Reddit user. It's for those that are targets of their mocking and harassment. You think that if your obese cousin has a candid photo taken of her at the grocery store and posted to Reddit (and then linked on Facebook), it's totallyfine because your cousin can just choose to block the subreddit? That's ignorant.

       You are grossly over-exaggerating the impact and scope of Reddit's decision while massively under-playing the harm of a subreddit like FPH. It's a combination that can only be described as willfully ignorant. Reddit is not the Internet. I'm not supporting laws that prevent people from having a fatpeoplehate forum anywhere on the Internet. I'm supporting Reddit in their decision to kick these morons off the site.

       Give it up. That's a cop-out if that's your defense of a community actively harassing people run by mods who engage in the harassment.

       This isn't a freedom of speech issue. This is Reddit, a private web site, finally starting to take a stand against toxic bullshit communities. Only in abstract theory-land can you even begin to spin a story on now this is a bad idea. Here in reality, it's a no-brainer. It was a shitty community full of assholes that crossed the line.

       Reddit would absolutely love a mass exodus of people that were fans of
       <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">
        /r/fatpeoplehate

       or
       <a href="/r/CuteFemaleCorpses">

       As far as I'm concerned, I would be thrilled if every moron upset about these hate-filled subreddits being banned went to voat.co. I don't see why the CEO of Reddit would feel differently.

       I understand that. I am responding to the suggestion that Reddit would conspire to prevent fans of FPH from leaving. It doesn't make sense. We/they don't want them here, anyhow. They don't help Reddit make $$. They detract from Reddit's image and brand. Having them exodus to Voat.co is a dream come true.

       No idea what you're trying to say. You think that the same users that donated to voat.co would've otherwise donated that money to Reddit, had Reddit not driven them away? That makes no sense.

       If they contributed money to a community built forum, what says they wouldn't have contributed here?  Or they weren't contributing here?

       While it is impossible to know who would donate in a hypothetical scenario, I think it's highly unlikely that people who are so excited at the idea of having no rules to govern their harassing hate speech would have otherwise been inclined to donate to Reddit. It's always been just a matter of time before Reddit ran them off. Nor do I think $20k of donations (or whatever you think it was) holds a candle to the brand damage caused by having subreddits like FPH and cute dead corpses. Reddit knows this; such subreddits are a thorn in their side and they are thrilled to be getting rid of them and offloading the problem to another community, which is why this conspiracy theory is ... dumb.

       Look at it this way, FPH did have rules... outside of FPH.

       It was stated (quoted literal quoting, you know what a quote is right?) "the amount of donations that came in crashed my Paypal... I would have to go through a process of reverification of who I am to get the funds."

       And how do you calculate this "brand damage"?  Also wouldn't having a CEO making frivelous sexual discimination suits be a huge bit of "brand damage".  For that matter, wouldn't having a CEO linked to literal ponzi schemes be outrageous amounts of "brand damage"?

       FYI, .r.cutefemalecorpses still exists.  I am not linking it properly because it isn't everyone's thing, but it still has a place.

       The problem is the apparent favoritism of banning subs, I wasn't subbed to fatpeoplehate but they literally only targeted that subreddit and others made in response to it while there are many racist subreddits and cutefemalecorpses is still alive and kicking.

       I wouldn't mind if they did away with all of those subreddits, the problem is they didn't and only took out one subreddit that was 13th? in subscriber popularity on the entire site.

       They did it because of clear direct harassment of individuals. You are just arguing they should ban more? Cool. I agree.

       I can get paid for being glad when shitty, toxic subreddits like
       <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">
        /r/fatpeoplehate

       Nice deflection, shill.  Did they give you a script with that rhetoric?  It seems everyone is "happy" the "shitty, toxic" sub is gone.  Do you think about all the others?  Or are you just happy with dealing with a group of frumpy people?

       See that is the problem.  If you are not a shill you would then be someone with no concept of freedom, ergo you would just be a shill that isn't being paid.

       The point of moving to a new service isn't to spite the Reddit admins. It's simply to find a place where they won't be banned.
