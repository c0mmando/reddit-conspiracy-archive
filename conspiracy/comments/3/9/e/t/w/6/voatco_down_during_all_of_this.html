<p>Biggest understatement of the year to describe the posting of unsolicited pictures of obese people on the Internet and actively harassing them.</p>

<p>Sorry, you don&#39;t get to spin something as evil as FPH as innocent. No one&#39;s buying it. Go join the party at voat.co with the other &quot;issue voicers&quot;. We won&#39;t miss you!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You are grossly over-exaggerating the impact and scope of Reddit&#39;s decision while massively under-playing the harm of a subreddit like FPH. It&#39;s a combination that can only be described as willfully ignorant. Reddit is not the Internet. I&#39;m not supporting laws that prevent people from having a fatpeoplehate forum anywhere on the Internet. I&#39;m supporting Reddit in their decision to kick these morons off the site. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Give it up. That&#39;s a cop-out if that&#39;s your defense of a community actively harassing people run by mods who engage in the harassment. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a freedom of speech issue. This is Reddit, a private web site, finally starting to take a stand against toxic bullshit communities. Only in abstract theory-land can you even begin to spin a story on now this is a bad idea. Here in reality, it&#39;s a no-brainer. It was a shitty community full of assholes that crossed the line.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While it is impossible to know who would donate in a hypothetical scenario, I think it&#39;s highly unlikely that people who are so excited at the idea of having no rules to govern their harassing hate speech would have otherwise been inclined to donate to Reddit. It&#39;s always been just a matter of time before Reddit ran them off. Nor do I think $20k of donations (or whatever you think it was) holds a candle to the brand damage caused by having subreddits like FPH and cute dead corpses. Reddit knows this; such subreddits are a thorn in their side and they are thrilled to be getting rid of them and offloading the problem to another community, which is why this conspiracy theory is ... dumb.</p>

<p>Look at it this way, FPH did have rules... outside of FPH.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It was stated (quoted literal quoting, you know what a quote is right?) &quot;the amount of donations that came in crashed my Paypal... I would have to go through a process of reverification of who I am to get the funds.&quot;</p>

<p>And how do you calculate this &quot;brand damage&quot;?  Also wouldn&#39;t having a CEO making frivelous sexual discimination suits be a huge bit of &quot;brand damage&quot;.  For that matter, wouldn&#39;t having a CEO linked to literal ponzi schemes be outrageous amounts of &quot;brand damage&quot;?  </p>
