        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Is anyone else finding the response to banning subreddits for fat people hate staggering? Surely the removal of our genuine freedoms, i.e. being monitored on the internet, is more important than a company choosing certain view points are unpalatable. Reddit is a business, it does not have to provide you with any rights... It is not a public entity.</p>

<p>The government on the other hand, does owe you certain rights. It is a public entity. The right to free speech, to freely expressing yourself, is guaranteed in the constitution. Yet this right is constantly being trampled. No one has the freedom to express themselves as of now. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure many others, do not express their opinion for fear of being &quot;watched&quot; or placed on a watch list by the NSA or some other 3 lettered government agency. Individuals have already begun self-censoring,worried that they will be arrested, placed on a watch list where their google search history will be brought up if they do anything that threatens the powers that be. </p>

<p>The Government lies to get us into wars -- nary a response from reddit. People find out about Operation Mockinbird -- yet are totally fine with believing we have a free media. NSA admitting to wiretapping US citizens? Who cares! Obama tells a secret court to ignore law he signed 4 hours earlier, in order to extend illegal NSA surveillance? That&#39;s all unimportant right now, lets focus on the real issue -- we can no longer berate our fellow species member for not-conforming to my standards of how one should live! My precious freedoms!! /s </p>

<p>I thought <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was to discuss genuine conspiracy. This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, it&#39;s an open business decision by a business. They stated what they were doing. It wasn&#39;t done by a cabal in secret. If you want to direct your energy towards hating Ellen Pao, go ahead, unless you enjoy being in a mob, it will be a waste of your time whilst the rest of the world continues to go to rot. There are far worse CEOs, military leaders, and even technology companies to hate in this world than Ellen Pao. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of the few subs where bitching about reddit is somewhat safe; for those complaining and for reddit itself. People are pouring out of the banned subs and coming here to vent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of this as a starting ground for people. Most people have never noticed most of these &quot;conspiracies&quot; before, or have understood they have little control over them. This might be what gets the ball rolling on many younger, or less concerned citizens. Hell most of the posts on here about CIA torture, NSA surveillance, and many other top posts; are no longer conspiracies. Thus don&#39;t belong in the sub either. This sub reddit has changed over time to accommodate the needs of the people. Yes, this might bring in a bunch of people who care about trivial FPH, but think about what they could learn just by visiting this sub reddit. I enjoy this first amendment fight, it gets people thinking about what they believe  in. I makes reddit either double down on internet freedom, or finally reach the point of becoming the bad guy. Sometimes the its the stupid fights that actually bring up the bigger questions. I&#39;m just proud to see this subreddit remaining a haven for people who ask uncomfortable questions to people in power. The same powerful people who would rather you not ask any questions.  </p>

<p>Not going to lie my first thought was &quot; fuck this fat shit, it&#39;s so trivial&quot;</p>

<p>But after a moment of emotions i gladly embrace them. Make  a super thread for it hopefully they find a space to let it out and decide to check out some other threads that may have a bigger impact on the picture.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth pointing out for illustrative purposes if nothing else: I just read an article in r/australia about Big Pharma being the driving force behind the TPP. That&#39;s a bunch of reddit&#39;s favourite topics not being talked about.</p>
