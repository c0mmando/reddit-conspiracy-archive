<p>According to their material and their model, The earth is flat and around and encircled by antarctica, and that no one is allowed to go to the edges of antarctica and so forth. And that the moon and the sun are directly over the earth in an orbit on the same level.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> If the moon and the sun are directly above the earth on the same level, how is a lunar eclipse possible?</p>

<p>You mean lunar eclipses that have been documented and witnessed by millions of people are baseless speculation?</p>

<p>Well if you havent seen one, for example here is the data for april of 2014, full with pictures and other data to dispell the baseless speculation assumption</p>

<p><a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html">http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html</a></p>

<p>Im really interested in why, you seem to avoid this question: is it because you dont know how to explain it because it completely refutes your model </p>

<p>If the sun and moon are directly above the earth on the same level, then a lunar eclipse is just impossible. But for some reason we have documented evidence of lunar eclipses for years now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rob Skiba has done a good job compiling <a href="http://www.seedtheseries.com/blog/BibleEarth.html">scriptural and empirical evidence together</a>. If I&#39;m not mistaken he still holds to the convex ball model, but is on the fence due to the overwhelming support for the flat earth. (As a side note: I wouldn&#39;t put too much stock into the book of Enoch. Though it may reflect a certain time period, it&#39;s certainly not canonical and there are some obvious reasons for that.)</p>

<p>If you check out <a href="http://ifers.boards.net/">Eric Dubay&#39;s forum</a>, you can find also other ancient cosmologies which are all pretty well agreed upon a flat world. That place has pretty well become a cess pool, though...</p>

<p>Yeah and its perfectly explained: so your debunking due to that phenomena is mute</p>

<ul>
<li><em>On Oct. 8, Interested skywatchers should attempt to see the total eclipse of the moon and the rising sun simultaneously. The little-used name for this effect is called a &quot;selenelion,&quot; a phenomenon that celestial geometry says cannot happen. And indeed, during a lunar eclipse, the sun and moon are exactly 180 degrees apart in the sky. In a perfect alignment like this (called a &quot;syzygy&quot;), such an observation would seem impossible. But thanks to Earth&#39;s atmosphere, the images of both the sun and moon are apparently lifted above the horizon by atmospheric refraction. This allows people on Earth to see the sun for several extra minutes before it actually has risen and the moon for several extra minutes after it has actually set. [How to See the Total Lunar Eclipse (Visibility Maps)]
As a consequence of this atmospheric trick, for many localities east of the Mississippi River, watchers will have a chance to observe this unusual sight firsthand. Weather permitting, you could have a short window of roughly 2 to 9 minutes (depending on your location) with the possibility of simultaneously seeing the sun rising in the east while the eclipsed full moon is setting in the west.</em></li>

<p>Thats an assertion without evidence, its not argument that you are correct or that it never happened, you are simply asserting your opinion as fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what is your explanation as to the other celestial bodies clearly being spherical? You can easily see this for yourself with a telescope. </p>

<p>How do you explain the images of our own planet and moon? You may believe the lunar landing was faked, but you can&#39;t dismiss space activity. Most of our communications tech relies on devices in orbit. Orbit isn&#39;t possible in a flat earth scenario. </p>

<p>You appear to rely on scripture to support your ideas. How do you justify accepting the existence of <em>anything</em> not mentioned by scripture if that&#39;s your defense? How do you explain that the church universally accepts a round earth? </p>

<p>Do you have an actual theological education background? Have you studied the scriptures in Hebrew and Greek, or do you accept English translation even though that&#39;s easily proven to be edited and therefore fallible? </p>

<p>How do you explain the horizon? A flat earth would not have a horizon, it would simply fade from sight. How do you explain being able to see evidence of the curve if high enough?</p>

<p>How do you explain physics? Take a bullet as a very simple example. In long distance shooting it is necessary to correct for not only curvature but also rotation. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to see you even attempt to answer a question, so I don&#39;t expect you to do so here, but anyone is welcome. </p>

<p>So what is your explanation as to the other celestial bodies clearly being spherical?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re assuming they are. You cannot see much at all in a telescope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you explain the images of our own planet and moon? You may believe the lunar landing was faked, but you can&#39;t dismiss space activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Communications do not require satellites; we&#39;re just told they do. Photo-realistic painters exist. The movie Gravity is a demonstration of where computer graphics have gone. There&#39;s nothing to suggest that space is real and hasn&#39;t been faked.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you explain that the church universally accepts a round earth?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.&quot; <em>(1 Timothy 6:20-21)</em></p>

<p>The church accepted worldly influence and became corrupt almost immediately after Jesus ascended. Just look at the Catholic Church, drunk with the blood of the saints and filthy with the wine of her fornication. Wine is symbol for doctrine, which she&#39;s fornicated with the world and left the faith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you explain the horizon? A flat earth would not have a horizon, it would simply fade from sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not true. Please study the laws of perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you explain being able to see evidence of the curve if high enough?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There isn&#39;t any. People assert there is when they have no argument left to go to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you explain physics? Take a bullet as a very simple example. In long distance shooting it is necessary to correct for not only curvature but also rotation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t true, either. You do not have to correct for curvature at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no .. it can&#39;t be inertia without also involving the air mass, because a helicopter can reverse direction.  For your explanation to work the entire atmosphere has to be considered one structure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument doesn&#39;t make any sense.  Consider my example of being in the jet plane.  A helicopter CAN reverse direction just as you can walk toward the back of a forward moving plane.  Your body IS moving at hundreds of miles an hour in the direction of the plane, but you can easily walk to the back without overcoming that great force.  But consider if that plane hits a brick wall or is somehow able to slam on brakes.  Then what happens?  </p>

<p>And I particularly love that you claim the church was corrupted immediately after ascension while quoting a passage that wasn&#39;t written until almost 100 years after ascension and wasn&#39;t considered canon until nearly <em>500</em> years later, at which time the church that you call unreliable while relying on to support your argument compiled the bible in its first form. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I suppose I am one of the people you are referring to.  I have discussed the topic with you before.  The accounts are likely new because the idea has only reemerged as a serious topic recently.  I lurked this subreddit for a long time before making an account.</p>

<p>I have spent quite a bit of time considering this topic.  I am convinced that the earth cannot be a spinning globe, orbiting around the sun with other planets while the whole solar system is hurtling though space.  However, I am not 100% convinced that the generally accepted flat earth model is correct.  I do want to know the truth and I&#39;m still pursuing it.  </p>

<p>Previously I have advised people to go to <a href="http://ifers.boards.net">http://ifers.boards.net</a> for information.  There is a lot of information available there on the topic and it is still worth looking at, but there are problems with that place.  Legitimate questions about the flat earth model are often shut down and users get banned very quickly.  I got banned not long ago for daring to question.</p>

<p>The key is that you can&#39;t trust anyone absolutely.  Consider the points that people make and think for yourself.  </p>

<p>As for the specific question about lunar eclipses:  Lunar eclipses are a problem with the globe model as well.  They cannot be caused by the earth blocking the light from the sun because they sometimes occur while the sun is visible in the sky.  As an example:  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/total-lunar-eclipse-on-wednesday/">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/total-lunar-eclipse-on-wednesday/</a>  There have been many other occurrences of this through history.  The speculation is that there is possibly a third celestial body, which has been called &quot;Rahu the black sun&quot;, which goes in front of the moon to create lunar eclipses.  I do not know if this is correct.</p>

<p>I encourage everyone to not dismiss this topic without really investigating it themselves.  The evidence of flatness of water over long distances and other points means that the globe model just can&#39;t work.</p>

<p>Would you look at that, your own article explained the thing: why didnt you read it</p>

<ul>
<li><em>On Oct. 8, Interested skywatchers should attempt to see the total eclipse of the moon and the rising sun simultaneously. The little-used name for this effect is called a &quot;selenelion,&quot; a phenomenon that celestial geometry says cannot happen. And indeed, during a lunar eclipse, the sun and moon are exactly 180 degrees apart in the sky. In a perfect alignment like this (called a &quot;syzygy&quot;), such an observation would seem impossible. But thanks to Earth&#39;s atmosphere, the images of both the sun and moon are apparently lifted above the horizon by atmospheric refraction. This allows people on Earth to see the sun for several extra minutes before it actually has risen and the moon for several extra minutes after it has actually set. [How to See the Total Lunar Eclipse (Visibility Maps)]
As a consequence of this atmospheric trick, for many localities east of the Mississippi River, watchers will have a chance to observe this unusual sight firsthand. Weather permitting, you could have a short window of roughly 2 to 9 minutes (depending on your location) with the possibility of simultaneously seeing the sun rising in the east while the eclipsed full moon is setting in the west.</em></li>

<li><em>On Oct. 8, Interested skywatchers should attempt to see the total eclipse of the moon and the rising sun simultaneously. The little-used name for this effect is called a &quot;selenelion,&quot; a phenomenon that celestial geometry says cannot happen. And indeed, during a lunar eclipse, the sun and moon are exactly 180 degrees apart in the sky. In a perfect alignment like this (called a &quot;syzygy&quot;), such an observation would seem impossible. But thanks to Earth&#39;s atmosphere, the images of both the sun and moon are apparently lifted above the horizon by atmospheric refraction. This allows people on Earth to see the sun for several extra minutes before it actually has risen and the moon for several extra minutes after it has actually set. [How to See the Total Lunar Eclipse (Visibility Maps)]
As a consequence of this atmospheric trick, for many localities east of the Mississippi River, watchers will have a chance to observe this unusual sight firsthand. Weather permitting, you could have a short window of roughly 2 to 9 minutes (depending on your location) with the possibility of simultaneously seeing the sun rising in the east while the eclipsed full moon is setting in the west.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The only record i can find of that is from Flat earth society websites: do you have a link from the primary source. Because i cant seem to verify that quote, can you?</p>

<p>Secondly, nobody can verify whether that account is true or not. But we can verify recent eclipses which have both picture and video evidence</p>

<p>Like I said before, we do not know how it works. My authority is the scripture and its cause is not discussed nor is it remotely important. The horizon at altitude alone debunks the round earth and it&#39;s only an issue for those who cannot bear to part with the globe model for whatever reason.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say with confidence that I believe all the evidence of the flat earth theory and I definitely don&#39;t believe all the evidence of the round earth theory.  I question all theories and entertain all thoughts because one would be ignorant otherwise to just believe everything they&#39;re told and everything they see, especially by NASA. I believe a little bit of both theories.  I don&#39;t believe the world is flat, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s round either. I think its a huge ice cream type of shape, which still gives it the round shape that people &quot;see&quot;.  I believe that there is a core in the middle of earth. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s in the middle of a round earth, just the bottom tip of the &quot;cone&quot;.  </p>

<p>People talk about what the earth looks like from space. They&#39;re always looking from above. Whether they take off from US or take off from China they&#39;re still going UP and looking below at the whole earth. People talk about looking at a ship and seeing the ship &quot;sink&quot; under the horizon. The cone shape would still give that effect. People talk about pictures. I already gave you my opinion on pictures; people shouldn&#39;t believe everything they see. People talk about time zones. If the earth was a cone or even flat, time zones would still be possible.  The biggest mystery to me is Antarctica.  I personally believe that Antarctica borders the cone and &quot;connects&quot; to the core of the earth at the the tip of the cone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have posted this response in another topic but it also fits in here very well:</p>

<p>I think this all goes a bit deeper. To be honest right from the beginning, I am a round earth believer and I know that not all flat earth believers are stupid (not everyone is parrotting nonsense s/he heard from a friend which read something on the internet what a friend saw on youtube). I think this all is just part of a huge controlled disinformation campaign in order to make people resistant for the upcoming disclosure and the massive information dump which is to come linked to this. Because if one gets the masses to disbelief in science and get them to not being able to distinguish honest and true science from fakes, then the masses also won’t believe in disclosure and other true informations coming out. Lots of us are looking for informations, and at some point you will come across the illuminati &amp; cabal groups, and if you are up to date you’ll probably know about the sphere alliance and the SSP’s. It is obvious (at least to me and many others) that the cabal groups have infiltrated the conspiracy theorists and it seems this is all well prepared. People around the globe are slowly waking up and are realizing that somethings not right here. People know that NASA, our politicians, the media, schools and what have you weren’t always truthful and honest. So I believe that this huge disinformation effort is to discredit science with the weaopns of the conspiracy theorists. It is basically their last stand because they know if that doesn’t work they, the cabal group, will be history. But no matter what, this time they’ll lose anyway. I have read a lot about flat earth theory and in every forum, and on youtube etc. at some point the flat earthers are fighting fiercly with the round earthers about their beliefs. This tactic is old, very old and it seems to work on us almost every time unless someone notices it. Not only on this topic but also on many others. Get the people to fight each other so they don’t care about the one initiating all of this. I think what we should focus on is prevent this useless namecalling, fighting, insulting and so on because aggression does not get you anywhere in this discussion. No one knows everything and the one who claims to know everything is a liar. Only full disclosure is real disclosure and anything other than that will be orchestrated by the cabal groups. Its as easy as that. Technically we could be much further than we are at the moment and if the real full disclosure occurs we have to be able to distinguish the fake from the real thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to start to explain details of this because I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this as good as the ones who are doing this for years. But I can provide some links so you can research for yourself.</p>

<p>But in all honesty: it makes this sub look bad. I don&#39;t believe in any conspiracies; I usually come here to debate you guys who believe in them, but atleast I know when I&#39;m talking to you, you guys are genuine about what you present and aren&#39;t trolling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So around 6 minutes in he finally presents his argument, Im gonna boil it down and tell me if i have his argument right:</p>

<p>A magnetic force exists atop the mountain at the north pole.</p>

<p>Around 7:50 he presents a scientific argument about a force that he cant explain what it is, how large it is, and what its composed of and why its invisble: he states:</p>

<p>*&quot;Every now and then because of the rotation of the planet this force will get stretched out and it will give you this black, mhmmm,ahhh illusion that theres something there blocking your view. Thats not true, its just, theres something that you are looking at, </p>

<p><strong>a black body that you cant see, but it remains over the north pole and every now and then, it gets pulled to the side and thats what you see</strong>. </p>

<p>Then he goes into a detail of campuses and how nasa is a cult</p>

<p>Did i get the argument right or did i miss something?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The inner earth or hollow earth theory claims that in the center of the earth is a second sun and mainly empty space around it. In this model you have 2 gravitational centers: One is distributed over the center of the crust and the other one is the inner sun. The crust itself is &quot;bent&quot; around at the poles. Due to the rotation of the earth, the crust gets &quot;teared appart&quot; at the poles and there are 2 polar openings that lead inside the earth to the other side of the crust.
So in this model, the earth is not flat, but has the shape of a distorted donut (torus)

    <div class="md"><p>Well I would say that lunar eclipses happen because the moon is exactly between earth and sun as the conventional theory says.
Hollow earth theory has no influence on lunar eclipses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bodies of mass stretch space time fabric and exert gravitational force on other objects.</p>

<p>The best evidence we have for this is that gravity bends light. Two objects behind each other the light appears on the side of the object </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So 536 of humans out of 7 billion? That&#39;s not even .5 of 1% of the entire human population. So forgive me if I don&#39;t consider that &quot;proof.&quot; and were you one of those people? Were you with them when they reached orbit or did you see it on tv?</p>

<p>Do you think it was logical when the Wright brothers decided to create the airplane in that day and age? People called them crazy. People said it was impossible but yet here we are in 2015 flying through the air in what is basically metal tubes.</p>

<p>And logic and reason on the internet??????? I&#39;m not even going to bother with that statement. </p>

<p>Because obviously if anyone believes something that you don&#39;t agree with then they must be &quot;trolling&quot;</p>

<p>You don&#39;t support any of the conspiracies? I find it hard to believe that out of all the bullshit in this world you don&#39;t question anything. That&#39;s goes against basic human nature </p>
