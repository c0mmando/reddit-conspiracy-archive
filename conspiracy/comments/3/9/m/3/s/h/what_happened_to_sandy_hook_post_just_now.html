<p>EDIT.</p>

<p><a href="http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiro/comments/39kr0n/sandy_hook_im_a_teacher_and_i_wanted_to_have_a/">http://np.reddit.com/r/conspiro/comments/39kr0n/sandy_hook_im_a_teacher_and_i_wanted_to_have_a/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the original post:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s really hard to even do research on Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>I made a mistake. When I first heard of the tragedy, I was at school. Of course I didn&#39;t question it. Kids were killed and it just sound awful.</p>

<p>A few months ago, though, I&#39;m not sure but something hit me. None of it was making sense. As a teacher, if there was a school shooting like Sandy Hook, I know it would be complete chaos and blood would be everywhere.</p>

<p>I decided to search every post submitted on Reddit about Sandy Hook. Every single one. Guess what?
Almost none of the directed links worked anymore. Nearly all videos and articles were removed.</p>

<p>To me, that in itself is a conspiracy. Look up Sandy Hook in Reddit posts and search from the top to the bottom. Nothing works. Why would this key information be removed? Even links debunking Sandy Hook conspiracy theories don&#39;t work.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all unsettling. Then I attempted outside research and it was worthless. Google seems to be highly censored and I could not get any valid information. I used YouTube, too, but a lot of videos have been removed.
I just wanted to vent here. Please be gentle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure where to comment so here will do. </p>

<p>The theatre shooting was a mess with badly injured walking wounded spreading blood everywhere. I don&#39;t mean to be callous, but the Sandy Hook shooter was just a better shot and a more organised killer.  He shot people, and they died on the spot. According to reports there was only two injured children and two injured adults. The children died in hospital so they were probably severely injured and wouldn&#39;t have been moving around and the two adults survived but went to ground. One of the adults was shot through a door and there&#39;s no way she&#39;s coming out of that room, and one other who has opted out of public comment. Who knows why. Eminently sensible imho as the vultures would have picked their bones clean with no regard for their well being. What could they say that we don&#39;t already know. </p>

<p>What&#39;s to learn here? Sad losers with guns will occasionally kill as many people as they can. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for a good conspiracy theory but this one just seems silly to me. It&#39;s people that want the right to carry around legal instruments of mass death wanting to believe it&#39;s ok for everyone to have legal bringers of easy violent death. When you get behind that sentiment, what do you get? Death. Its horrible, but not that surprising.  </p>

<p>Imo of course. </p>

<p>tl:dr SH scumbag was an excellent shot so no blood was tracked around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shirley you jest. My wild theories? Oh well, whatever floats your boat.</p>

<p>Actually, I didn&#39;t quote any redacted reports, just various articles from news sites. </p>

<p>Ok, you won&#39;t care about this because it appears your mind is set but what I think happened here is that the people involved were mostly well educated, well informed upper class whites who understood that talking to the media would only increase their pain. I note there is one family making hay while the sun shines with a fund for something or other, but most of them just went, media, get the fuck away from me. They used their education and skill to try to encourage change. Good luck with that of course, but it&#39;s understandable you want something good to come from losing your child. </p>

<p>So I&#39;ve answered you. Can you answer this question? Given that you have a right to bear arms of all sizes, speeds and ferocities, and give the place is absolutely flooded with weapons, (I know that guns don&#39;t kill people, people kill people) and given that some people are mentally ill or drug fucked or just violent and vicious, what do you expect to happen? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to bud in but you make a lot of assumptions without actually having done enough research. I find it tedious when someone glances over something, comes up with an &#39;answer&#39; and refuses to see all the details that have made it questionable in the first place.</p>

<p>If it was just a shooter and everything matched up [all video and other], then nobody would have questioned this in the least.
Read and watch more and then come back, it is far too much to explain it on here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel your pain. I too hate hasty condescending ill informed comment from people I disagree with, but what you gonna do? I watched the journalist collective doco where the woman tries to show that the timeline doesn&#39;t match up to the video footage from the police car. It was pretty weak. There are so many reasonable explanations for this that I don&#39;t even know where to start to point them out to you. Once a person has a mind to see a particular color conspiracy everything is tarred with same brush. </p>

<p>If there is a conspiracy here it&#39;s more along the lines of &quot;these people have friends in high places and we don&#39;t want them to suffer and have the media harass them&quot; rather than, &quot;let&#39;s fake a massacre so we can get I&#39;d of some of the more ridiculous guns that people are allowed to teach their children to use under the guise of &#39;family outings&#39;, &#39;responsible gun ownership&#39; and &#39;good clean fun&#39;. </p>

<p>Btw, actors have to send their kids to school somewhere. They also have real lives, real emotions and real children. The fact that there were some actors involved proves nothing. The fact that there was an anti gun parent is a sad irony that only proves there are sane people living in the town. The fact she&#39;s from Switzerland seems irrelevant. </p>

<p>Reported sightings of dead people are common as muck. Cayley Anthony&#39;s grandmother was getting solid tips right up to the day before her body was found. The McCann&#39;s are still putting out aged photos of Madeleine and getting tips when Maddy is dead as a dodo. People swear that Elvis is alive and well and eating fried peanut butter sandwiches in Hawaii. It doesn&#39;t mean he really is. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re willing to have s crack at me, how about having a crack at answering my question? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a user posting that there is documentation from a company called Clean Harbor or something. It&#39;s in that link. I was following this thread since the morning and sorting by &quot;new&quot;. The user has a comment about &quot;I may be deleting soon&quot; and then the most recent on was someone saying to pm her (presumably her) and they would explain their first hand account of the incident and she responded &quot;ok!&quot; And then it got ghosted. </p>

<p>edit: if I had to hypothesize, <a href="http://cspsandyhookreport.ct.gov/">this</a> was the supporting evidence that a clean up occurred by Clean Harbor, Inc. It was posted by a couple users refuting the lack of accountability for who performed the cleaning. Maybe it was enough for the OP to rescind and delete. </p>
