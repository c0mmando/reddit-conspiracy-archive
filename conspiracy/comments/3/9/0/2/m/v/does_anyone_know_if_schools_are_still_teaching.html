        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I remember learning about MLK at a very young age, I&#39;d say between 3rd and 5th grade, and remember that every test pertaining to MLK had a question that required us to know who was responsible for his death, with the &quot;correct&quot; answer obviously being James Earl Ray. As I&#39;m sure many on this subreddit are aware, in 1999, members of MLK&#39;s family sued the government for a total of $100 in damages in an attempt to reveal the truth about the assassination. More info on the trial can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEP94AVshrs">Here</a>, as well as official and full transcript of the trial <a href="http://www.thekingcenter.org/sites/default/files/KING%20FAMILY%20TRIAL%20TRANSCRIPT.pdf">Here</a>  </p>

<p>This disturbing verdict was obviously suppressed by all forms of major media, but with an official verdict it surely can&#39;t be legal to teach children legitimately wrong information. Does anyone know if schools are still teaching this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A civil trial was held, much like the criminal AND civil case against OJ Simpson. While OJ was not convicted in his criminal trial, he was found responsible for civil damages.</p>

<p>James Earl Ray was found guilty in a criminal trial, recanted and the King family was unable to get a retrial. They sued in a civil trial, evidence was presented and items like a military sniper team was very close at the time of the killing, the fact that the Memphis police cleared brush from the sniper&#39;s area making it appear there was no place to hide and other little known tidbits were discovered at this trial. The US was convicted and ordered to pay the $100 the King family sued for.  </p>

<p>It as not a play trial, it was a real American court with real rulings. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the gun that the owner of the building was told to stash a day before the shooting and paid to get rid of afterwards? And the last minute change of rooms to an open balcony? There&#39;s footage of MLK&#39;s brother <em>shaking hands</em> with James Earl Ray. It was 100% proven that he was not at all responsible for the assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US government was not convicted of anything.  The US government wasn&#39;t even being <em>tried</em> for anything.</p>

<p>A jury found one man guilty, in a civil trial, of wrongful death. The story implicated the government, but since the government wasn&#39;t on trial they could not be convicted, much less ordered to pay any money.</p>

<p>The man who was ordered to pay the $100 later profited <em>heavily</em> from the whole ordeal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would be surprised about how many events or people are either skipped or just given half truths about in school now.</p>

<p>The us school system is honestly nothing more then indoctrination into the work force. Think about it. They start classes and end at the same time as Tue work force. Many teachers issue homework to get accustomed to working longer hours which you shouldn&#39;t be as a kid.</p>

<p>Then what do you really learn in school? They don&#39;t teach you how to balance a checkbook. How to do taxes. You sure as shit don&#39;t learn critical thinking. You do learn to obey right away. Yeah that catchy phrase is tought within preschools by police</p>

<p>Parents do not become involved within their kids education. Its complete disregarded by adults because they think its fine. Its altered every fucking year now. So that they don&#39;t know its fucked.</p>

<p>Got a 6 year old myself and I will be <strong>THAT PARENT</strong> . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We just finished our topic on the American Civil Rights movement at my school. This is in Australia, so I&#39;m assuming American textbooks delve more deeply into the subject, but our book only briefly mentioned that he was assassinated, and what he was advocating for at the time. Absolutely nothing about who the killer was, which I guess is better than perpetuating a lie. Although one of the students did ask our teacher why he was assassinated, and she rattled off something about how &#39;they caught the guy who did it&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;Education&#39; system is really just a mind programming system - according to David Icke. For this reason it is often the case that &#39;historical facts&#39; are often ignored. On a related point I have always been angered by the teaching that &quot;Lee Harvey Oswald Killed JFK&quot;. The fact is that he was never tried and found guilty by a court. He was only tried by media but yet according to the history books Oswald was guilty.</p>

<p>It is disturbing to think that real history has been clearly twisted by the &#39;correct&#39; answers to who killed JFK and MLK. I really do wonder how much more of our history is a TOTAL LIE? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I graduated high school last year. Any time I would mention MLK or JFK being assassinated by the government/agency, I was called a crazy conspiracy theorist. The history classes are very bland, usually the dumbest teachers in the school taught history, they did not believe in open debate on historical events/politics (just memorized facts), and in all honesty... History classes were probably the worst part of school. And I greatly enjoy history for the most part</p>

<p>Of course the tactic would be to not even defend yourself. Get as much distance as possible. </p>

<p>Just because it was a civil and not criminal trial doesn&#39;t mean that the verdict is meaningless. </p>

<p>No you really don&#39;t. Your only comments are against 9/11, Boston, Sandy Hook, Flat Earth and Chemtrails. You never comment or have anything intellectual to say on other things like the Federal Reserve, Police Brutality, or just anything in general that the public needs to know and take action on.</p>

<p>Every one of your comments are snide remarks and you attempt to debunk everything. You don&#39;t believe in any conspiracy yet you refer to this sub as &quot;us.&quot; </p>

<p>Every time I call you out on it, you don&#39;t reply. You sport the user name HaltNWO, as if you&#39;re trying to put a halt to the advancement of a One World Government, yet everything that is signifying to us that a One World Government is coming to fruition, you &quot;debunk&quot; with disinfo.
