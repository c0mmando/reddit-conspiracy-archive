       The greatest trick George Bush ever played on the world was convincing it that he is stupid.
      </p>

       It's all an act, and the world is stupid for having believed his act.

       If you can't tell that the man is obviously saying "strategery" so that you will all be distracted and talk about how he said "strategery" for days on end so that you won't talk about actually important things, you're an idiot.

       I remember seeing a Youtube video a long time ago that played clips of Bush speaking as president alongside other clips, from much earlier in his political career, where he spoke much more strongly and intelligently. The video tried to make the point that, on the basis of his worsened speaking ability, Bush's mental health was declining, and we should be worried. But all I really took from the video is that Bush had the capacity to present himself much more coherently than he was doing, and, for some reason, he just wasn't doing that.

       Yea Bush was a douche, but im kinda with you on your point. I feel as if he was just a figurehead. Like the queen of England. Or Obama, just another puppet to relay a message to the masses. Good rock talk.

       Cheney fits that definition. Best example is the testimony from

        Norman Mineta
       </a>
       revealing that Cheney told an aide to stand down when he questioned Cheney's response to one of the hijacked planes still being in the air.

       To be fair, the idea that Bush's cognitive abilities were failing is not entirely new or unfounded. A psychologist who wrote a book titled "Bush on the Couch" has the same theory. Bush had a pretty serious drinking problem, did coke, had Lyme disease, and almost chocked to death on a pretzel (that was the bruise on his face when he was in office. He passed out). He's got a pretty incurious and impulsive personality, judging from his behavior in the National Guard Air Force. The down hokey stuff might have been somewhat of an act, but there's no doubt Bush has issues.

       No, wrong, it's like you're just throwing out names in an attempt to purposely discredit the "playing the stupid card" trick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paris Hilton is an actual idiot, she's a rich spoiled attention whore who is completely unimportant, and only serves to act as distraction thanks to those idiots who can't just shut the hell up about her and never say her name ever again as if she doesn't even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Britney Spears is an illuminati controlled music industry puppet, completely clueless to what goes on behind the scenes. She's not pretending to be an idiot, she is an idiot, but she's completely unimportant so why are you even talking about her?
      </p>
      <p>
       Justin Bieber realized how corrupt the music industry is, which is why he's basically all but gotten out of it. Again, however, why are you even bringing up Justin Bieber?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not a politician, nor does he hold any form of position of power, so he's just complete distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lady Gaga is yet another illuminati mouth piece, doing what she's told for money, completely clueless to the occult symbology within her own music and music videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every individual that you listed is not using the "dumb person" trick, nor would they have any reason to.

       As someone who knows someone who grew up with Stefani Germanotta (Lady Gaga), I can assure you she's no idiot and she most likely knows EXACTLY what she's doing with all the occult symbology. She may not be coming up with all these esoteric activities, but she def has to be tuned into them. She may be a mouthpiece, but she's no dummy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor Britney Spears, however, I totally believe has been abused since childhood and is completely mentally broken. Bieber I'm guessing as well. Paris Hilton was the test run for Kim Kardashian, from amateur porn video to moronic reality series to sick circle of friends and lovers, except she doesn't have the same amount of ambition and immoral ruthlessness.

       As I was writing that I was thinking Lady Gaga is a horrible example to use as far as not knowing is concerned, I think that would be somebody like Katy Perry.

       As you stated, Gage definitely knows about many occult aspects of her music.

       Do you really think Katy Perry is an idiot? I'm not so sure; she hooked up with Russell Brand, and he's no idiot. I can't figure that guy out at all -- is he a jester now tasked with telling the truth so no one believes it? That can only go on for so long, I think, when he keeps saying smart things. But maybe not.

       Has Bieber really wisened up to the industry and tried to get out? I sure hope so. I would love to be able to listen to 'Baby' and enjoy it again, like I did before I woke up. Excellent pop tune, no matter which way you shake it.

        In addition to his analytical speed, what most impressed me were his memory and his substantive breadth. We would sometimes have to brief him on an issue that we had last discussed with him weeks or even months before. He would remember small facts and arguments from the prior briefing and get impatient with us when we were rehashing things we had told him long ago.

       Like I said, this is impressive to
       <em>
        dumb

       people. It being at Yale does not make up for his lackluster efforts. He was a C student as a history major. I repeat, as a

       major. That is
       <em>

       . That may be impressive to
       <em>

       , but to people like me who have more than two brain cells to rub together, that is not impressive by any stretch of the imagination.

       Actually SAT scores when GW took them were a proxy for IQ scores, he only barely cracked 1200, so not a genius, but probably better than you.

       I actually scored pretty high on the ACT. Didn't take the SAT. And I can care less about those test. Since I can't prove it anyways. I'm not stupid enough to think a random test taken as 16 year old teenager says anything significant about intelligence as you apparently do. Maybe because you couldn't cut it in the engineering and sciences so you need to hang your hat on some lame test back in high school to feel important? Who knows.

       Think of it this way: if someone came to you and said "I am responsible for shaping your entire career. Here is as much of the truth about everything as you can handle, the way the world actually works. If you ever tell anyone, you will find out there are worse things than dying."
      </p>

       If you're dumb, you might still talk. If you're (Ivy League) smart, you'll more than likely think "why go against the grain, when I can have the life I've been preparing for?"

I elected myself with a few others and then they taught us a terrible lesson: how to try to get people to do things when they don't want to and you have no leverage whatsoever.  It basically cannot be done unless you exploit some kind of deep-seated fear or perceived weakness in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that when you stand up to be a leader, you start to realize it's not what you thought it was and it's a hell of a lot harder than you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's when the hidden hand comes into play to help you out as you struggle.  Either with a powerful propaganda strategy ("Advertising", "PR campaign", MKULTRA project, etc), leverage in the form of power or world events, and suddenly you find yourself awash in powerful interests with strings attached to your arms and legs.  They don't, after all, give you these tools and techniques for free.

       The public facing "rulers" which the people see as the ones who actually rule the world,  are idiots to a certain extent.  They have to be somewhat incompetent in order to be controlled by the real power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real power,  which is not Obama,  or any other politician for that matter,  are absolutely not incompetent in any way shape or form.

       Everyone has parts of their lives they don't want people to know. When you are in a position of power, you are legally scrutinized to a level that most would find uncomfortable. That's why a lot of these people spend a lot of time and energy scrubbing or resolving their past before they become a public servant.
      </p>
      <p>
       People with secrets are the easiest to control, no need to hire the incompetent. Why do you think it keeps coming up that there's an inordinate amount of PEDOPHILES in public office?

       Very good point.  I guess my point was more that the majority of people believe that the politicians they see on TV are the ones with the power, and are the ones ruling us.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're saying is that these front men, or puppets are making idiotic decisions not because their idiots, but because they're being blackmailed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I absolutely agree with that.  You can take one look at Mitch McConnell and tell that he's got some serious skeletons in the closet which are most likely being used to control him.

       I agree that blackmail plays a large part in pol behavior as well. Look at Dennis Haggert. 3.5 million payout for a molestation victim (all under the table). The more heinous a public figure's past, the more malleable he or she is.

       Correct. The warrantless wiretapping was FIRST used against Congress. I facepalmed as everyone went on about their business, totally ignorant of the Watergate parallels.

       Whenever Congress starts to get a backbone, they are threatened with

       Where do the real rulers send their kids to school? That is what I want to know. My gut instinct is that they wouldn't even send their kids to school at all, but then again, what idea do I have what gets taught at those elite private schools? Could be real history, not the nonsense we get fed at our schools.

       I don't want to engage in the JewBash Moshpit. Yes AIPAC has too much influence on elections, legislation, and military policy. But the posting is about appearing idiotic while pursuing their own interests. I learned long ago the slow talking, dumbed down, verbally challenged are thinking twice as fast as you, generally sociopaths. Certain groups reward and promote amoral sociopaths, specifically corporations. Why do you think "limited liability" was written into law. Don't kid yourselves, though, because most of us are bamboozled and stupidly impressed by fast talking and big words in a suit, or lab coat, who are themselves sociopathic. Think of creatures that use camouflage. It is only necessary to have the APPEARANCE of integrity to get away with murder and theft.

       The public sees the rise of Hitler and other historical events as largely random, chaotic, etc., when in reality Hitler was balls deep in the occult, plotted every step of his rise, and declared he would take over Germany as early as 1923. This man had two or three noted spiritual teachers, was in the inner core of a secret society called the Thule Society, studied mass psychology in depth, sent a Nazi mission to Tibet to gain secrets from monks about higher awareness, received massive amounts of funding from American oligarchs, literally wrote a book about his plans before taking power etc. etc. And yet the average person thinks he was some raving lunatic who was just in the right place at the right time. I'm not defending Hitler or any of these evil mo fo's, but let's get it straight: they are highly aware.

       We are ruled by zionist jews. One thing you have to understand is that jews are very cunning. They know how to get things done. You can not underestimate them. They have mastered the art of lying, cheating, stealing, and deception to get what they want.

       So Israel backs its greatest ally in a war hundreds of miles kilometers from the country. Not too shocking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also like any group without border or a set leadership, you cannot just invade it. Sure AL queda was getting protected by the Afghanistan government but you can't just walk into a country and declare war on a terrorist group.

       Wait a minute wait a minute... jews are a small minority of the world population though... If there was such a huge disparity between jews in power vs total jews, it would almost make it seem like there was a massive conspiracy which vastly favors jews...
      </p>

       Nah.. people are just racist if they want to bring the fact that jews are
       <em>

       Whatever, we are perfectly happy to implicate Larry Silverstein, as someone who is not nebulous or indescribable, and also jewish. I'll also implicate Rumsfeld, Cheney, and Brzezinski in the same breath. Also, I'm betting no one here cares about what happened in 1000 AD...the time of the crusades. There's probably a different sub for that.

       First, I have no idea if your 'beliefs' about statistics are correct. Second, the vast majority of politicians are protestant Christian, and many oppressive policies (abortion, abstinence-only) stem from their beliefs. So no, I don't see Jewish influence exerting itself heavily in American life.

       They use the Christians as proxys. They're shabbat goys. They get their work done for them. Why does every presidential hopeful have to say how great Israel is. You don't see anything fishy?

       How's that a strawman? Judaism is Zionism. Zionism is Judaism. They're one in the same. As long as people pussy foot around talking about "zionists", we won't get anywhere as the monolith called the Jew is still around while people are focused on zionists.

       Easily explainable. There are 14 million Jews in the world. Obviously they can't be in all places at once, so they have shabbat goys do their work.

       No it's true. I've got a few jewish friends who also acknowledge that the majority of jews, the ones who sing the party line, are actively trying to destroy western civilization as it exists, to shape it to their own will, at the expense of everyone else.

       There's a GREAT jew named Brother Nathanael who has the balls to speak out against the massive corruption and conspiring by the rest of his past-brethren.

       Doubt it. Christians haven't been kicked out of 109 locations for usury and other things. Jews have it out explicitly for white European Christians. They will use their good goys to get what they want, destruction of the white race.

       Are Jews not a threat to Western civilization? Do you see how every politician has to how down to Israel, why? Why does every politician go to the wailing wall? How come every time people name the jew, they always take it back immediately?

       Replace Jew with "wealthy donor" and your accusations of politicians supplicating for cash will still stand. I have never seen a conspiracy that credibly blames ordinary, walk-to-the-synagogue-on-Sabbath jewish people. Ordinary jews don't know anything about WTC7 or Wall Street, so stop spouting hate.

       That's cute and all, and I can see where you're going with this, but until you understand that both sides are working together for a common goal, and acting as if they're working together despite their differences is just the illusion of choice.

       You can say that all you want, but the fact of the matter is that this is just not the case at all.

       Sure I will concede the Clinton dynasty leans on support from Israel just as much as say John McCain does.

      <p>
       But the democratic Senators, and supportive base is increasingly hostile towards Israel.

       This is my favorite bullshit to disprove.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How did they prove that idiots and conservatives are racists? They gathered two large data sets from the UK, one started in 1958 (NCDS), the other in 1970 (BCS); about 16,000 individuals in total, roughly equal numbers of males and females. The quizzed the groups when they reached 11 and 10 years old on their “intelligence”; they then came back to these individuals when they were 33 and 30 and asked them about their “socially conservative ideology and racism.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The authors do not say how many people they used in their analysis; how many individuals were lost in the 20 years between surveys is not noted in their paper. My read of the NCDS website (pdf) makes the loss about 30%. That leaves about 11,000.

        Intelligence was defined in one database as scoring well on matching the similarity between 40 pairs of words, and on matching the similarity of between 40 pairs of shapes and symbols. On the other database, this changed to drawing 28 missing shapes, recalling digits from 34 number series, identifying the definitions of 37 words, and “generating words that are semantically consistent with presented words” 42 times.

       And? That has nothing to do with the text above. Correlation is -0.01 for men and 0.02 for women? WHY EVEN PUBLISH THAT GARBAGE? It's a useless study. Yea, he can't read a high-school graph. Nice character attack on the man without saying anything to the text I linked. Typical.

       Great retort. I see you're a fucking idiot who can't say shit when his bullshit "facts" get disproven. Everyone else can tell how much of an idiot you are, because you can't say shit to this post, except ad hominem, shifted goal posts and character attacks.

You're posting garbage which I disproved and you're still going on about it. Who's low IQ? YOU ARE. You can't admit you were wrong so you have to play the RACIST game. Too bad.

       Just a quick question, if we are the circlejerkers, then why are we the ones attempting to engage in debate outside of our social circle? Havent seen you around on /coontown, friend. Maybe you're just projecting your own behavior?

       Actually the white race is known for its out-group altruism (empathy and compassion). To the point where people upset with Political Correctness/Cultural Marxism recognize that Jewish Dual-Morality allows for the manipulation of whites by preying on this out-group altruism.

       You're still going on with that garbage? I showed the correlation was -0.01 for men and 0.02 for women. SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED!! What a crock of bullshit.

       All you did was say racist and go to a character attack on the author of that piece, not once saying A THING to the text in my post. Typical to deflect to ignorant garbage when you have no idea what to say.

       OK? Does that have ANYTHING to do with my post, which you STILL haven't said anything to except a character attack on the author? Typical tactic from people like you. Ad hominem when you don't like the facts that are brought to you.

       You're wrong as fuck. Holy shit! I've never encountered someone like you who in the face of FACTS still has this stupid ass notion that you're right. Well, you're wrong.

      <p>
       Nothing but ad hominem, shifted goal posts and character attacks from you. Just what I expect from people when they're presented with evidence that they don't know what to say to because they know damn well they're wrong, so just like you're doing now, you play the "racists have low IQ game", which I showed you was a REALLY FLAWED STUDY, yet you still go on with that bullshit.

       As tempting as it is, (I certainly do it myself) I'll have to pass on reading studies which essentially boil down to the worst part of partisan politics which is "well I'm smart, so obviously people who disagree with me are dumb".
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if the irony of labeling huge swathes of people as "dumb" or "stupid" based on arbitrary factors, while at the same time demonizing racists for arbitrary beliefs is at all lost on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       See I have no problems being a racist, or labeling groups of people. I own it. You try to deny doing the same thing, while taking the high ground.

       It's pretty easy to label a racist an idiot, because to hate a race is just fucking stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am on the moral high ground, I believe all people of all colors are equals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it quite humorous when I turn the prejudice around on the racist and they immediately go into attack mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't handle being ostracized and fall apart to the point of insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       They want to dish out their little racist comments and cant handle it when it's turned onto them.

       Well, then the more enjoyment for me.

      <p>
       I agree that's what Zionists want, yes. But then again, I'm intelligent enough to understand the distinction and make it on the regular. This reductionist worldview is a very specific Anglo coping mechanism to legitimize a pathological desire to conquer all which is not white and make it so.

        I agree that's what Zionists want, yes. But then again, I'm intelligent enough to understand the distinction and make it on the regular. This reductionist worldview is a very specific Anglo coping mechanism to legitimize a pathological desire to conquer all which is not white and make it so.

        ZIONIST JEWS

       are running shit, but can't put together that even when the Zionists are gone, if they ever will be because how can you tell the difference between a "Zionist" and  Jew? YOU CAN'T. Which is just what they want.

      <p>
       Please do tell. How do we tell Zionists from regular Jews?

All Zionists are ideologically erroneous, but Zionism is not Judaism.
Neither is Judaism in support of Zionism.

       The current crop of psychopaths have nothing to do with judaism (nor with christanism, islam, or any other religion). Regular jews are just as much victims as all others, and can be allies. By stupidly blaming all "joooos" you simply distract from the real problem. Also, your white victim crap is simply ludicrous.

       Keep talking about just zionists. Do you think that when all the zionists are gone that we'll be fine? No. The jew will still be there. Hitler noticed this. Hitler put a stop to this. Once the jew was out of German daily life, it got better. Jews are parasites.

       Nah. You said prove they are, I said prove they aren't. All you need to do is look at who runs the media. Look at all of the locations they have been kicked from. Look at how quickly someone takes back their statements when it's critical of the Jews.

       Thieving manipulative race.

       Hmmm... being kicked out of 109 locations in almost 2000 years for usury isn't thieving and manipulating? I don't know what is.

       It's the very definition of a fallacy. Which is why i linked to the definition of that particular fallacy. Your belief in a fallacy doesn't make it NOT a fallacy. I know a lot of Americans like to believe that because they are American they are always right, even when they are expressing an OPINION. This is also not a valid reality.

       Actually, they're hidden behind layers and layers of fall guys who each have very little understanding of what they're doing. Either way, though, none of that excuses the foolish talk of "jew masters," as though an entire ethnicity is secretly pulling strings in the world. That just makes us look like idiots.

       How many countries have whites been kicked out of? Only one that comes to mind is Rhodesia, and look what happened after they were gone, destitute farmlands, the people there didn't know how to farm, but mugabe didn't care.

         Turns out, Americans never gave smallpox blankets to any Indians anywhere at anytime. Not the government, not the Army, not anyone. So we are absolved on that one. The incident in question occurred in 1763, before there even was a USA, before there even were Americans. And American colonists (pre-Americans) didn’t do it either. It was the British that done the deed, and the one man who is always accused of doing it never even did it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although we do not know how the plan worked out, modern medicine suggests that it could not possibly have succeeded.
         <strong>
          Smallpox dies in several minutes outside of the human body. So obviously if those blankets had smallpox germs in them, they were dead smallpox germs. Dead smallpox germs don’t transmit smallpox.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the apparent scientific impossibility of disease transmission, there is no evidence that any Indians got sick from the blankets, not that they could have anyway. The two Delaware chiefs who personally received the blankets were in good health later. The smallpox epidemic that was sweeping the attacking Indians during this war started before the incident. The Indians themselves said that they were getting smallpox by attacking settler villages infected with smallpox and then bringing it back to their villages.

You're not concerned about a very real case of your very real government lying to you knowingly and intentionally about a direct, multigenerational cost to taxpayers - but you ARE very concerned about this conspiracy ALL JEWS are in on to RULE THE WORLD like some bad 60's Bond villain?

       You're right. Whites made sure to destroy all non-white centers of knowledge in Africa, the (now) Middle East, and South America to make sure they stayed on top too, stealing all the stuff they found useful along the way.

       Saaaay, it sounds like you're admitting that WHITES run the world, not Jews. Are you confused, maybe?

       Our government isn't made up of Jews, and they're going along with the plan, right? Wouldn't that mean that they're ZIONISTS, and not Jews to a man? Feel free to ignore that logical hiccup in your propaganda as well.

       Center of knowledge in Africa? HAHAHA WHEN WAS THIS?!! It was the Muslims who destroyed the Library of Alexandria the last time IIRC. South America? I do agree about the MesoAmerican civs, but if you think they just went into MesoAmerica with just 200 people and conquered, you're wrong. They had help from neighboring enemy tribes.

       Doubt it. Christians haven't been kicked out of 109 locations for usury and other things. Jews have it out explicitly for white European Christians. They will use their good goys to get what they want, destruction of the white race.

       smart. He fucked up the economy, he was a C student in college. He didn't study the sciences or engineering or math. He did liberal arts and
       <em>
        was still a C student
       </em>
       in easy classes. He is not smart, not a whiz. He is smart to dumb people.
