       People are more concerned with Ellen Pao banning subs that are literally nothing more than hate sites than actually posting conspiracy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major developments have been happening in the world of politics as of late. Alex Jones has done a tremendous job of covering the Dennis Hastert/pedo blackmail stuff and Bilderberg these past couple of weeks. I know some people here are not his biggest fans but when someone finally starts covering the hot topics this sub is always going on about, you see none of it here.

       Reddit won't let me make a post because, "Looks like you're either a brand new user or your posts have not been doing well recently." Since this thread is about Bilderberg, I figured I'd share something I found. (I'm not sure if it's something most people already know about or not, so forgive me if it is common knowledge.)
      </p>

       you can find information about a proposal by the Danish Defence Intelligence Service(AKA the "FE") that gives the FE potentially more power than the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2015/03/03/denm-f03.html">
        This article
       </a>
       , if I understand it correctly, confirms that this proposal has passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thomas Ahrenkiel is the head of the FE and an attendee of this year's Bilderberg conference.

       It's been "almost here" &amp; "clearly visible" for the past 14 years. I think I first heard about it in 2003.

       Hardly.  No US media outlets will publish anything on it.  If they do, it will be a small editorial piece at the end of the conference, and the focus will be on the "conspiracy theorists" who talk about it as part of a "new world order" one world government tinfoil hat theory.  And I guarantee that next year it will be in maryland or virginia, because it has to be close enough to DC for the candidates to sneak there without anyone knowing about it.

       The only large outlet that covers it is the Guardian, where Charlie Skelton does so with comedic effect.  And the only reason he started covering it was to make fun of Alex Jones, but he realized quickly based on his treatment that this was no joke.

       What does it matter what happens in Bildeberg? The jews already have sunk their teeth so far into western civilization that honestly, there is no way it can be stopped. The only man who stood up to the jews in the last century was villified and went down as the most evil man to ever live. And anyone in the future willing to stand up to the jews will meet the same fate.

       I think most of it is bullshit. Humans are good at making connections even ones that arent there. I do buy certain ones like priming people about Iran and nukes, or Israel testing responses to a dirty bomb and then 2 days later saying that there is evidence that a dirty bomb could be used on them shortly.
