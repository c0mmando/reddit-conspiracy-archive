       With how much subliminal messaging/propaganda/symbolism I see in every movie, tv show, video game, and song.. That alone keeps confirming my beliefs about this fucked up place.

       Is this some kind of power? If so I would like an apprentice, someone worthy of wielding it. I would like to pass it on, because I have seen far too much.

       This life ain't easy. Especially when you were stupid enough to be smart about how the world really works. Stupid enough to think that you could accomplish change without the rest of the nation behind you.

       Yea, I was sitting there wondering if anyone else was thinking what I was thinking. My guess was probably not. No one that I know believes in conspiracies or cares about their liberties getting taken away :/

       Jurassic World was entertaining. Well, the first part of the movie was slowish but then stuff started going wrong and I started having fun. I still like parts 1 and 2 better, though.

       JW was fun but if I had to be honest with myself, it could have been just an action movie with dinosaurs and not a JP movie. I don't know why I feel this way, however. You do get to hear the same theme song as before, there are familiar faces from the previous movies, and other things I don't want to spoil, but if you take those things away, it just didn't feel like JP. :/

       Is it a good show for people who like post-apocalyse kind of shit? I need something to watch with my gf, and watching Friends is gettin' kind of old. Yeah, it can be funny when I'm high and drunk, but I can't help thinking: "man, I fucking hate people like this in real life. I mean Phoebe seems cool but the rest of them are a bunch of goddamn yuppie sheep."

       First series was ok decent story and characters a little propaganda as always but not so much it ruins the show. Filtered into the yeah sure box. I imagine the pitch was "walking dead - on a boat!"

       The commercial really rubbed me the wrong way. It just seemed so deceiving. Like they were trying to make drones look like the good guys. I dunno. I guess I'm really harsh on drones and against their existence in general.

       It seemed deceiving because it was deceiving. They were just trying to put drones into the best light possible. Kind of like the Marine Corps commercials painting us as distributors of humanitarian aid.

       It's really about how and who is using the drone, them being a thing is inhabitable in one form or another.
one positive uses i saw is
       <a href="https://vimeo.com/108448978">
        drone racing

       - honestly it looks bloody amazing and if i had the cash it would quickly become a new hobby.

       Wow, I noticed the same thing, except the thing that strikes me most is the subtle fearmongering exacted by the AMC ads themselves - the "report suspicious characters" shpeal followed by a scene of cartoon people comforting themselves with soda and popcorn. Almost all of the movies they advertised were in some way related to the military. How many WWII and Cold War spy movies are they gonna make? Comfortably propagandizing periods in America's military history that are most easily portrayed in good guy/bad guy terms..

       A GLOBAL force for GOOD! The problem isn't whether or not you enjoyed your time there as an individual. It's about what the highest ranks are doing to act as a global police. All in the name of "national security" and "national interests". It goes against everything we were founded upon.

       Copy and pasting a comment I left above with a little edit:
      </p>
      <p>
       The lineup of commercials that I saw last night were not typical before-movie-commercials. There was a common theme. Usually, the ads would be for things like an upcoming album, a soda company, or a local business. If the commercial for the navy was in a typical lineup like I just listed, I would not have thought it to be propaganda.

       yo! what did you just turn 17 and buy your first movie ticket? They play a national guard ad before every movie. At least once. I have seen it played twice before. The one where they show the nondescript town destroyed by a flood. That one must have played for 5 years straight.

       Look, they have a marketing budget, they use it, its like that before every movie, navy or army, because they know idiots go see movies in theatres and idiots listen to what they're told.  They're just trying to boost their numbers to get more funding by spending shit tons of money that is funding...  It's cyclical, not a conspiracy.  Granted I don't like drones used by police or military, though the underground racing in Australia seems cool.  Also I have my issue with military policymakers and follow through as well.  But this is just advertising to boost numbers.  We're not a country that has mandatory enrolment for the military, and believe it or not enrolment numbers are dropping.  They need bodies or they can't justify costs, simple as that.  So yes propaganda, but isn't all advertising propaganda?

       nope. did i say that? dont try and make this about you and whatever argument you want to start. I loved my time cause i had a good fucking time and i have a wonderful job now as a civillian because of it. I went in for purely selfish reasons. take your agenda somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: since you tried to guess. Ill tell you. I went in cause i was a pothead and managed to drop my GPA from 3.8 to a 2.8 from the time i started highschool to the time i left. I want to see a little bit more of the world than Virgnia. I had no interest in college but wanted the GI Bill so i could pay for it when i did acquire an interest. I wanted to sleep in a bed every night and wanted 3 hot meals a day. I wanted to work with computers. Your safety is in your own fucking hands.

       its the honest truth. i would bet all the money in the world over 80% are in to support their family financially. I went in when i was 18, but a staggering amount of people i met were coming in at the age of 25-30. Without a proper support system its very easy to land in the gutter as a civilian. My analogy for the military is like bowling with bumpers. You can fuck up but cant land in the gutter. your ass is going to make it to the pins. maybe not on the straightest path for some, but you will reach the end. This is the reason i got out. I wanted to see if i could make it without the safety net. I found it scary and its very easy to get institutionalized just like a prisoner. That is scary to me than a recruitment advert.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found out in places like germany people who join the military are looked at as citizens who could not make it any other way and thats how i felt personally.

       Great analogy. I have friends in the military and it seemed just like a safety net of sorts. Not that all soldiers are government dogs. I'd hate to see my life left to ruin knowing there was something I could do. Even if that something was supporting an unfavorable group.

       Did you really just try to claim the last ship is Propaganda? or that Samsung marketing something that can be attached to a drone (which have become very popular) is also propaganda?
      </p>
      <p>
       The army has been trying to get people to join since the very start, this isn't propaganda it's just how things work.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, this last ship one made me laugh, it's a fucking TV show and a bad one.
      </p>
      <p>
       The show is based on a book where a nuclear war between the US and soviet union broke out and the ship is searching for a new home for the crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       They just updated it for today and decided to go with virus, which by the way if this counts as propaganda every other movie ever made about a pandemic also does because the military is heavily involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in reality a pandemic like this the military would be heavily involved, that's just how it works.

       They have an interest in recruiting people in order to keep the army running.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people joining the army actually get a ton of perks, they're not being forced to join.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't anything wrong with marketing, and calling it propaganda is pretty cringe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also are you trying to imply people that join the military are gullible? what makes them gullible?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a good job with good benefits, and can really get you ahead in life with the training and experience you get.
      </p>
      <p>
       This just sounds like a typical conspiratard point of view that thinks anything involving the government is bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are people that sign on to be loggers gullible? job is more dangerous than the US military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are people that sign on to fly planes also gullible? because they have a higher death rate than the US military as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good to apply logic to things, I know a bunch of people in the military and they love the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're getting an education and training that will be with them for their entire life.

       The association between gullibility and military enrollment stems from the fact that those not seeking COD-style thrills or future financial security typically have a strong sense of patriotism, and join because they want to protect US citizens as well as people of foreign countries. This, of course, is a fallacy, as anyone on here will tell you; anyone with basic typing skills can get on google and understand what our military is really used for, so those still signing up with naive dreams of spreading freedom are thus considered gullible, having been "duped" by US propaganda.

      <p>
       Most people join the military for experience or to help pay for school.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact I can cite a few studies saying conspiracy theorists are more gullible than other people if you'd like.

       Nope, that comment was based on conversations I've had, seen, and been relayed about young people, usually males, who have been served a vainglorious vision of what being a soldier is about. This, paired with the undeniable nation-wide obsession with FPS games results in a hobby-level fascination with guns and military glory that transcends into enlistment. Those are the thrillseekers. Sure, many people join to save their finances or to boost their careers, but what does THAT say about the military's place in our society? Enlistment=/= gullibility.......patriotism strong enough to convince you to desire killing another human being, however, does.

       Why would the US be in wars for humanitarian purposes? that isn't what the army of any country is for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you mean humanitarian efforts, the US has every other military on the planet beat by a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       They respond to every disaster worldwide and help people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you're misunderstanding what a military is for, a military is for defense and protecting your interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vietnam was a war to protect US interests, as the south was an ally of the united states and being attacked by the north.
      </p>
      <p>
       Korea was pretty much the same thing, south Korea was our ally and got invaded by the communist states, that means it was in the best interests of the united states to intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first Iraqi war was to protect an ally of the united states, and to once again protect our interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second Iraq war was a long time coming, it was still a stupid war and it's the only one I'll disagree with the reasoning for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Afghanistan, the Taliban needed to be taken out of control, and before you claim the US built the Taliban I'm pretty well educated on the subject and the Taliban is in no way the Mujahidin, in fact the guys the US armed during the soviet war in Afghanistan ended up fighting the Taliban.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US military does amazing research, has given us many technologies and is not a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also like to point out people in western countries are many times less patriotic than people in other countries, I believe the last poll said about 55% of people in the united states said they would defend the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe had an average of like 20%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia and all of those other countries were over 90%.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you can show me a superpower in history that didn't act to protect their own interests, the argument is over.

       I grew up in a military family.  My dad was a lifer officer.  He joined because he was poor.  Then they had him become a gangster for capitalism.  He did some nasty shit.  All because it was a "good job".

       The lineup of commercials that I saw last night were not typical before-movie-commercials. There was a common theme. Usually, the ads would be for things like an upcoming album, a soda company, or a local business. If the commercial for the show was in a typical lineup like I just listed, I would not have thought it to be propaganda.

       I've seen military ads at these places before, I had to watch spy kids back in the day and they had military ads before the movie.

       I think you are over thinking a little bit. Commercials having you enlist is a commercial and not propaganda. Its goal is to clearly recruit you.

       Get serious. Military recruitment ads are some of the worst propaganda out there. Just because you're used to it doesn't mean it's not propaganda.

       You think people sign up as a hypnotize drone and only wake up when they are homeless on the streets after their discharge date. You must have zero respect for your common man and must believe you are the smartest person in the room 24/7 to believe people are being hypnotized by propaganda. I know in the same breadth you will expel no pity for enlistees. I bet you have babbled on about how you are disgusted how soldiers are worshiped.

       A recruitment ad relating the image of a young man fighting a dragon as a knight in shining armor to service in the armed forces is a fairly textbook example of propaganda.
