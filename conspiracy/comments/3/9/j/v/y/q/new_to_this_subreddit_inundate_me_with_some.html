       Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.  All dank memes aside.  It totally can't and if you accept the fact that 9/11 was perpetrated by the US government and then consider that almost EVERYONE buys the official story, then what other sinister shit are they capable of ?

       No one has proved any steel melted.  My understanding is some firefighters saw a bunch of shiny stuff, and didn't take any samples.  Perhaps it was melted aluminum, or something else.

       Let's assume that's true.  All we have is anecdotal evidence from several fire fighters and response personnel, of whom were under severe stress and not likely to be reliables sources of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did the US government cart away all of the debris from the collapsed buildings and sell it for scrap to 3rd party organizations?  Why has no (official) independent analysis been done on the wreckage?  Why did they spend more time and money investigating a president getting a BJ in the Oval Office than the New Pearl Harbor?

       Yes, I know.  I wasn't claiming it to be.  I clearly said, let's assume the previous statement to be true, which presumed the uncertainty of melted steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was merely following the thought experiment that leads to the multitude of things that simply don't add up on 9/11.  Even if you can explain for one, two, or even 10 things, it still seems highly likely that there are shenanigans afoot.

       There are unexplained or contradictory things in any big event.  Eyewitnesses disagree or are wrong.

       Sounds like you have no evidence that any steel melted.

       Burden of proof is on the conspiracy theorists to show some solid evidence that supports their claims.  So far, they have zero.

       Sigh...yes I know it wasn't evidence and, again, I simply wanted to continue the discussion on the inconsistencies.  I was accepting at face value that there was no molten steel (there was) and then even still there are many inconsistencies that shed doubt on the official story.

       I am not interested in talking about "inconsistencies".  Everything has "inconsistencies".  Talking about that is the last refuge of people who have no evidence whatsoever yet want to prop up their desired conclusion.

       I see alot of discussion about jet fuel/melting steel etc and I would just like to set something strait. Steel does not have to melt for it to be compromised. Steel loses HALF of its strength at a mere 800 degrees. I don't know the actual melting point off hand but it's well over the typical temp of normal structure fires. The temperature and scope of the fires burning in the world trades were easily within the range to contribute to a collapse. Anyone that denies this is a liar, an idiot, or is horribly misinformed. Whether or not the steel melted is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a firefighter and have personally been in a steel frame structure collapse on the scene of a warehouse fire. Steel buildings are not invincible. I was at the station the morning of 9/11 and watched the whole thing live and we all talked about the possibility of collapse, talked about whether or not the fire pumps would actually be able to get water to the fire floors due to the trauma that the buildings had experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the whole truth about 9/11. There are many things that point to our government, things that dont add up. The Saudi's definitely have been pulling our strings and we have been doing thier bidding in the middle east for some time now due to the petro dollar status. The whole damn world is a cluster fuck as far as I'm concerned but man I wish people would stop discrediting legitimate questions of fact with bullshit theories/uninformed opinions/ignorance of basic reality.

       There seem to be two contradictory conspiracy theories going on here:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         steel melted, which is impossible in jet fuel fire, so must have been thermite or demolitions or something.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         steel can't melt in jet fuel fire, so how did buildings collapse, must have been thermite or demolitions or something.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Of course, there is no evidence to support steel melting or thermite or demolition.

       Yes, and they took no samples.  Maybe it was aluminum, or glass, or something else ?  And if they saw it long after the event, it's less likely to be steel, which has a high melting point.

       problem is that ignoring the advanced tech... is important to this discussion of how we are being lied to and what about.
      </p>
      <p>
       to just relay that we are being lied to is not enough, they need to know the depth of the deception, that it goes all the way back to the foundation of our language.
      </p>
      <p>
       as my friend who speaks 17 languages has said...
      </p>
      <p>
       english is the language of theives..  why?  because all the double meanings and ways of hiding your true intent while apparently speaking 'truthfully' .    by disguising truth and allowing people to speak in double meanings has the affect of negating the natural way lies come out, because telling lies is readily apparent, but if what i say is 'true' in one sense and taken another way by the receiver, you have a case where the liar can more easily conceal their lies as they are 'telling the truth' from their perspective.

       a little investigation would show you the 'planes' that hit were not what they said they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       on record is the speed of these 'planes'  ... which exceeded the maximum speed of the aircraft they are supposed to be by 100-200 mph..  at sea level.
      </p>
      <p>
       these 'max speeds' are for cruising altitudes were the air is less dense, at such low altitude at such speed the wings literally would tear off.
      </p>
      <p>
       this did not happen.  as such we can conclude they were drones or something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       as for the lizard people.... whoever is running things are de-evolved humans that lost their capacity to feel.
      </p>
      <p>
       so they might as well be lizards people if they aren't truly lizard people... there is little difference.

       And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication: And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration. And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns. The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth. And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space. And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition. And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast. These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful. And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues. And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth. (‭Revelation‬ ‭17‬:‭1-18‬ KJV)

       And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God: For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever. And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen; Alleluia. And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and great. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God. And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND Lord OF LORDS. And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God; That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army. And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. (‭Revelation‬ ‭19‬:‭1-21‬ KJV)

       After years of reading, note taking, bookmarking, brainstorming and researching on every conspiracy you mentioned and more,
       <a href="http://www.lawofone.info">
        this

       has to be the most interesting single collection of information I have ever come across.  Which ties very much to the first link I provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language and nuances of the way they speak, once you're able to decipher it, is truly fascinating.  And while I have absolutely no proof to offer any validity to the material to which it speaks, the two taken together really do offer a very unique all-encompassing position to which all conspiracies can be explained.

       We are seeing an explosion of autism, Alzheimer's, not to mention massive die offs of bees, phytoplankton and other animals.  There are surely other contributing factors, but nanoparticulate heavy metals used in the sprays have the most devastating net effect on earths life systems.  The haarp report on YouTube has some fascinating insight on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to the wealthy being poisoned alongside, take any other massive corporate crime or environmental degradation into account and realize that these insane 'boys with toys' do not care about side effects to anyone or anything if it means they can achieve their desired goal. In this case, the goals are multifaceted at each level of involvement, but its mainly about a race for power (again) and making tons of money. Read 'Owning the Weather in 2025' to get a more clear picture of what's going on.

       I agree with the comment on autism, etc., but is that due to geoengineering? Or is it a combination of other stuff, from vaccines to GMOs to poisons that spray our food, etc?

       Making tons of money to rule a planet that's completely ruined? I don't know.

       You're right to think toxic soup of everything is contributing to a general decline in human health, and there are other contributing factors to poisoning us including shitty food, water fluoridation etc.  We also know that they're spraying. If you look at the numerous patents on geoengineeringwatch dot org you can garner a sense of what's being sprayed.  Aluminum is one of the big components causing such documented health problems, and in the form its in there is no  other way for it to arrive in the environment in the massive quantities it is than from geoengineering aerosols that are documented as happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you don't immediately see all the parts does not mean they are not already place. It is a vast and interlocking conspiracy after all. These activities have been present and developed since the end of WWII.  Good old Enron gave geoengineering a new life blood with seed money and incentive to ramp up spraying through development of weather derivatives, betting on the weather and not losing.  From disaster capitalists, to thieving aid groups, to carbon millionares, not to mention the anonymity and power gained by being able to manipulate weather forces at will, it becomes easier to see the power lust at the core of this shadowy side of history. Not to mention one of the big goal of melting the arctic to open it up for oil exploration, again an old topic.  That the sprays are also toxic seems to be an unfortunate after thought on their end, but obviously not of concern enough to let go of the weapon.  I encourage you to do your own research and check out geoengineeringwatch dot org and also corebttreport has a few great episodes on the topic.

       The real "horrifying facts" are that these conspiracy theories do real harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the lesson we learn from 9/11 is "govt is evil" or "the Jews did it", when the real lesson (I think) is "we should stop supporting dictators and invading countries", we risk more 9/11's.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the lesson we learn from big events (9/11, Boston Bombing, HIV/AIDS, Ebola) is "don't trust anything the govt or scientists say", that helps lead to "deny climate change, refuse vaccines, deny evolution".
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theories generally are a form of religion: belief without evidence, even belief despite the evidence.  This harms our country and our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there have been real conspiracies.  Yes, there is plenty of malice and incompetence by govts or govt agencies.  But these conspiracy theories are a different thing: start with desired conclusion, and invent/deny facts to justify it.

       The real conspiracies are not in this sub. The real conspiracies are how we eat, how we think and speak, cars, our entire fucking way of life. You don't need illuminati for the problems, just basic human ignorance and greed. To me, that stuff is scarier than any hypothetical pedo nazi lizard or w/e.
