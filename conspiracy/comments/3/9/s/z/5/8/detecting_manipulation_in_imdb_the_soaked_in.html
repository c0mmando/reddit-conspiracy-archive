       I've dealt with a lot of surveys and preference aggregation in my life. I've wrote code and designed modules for several software products in several information spaces. Here's the phrase for the day:
"Bulge around the mean with spikes at the extremes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning IMDB.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will typically have a semi-normal curve around the average rating for a movie. Since their rating curve is 1-10, if a movie has an average rating of 4.3 (Biodome), then you will see a large amount of users giving Biodome a score of 3, 4 and 5, and you will see the distribution bulges out at that point.
       <a href="http://imgur.com/DlKRCO6">
        http://imgur.com/DlKRCO6
       </a>
       In addition to this, you always have a spike of support at the extremes... one and ten. Usually, 20 or 30% of people will be spike voters... LOVE IT/HATE IT!!!
Let's look at a loved movie, generally, where the actual average is around one of the extremes... BRAVEHEART!!! WOOT!!!
       <a href="http://imgur.com/5kF39ql">
        http://imgur.com/5kF39ql
       </a>
       Here, you see that the average is 8.4. That means that the number of people voting for 8 and 9 will be approximately equal (167k vs 154k). Similarly, the natural amount of people who actually gave it a 10 should be roughly equal to the natural amount that gave it a 7, excluding spike voters. We see that about 80k people gave it a seven, and 180k gave it a ten. From this, we can deduce ROUGHLY that 100k of the 10's are spike voters (approx), and we still see a spike at 1, even for Braveheart.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we look at a more controversial film, we will see a higher amount of spikes... up to 40 or 50%, although this is highly unusual, it does happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bowling for Columbine is fairly controversial, but shouldn't attract too much zeal... as we see:
       <a href="http://imgur.com/aGvWWqs">
        http://imgur.com/aGvWWqs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price is rated, with a bulge around the mean (6.8) and spikes at the extremes (15%-20% spikers)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go to Fahrenheit 9/11. Very controversial, now.
       <a href="http://imgur.com/V86VH9v">
        http://imgur.com/V86VH9v
       </a>
       You see major spiking here... as expected. Median, 7.5. That looks right. Spiking looks to be about 25%-30% around the extremes. This is a divisive movie, but the scores still look legit, although the spiking around one looks a bit high, you can see from the fairly normal age/gender/geography graph, that this probably isn't majorly manipulated.
       <a href="http://imgur.com/cLI0RVR">
        http://imgur.com/cLI0RVR
       </a>
       See how all the categories are roughly 7-8. You can see on the other movies that the categories look pretty normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW WE COME TO - Soaked In Bleach:
       <a href="http://imgur.com/hCHYvrt">
        http://imgur.com/hCHYvrt
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This doesn't even resemble a real movie. From a first look, you can see that about 1000 of the votes follow a normal curve centering at 10. The other 2500 votes are distributed between one and two.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of 3 votes gives it away. I am expected to believe that the standard deviation of the no votes is far less than one. Anything less than 100 3 votes is HIGHLY suspicious (demonstrably 95%+).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a movie with a natural score of about 8. There are a LOT of spike votes at ten because it is contraversial. Those are the natural spike votes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone decided to kill this movie, and they didn't have a statustician look at it, or the guy would have said, You need WAAAAAY more 2's and 3's.
      </p>
      <p>
       There should be a BULGE at the weighted average of 3.9.
      </p>
      <p>
       A total of 4 people out of 3,600 gave the average vote. That screams fraud so loudly that I had to write this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, refer to the bottom chart, and you will see a demographic breakdown of the attackers.
They are obviously in the United States. No one under 18 works there, and no females over the age of 45... few people over the age of 45, in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a 10.0 movie... but I'd say it's around an 8 or an 8.5 with a bunch of concerned people clicking ten because "YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm about to go watch it, now that I know it's worth burying.

       I actually haven't spotted many. When anyone does this on a site with any sort of analytics, it takes a deft hand to pull off successfully. I used to nail YouTube all the time, and then they disabled their analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a while, YouTube experimented with labels... instead of voting up or down, you could say, "Good Quality", or "Incorrect Information" or "Enraging"... that lasted about two weeks, because tools like that make it VERY, VERY hard to get shit past me =P And about 1 million other people who are looking at exactly the same stuff with exactly the same tools.

       I watched this movie yesterday and if anything this movie has provided enough plausibility that this was a homicide more so than anything else. To see if anyone felt my sentiment, I checked out a thread on the front page with Courtney getting her lawyers to remove the movie from theaters and everyone on the top comments just absolutely bashed this movie without giving it an ounce of viewing.  I am very interested to see what you have to say about it since Tom Grant literally had this movie in play out in sequential time events and can supply supporting evidence to his claims.

       Don't underestimate the cleverness of those who wish to f*** with you. If he was killed by... let's say, Sony (no reason to think he was, but I don't like 'em), then a great move for them would be to manipulate the stats of an errant movie to draw more attention to it. I must admit... I'm a sucker for such things.

       Interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time Ive ever noticed clear manipulation of IMDB was during the first few weeks of season 1 of fox's 'fringe'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first 3 pages of written reviews all made similar points with a similar voice and all gave the show low scores (1-4). most were probably written by a single person, because if you trudged through them to the fourth page and beyond, every single review became unique and colorful and positive, written by different people, with scores like (8-10). It seemed like someone had the ability to control which reviews were being seen and had frontloaded the system with a bunch of fake ones to hide the actual positive response that the show was receiving.  If I remember correctly the actual score/avg was being hidden too, it said something like 'not enough reviews to calculate' even though there were well over 100 and I kept coming back for 3 weeks to see if it had changed and it never did.

       It's really dangerous to tamper with sites that have analytics. It's also dangerous to fuck with any data about anything having to do with Seattle, Washington. I know about a dozen people, just like me who I've worked with at different places that would have an INSTANT, STUDIED bullshit response to seeing these graphs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they're fucking with Kurt. We fucking love Kurt, so I'm predicting I can wake a couple people up, just a little, with just this story. I've got all my screen shots and evidence, and I'm ready for the next Nirvana fan I meet. I guarantee I'll get people to watch this movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even care if the movie is accurate or well done. I'm trusting the numbers and the numbers say it's a 8-10 that was f***ed with by a concerted effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know that Courtney would have anything to do with this, but it certainly makes it a hell of a lot more interesting that the movie is being buried. Oh, what I wouldn't give for a list of IPs. Even if they are proxies, it'd be nice to see if we have 2500 votes given through proxies, or from clusters of IPs.

       Start a thread. Make a petition, and ask IMDB to correct their stats. I'm 99% certain they are not complicit in any manipulation, because it was done so poorly. If you get a few hundred people to pop their name on a petition, they will probably fix it.

       Have you watched this? I won't have time until next weekend. Do you think it more implicates Courtney, which I've heard... or is it just the general questioning around the investigation that strikes home the most?

       It definitely implicates courtney in having something to do with the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spoiler alert?  she readily admits that kurt said he was divorcing her.  She is on tape talking about how she's leaking lies to media in order to help her sell her alblum thats' about to come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       She files a missing persons report with the police under the name of Kurt's mother in which she quarter back's the whole scenario by telling them he's supposedly suicidal and owns a shotgun.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shotgun is purchased/registered under the name of a guy she inserts w\ the PI to look around and act as her point of contact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of fishy stuff.  The police back then weren't willing to look at anything other than suicide and ruled it suicide before any forensics came back.

       It's super plausible and very fishy. She would be the perfect person to set up for this. I've been watching a few vids from their whole life. I'm going to reserve judgment on the specifics, but it seems pretty obvious that the investigation was bungled... it seems like there had to be someone inside the investigation, and I'm fuzzy on that link. Perhaps you could clarify, if you have some info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Courtney have influence or contacts inside the police?
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've seen, Kurt seemed like he had his stomach thing under control... finally found a medication that worked, and he seems to have been in a decent mental place around the time of the "suicide"... so that's suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something fishy that I haven't heard mentioned... So, Courtney left her backpack at that lawyer's place for a week, and the lawyer didn't call her. Instead, at the end of the week, she rummages through the backpack? Could she be involved in a set up? It seems super weird that she would leave SUCH an incriminating piece of evidence in a lawyer's office for a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this was too easy to catch. I have to usually get out Excel and do some work to detect manipulation. This is SO obvious that it begs the question, why? You don't run a vote manipulation company without knowing all this. You'd NEVER try to alter a vote with a bunch of ones and no actual votes around the arithmetic mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe there are several people involved, and they are trying to pin it on JUST HER. If she "committed suicide" now, it would practically be, "Case Closed". Everyone would say the Guilt got to her... but maybe it was the Lawyer, working for the Record Company working for Obama working for the Reptilians... hmmm.....

       The conspiracy theory on her is that she was a cia child etc etc, i don't prescribe to that but I've heard it recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more damning thing to me is that she quarter backed the investigation by filing the missing person report as his mother in which she state's he's suicidal and has a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       She put it out there before he was found that he was suicidal and had a gun that was registered not to him but to a friend of theirs who she had running errands for her.

       Hope, it was worth wathing the movie. If you are convinced the Case should be reclassified to "Homicide", then please help to get this petition at goal:

       What even helps more is to write to various King County officials. The SPD obviously is not interested in reopening of the CobainCase bc it would expose the coverup done 21 years ago.

       After a lot of review, I'm of the hesitant opinion that Kurt was killed and C was implicated just in case it wasn't believed to be a suicide. The best thing you can do if you like or don't like Courtney is to get an interview with her. If you've ever talked to her, you'll know it's not as difficult as it sounds. A lot of people in Seattle know where she lives. Most don't think she killed Kurt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't think she's that calculating. She's a pretty straightforward individual and pretty accessible.

       Good luck. Justice needs to be done in this case. You really should go talk to Courtney and get her on camera. I can sign the petition, but it needs some celebrity kick. Go down to 1st street or over to the bars/clubs by the stadium and ask bartenders and DJ's if they could contact her. Tell them what you want and be honest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you think she is guilty, you can probably get her to do an interview if you ask the right way. In the end, that's why I don't think she's guilty. She doesn't seem to have any cunning to me.

       i know this is a crazy idea but if courtney was actually just a loving wife that legitimately lost her husband to suicide it would make sense that she would want to suppress this movie. if she was innocent this movie would be very hurtful and highly offensive. it would also probably convince people that she is a heartless murderer which is also pretty shitty in its own right if she was innocent.

       ABSOLUTELY. Keep your eyes wide open, and don't follow the carrot if you see a string attached.

      <p>
       Your comment goes hand in hand with my oft recited soliloquy. Don't underestimate your competition, or they will OWN you. If it wasn't Courtney, this would be a great way to draw more suspicion her way, or it might be an obvious manipulation, meant to be caught... by one of the publicists for the movie. Also, I could be getting paid to point this out, as part of the ploy.

       why would i need to see the movie to play devils advocate? its perfectly reasonable to suggest that love would want to suppress the movie even if she was innocent. maybe even more so. if anything i think you are a shill paid to promote this movie.
