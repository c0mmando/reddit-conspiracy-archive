No idea where next. Berlitz crash cause or get staff in at the venue ahead of time.

       Luke's got balls for his style of ambush journalism. I've seen him with Kissinger, the 9/11 players, and even a Rockefeller.
      </p>
      <p>
       But damn, can he put on a sports coat and cut his hair? Maybe talk like a professional journalist? He's approaching serious topics, but he comes across like a college kid working on a class project.
      </p>
      <p>
       His audience are those of us across the country who are upset with the current situation, but we have jobs and families that we can't afford to lose if we spoke up. There are many of us who are trapped. Sure, we love our middle income, but we can see the future and it doesn't look bright.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is Luke...clean yourself up. Present yourself as someone the "elite" and professional America can respect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep doing what you're doing, but tuck your shirt in...

       You are right, outer appearance is the only thing professional journalism is about today, because in that profession you have to compensate the missing credibility of the articles. We are very unlucky that Luke prefers investigative journalism and not just reporting what he is told. So I do not think he can afford a shinny armor that blinds his audience.

       So then the situation seemed pretty fucked then doesn't it? because it seems that unless one is willing to stick their neck out, not much is going to get done...and if one is already heavily beholden to a house, a car, family, a "this" payment and a "that" payment, and they have to stay in their 9-5 wage slave job in order to keep holding on to all these material things, then it seems nothing's really going to get done.

       Fuck that.  He's clean enough.  Luke, keep doing what you're doing.  Keep focusing more on exactly what you're focusing on:  The stories and issues you're actual reporting on.  If someone isn't going to give you credit because you have a t-shirt and jeans on, then they're simply not paying attention.

       Give me a break.  This is the exact kind of mindset that is more worried about appearances than actual content.

       The "elite" - and "professional America" as well for that matter - is a big part of the problem in this country and planet that people like Luke Rudowski are calling out.

       No worries, bro.  Sorry.  Didn't/don't mean to come across antagonistic to you.  I understand what you're saying, but I just, again, strongly feel that content is

       Luke R consistently addresses important issues that mainstream press refuses to, and he does so by getting in the faces of important people.

       I see your and the previous poster's point well enough, but this is a perspective that is overwhelmingly shaped and manipulated by the MSM - an MSM that is the problem in the first place.  The "This how things should be done!" paradigm set by TPTB really is part of the problem from the get go because it causes people to base their understanding of an issue not on content, but on presentation...and this is an m.o. that is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       bad - one that is made almost effortlessly easy to fool for those individuals pulling the strings because they know that people that focus too much on and pay too much attention to presentation over content are individuals that are not thinking critically enough to know when they're being lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who cares about how anyone is dressed?  Listen to their
       <em>
        content
       </em>
       and what they say - not how they say it or how they're dressed when they say it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll admit that there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       indeed a "line of presentation", however, and it wouldn't be good to cross that line if one wants to be taken seriously.  I don't think Luke's crossed that line to any extent whatsoever, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, take someone like Alex Jones.  I think
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       dude is so annoying in his presentation style that I
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       pay attention to his content.  He's one dude that, although he dresses nice and has nice backdrops in his presentations, he spits and screams and rages in almost everything he says...so I just don't even pay attention to what he says regardless of how valid it might be because he seems to cause more harm than good based on
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       he's presenting things.  Jones' presentation style pretty much entirely clouds his content.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think Luke gets even
       <em>
        close
       </em>

       Dude...these videos you're linking...well, are pretty hard to watch through because the people sound like bumbling idiots...and the other video you linked has a bunch of distracting music playing in the background.  It's like wtf?  The presentation really
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       suck big time.  However, looking through as much of the other video you linked as I could (which wasn't
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of it because, again, the presentation really was so stupid and annoying and just so laughably bad that it was really hard to take it seriously and get through too much of it), it seems that there's a possibility that those two individuals
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be the same person.  I'll grant that.  Rudowski
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be Milewski.
      </p>
      <p>
       and no, I was not aware of that before, as you implied in your other response.  I didn't know anything about Milewski before.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Milewski is Rudowski, then that would show that the chicanery is very ubiquitous and around every corner - which I knew already, but it just shows that one has to be extra careful still.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Luke Rudowski's nothing but another cointelpro limited hangout operation, then it just shows that one has to watch their back and be mindful of what information they pay attention to around every corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take what is useful, and discard what is not.  The information that Rudowski provided in the OP videos
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       very much useful and one would do themselves a disservice if they were to disregard them.  However, one should be careful at seeing Rudowski as any sort of "savior" whatsoever - or
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       for that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, take what's useful, and discared what's not.

       Just read the cryptome article. Good call of Luke to say those are COINTELPRO. They had all the hallmarks. Anonymous names, infiltrated the group when it was climaxing, interested only in in-fights,  a few years later there are no traces of them and no domain from where they operated is anymore in use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luke is still there kicking and they disappeared. How come they are not known to us when they are such superior human beings and knew always how it is done better than Luke does it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw that so often that I recognize them very easily. In 2010 you could have still doubts about Luke, but now we know better. Time will always show who is real and who is not.

       Dan Wallace was Lukes best friend. What are you even talking about?

       I knew Luke when he was underage and he was already in the 9/11 truth movement. I do not believe he was approached by the Intel communities back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Dan passed away in 2007 and was Lukes main motivation to be more aggressive seeking the truth of 9/11.

       Considering that so many people who did not know Dan made allegations of all sorts speak volumes about their credibility.  I mean in particular Tom Weiss, screwloosechange, Nico Haupt or anybody who claims there was foul-play involved. None of these characters have been beneficial for the movement. I do not think Sabrina Rivera, LaRouces or Luke did anything to Dan. There is no logical reasoning for a motive. He was not important enough to being assassinated and the only person around him when he died was his girlfriend. But his death is obviously used by outsiders to see if something sticks to it and by doing so they discredit the 9/11 truth movement and they anger the relatives and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply do not participate in that chitchat or this kind of yellow press material that lacks any evidence. If that is to your licking go on with what you are doing. I prefer evidence about 9/11 instead. We are here for the the real conspiracies and those personal attacks do not convince me at all to listen to these people.
