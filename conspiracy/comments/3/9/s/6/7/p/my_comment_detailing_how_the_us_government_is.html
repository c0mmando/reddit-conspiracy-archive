<p>Raoul Silva: Hello, James. Welcome. Do you like the island? My grandmother had an island. Nothing to boast of. You could walk around it in an hour, but still it was, it was a paradise for us. One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They&#39;d come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island? Hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait and the rats would come for the coconut and... they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you have trapped all the rats, but what do you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it and they begin to get hungry. And one by one...  they start eating each other until there are only two left. The two survivors. And then what? Do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees, but now they don&#39;t eat coconut anymore. Now, they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us.</p>

by Two-Time Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient
Major General Smedley D. Butler - USMC Retired</p>

<p>&quot;I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience there are generally two types of people - those who are good skeptics and those who are bad skeptics.</p>

<p>The bad skeptics are those who find things easy to believe, without having researched for themselves (and recursively, researched the sources of what they are researching, i.e. is a specific news source honest or not). The bad skeptic takes what he is told at face value, whether it&#39;s from TV, the New York Times, or from the local water cooler gossip. The bad skeptic has a very cartoonish view of the world - that is to say their understanding of what goes on around the world is caricatured to exaggerate certain features, and is heavy on the contrast. There is right and wrong, black and white, with little in between.</p>

<p>The good skeptic is one that assumes nothing, accepts no viewpoint of reality except that which they themselves can prove and verify, and keeps a log of &quot;hypothetical maps of reality&quot; in the back of their mind, as possible explanations for the phenomenon they experience. They gather information, judging how accurate that information can be, and store it in their ever increasing pool of data, and slowly start to develop a rich map which is a representation of reality - and not reality itself, but they understand this. </p>

<p>Rarely is it ever true that anything of great consequence on the global stage is the result of one man or of one group - it&#39;s a cumulative result of many different actors with different agendas unfaithfully steering a current event into an unknown (but purposeful) direction - to create events that are then perceived as &quot;problems&quot; by the general public, who then more readily accept something that is akin to a solution, from which mutual parties benefit as providers.</p>

<p>In all walks of life, in every group, you find the good and bad skeptics. I don&#39;t think the ratio ever changes much, whether you are on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or elsewhere. The idea that somehow those here are more aware of their reality than those who hang out in <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> or something is just another myth that the bad skeptic would believe without testing it for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Paranoia isn&#39;t healthy but understand is.&quot; You my friend are the one who nailed it. I get my views based on the facts that I can verify to be true. I can&#39;t even consider myself a consiracy theorist because, I don&#39;t really have any theories. I just can stitch together these things based on what my research has lead me to believe. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying you know who did 9/11 and why. I can&#39;t say any of that for sure. I always tell people I don&#39;t have a theory, but I <em>KNOW</em> that a plane didn&#39;t hit the field in shanksville, a plane did not hit the pentagon, and &quot;big grey, military planes&quot; hit the twin towers, which then dropped at free fall speeds which is impossible. So I don&#39;t know what happened, all I know is the story we&#39;re given isn&#39;t the truth because it doesn&#39;t nearly match the events we&#39;re told happened. </p>

Putin is doing this and Korea and China and the UK and so forth; the ruling class uses the 4th estate to send the message to the working class that the working class needs those Rulers because there is imminent danger. The danger is foreign so long as that propaganda works and the threat is domestic when the fear of the foreign threat is outweighed by the inhumanity of the ruling class. There have been temporary solutions in one place and time and rulers everywhere study how they came about and how to prevent them in their areas and time periods. This evolution brings about such crafty techniques as an agent provocateur, which most OWS couldn&#39;t define let alone counter-counter measure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/10/us-syria-crisis-rebels-usa-idUSBRE9290FI20130310">Americans are training FSA rebels in Jordan.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/3000-fsa-fighters-defect-isis-qalamoun-mountains/">FSA rebels defect to ISIS.</a></p>

That 6% represents those rich enough to afford slaves, it is not a measure of racism. You do realize the civil rights movement was only 50 years ago, but the civil war was 150 years ago. It wasnt jsut that rich 6% allowing it to continue. Your comment just pissed me off more than it should have i think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the comment probably pissed you off just the right amount.  For one thing, the figure is skewed enough to fit the famous quip about &quot;lies, damned lies, and statistics.&quot;  </p>

<p>Narrowing it down to a set of numbers for one year, 1860, shows that 35% of families in Alabama owned at least one slave.  In Mississippi, an optimist could say that less than half of the families owned slaves.  Or you could say that 49% did.  The only slave state that ranged in the single digits was Delaware.  Delaware.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who benefits from rumors about ISIS being funded by the US government? The answer is... the US government. For there would be few things better guaranteed to drain the most fervent support away from a radical Islamic organization than if it is believed to be being funded by the Great Satan.</p>

<p>I think this is a very credible contender for a case (and certainly not the first) where conspiracy theories are being promoted by authorities, with the aim of discrediting their subject. That&#39;s why you also see it being spread by opponents of ISIS, with the same aim. </p>

<p>I note, with interest, that when you Google &quot;ISIS conspiracy theories,&quot; on the first page of results you will find the likes of Time, the BBC, the NY Times and the International Business Times. You don&#39;t see that often with regard to other topics, shall we say. And it seems to be having the desired effect:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-magazine-dabiq-attacks-conspiracy-theories-causing-jihadists-flee-1502528">Isis magazine Dabiq attacks &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; causing jihadists to flee</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The publication also features an article suggesting that the terror group is losing militants to conspiracy theories. Titled Conspiracy Theory Shirk (Sin) the piece implies that some fighters have grown delusional because of conjectures saying that IS is a puppet in the hands of western intelligence agencies. &quot;If the mujahedeen liberated territory occupied by the kuffar [infidels], they would say that the kuffar allowed them to do so because kafir [disbelievers] interests&#39; necessitated a prolonged war,&quot; the article reads. &quot;According to these theorists, almost all the events of the world were somehow linked back to the kuffar, their intelligence agencies, research, technology, and co-conspirators! Conspiracy theories have thereby become an excuse to abandon jihad.&quot;</p>

<p>Because, of course, it was <strong>so</strong> stable previously. Oh, hang on: it has actually been the least stable region on Earth over the past hundred years. Whoops. </p>

<p>Here, let me clue you in on a little secret: neither the CIA nor anyone else need to do anything &quot;to destabilize the reason.&quot; It has been unstable for a hundred years, since well before the CIA was even dreamed of. Do yourself a favor and look into the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, after which Western cartographers totally ignored tribal and religious boundaries and carved up the region with straight lines. [See also: Central Africa] </p>

<p>Nor is there any need at all for the CIA to fund ISIS, because copious, <strong>proven</strong> historical record - not dubious allegations - show there are more than enough oil-rich Muslims perfectly willing to open their wallets to fund extremist movements. You want to &quot;destabilize the region&quot;? Just wait for a few years. It&#39;ll destabilize itself perfectly well, without any action by the CIA. That&#39;s the reality here: the conspiracy theory is much more likely to be the conspiracy theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, two stories from Fars News, the <em>de facto</em> propaganda arm of the Iranian regime - who, of course, have no agenda of their own to push! - and a naive analysis of the DIA report from an equally virulently anti-US site, whose other headlines include &quot;World on Verge of Corporate Takeover While Congress Sleeps at the Wheel&quot; and &quot;America’s Corrupt Justice System Drives Innocent 22-Year-Old to Suicide&quot; No, absolutely no possibility of bias there!</p>

<p>I love how some people gobble up blatant propaganda when it fits their agenda. If that&#39;s what you consider &quot;facts,&quot; then there&#39;s absolutely no point discussing this further with you. </p>

<p>Have a more credible analysis, since you seem desperately in need of one. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/06/the-isis-conspiracy-that-ate-the-web.html">The ISIS Conspiracy That Ate the Web</a>: &quot;The intelligence report about Syria is just that — a report, It’s not a policy directive and there’s no proof that any action was taken based on its analysis. Nevertheless, people across the political spectrum are taking it as if it were a presidential order. Anti-Muslim bigot Pamela Geller thinks it’s a scandal because it proves President Obama knew about ISIS and chose to do nothing. Geller’s outrage is the inverse of the indignation expressed by far-leftists like the Guardian’s Seumas Milne who takes the report as proof that the U.S. abetted ISIS to sow discord in the Middle East, part of a grand divide and conquer strategy. Neither one seems to understand what they’re actually looking at.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s certainly grounds to suggest that <em>in the past</em>, SOME objectives of SOME members were in line with American policies. But the use of the present tense &quot;is funding and arming ISIS&quot; by OP, is in no way supported, even by your own sources. It&#39;s as dumb and baseless a claim as the one that the CIA funded 9/11. In reality, the CIA funded a wide range of anti-Soviet groups in Afghanistan, one of whom then unexpectedly morphed into Al Qaeda and bit the hand which had fed it. This is called &quot;blowback&quot; and is a well-known hazard of intelligence work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be somewhat familiar with Sunni radicalism in the form of Wahhabism (which is the ideology of Sunni radicals like ISIL (ISIS), Jabhat al Nusra, Al Qaeda, the Khorosan Group, etc.), and the Sunni vrs Shia divide in the Middle East. </p>

<p>Wahhabis hate the secular nature of certain Middle Eastern governments such as Syria and Libya, as well as despising the Shia led government of Iran.</p>

<p>The governments that ISIL wants to overthrow are by and large secular or are those who are governed by Shia, which are also coincidentally friendly to Russia. This has made them natural allies of the US, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey. </p>

<p>So you can see why the US has supported these radical Sunnis now for decades. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not just ISIS the US has been funding, arming, training and providing intel to. Any Sunni Jihadists have been the largest beneficiaries of US and US ally support for the Syrian opposition, and this has been the case for decades.</p>

<p>In the period following the Second World War, the US has engaged in covert operations and coup attempts in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries due to their support for Socialism and Russia (just as has happened in South and Central America, Africa, and South East Asia):</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Syria">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Syria</a></p>

<p>This means that in the ME the primary choice of opposition was radical Sunni Islamists due to their rejection and violent opposition to the inherent secularism of socialist leaning governments:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-s-uprising-in.../29221">http://www.globalresearch.ca/syria-s-uprising-in.../29221</a></p>

<p>This has lead to decades of violence and conflict between the Syrian government and the Sunni radicals, and terrorist attacks against Syrian Christian and Alawites. The Sunnis due to their lack of political dominance in the country have instead resorted to terrorist attacks against civilians and government officials in order to oppose the secularism of the Syrian government. Bashar al Assad had attempted to address this problem by allowing the Sunnis to have control over a semi-autonomous region of Syria if they relented in their terror campaign. The Sunnis being irrationally opposed to secularism of any kind continued their terrorist attacks against Syrian civilians and the government. This forced the government into a position to protect Syrian civilians and has lead to the increasing violence between the two factions we have this day.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Syria">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Syria</a></p>

<p>Syria&#39;s current uprising is not secular or based on the desire for democratic reform. The majority of the Syrian protesters and rebels have always been dominated by radical Sunnis who have wanted a government based on Sharia.</p>

<p>“Syria’s uprising is not a secular one. Most participants are devout Muslims inspired by Islam. By virtue of Syria’s demography most of the opposition is Sunni Muslim and often come from conservative areas.”</p>

<p><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/.../islamism-and-the-syrian.../">http://foreignpolicy.com/.../islamism-and-the-syrian.../</a></p>

<p>And that source dates back to March 8, 2012. But it doesn&#39;t matter because all anyone has to do is look at the history of which group has been the largest opposition to the Syrian government.</p>

<p>So I have to reply to this question from this account,  because my other has been banned.... again,  lol.</p>

<p>I had made this comment in a few subs, and it wasn&#39;t appearing on the site in any of those subs.  My question was simply what in that comment was causing it to not show up. </p>

<p>What <a href="/u/OWNtheNWO">/u/OWNtheNWO</a> said actually made the most sense to me. He said all infowars links are automatically sent to the spam queue. Can you confirm this? </p>

<p>Fantastic!   If your not making people angry in your activism,  your not doing a good enough job.  I&#39;ll take 12 SJW mod reports on my posts  over 3300 Karma any day of the week. Just confirms the information in mind. </p>

<p>I imagine that these 12 reports were what caused the admins to ban my account site wide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, your wideawakenwo account is definitely shadowbanned.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is correct and it&#39;s sitewide, infowars is one of the domains that automatically gets censored and needs to be manually approved.  I think naturalnews is one too and there are a few others.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Most likely, a lot of the reports claimed you were asking for upvotes.  I don&#39;t see that in your OP but perhaps you edited it out, that&#39;s probably why you were shadowbanned though.</p>

<p>But it makes very little sense since self posts don&#39;t give the OP any karma.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know how many reports over here come from there, but I doubt it&#39;s possible. I know I&#39;d probably set them to ignore, &#39;cause it&#39;s like they hang on every word over here, looking for something to mock or report. It&#39;s really weird and sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This whole Da&#39;esh thing is hilariously propaganda-y, at least here in the UK.</p>

<p>Every single day in the papers, they pick someone who has allegedly become radicalised and joined them, and show pictures of how wonderful they were before this shadowy monster got its hands on them. As I type this, there is an article in London&#39;s Metro showing a man stroking a cat at the age of 18 and then sporting a big beard after he changed his name to Akim and became a terrorist. And that&#39;s above a bit about how they are apparently all paedophiles and groom young girls.</p>

<p>The UK media reaction is making me really question how much of this stuff is just made up, because it always contains so much unevidenced speculation that I think it&#39;s all just fear mongering designed to support war spending or whatever their endgame is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are multple issues with the politics that you are talking about, they are vague at best and completly wrong if I am being frank. Not to say that there isn&#39;t a lot of bullshit concerning all this, and that the Way that the Us occupation in Iraw ended didn&#39;t partly creat Isis, but it is not direct or on purpose. Claiming this just takes credibility away from some of the valuable, good and right arguments that the US is partly responsible for the creation of ISIS, that 2 of the West&#39;s/ the US closest allies in the region or at least high ranking people in these countries  (Turkey and SA) as well as Qatar/Qatar buisness manüp are supporting ISIS and other rebel groups in some way.  </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t meditate on who or what filter action is being taken. It should just be a sign to you that your message is on-point. It will be good if we all understand the internet has its&#39; own deceptions going on.

If these countries descend into economic, social, and political chaos, then the threat they pose is minimal--particularly if the US and Israel are the principle backers of the insurgencies causing the turmoil.</p>

<p>Netanyahu knows that the longer his enemies are at peace, the stronger they become, so fuelling chaos within his enemies&#39; borders is a no-brainer type strategy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my experience there are generally two types of people - those who are good skeptics and those who are bad skeptics.</p>

<p>The bad skeptics are those who find things easy to believe, without having researched for themselves (and recursively, researched the sources of what they are researching, i.e. is a specific news source honest or not). The bad skeptic takes what he is told at face value, whether it&#39;s from TV, the New York Times, or from the local water cooler gossip. The bad skeptic has a very cartoonish view of the world - that is to say their understanding of what goes on around the world is caricatured to exaggerate certain features, and is heavy on the contrast. There is right and wrong, black and white, with little in between.</p>

<p>The good skeptic is one that assumes nothing, accepts no viewpoint of reality except that which they themselves can prove and verify, and keeps a log of &quot;hypothetical maps of reality&quot; in the back of their mind, as possible explanations for the phenomenon they experience. They gather information, judging how accurate that information can be, and store it in their ever increasing pool of data, and slowly start to develop a rich map which is a representation of reality - and not reality itself, but they understand this. </p>

<p>Rarely is it ever true that anything of great consequence on the global stage is the result of one man or of one group - it&#39;s a cumulative result of many different actors with different agendas unfaithfully steering a current event into an unknown (but purposeful) direction - to create events that are then perceived as &quot;problems&quot; by the general public, who then more readily accept something that is akin to a solution, from which mutual parties benefit as providers.</p>

<p>In all walks of life, in every group, you find the good and bad skeptics. I don&#39;t think the ratio ever changes much, whether you are on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> or elsewhere. The idea that somehow those here are more aware of their reality than those who hang out in <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> or something is just another myth that the bad skeptic would believe without testing it for themselves.</p>
