<p>The flat earth theory can be falsified on any clear night an hour or two after sunset by observing satellites in the sky[2], provided that one accepts either Occam&#39;s razor or common sense as valid stances. Plus sanity. Unless governments around the world are launching one-shot satellites every night to maintain the conspiracy, a flat earth simply won&#39;t support a constellation of orbiting objects.

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds as if you have made up your mind on the subject without considering the evidence and you are interested in making this person agree with you.</p>

<p>I have spent more than 200 hours on this topic.  There is some extremely compelling evidence that we cannot possibly be on a spinning globe and that the world must be flat.  I suggest you research it yourself from the beginning.  To do this properly you must put aside the conclusion that you have already reached.  Be aware that there is a lot of disinformation out there on this topic.  The &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot; is controlled opposition, they exist just to make it seem silly.</p>

<p>It is comforting to watch a &quot;flat earth debunked&quot; video on youtube, but they are full of problems.  They do things like rebut arguments that no legitimate proponent of flat earth would make.  </p>

<p>Water just doesn&#39;t curve over long distances.</p>

<p>Also, be very careful when you use wikipedia as a source for anything that is the least bit controversial.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have posted this response in another topic but it also fits in here very well:</p>

<p>I think this all goes a bit deeper. To be honest right from the beginning, I am a round earth believer and I know that not all flat earth believers are stupid (not everyone is parrotting nonsense s/he heard from a friend which read something on the internet what a friend saw on youtube). I think this all is just part of a huge controlled disinformation campaign in order to make people resistant for the upcoming disclosure and the massive information dump which is to come linked to this. Because if one gets the masses to disbelief in science and get them to not being able to distinguish honest and true science from fakes, then the masses also won’t believe in disclosure and other true informations coming out. Lots of us are looking for informations, and at some point you will come across the illuminati &amp; cabal groups, and if you are up to date you’ll probably know about the sphere alliance and the SSP’s. It is obvious (at least to me and many others) that the cabal groups have infiltrated the conspiracy theorists and it seems this is all well prepared. People around the globe are slowly waking up and are realizing that somethings not right here. People know that NASA, our politicians, the media, schools and what have you weren’t always truthful and honest. So I believe that this huge disinformation effort is to discredit science with the weaopns of the conspiracy theorists. It is basically their last stand because they know if that doesn’t work they, the cabal group, will be history. But no matter what, this time they’ll lose anyway. I have read a lot about flat earth theory and in every forum, and on youtube etc. at some point the flat earthers are fighting fiercly with the round earthers about their beliefs. This tactic is old, very old and it seems to work on us almost every time unless someone notices it. Not only on this topic but also on many others. Get the people to fight each other so they don’t care about the one initiating all of this. I think what we should focus on is prevent this useless namecalling, fighting, insulting and so on because aggression does not get you anywhere in this discussion. No one knows everything and the one who claims to know everything is a liar. Only full disclosure is real disclosure and anything other than that will be orchestrated by the cabal groups. Its as easy as that. Technically we could be much further than we are at the moment and if the real full disclosure occurs we have to be able to distinguish the fake from the real thing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to start to explain details of this because I wouldn&#39;t be able to do this as good as the ones who are doing this for years. But I can provide some links so you can research for yourself.</p>
