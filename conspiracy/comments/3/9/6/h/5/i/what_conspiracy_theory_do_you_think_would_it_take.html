       I'm not sure people "know" about the global child abuse ring; people I talk to about it just can't accept it. They don't WANT to believe it; it's not that they don't care. They simply can't believe that level of evil exists.

       Again, I don't agree. The media pounded the "lone pervert" message and that's what people wanted to accept. They don't want to imagine an institutional evil. It's not that they don't care, it's that they don't want to know. It's a big difference -- cognitive disorder.

       Really, I'm beginning to expect that when the veil starts to lift, it's going to all come rushing out in a short period of time, too much for everyone to keep up. 9/11, global pedophile ring, Boston, JFK, all coming at once...mind-blowing, overwhelming, and yes, maybe numbing.

       OK, you're right about Paterno's defense and ongoing redemption. But, again, people just DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE. That's different than knowing and not caring. But it's tragic either way, just more banal than outright evil (paging Hannah Arendt).

       We are experiencing the end of time as we know it. The end of humanity as we know it. It is not a good or bad thing either. It just is. The Last Blood should open up everyone's eyes to some hidden truths. From there all bets are off and a line in the sand will be drawn. God or no God. I roll with God.

       Only when something becomes acceptable does it become truth. The change starts from within, when the majority of people change themselves from within then they project that outwardly in the planet. All it is like everything else is a choice. An attitude away, a choice between fear, and love. That's all it is.

       The same system that is starting to crack and reveal it for what it truly is. The information has, is and continues to rise to the surface and more and more people across the world are waking up. It's not something that will happen overnight. But it's very evident that it is happening.

       You're entitled to your own opinion of course. You must remember that without us (as a collective) and our acquiescence that gives them power the whole house of cards will come falling down. They are not unstoppable and invincible as you seem to perceive them to be. It does no one good to dwell on these matters. If you want to change the world it starts from within, ask yourself are you the change you want to see?

       Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. (‭Matthew‬ ‭28‬:‭11-15‬ KJV)

       Our society has been so fucked in the heads for so long, I don't think they are ever going to do anything useful. It may be that a single strong leader will arise who is able to impose his will and turn things around for the better. Other than that, I have no hope.
