<p>Okie dokie, I can already feel the orgasm you guys are going to get when I tell you I&#39;ve disabled all inbox replies for my comments here. For every answer I look up and supply I&#39;m requested more. If you guys don&#39;t want to supply the actual proof and not the same few sensationalized youtube videos and documentaries, I&#39;m not going to continue looking up facts and doing your homework for you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious at this point that you are not intellectual skeptics, but rather sensationalist libertarian circlejerkers who have probably told everyone they know about their beliefs and can&#39;t turn back anymore. Enjoy the information you think you have about an event most of you don&#39;t seem to have actually researched aside from over-hyped skeptics who have since been proven wrong in almost ever aspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Collapsed?? No. Heavily damaged?  Absolutely!!</p>

<p>The Deutsche Bank Building was a skyscraper at 130 Liberty Street in New York City, United States, adjacent to the World Trade Center (WTC). The building, which existed from 1974–2007, was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon which also designed the Empire State Building and Peterson &amp; Brickbauer.</p>

<p>Opened in 1974 as Bankers Trust Plaza, the building was acquired by Deutsche Bank when it acquired Bankers Trust in 1998. It was part of the skyline of Lower Manhattan. The Deutsche Bank Building was heavily damaged in the September 11 attacks in 2001 after being blasted by the avalanche of debris, ash, dust, and asbestos that spread from the collapse of the South Tower. Five World Trade Center will eventually replace the building, expanding the ground space on which the World Trade Center stands, as this land was not part of the original World Trade Center. The structure has since been completely dismantled, clearing the way for the construction of 5 World Trade Center and the World Trade Center Vehicle Security Center.</p>

<p>Fiterman Hall and the September 11 attacks[edit]
<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Fiterman_hall_damage.jpg/227px-Fiterman_hall_damage.jpg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Fiterman_hall_damage.jpg/227px-Fiterman_hall_damage.jpg</a>
Fiterman Hall was heavily damaged from the collapse of 7 World Trade Center on 9/11.
Fiterman Hall was a 15-story building on the campus of this college at 30 West Broadway (also called 81 Barclay Street, 235 Greenwich Street and 82 Park Place) in Lower Manhattan. It opened in 1959 as an office building before owner Miles Fiterman, whom the building was named after, donated it to BMCC in 1993, which at the time was the largest private donation to a community college in U.S. history. It was renovated in 2000 to receive new windows and infrastructure. The building was owned by the State of New York Dormitory Authority.[3][4]</p>

<p>It was heavily damaged during the September 11 attacks in 2001, when debris from the collapse of 7 WTC compromised the structure. It became unsafe to occupy due to mold growth and asbestos exposure. Because traditional demolition would result in an unacceptable environmental impact, the building was scheduled for deconstruction and decontamination as part of the Lower Manhattan redevelopment project.[5]</p>

<p>Fiterman Hall was to have been replaced by a new building designed by the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners.[6] Deconstruction was scheduled to be complete by February 2007; however, environmental impact concerns and funding issues caused numerous delays in completing the project. At a press conference, which took place at BMCC on November 13, 2008, city and state officials announced a new agreement which solidified demolition and reconstruction plans through a funding agreement with New York City, New York State, and the City University of New York. In addition, approximately $80 million will come from an insurance settlement. Under the plan, the new Fiterman Hall was completed in 2012.[7][8]</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t there a marriot hotel, Deutshe Bank, and another office building, and I think something else? </p>

<p>If all those other buildings went down as well, then this is the first I&#39;m hearing of it. There were only three I&#39;m aware of.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn&#39;t it go down in a similar fashion? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you seen the video of it? People believe that WTC 7 was rigged with explosives because of the way in which it fell: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7BImVvEyk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zv7BImVvEyk</a> . Aesthetically, it looks very much like a controlled demolition (this obviously doesn&#39;t prove it was).</p>

<p>There is also a whistleblower named Barry Jennings that survived the WTC 7 collapse and was interviewed in the moment: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO5V2CJpzI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LO5V2CJpzI</a> . Later he appeared in the reissued version of &quot;Loose Change&quot; and describes being right near a bank of elevators when they exploded: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmeY2vJ6ZoA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmeY2vJ6ZoA</a> . He died within a month of the release of his Loose Change interview.</p>

<p>People also point to the BBC and FOX reports that show a reporter saying that WTC 7 (The Solomon Bros. building) had collapsed yet it was standing up in the background: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxFRigYD3s</a> . A scientist from the UK actually sued the BBC claiming they had foreknowledge of the all of WTC 7 and he won the case: <a href="http://www.sott.net/article/136726-Scientist-to-Sue-BBC-for-Public-Deception-over-9-11-documentary">http://www.sott.net/article/136726-Scientist-to-Sue-BBC-for-Public-Deception-over-9-11-documentary</a></p>

<p>Also, in your comment you asked &quot;Why are questions like these automatically downvoted&quot;. It&#39;s not because anyone is doing it, look in the New queue of r/conspiracy. There is a bot that auto-downvotes every new post so they can&#39;t make it to the general front page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Along with the 110-floor Twin Towers, numerous other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church.[148] The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3 WTC), and 7 WTC were completely destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it&#39;s the first you&#39;ve heard of the Marriot hotel and the church, buildings 3 through 7 sounds like more than one extra building...</p>

<p>Idunno, it sounds like you guys have your mind so set on something that you just kind of shit on anyone who even asks questions without trying to start anything and drive them to being mean in response to harsh criticism just so you can chalk it up to &quot;they&#39;re just dumb and crazy, I&#39;m smart&quot;</p>

<p>I feel like if you post enough facebook statuses about something you&#39;re so adamant about you kind of put yourself in a corner you can&#39;t get out of even if you&#39;re wrong. Not saying you&#39;re wrong, just saying what you&#39;re doing and the way you guys defend your points in such a hostile way in subreddits with like-minded people doesn&#39;t do anything to make you a skeptic, it makes you a lunatic. </p>

<p>Is there any other sites other than wikipedia? Any pictures? Being &quot;destroyed&quot; or &quot;badly damaged&quot; doesn&#39;t mean they collapsed in the same way as WTC 1, 2 and 7.</p>

<p>What have I said to you that comes anywhere near &quot;harsh criticism&quot;? Don&#39;t be a pussy. If you want answers to questions just ask them and I will explain the conspiracy angle on it. I know that I will never change your mind, you should know that you will never change mine. Let&#39;s not try to &quot;win&quot; an argument, if you are genuinely looking for information just ask. Everything else is noise.</p>

<p>This report shows that only 3 buildings fell. lol. I opened it up and looked for about 30 seconds before I found the map of which buildings fell and which didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>To get to the map: Open up your link, click on the Chapter 7 PDF (Peripheral buildings) and look at the color coded map on page 2. The &quot;Full Collapse&quot; buildings are coded in Black. There are only 3 of them on the FEMA map. They are WTC 1, 2 and 7. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve uploaded a screenshot of the map you&#39;ve provided that proves me right: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fLFwYxS.png">http://i.imgur.com/fLFwYxS.png</a></p>

<p>Thanks for the additional info.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious at this point that you are not intellectual skeptics, but rather sensationalist libertarian circlejerkers who have probably told everyone they know about their beliefs and can&#39;t turn back anymore. Enjoy the information you think you have about an event most of you don&#39;t seem to have actually researched aside from over-hyped skeptics who have since been proven wrong in almost ever aspect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now that I&#39;m looking at the map you&#39;ve provided: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/fLFwYxS.png">http://i.imgur.com/fLFwYxS.png</a> , something is confusing me. How come WTC 5 and 6 didn&#39;t fall completely even though they are much closer to WTC 1 and 2 (the actual buildings that got hit by the planes).</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t it weird that two buildings were hit by planes and went down but the only other building to fall without being hit wasn&#39;t immediately adjacent to WTC 1 and 1? How could it be that WTC 7 completely collapsed yet WTC 5 and 6 did not collapse even though they are much closer to WTC 1 and 2?</p>

<p>These are good questions you&#39;ve sparked. Thanks for contributing positively to the sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, basically, two other buildings (church and hotel) were damaged or destroyed, as well as the three WTC buildings destroyed.  Doesn&#39;t seem like &quot;numerous buildings that went down after the twin towers&quot; as you said elsewhere in this posting, or &quot;so many buildings in the area to collapse after the towers&quot; as you said in the title.
