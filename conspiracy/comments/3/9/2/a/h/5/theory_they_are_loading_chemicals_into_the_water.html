        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There are feminine hormone producing chemicals in alot of stuff, fact. Whether they are intentionally doing this cannot be determined by getting a confession out of someone, what we can do is determine motives.</p>

<p>The motives could include:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hormonal modification to make men lazy and demoralized, to make men less aggressive like how they gave Prozac to mental health patients and to dumb down our drive for success, so that we may remain dependent on the state and on corporations. This can explain the upswing in males being born gay, in young men being addicted to drugs, the increasing incarceration rate for males, and the ever decreasing amount of males going to college.</p></li>
<li><p>Women almost go unaffected by these chemicals, so their sex drive remains normal, why men suffer. This can point the finger at pharmaceutical companies, who give out female hormones to young men, then turn around and sell them viagra.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All corporations benefit from young men who don&#39;t have the drive to achieve success independent of corporations. Foods are proven to have addictive chemicals in them, peddling food like how a crack dealer gets you hooked and your body becomes chemically addicted. </p>

<p>Add chemtrails, gmos, fluoridation, cow growth hormones, designer drugs, and all products made from petrol, we are pretty much screwed. Move to your nearest hippie town and join a co-op, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment history is hilarious. To wit:</p>

<hr/>

<p>You are completely wrong and your citation is inappropriate. You are being completely intellectually dishonest. ...  </p>

<p>His arguments are not made sincerely. You are being naive and intellectually dishonest. There is no need to consider the points of someone named &quot;Autocoprophage&quot;. The word &quot;troll&quot; exists for this purpose.</p>

<p><strong>This is ridiculous.</strong> &lt;-- for me, yay!!</p>

<p>You are trying too hard to attack every valid criticism in these threads. You are not motivated by reason.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous and not even a sentence. And though teenagers may not realize it, &quot;butthurt&quot; is just the latest homophobic insult.</p>

<p>You should not be here. Your account is a few weeks old and routinely accuses others of being shills.</p>

<p>You&#39;re obviously posting substanceless, meaningless replies because you have an ulterior agenda. You are trying to &quot;catch&quot; criticism. Your original comment is the only mention of the JIDF, and I&#39;ve noticed a lot of shill accounts on r/conspiracy have a similar motif of self-description via account name.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;source?&quot; in response to my comment is nonsensical and further delusiveness.</p>

<p>The video and your comment are ridiculous disinformation. Noam Chomsky is a preeminent intellectual and critic of illegitimate power structures. He supports the proverbial underdog. These occasional, unsubstantiated attacks on such an esoteric subject are meant to deter people from edification via pursuit of Chomsky&#39;s works that accurately describe the extant systems used to control the world&#39;s various tiered populaces.</p>

<p>Yes, obviously you are not trying to be delusive by simply saying &quot;grabs popcorn&quot; in italics. No, that&#39;s a good contribution that fosters further discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This makes a lot of sense to me.  When you also add to it the fact that <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/03/14/your_tap_water_is_probably_laced_with_anti_depressants_partner/">tap water is laced with anti-depressants</a> already, it does become harder to believe that there isn&#39;t some grand social engineering conspiracy in play.</p>

<p>I definitely have seen a large uptick in the amount of gay men I see on the street.  There is no doubt that something has changed which is causing this growth of gay men, and your theory does make a lot of sense in explaining what might be helping spur this growth of gay men.</p>

<p>When they know that the side effects of BPA, or the plastic which is used to make baby bottles, has been scientifically proven to cause; developmental disorders, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, early puberty, learning disabilities, infertility, and gender confusion, <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/040056_BPA_FDA_infertility.html#">and still refuse to ban it or even label it harmful</a>, there is obviously some ulterior motive they have for using it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In The Quarterly Review of Biology, researchers at UC Santa Barbara and Uppsala University in Sweden have concluded through their research that sexual orientation can be decided through epi-marks, which are temporary switches in a fetus’ DNA that exist while in the womb and shortly after birth….“Genes are basically the instruction book, while epi-marks direct how those instructions get carried out. For example, they can determine when, where, and how much of a gene gets expressed.”</p>

<p>The study finds “sex-specific epi-marks, which normally do not pass between generations and are thus ‘erased,’ can lead to homosexuality when they escape erasure and are transmitted from father to daughter or mother to son.”</p>

<p>Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that at certain doses, can interfere with the endocrine in mammals. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Any system in the body controlled by hormones, can be derailed by hormone disruptors.</p>

<p>What chemical can be used to do this? BPA. BPA is a Endocrine disruptor.</p>

<p>Bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic endocrine disruptor widely used in the production of plastics. Increasing evidence indicates that in utero BPA exposure affects sexual differentiation and behavior. </p>

<p>BPA may disrupt epigenetic programming of gene expression in the brain…BPA exposure induced persistent, largely sex-specific effects on social and anxiety-like behavior, leading to disruption of sexually dimorphic behaviors.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gay.  I&#39;ve learned that I was fed soy milk (microwaved in BPA-ridden plastic bottles in 1980)  as a newborn infant. My mother, while pregnant with me also consumed a lot of soy and microwaved all her meals in BPA plastic. I may have found my &quot;root.&quot; </p>

<p>Scientists have used endocrine disrupters in hairless rat &quot;fetuses&quot; that turned the rats &quot;gay.&quot; It&#39;s been proven. Our country is the only one on earth that feeds infants soy milk. My mother might as well have been crushing up several birth control pills into my baby milk every day—that&#39;s how much estrogen was being put into my body while my brain was still developing. I think all that estrogen gave me a female brain. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  I really admire your courage and honesty. Thank you for this excellent, informative comment, as well as how it relates to your own personal experiences.</p>

<p>I actually have a twin brother (fraternal) who is gay, while I&#39;m straight.  He too is convinced that because he was not able to breast feed as easily I did, which resulted in my mother bottle feeding most of the time, while I breastfed, that the BPA in the bottle is what caused him to become gay, while I am straight.</p>

<p>Other then him being bottle fed much more frequently then I, there aren&#39;t any other real environmental differences which we can both point to as the reason for us having different sexual identifies. </p>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve found that your sexual identity may have been caused by a chemical you were exposed to, if scientists were able to provide you with a remedy that would reverse the effects of BPA, and thereby changing your sexual identity to what it naturally should have been to begin with, is this something you&#39;d want to do?</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t answer that question if you don&#39;t want to.  I am just curious how you feel about it reversing the effects now that you&#39;ve concluded it was caused by you being exposed to the chemical.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing that.  You and your brother&#39;s story certainly does seem to back up my theory. I recently talked with a scientist who told me there is a huge number of estrogen-mimicking chemicals in plastic besides BPA. That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. You don&#39;t have to take my friend&#39;s word for it. A simple Google search will pull up dozens of articles about it including one published by NPR in 2011. So if the government is even admitting it...just how bad is it, r/conspiracy?</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced that my brain developed this way while it was still developing. I don&#39;t believe science could change it at this point (my brain is 34-years-old and set in its ways) without changing my DNA. If it were possible however, I would not change:..but don&#39;t tell my mom, lol. If you had asked me in my teens and early 20&#39;s I would have given everything for the treatment or pill. I would have given a limb. As it is now, I&#39;m in love with a man and I&#39;ve fully accepted myself for what I am—a homo—whether it was genetic or caused by chemicals that deformed and damaged the development of my brain. At this point no, I would not opt to change. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to say whether or not the uptick in openly homosexual people has been due to hormones in our diet, or if it has been due to society being more openly accepting of homosexuals, but I have noticed a trend of decline in average masculinity in males, particularly younger ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not necessarily just endocrine disruptors, either:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a recent experiment in captive white ibises, many of the males exposed to the metal chose other males as mates.</p>

<p>These &quot;male-male pairs did everything that a heterosexual pair would do,&quot; said study leader Peter Frederick, a wildlife ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville.</p>

<p>&quot;They built their nest, copulated together, stayed together on a nest for a month, even though there were no eggs—they did the whole nine yards.&quot;</p>

<p>Wild white ibises—among the most common birds in Florida&#39;s Everglades—are exposed daily to mercury through their diets of crustaceans and other small invertebrates.</p>

<p>The prey animals take up mercury that&#39;s long seeped into the Everglades as a byproduct of industrial processes such as waste incineration.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101203-homosexual-birds-mercury-science/">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/12/101203-homosexual-birds-mercury-science/</a></p>

<p>On the subject of endocrine disruptors from 2009:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Poisoned Waters, Smith speaks with researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), who report finding genetically mutated marine life in the Potomac River. In addition to finding frogs with six legs and other mutations, the researchers have found male amphibians with ovaries and female frogs with male genitalia. Scientists tell FRONTLINE that the mutations are likely caused by exposure to &quot;endocrine disruptors,&quot; chemical compounds that mimic the body&#39;s natural hormones.</p>

<p>The USGS research on the Potomac River poses some troubling questions for the 2 million people who rely on the Washington Aqueduct for their drinking water.</p>

<p>&quot;The endocrine system of fish is very similar to the endocrine system of humans,&quot; USGS fish pathologist Vicki Blazer says. &quot;They pretty much have all the same hormone systems as humans, which is why we use them as sort of indicator species. ... We can&#39;t help but make that jump to ask the question, &#39;How are these things influencing people?&#39;&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/poisonedwaters/view/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/poisonedwaters/view/</a></p>

<p>There is scientific fact that certain pollutants directly cause homosexual behavior in multiple animal species, including animals from different classes. </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s a difficult subject to bring up these days because of the LGBT support. I have family and friends who are gay, there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with being who you are. I am not looking for a cause to homosexuality. </p>

<p>But yet we seem to have noticed a <em>trend</em> in this behavior. For those that mention homosexuality being common amongst Mediterranean cultures (and basically every other culture as well) might not be realizing that heavy metal exposure was quite common in many of those cultures as well. </p>

<p>There is absolutely <em>no doubt</em> that industrial chemicals are influencing the genetic development <em>and behavior</em> of fish and amphibians. It&#39;s my guess it won&#39;t be long until reptiles and mammals see more pronounced effects. Hell, it may already be happening, we just don&#39;t fully realize it. </p>

<p>On the other hand, I think all the synthetic testosterone being peddled on middle aged men is an unbelievable racket. Men have been artificially pumped up since the ate 70&#39;s/ early 80&#39;s. I dunno, I knew men from the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s that could perform physically when they were in their 80&#39;s. They just worked hard every day on the farm, ate natural food (raised themselves), and never went on a roid binge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there haven&#39;t always been &quot;gay people.&quot; The concept of the sexual orientation itself only first came into existence in the 1890s. Prior to this, instances of homosexual behavior were just instances of homosexual behavior, and that&#39;s it - the notion that a person would be exclusively attracted to the opposite sex was completely unheard of. The &quot;gay person&quot; is an entirely modern invention. It only exists as a symptom of the modern person&#39;s preoccupation with defining his own self and his identity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The word homosexual is a Greek and Latin hybrid, with the first element derived from Greek ὁμός homos, &quot;same&quot;(not related to the Latin homo, &quot;man&quot;, as in Homo sapiens), thus connoting sexual acts and affections between members of the same sex, including lesbianism.[17][18] The first known appearance of homosexual in print is found in an 1869 German pamphlet by the Austrian-born novelist Karl-Maria Kertbeny, published anonymously,[19] arguing against a Prussian anti-sodomy law.[19][20] In 1886, Richard von Krafft-Ebing used the terms homosexual and heterosexual in his book Psychopathia Sexualis. Krafft-Ebing&#39;s book was so popular among both laymen and doctors that the terms &quot;heterosexual&quot; and &quot;homosexual&quot; became the most widely accepted terms for sexual orientation.[21][22] As such, the current use of the term has its roots in the broader 19th-century tradition of personality taxonomy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you believe that? If you look at examples of homosexuality in history, <em>all of them</em> are sex oriented and indulgence oriented. Fucking a member of the same sex was just some deviant thing a person did, like buying a prostitute. There are <em>no instances whatsoever</em> of people actually seeking romantic companionship with members of the same sex, or people even expressing that same sex attraction was a legitimate thing that occurred outside the context of indulging a sexual fetish. Why do you think that is, if the concept of homosexual orientation supposedly existed for thousands of years?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not really about the secret itself but how would these people handle the consequences. For social engineering how do they protect their own family from its mind altering consequences. Exclusive schools, no TV/Media or hip culture. Maybe that works when their kids are young but what happens when they reach a certain age when it doesn&#39;t matter anymore what their parents tell them? Even if they mostly run in upper class circles they can&#39;t all be in the know and so they come in contact with others who are affected by social engineering which infects the mind sphere.</p>

<p>If they taint certain food sources how do they protect themselves? They can&#39;t go everywhere with their exclusive cooks who provide them with food/drinks from &quot;clean&quot; sources. That&#39;s not practical in reality unless they live completely isolated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They get in their seats of power and bat it away like little stuart from mad tv, with disinformation propaganda, blocking bills like how corporation bought politicians blocked putting gmo labels on food. </p>

<p>Then you get support by brainwashing individuals who have been conditioned to accept such ideas, this is why each news source accommodates specific political stances, while each political stance seems different, they support the elite.</p>

<p>Perfect example is each news stance on government regulation, the tea party Fox&#39;s want limited regulation, but the liberals want everything to be regulated. With limited regulation, corporations soar, but with complete regulation they can easily rig the system. If you can understand the power the Koch brothers, the tea party and government regulation both work in their favor.</p>

<p>Whats wrong with this country is that rich people are obsessed with becoming more rich. This is why state pension funds are being put in hedge funds unbeknownst to the pensioners, labor unions are almost no more, employee owned corporations are becoming no more. No one experiences this best first hand, then someone who has a rich landlord who lives in another state, constantly raising rent, while failing to maintain the rental more and more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it has a lot more to do with sterility than anything, but that&#39;s me. Many different countries, like China and their one child policy, have population reduction methods. Bill gates even admitted in a Forbes article that the reason he funds vaccines is for population reduction, the theory being that if mothers assume their children will survive, they won&#39;t have 10-20 children. </p>

<p>So, it would not surprise me if all of these chemicals which happen to lower sterility are added deliberately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must go out of your way if you want to try and stay healthy.  everything has been tainted.   </p>

<p>Start Reading ingredients.. you will see some form of Corn and or Soy in a product where it has no business.   Its shocking when you figure it out.  but after a few months of avoiding them and not using anything lined with BPA only cooking in stainless steel or cast iron and only storing leftovers in Glass.  </p>

<p>My Testosterone is very high for my age now but before this when it was super low and my estrogen was high  and i was supplementing with Testosterone  and using a Estrogen Blocker. When my levels were sort of back to normal for my age i didn&#39;t feel any better and we had been doing HRT for over a year.. so i told them it&#39;s not worth it if i don&#39;t feel better. so i stopped and a few months later i started reading labels to see if that made a difference if i try and avoid GMOs.. nows it&#39;s a complete reversal. My Diet is mainly Grass Fed Beef or Bison, Grass Fed Butter and or Olive oil, and my HDL and LDL have never looked so good.. the doctor said whatever you are doing keep it up. I told him i just think everyone is out to poison me. Now that i know that it&#39;s making a difference and the blood test prove it.  some people say just count calories  but that would be simple if all calories were equal.. and they are not.  Don&#39;t Drink Calories,  Stay away from things like Aspartame, well unless you want cancer to go along with your feminized endocrine system.</p>

<p>If i make homemade everything and i mean everything my food is healthier and less damaging that any Manufactured store bought food that attempts to mimic my food.  In the end i eat the same shit i have always ate besides now it&#39;s all organic and non gmo..   Bread and Pizza are on the Menu..  </p>

<p>No Aluminum in my deodorant or Baking powder..  No Triclosan in my soap..  and No Fluoride or micro beads in my toothpaste.</p>

<p>No Glyphosate to kill my stomach bacteria is another plus to eating Healthy Non GMO food.</p>

<p>And there is nothing wrong with feminine primacy as long as it is kept in check...which it is not...therefore my statement of our culture placing feminine primacy at the forefront of our culture being dangerous...why is it dangerous?</p>

<p>Because it is unbalanced and no longer focuses on fairness and justice for both genders and further adds to the alienation of the sexes.</p>

<li><p>what upswing in males being born gay?  We live in a more tolerant time so more gay men are comfortable being openly gay, but I highly doubt more people are gay now than any other time.  Same thing for drug addiction, that is nothing new in any way.  If men are being &quot;feminized&quot; to make them more passive and dependent than why would more men being going to jail?  seems like that would decrease the likelihood of a man committing violent or risky behavior.  This increase can be explained a different way - the drug war mostly.  Same thing with less males going to college - assuming that is true, no sources were given - that would be the symptom of a different problem.  Also, I thought we were running into a personal-debt problem because TOO MANY people were going to college?  Also, why would female hormones make men less likely to go to college anyways?</p></li>
<li><p>who is selling young men Viagra?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>&quot;There are feminine hormone producing chemicals in alot of stuff, fact.&quot;
what &quot;stuff&quot;?  where can I find this fact?  How much enters my body from using this &quot;stuff&quot; and what are the effects of x amount on a person?</p>

<p>&quot;Foods are proven to have addictive chemicals in them&quot;
which foods?  what addictive chemicals?</p>

<p>You offer no sources for any of your &quot;facts&quot; let alone sources of how they are all connected in some grand conspiracy.  This is a great sub most of the time, but unsubstantiated wild speculation makes us all look a bit silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More men appearing to be born gay is a result of increasingly friendly societal attitudes towards homosexuality, not a conspiracy. Increasing male incarceration is a result of the War on Drugs, not a conspiracy. Although the War on Drugs could be seen as conspiratorial unto itself, but that&#39;s beside the point. As for the &quot;decreased drive,&quot; more men are going to college than in previous history. They are slightly outnumbered by women, but that&#39;s indicative of increased societal support for women venturing outside of homemaking, not a conspiracy.</p>

<p>so no, I don&#39;t believe that there is a depopulation agenda. The ideas put forward in this post are hilariously misguided and misinformed, and sound more like someone blaming minorities for their own personal failures. Posts like this are why Stormfront thinks of this subreddit as their top recruiting base on the internet. The only surprise here is that the Jews somehow weren&#39;t blamed </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Margaret Sanger, the founder of the largest abortion clinic chain in the country, Planned Parenthood had <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/2015/02/23/7-shocking-quotes-from-planned-parenthood-founder-margaret-sanger/">these things to say</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>They (black people)are…human weeds,’ ‘reckless breeders,’ ’spawning… human beings who never should have been born.</strong></p>

<p>Organized charity itself is the symptom of a malignant social disease…Instead of decreasing and aiming to eliminate the stocks [of people] that are most detrimental to the future of the race and the world, it tends to render them to a menacing degree dominant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And This:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge of birth control is essentially moral. Its general, though prudent, practice must lead to a higher individuality and ultimately to a cleaner race.</p>

<p><strong>Birth control is nothing more or less than the facilitation of the process of weeding out the unfit</strong>, of preventing the birth of defectives or of those who will become defective.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to me from my experience…that while the colored Negroes have great respect for white doctors they can get closer to their own members and more or less lay their cards on the table which means their ignorance, superstitions and doubts.</p>

<p>We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal.</p>

<p><strong>We don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population</strong>, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So your idea of depopulation and eugenics not being real are just not based in reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so planned parenthood runs the world now, and not only that but by rules set down by a racist old born in the late 1800s?  Or is planned parenthood a front for something?  I fail to see why something a lady who died in the 60s said about hating black people is evidence of a massive conspiracy.  and who is &quot;them&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Planned parenthood has over 700 locations nationwide who are still continuing their founder,  Margaret Sanger&#39;s wish of &quot;exterminating the negro population&quot;. Again,  her words,  not mine.</p>

<p>Her philosophy and organization is 100% supported by the Democrat party,  every leading Democrat in power today publicly supports them, as well as some establishment Republicans. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pure evil, racist and discusting what they&#39;re doing to the black community.  Just as bad as what Hitler did to the Jews, with the only exception being that Planned Parenthood continues their Holocaust on African Americans to this day. What enrages me most though,  is they are partially publicly funded. We are literally paying with our own tax dollars that get taken out of every paycheck we get,  while Israel has enjoyed assistance, military funding, and full access to this country&#39;s most secret and guarded state secrets, prosperity and good will from most of the entire Western World for the last 70 years. The most danger the Israel has been in the last 25 years have been in have been rock throwing,  and homemade Palestinian <del>rockets</del> technologically sophisticated fireworks, let&#39;s be honest here. </p>

<p>I am willing to bet you money that Planned Parenthood has killed as many,  if not more African Americans over the last 70 years as Hitler did Jews.</p>

<p>If Black Lives matter when police kill them,  they should matter just as much when Planned Parenthood &quot;exterminates&quot; them, again their words,  not mine. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great point.  I personally think that the true top of the pyramid of people who are this evil and are knowingly social engineering people on such a massive, planetary scale, are very few to begin with. </p>

<p>I would say the very top of the pyramid consists of only 25-30 families in the world.  Even the Bilderberg Group has only 175 attendees (or so they say). </p>

<p>Even if every single one of the attendees family members knew of the conspiracy (which they don&#39;t) it&#39;s not that difficult to keep that small number of people in on the secret. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They get in their seats of power and bat it away like little stuart from mad tv, with disinformation propaganda, blocking bills like how corporation bought politicians blocked putting gmo labels on food. </p>

<p>Then you get support by brainwashing individuals who have been conditioned to accept such ideas, this is why each news source accommodates specific political stances, while each political stance seems different, they support the elite.</p>

<p>Perfect example is each news stance on government regulation, the tea party Fox&#39;s want limited regulation, but the liberals want everything to be regulated. With limited regulation, corporations soar, but with complete regulation they can easily rig the system. If you can understand the power the Koch brothers, the tea party and government regulation both work in their favor.</p>

<p>Whats wrong with this country is that rich people are obsessed with becoming more rich. This is why state pension funds are being put in hedge funds unbeknownst to the pensioners, labor unions are almost no more, employee owned corporations are becoming no more. No one experiences this best first hand, then someone who has a rich landlord who lives in another state, constantly raising rent, while failing to maintain the rental more and more. </p>

<p>Lets put government overhaul on the table, before its too late</p>
