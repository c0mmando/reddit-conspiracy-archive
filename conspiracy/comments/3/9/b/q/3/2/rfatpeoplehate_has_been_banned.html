<p><strong>Reddit is no longer a place of free speech under Ellen Pao.</strong> </p>

<p>Official statement from reddit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> has been banned due to violating the reddit rules based on the harassment of individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reddit CEO Ellen Pao: <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/reddit-ceo-ellen-pao-its-not-our-sites-goal-to-be-a-completely-free-speech-platform-2015-5?r=US">&quot;It&#39;s not our site&#39;s goal to be a completely free-speech platform.&quot;</a> </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear she&#39;s starting to shut down key subreddits that are giving reddit a &quot;bad reputation&quot; because of the consequences free speech has.</p>

<p>At least when I got banned from trees and I messaged they told me why and how long it was for. Then when I said it&#39;s cool but I think the rule I violated is dumb however I can see its merit, the mod just agreed. We told each other to have a good day and then later I got unbanned. </p>

<p>Why is the pot smoking sub the only one I&#39;ve seen moderated decently or that I&#39;ve had a not shit time dealing with the mods...?</p>

<p>It&#39;s true, there have been many visionaries in social progression, Martin L. King, FDR... And it&#39;s true, that our world is in fact better because of these guys. </p>

<p>But the idea of a Social Justic Warrior isn&#39;t the idea of a world changing visonary. It&#39;s actually the opposite. It&#39;s the idea a loser, who only ever acts from behind a keyboard (hence the ironic use of &quot;warrior&quot;). It&#39;s a mocking term for people who don&#39;t want to change the world, but rather want to spend all day bitching about it. </p>

<p>There are people out there, literately risking their lives, talking about homosexual equality, birth control, and religious equality in shithole countries that tend to kill people who speak out. And then there are pretentious assholes on tumblr who think they&#39;re brave for blogging that time they being a dick to you during class. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because &quot;muh feelings&quot;, because Ellan Pao was brought in to try to make reddit start making money, because SJWs are usually white, middle class, liberal arts majors, women, which a big purchasing power. Having the 16th most active subreddit actively being a hate forum (and I&#39;m not saying that that is a bad thing when it comes to fatties) won&#39;t attract much sponsors. Reddit want tech-illiterate users who don&#39;t know what adblockers are and <a href="/r/fph">/r/fph</a> wasn&#39;t helping that cause.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw elsewhere that reddit can now be liable (sued) for damaging content it hosts. Previously, reddit was &quot;anything goes&quot; and could largely show they had never policed content, thus they weren&#39;t responsible for it.</p>

<p>Now with the banning of fph in the name of harassment and personal safety, they&#39;re showing that they are aware of the content within reddit.</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t that mean they could be sued if someone got fired for a SRS brigade? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s gotten to the point where <a href="http://imgur.com/a/CP6SI">4chan</a> is more tolerant and emotionally supportive than Tumblr.</p>

<p>Tumblr is the kind of website where the users will bully people who are disabled (OR transsexual OR a minority) for not going along with their constantly changing and utterly arbitrary ideas of how people should act. Not to mention focusing on someone&#39;s race/gender/sexuality to the point where it eclipses any other aspect of their personality.</p>

<p>4chan is the kind of website where the users will call you a faggot regardless of gender or sexual orientation, and act like assholes purely for the purpose of being assholes, and freely admit to that.
They may be assholes, but at least they aren&#39;t so goddamn <em>self-righteous</em> about it.</p>

<p>Except for Fat People Hate <em>wasn&#39;t</em> an open forum, because if you disagree that fat people are the scourge of existence, you get banned.

You are right when you say the sub practiced censorship against people who spoke against them. However, the sub was designed as a place for people with those beliefs to express those beliefs without getting banned. A sub practicing censorship against those with different beliefs is one thing but Reddit going out of their way to censor said sub is a whole different thing. That&#39;s what some people are angry/worried about, the fact that Reddit is starting to censor things that were once allowed. For the most part it used to be a place of free speech. That time is over and that is what the outcry is about. Also if you browse <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> expect to see shit you don&#39;t want to see bud. Although, someone here does seem mad.</p>

<p>LOL. Well, I think Reddit is going down the sewer... I am not for hate speech, but people should be able to talk freely. I guess soon some alternative site will take this place over. Actually I am myself a bit overweight (wanna lose about 10-15 more kg, and I am on a strict diet for some time), but I think banning subs is a fuckin&#39; stupid idea. Even subs like <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a>. Which one will be the next one? <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ?  <a href="/r/pcmasterrace">/r/pcmasterrace</a> ?  <a href="/r/trollxchromosomes">/r/trollxchromosomes</a> ?  <a href="/r/mensrights">/r/mensrights</a> ?   <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is your free speech under seige because of subs like Top Minds Of Reddit (TMOR)? You&#39;re able to voice your opinion here on reddit quite freely in fact. Yes there are bans left right and center but the absolute vast majority of posts and users remain untouched, even those with controversial opinions. If reddit&#39;s leadership really was against free speech they would&#39;ve banned large amounts of &#39;less-than-ideal&#39;-subreddits ages ago (subreddits the admins happen to disagree with).</p>

<p>When people from TMOR come along and then make jokes about the posts you or others make isn&#39;t infringing on your right to free speech, in fact it&#39;s their right to free speech. You aren&#39;t protected from ridicule or being joked about. </p>

<p>Just like police have to say that &quot;whatever you say can and will be used against you in a court of law&quot; applies equally well here on reddit. Only without the being arrested, courts and jail sentence parts. Whatever you say anywhere on reddit is free to be ridiculed and it doesn&#39;t infringe on your right to free speech, not for one single second.</p>

<p>Apart from all that, it&#39;s their website, they are able to police it anyway they want and then still your right to free speech isn&#39;t infringed upon. They&#39;d be assholes because of it, yes, but it&#39;s not illegal because their website = their command. </p>

<p>Or I have absolutely misread your post and wrote a wall of text :p. </p>

<p>No reason to ban it though, I found it fucking hilarious to watch a bunch of horrible people slinging shit everywhere and trying to see if any of it sticks.</p>

<p>All those shitty subreddits were the same.  Everyone was so tough and righteous with their hatred until their shit show spilled into regular subs and then you got to watch them get shouted down by a bunch of decent people when they left their little echo chambers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the way to handle hate groups.  Ban them and they just scatter and find somewhere else to promote their shitty ideas.  I&#39;m sure there are a ton of news subreddits popping up today for hate groups to flock to.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that protecting fat people is most important, it&#39;s that of all the subs on their list, <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> was the most broadly alienating to their user base for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It makes fun of a group of people who comprise somewhere around 50% of the U.S. population.</li>
<li>It&#39;s frequently upvoted to the front page.</li>
<li>Fat people buy stuff. </li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the outrage. This is nothing new, folks. Capitalism always hurts creativity. It&#39;s probably worth it, though. And thankfully there&#39;s no shortage of creativity on the internet. If anything this is a glaring opportunity to start the next &quot;cool&quot; link aggregate site.</p>

<p>Like George Carlin said pertaining to Radio as instead of the Internet:</p>

<p>&quot;Did anyone ever tell you there are two KNOBS on the radio?</p>

<p>Two. Knobs. On the radio. Of course, I&#39;m sure the reverend isn&#39;t that comfortable with anything that has two knobs on it.  But hey, reverend, there are two knobs on the radio! One of them turns the radio OFF, and the other one </p>

<p>CHANGES THE STATION! Imagine that, reverend, you can actually change the station! It&#39;s called freedom of choice, and it&#39;s one of the principles this country was founded upon. Look it up in the library, reverend, if you have any of them left when you&#39;ve finished burning all the books.&quot;</p>

<p>The reason Reddit works is because YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO GO TO THOSE SUBREDDITS THAT OFFEND YOU.  Banning them will just give justification to ban anything that you don&#39;t like.  </p>

<p>We all know the real reason she&#39;s doing this is $$$$$$$.  The reason I come to reddit is because of the openess and freedom.  This is the first step of me actually searching for an alternative.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude was telling the truth, there were more than a few former fats that came to the sub for motivation to lose weight and keep it off.</p>

<p>It may be a hard pill to swallow, but I think FPH probably did more good than bad. Some folks saw that sub and realized that this is what most people (whether they admit it or not) think and feel about fatshits. Then had the mental and emotional fortitude to take that reality check and use it as motivation to better themselves. Sure there were bullies, but you can find shitty people in every sub. I never saw any rally cries or calls to action, as a matter of fact the exact opposite. Stories of people being harassed by lard tards from other subs because they found out OP posted in FPH were very common. One poor girl got doxxed and had someone call her fucking boss over it. I don&#39;t ever recall seeing anyone post OC of them in the wild, shitlording hams. That&#39;s just a straw man... and large, buttery, flappy, disgusting straw man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I could see how that might be misunderstood. What I meant by low hanging fruit was that nearly everyone who disagrees with anyone from FPH is immediately called fat, based on their opinions. It&#39;s a fairly childish, straw man argument to latch on to. It&#39;s even better when two people from FPH disagree with each other in unrelated threads and call each other fat immediately.

    <div class="md"><p>LoL, yeah callin&#39; people fat was kind of the modus operandi of the sub.

I get that that&#39;s shitty. But the huge brunt of the hate was focused on a very specific type of fat person, the ones that promote the FA and HAES (lack of) movements... and the mind numbingly hypocritical planets that attempted to shame normal sized folks with their &quot;real girls have curves&quot; nonsense. FPH was a break from this growing delusion that these people are somehow unable to control their weight, and they didn&#39;t like having their little burst when they willing checked the sub out. I dunno, it just rubbed me wrong when I saw you belittling the dude who said that it saved his life... while it may be a little hyperbole, it most likely did help him.</p>

<p>Ya...newsflash. Ellen Pao makes money. She has the right to decide the content on her website. End of. Free speech doesn&#39;t <em>actually</em> cover hate speech.

<p>My feelings might be hurt if I were overweight. I&#39;d like to think that I wouldn&#39;t be upset by what a random idiot on the internet thinks, but I don&#39;t know.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. </p>

<p>You rarely hear people talk about Digg on Reddit. Reddit is so different from Digg that the only time it&#39;s brought up is when SJWs start taking over the site. </p>

<p>But with Voat it looks and feels exactly like Reddit. You will never use it without thinking about Reddit. You most likely will always check back with Reddit to see what&#39;s going on with the popular crowd and most likely get back involved with Reddit. </p>

<p>Sort of like 8chan. Why would I ever go to 8chan when there is 4chan? If 4chan sucks now, that doesn&#39;t mean that 8chan is the answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think now is a good enough time to spread the word. 2 week ultimatum.  June 24th,  if reddit has not reversed this ruling or given community approved rules regarding subreddit bans, the second great exodus begins.  The heart and soul of Reddit has always been a place for all people,  shit-lord or not,  to express themselves however they choose.  The ultimate in democratic freedom.  You don&#39;t like what a subreddit says?  Don&#39;t subscribe,  you never have to see it again.  If you take that away,  you take away Reddit, and you&#39;d better have a damn good reason for it.  If this bullshit censorship is an indicator of what reddit is becoming,  I&#39;m out,  and I bet I won&#39;t be alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only issue I see is that FPH content can show up on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. People like me will pass it and forget about it while others will make a huge issue out of it.</p>

<p>The real problem, I&#39;m noticing, is that the media craze right now is people getting in trouble for expressing their opinions or not being politically correct. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but these type of articles are popping up a lot more lately.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if Snoop Dogg calls Caitlin Jenner a science experiment or if that other kid says he&#39;ll continue to call her Bruce. I don&#39;t care if Kaley Cuoco is fine with having the old traditional wife role where she&#39;s fine with making her husband dinner. But it&#39;s &quot;in&quot; to chastise people on their opinion.</p>

<p>Remember the &quot;shit in beard&quot; articles? Snopes proved it was wrong and that they took it way out of context. The reality was that bacteria found in feces were also found in beards ... but that same bacteria is found <em>everywhere</em>.</p>

<p>So, if these mere issues cause a media shitstorm, imagine what happens when the media outlet finds out there is a subreddit dedicated to mocking fat people. The media would go crazy. First: Jailbait. Second: The Fappening. Third: Reddit hates fat people and mocks them to no end!</p>

<p>No question, Reddit is trying to protect their image ... and it&#39;s unfortunate they have to do this. But to place the blame entirely on them isn&#39;t fair. We can blame the people and media outlets who love to jump on pointless stories to get people to read their articles and see their ads. Instead of actual news reporting, people seek out the next &quot;that&#39;s outrageous&quot; claim ... and FPH appears to be it.</p>

<p>We&#39;re hitting a point where &quot;everything is offensive and it needs to be remedied&quot;. When in all reality people need to get off their fucking high horse and realize the internet allows different opinions to be expressed. Don&#39;t like it? There&#39;s a back button, close window button, or an address bar to take you to a site that doesn&#39;t offend your thin-skinned ass.</p>

<p>And for the record, I hate FPH content, but it deserves to exist as long as it&#39;s legal.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> Free Speech</p>

<p><strong>Title-text:</strong> I can&#39;t remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you&#39;re saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it&#39;s not literally illegal to express.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Carlin is one of my heroes, and I absolutely agree with this point, however, I&#39;m not the best at Reddit and when I try and explore r/all I got nothing but r/fatpeoplehate.  r/all was my way to discover new top posts from subs I wasn&#39;t subscribed to but I eventually had to stop going there because of the hatred and filth I saw plastered all over it.  So, in this analogy my choices became; turn the radio off, only listen to a channel you know is safe, or read the disgusting and that&#39;s not right.  I don&#39;t agree with banning subreddits, but I don&#39;t agree with hate speech either.  It&#39;s quite the conundrum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your George Carlin analogy sounds good and all but I have a slight issue with it. In my opinion, acknowledging and subsequently choosing to ignore hate speech and  verbal abuse is tantamount to condoning it. If I walk past someone on the street yelling about how much they hate [insert group here], if I say/do nothing I am thereby sending the message that what is happening is OK. The same applies here on reddit, by not banning harassing subs and/or users, reddit would be indicating that such behavior is OK. </p>

<p>The United States government is legally required to allow freedom of speech (And rightfully so!) but reddit is not owned by the government; it is a private entity. You do not have rights here. The government cannot punish you for hating on fat people, but reddit can and I honestly believe that it should. You are free to say whatever foul shit you want, but the rest of society (excluding the government) is free to react however THEY want. And I fully support social consequences, such as what transpired today, as a result of socially unacceptable behavior.</p>

<p>But hey</p>

<p>if you don&#39;t like it, you can, as George Carlin says, &quot;change the channel&quot;</p>

<p>r/fatpeoplhate was not banned for content in the sub.  That&#39;s why subs like Coontown are still around.  They were banned for briggading, leaping into other subreddits, harassing people in the comments and sending them messages.  </p>

<p>In other words, a post that had a photo that someone in fatpeoplehate found unpleasant would crosspost it to fatpeoplehate, then the subscribers would go to that post and harass the OP and send them disgusting PMs.</p>

<p>They also doxxed all the employees at imgur. </p>

<p>The ban was not about the content of the sub, but the subscribers actions <em>outside</em> the sub, harassing other users in different subs.</p>

Look it up in the library, reverend, if you have any of them left when you&#39;ve finished burning all the books.&quot;</p>

<p>The reason Reddit works is because YOU DON&#39;T HAVE TO GO TO THOSE SUBREDDITS THAT OFFEND YOU. Banning them will just give justification to ban anything that you don&#39;t like. </p>

<p>The problem with this is that people from FPH were harassing imgur and imgur&#39;s staff after imgur decided to ban FPH from reaching their gallery&#39;s front page. </p>

<p>True, but <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> was hitting <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> a <em>bit</em> too much.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll bite. There&#39;s a reason they were banned. They were brigading across other boards.</p>

<p>Personally, I liked when they shat on Tess Munster and all that HAES crap. But one post that came up set off some alarm bells. A reddit user posted her weight loss progress (like 100lbs) and one of the shitlords said something to the order of &quot;well 400-100 is still 300, you&#39;re still obese, so this is not a victory yet&quot;</p>

<p>When you link to other parts of reddit, there&#39;s a reason people use the np tag. Lynch mobs form at the drop of a hat. If a subreddit does not hand out those bans like candy on halloween, they start to actively draw people who harass.</p>

<p>And if you saw the shitfest on planetside, KIA is going to be banned just the same.</p>

<p>And censorship is when the government stops you from using your first amendment rights. A corporation (that reddit is) can restrict what you say on their property to infinity. They were never under any obligation to. I don&#39;t agree with Ellen Pao&#39;s whiny SJW shit, but it&#39;s her ship to sink.</p>

Just ban it from the front page and <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> if possible.

<p>pretty soon the reasons for sub, user and comment related bans will be watered down to where there isn&#39;t a clear cut reason and everything could potentially be hate speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm... I can see your point but the only problem is that it&#39;s an argument basically based on the &quot;slippery slope&quot; logical fallacy.</p>

<p>This is never actually the case. Gay marriage doesn&#39;t lead to Man-animal marriage, Netflix price increases don&#39;t lead to $100/month subscriptions etc.</p>

<p>I agree that rules on bans, specifically for hate speech, desperately need clarification and quick. However, I do still believe that these rules do need to be in place. </p>

<p>As weird and cliché as it sounds for reddit to be able to be reddit above free speech - I believe - it is imperative that people are comfortable with their anonymity. Subreddits that harass threaten that core value which is why I think these rules need to be put in place.</p>

<p>I can totally understand your point of view but I think it is not realistic to think that moderation like this will lead to such an extreme case.</p>

this is a website that attracted people from every walk of life and presented itself as a free, u be the judge platform.  Unfettered, unfiltered internet all in one spot. Now if a sub breaks a law, then yes ban it. </p>

<p>I get that this isn&#39;t 1932 Germany. Truthfully I can just leave the site.
but any justification for a stifling what people want to put out there, cess pool or not, is simply censorship. No way to sugar coat it as anything but that. </p>

<p>So Ellen Pao doesn&#39;t need to read them, but she needs to publish them and financially support them?  This isn&#39;t the radio.  Reddit is not public airwaves.  It&#39;s a for-profit web site run by private interests, whose interests and business acumen apparently don&#39;t align with some of the fucked up stuff people like to discuss here.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what freedom of speech means, holy shit. George Washington would kick your ass right now. Freedom of speech is the freedom to legally say what you want without interference from the government. You have no right to use someone else&#39;s property or someone else&#39;s money to say whatever you want.</p>

<p>You think your Costco example isn&#39;t happening right now? Why do you think you only see factory farm abuses in PETA videos and not on ABC News? What&#39;s the latest from Ellen about whether or not dryer sheets and Greek yogurt are safe?</p>

<p>And as a minor point- radio stations are for-profit but they are licensed by the government because the airwaves are seen as a limited, public property.  The FCC judges whether or not radio stations are &quot;serving the public interest&quot; when approving or renewing a license. That said, I probably shouldn&#39;t have brought it up because the FCC rules don&#39;t really allow for unfettered free speech and they might not license a &quot;fat people hate&quot; radio operator.</p>

<p>Subs that distribute images of illegal behavior occurring probably need to be banned. But as you said, because they are tiny subs with a few dedicated followers that stay completely in their own domain, Reddit is going to turn a blind eye for now.</p>

<p>I bet when these subs are brought to the attention of the mainstream media, you will see a mass shutdown of hundreds of subs. And it will be the end of free speech on Reddit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is Ellen Pao&#39;s end-game: she will continue to &quot;fight&quot; to have reddit be a &quot;safe platform&quot;, knowing full well there will be a community backlash against censorship. Her toxicity will lead to her being ousted as CEO, or rather, the permanent CEO position not being extended to her once the interim period of one year is over. She will then go on social media and cry that she was &quot;fired&quot; for what she stood up for. In her deranged mind, she will see herself as a martyr for social justice, and demand &quot;8 figures&quot; for her to quietly &quot;exit&quot; reddit. Her demands will be denied, and she will proceed to sue reddit for her perceived slight injustices and discrimination - of which she has diligently kept a record of in a &quot;resentment chart&quot;. She will lose the much publicized case on all counts, will be asked to pay for the defendant&#39;s court fees, will claim the fees are absurd, and turn around and demand her own tidy sum not to appeal what was a frivolous suit to begin with.</p>

<p>If you really care about this problem there are much better ways to go about it as I mentioned.

Would you want your parent to post photos of you and laugh at how fat you were because they were doing what&#39;s best for you? No, you need to reach out and help.

Reddit is the site that always says they want an OPEN and FREE internet, If they are going to ban subs that have people talking about killing someone there would literally only be subreddits  with less than 1000 users.</p>

<p>I get that he said &quot;No one wanted to kill or hurt anyone&quot; But I think he was assuming you would count out the small minority that exists in every subreddit.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not arguing whether it was or wasn&#39;t justified to ban the subreddit. As much as I hated that place, I dunno. The whole point of Reddit is free speech and all that jazz. That said, I agree that it was a very big problem that it was starting to leak into other subreddits. I&#39;ve recently seen more &quot;shitlords&quot; bringing their hate into subs like WTF, cringepics, and facepalm.  I started seeing it on imgur, because it was hitting their &quot;most viral&quot; requirement. The fact is that it wasn&#39;t contained to that sub anymore. I&#39;ve definitely been on that sub before, to see what all the fuss was about. I&#39;ve visited two times, and looked through a few threads each time. On each one I always saw at least one highly-upvoted smart ass comment about &quot;Man that thing should be put down&quot;, &quot;They should just kill themselves&quot;, &quot;Why would you want to be alive if you looked like that&quot;, etc etc. And the problem isn&#39;t even that it was posted in that subreddit- it was that it had started to spread to shit like PMs.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s a &quot;small minority&quot;, if a subreddit like coontown (which I was unaware existed until a few months ago) ever started going viral or leaking into other places I can almost guarantee they&#39;d have been shut down just as fast.</p>

I agree, banning it is never the answer, they should crack down on the individuals spreading the hate outside the subreddit if anything. As we can see, all this has done is fuel their fire and made them keep creating new subs.</p>

<p>I dunno. I hated he subreddit and while I won&#39;t say I&#39;m not glad it&#39;s gone, I&#39;m also 100% willing to admit that it&#39;s likely not the right move since (as you said) as with pictures on the internet, it&#39;ll never actually be gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the burning of a person (already illegal) due to the color of their skin (now it&#39;s a hate crime as well) is morally indefensible.</p>

<p>However, like smokers who know they are killing themselves, morbidly obese people JUST DON&#39;T CARE that they are becoming a drag on society. Obesity is a PROBLEM in society. It needs to have light shed upon exactly WHY it is a problem for people to start really realizing that it needs to be stopped.</p>

<p>They put DEATH warnings on cigarette packaging. Think about that. It is known to cause disease and death. Morbid obesity is ALSO known to cause disease and death. WHY IS MORBID OBESITY NOT BEING TREATED LIKE THE DISEASE IT IS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN?!?!?! MORBIDLY OBESE PEOPLE ARE. NOT. ATTRACTIVE. Would you tell your kid to get morbidly fat? Doom him or her to a life of pain and disease and early death? Well the HAES movement is attempting to do just that by glorifying morbid obesity when it needs to be treated like cigarettes were, stop marketing, add tons of warnings, etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if you disagree, and sorry for all the yelling up there. I&#39;m really a nice guy but I get worked up easily in defense of my beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a fan of the overall ethos in <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a>. But look. Sure, it&#39;s kind of sad that grown adults get together to feel self-superior and say hateful things about others. The way they dehumanize obese people disturbs me. </p>

<p>But people will do what they&#39;re going to do. There&#39;s no real point in banning that shit for &quot;free speech&quot; reasons. It&#39;s kind of shitty to take a cell phone pic of someone in a Walmart, just so that you can make fun of them online. That&#39;s low. That&#39;s some fucking middle school shit. But people can be unpleasant. No one is going to stop people from behaving that way. The only way they&#39;ll stop is if they look at themselves and realize that it&#39;s not right to dehumanize other people like that.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;ve been the <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a>. People there like to circlejerk about how others on Reddit complain about them. It feeds into the perverse social solidarity that ties that place together. People unite when they feel somehow oppressed. Banning <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> will only strengthen that community, not dissolve it.</p>

<p><strong>But let&#39;s get real.</strong> Naturally, &quot;creating a safe space,&quot; and protecting people from being offended, isn&#39;t the <em>real</em> reason for banning &quot;harassing&quot; subreddits. As someone already pointed out in the comments on <a href="/r/announcements">/r/announcements</a>, it&#39;s about <strong>making Reddit more palatable and friendly to advertisers.</strong> </p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s look at why <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> was banned, but evidently, <a href="/r/coontown">/r/coontown</a> is still up and running. This is my hypothesis: subs that were targeted are the ones with higher traffic. As sad as it is, <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> is popular. It makes <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> on a fairly regular basis. It&#39;s highly visible. The nail that sticks out gets pounded down. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about making Reddit look good for advertisers. Reddit has struggled to monetize in the past, and like it or not, I strongly suspect that they&#39;re headed in that direction. If a sub that gets big enough is deemed &quot;offensive,&quot; it will be eliminated. Why? Because Reddit probably doesn&#39;t care about what goes on with 100 people on some tiny little sub. But they only want &quot;safe&quot; content to make the signed-out Front Page and <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>. They don&#39;t want Reddit novices or advertisers to pull up Reddit and see that stuff. They want some not-so-controversial news pieces and plenty of nice, vapid, palatable jokes and memes. </p>

<p><strong>&quot;Safe space&quot; is right. But it&#39;s not about being &quot;safe&quot; for the individual. It&#39;s about being &quot;safe&quot; for advertisers to reach as many people as possible.</strong></p>

<p>To me, the saddest thing about this, is that it&#39;s <em>not</em> some grand conspiracy of politicians or corporations. It&#39;s not even <em>about</em> trying to stifle free speech among the populace about political ideas or controversial views. <strong>It&#39;s about advertising. It&#39;s about selling more products to consumers. Reddit is curtailing free speech to sell more Coca-Cola, more iPads, more fast food. And that&#39;s just depressing.</strong></p>

<p>Like it or not, reddit is private property. This is not a government run website, your taxpayer dollars are not contributing to this website. As such, reddit is free to do what they want with it.</p>

<p>You seem to think that there is nothing wrong with this, and that that fact is so obvious it requires no support.  Many people believe that the combination of strong private property rights and the concentration of almost all wealth in a tiny elite has problematic implications for society.</p>

<p>Capitalism and private property are not physical properties of reality - they are social institutions.  If you believe they are good, that belief requires justification.  Given their unfortunate consequences for the vast majority of people, I think it would take some incredible evidence to demonstrate that they are good for society or otherwise justifiable.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is be a fair assessment of why censorship is used on Reddit.  It <em>sounds true</em> because the comic has a very effective delivery.  But there is nothing in the comic that provides any rational basis for <em>believing</em> that its claims are true.  It&#39;s like a catchy pop song; it sounds true, it sounds important, but it&#39;s a trick.  Its content may be true or false, important or frivolous.  You can&#39;t tell without further examination than just consuming it.</p>

<p>Given a choice, I&#39;d rather base my beliefs on a reasoned assessment of observable facts.  Reddit seems to use censorship, at the moderator level primarily, but sometimes at the administrative level, primarily to promote views popular in the mainstream semi-intellectual media (which are primarily shaped by the interests of their ownership and their customers, who are advertisers).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the most common dismissal I&#39;ve seen of the audacity of fat people wanting not to be mocked mercilessly. Most fat people advocating for themselves aren&#39;t &quot;justifying&quot; their fat as out of their control. That is just a small, if vocal, minority  (though some people do have thyroid &amp; other medical conditions or take medications that make gaining weight especially easy). What most fat people want is simply to be left the fuck alone. </p>

<p>The real kicker is that shame and bullshit diets (just the kinds reddit could profit off of with regards to advertising - Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, etc.) have been proven time and time again to make people fatter, yet the assholes who populate subs like FPH just circlejerk over how these fat people deserve it because hurr durr they could just lose the weight if they wanted to and tell themselves that this makes their hate justified in a way that racism isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Fat people in the U.S. are disproportionately people of color and/or from lower socioeconomic classes. Harassing and hating them provides a handy, if very thin, veneer for the perpetuation of less socially acceptable racism and classism. </p>

<p>None of this means that I don&#39;t suspect Reddit of sanitizing itself in order to be more appealing to advertisers. I just think FPH and their ilk who claim that their trolling and harassment is justified because fatties don&#39;t have to stay fat are absolutely full of shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is they can do whatever they want. What if a superpac decides it wants to advertise on reddit so they offer them massive dollar amount to run ads everywhere, but they think <a href="/r/SandersForPresident">/r/SandersForPresident</a> , <a href="/r/ronpaul">/r/ronpaul</a> and a few other subreddits are unslightly so they ask them to remove them. The admins might go 50/50 and be like money or a subreddit it could go either way. Now what if they someone at the said superpac decides well maybe we should self-sabotage the subreddits so our content would be more prominent and theirs unseen. When everything is hidden behind a curtain and nobody knows what the fuck is going on anyone with greed in their eyes and the power to do something could do almost anything they want.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an overall problem that does not have to do <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> but entirely as you said to sell that coke or that tacobell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  The mentality in <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> sickens me.  Surely people aren&#39;t this crass?  I get that people don&#39;t like the Every Body movement, and yes, being obese is a strain on social health care systems, but it shouldn&#39;t cause such an alarmist attitude because someone spotted a so-called &quot;land-whale&quot;.  Then all the in-fights as what constitutes as fat / obese / healthy.  Whatever.</p>

<p>Point is, outside of a small grouping (in the grand scheme of things) nattering about the topic is was largely (hrrhrr) harmless, and especially compared to other subreddits that are downright mentally disturbing or filled with such hate.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t the better option to have dealt with these subreddits is to lock them in their own room and disallow any posts from making the front page?  Kind of like, you do whatever the hell you want in your corner of the building, so long as it doesn&#39;t disrupt everything happening over here?  And if people want to eke out those rooms they can do so at their own discretion, just don&#39;t come crying to us about what horrors you find? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obesity kills, and is a serious health issue. Yes, the general tone in <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> was a negative and condescending one.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d rather live in a world full of healthy assholes than a world full of unhealthy nice people. A lot of other people feel that same way.  </p>

<p>For the record, they were nothing but supportive to people that were overweight, admitted that it was a problem in their life, and actively sought help and resources in mitigating that problem and also showed initiative.  </p>

<p>I say this as someone that went from 320lbs to 265lbs specifically because &quot;assholes&quot; like the ones on fatpeoplehate never let up on me. My knees don&#39;t hurt, my back doesn&#39;t hurt, I can see my dick again and I&#39;m no longer pre-diabetic. I owe &quot;assholes&quot; like them my life and continued good health.  </p>

<p>Reddit will see its downfall from this unnecessary censorship. Nothing there was illegal. This will only get worse before it ever gets better, if it ever gets better. A lot of people don&#39;t like <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> too. I guess we should ban it as well since it sees the front page on occasion?  </p>

<p>No. We fucking shouldn&#39;t. Because that&#39;s wrong, and stupid, and self-limiting. </p>

<p>Next time I&#39;ll explicitly state that I was referring to people that were obese.  </p>

<p>No, that&#39;s not what I meant. I meant that I would rather live in a world full of people that got mad when unhealthy ideals are celebrated and encouraged, than a world where people just watch everything burn around them.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s a pretty huge difference between someone that has Cerebral Palsy, Asthma, Lupus, or some other disability, and someone that can&#39;t stop shoving food into their gullet. Those first three things are real and serious diseases that kill and maim.  </p>

<p>Obesity is a choice. Those are not. That&#39;s the important distinction here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freedom of speech historically refers to the freedom to criticize the state (including arms of the state, such as religion). This is the spirit of the first amendment. If you actually read the first amendment, you will realize you are grossly misusing the term &#39;free speech&#39;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Free speech has nothing to do with protecting hate speech.</p>

<p>However, in light of the recent criminalization of protestors and whisteblowers, it appears this right was taken away long ago. I think this is a lot more important right now.</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely - when they deserve it. I especially hate alcoholics. But it&#39;s not often that a smoker, drinker or drug abuser enables their children to do the same - or destroys their children by literally feeding them garbage until their minds and bodies are ruined. But fat people do, and boy do they do it a lot!</p>

<p>Just like the rest of the internet..but those advertisers will hate to have their customers educated. Also for fun we can also complain to those advertisers about the hate and how it tarnishes their product to be advertised on such a hateful site..  Soon reddit will be like CNN...disable all comments or require id to post.. Its coming</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I disagree. The subreddit was a lot of hate speech, yes. The subreddit also points out a <em>massive</em> problem the entire world is <em>growing</em> into. In every developed nation in the world peoples belt size is ballooning. This is absolutely unacceptable. Being significantly overweight is not acceptable. It is a dangerous medical condition that needs treated with proper diet and exercise before permanent negative health consequences occur. Hiding the problem because Mc Donald&#39;s won&#39;t advertise McFatBurgers isn&#39;t going to fix this national and worldwide issue. This is an issue that will have significant effects on the GDP of entire countries as obese people age and become permanent residents in the healthcare system. From 1980 till now the number of obese people has went from somewhere around 6% to around 18% in teenagers. Most of that occurring in the 20 years from 1980 to 2000. That is a major society shift. That has had huge ramifications  on almost every facet of society, ones that need to be critically addressed and brought to light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll call bullshit on your idealism. Sometimes you do make a difference by making fun of people. George Carlin had no problem with hurting people feelings with jokes. Sometimes destructive behavior just needs laughed at. Being fat isn&#39;t a condition you are born with (if it is, it&#39;s very rare), certainly not something 1/3 of the population was born with in the last 30 years. It is something caused by not only your eating decisions, but the dietary decisions of your family around you and how food is marketed to you and society. We&#39;ve had groups telling us for years that our diets are bad. Evidently it&#39;s not working, we keep getting fatter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, maybe in moderation insults can be constructive, or if it&#39;s your friends just call you fat. But anonymous people on the internet taking the photos you&#39;ve posted on instagram or whatever and labelling them &quot;delusional hamplanets&quot; isn&#39;t exactly constructive, nor do I think that it&#39;ll actually make someone go &quot;oh i really am fat better hit the gym&quot;. All you&#39;re doing is being a bully on the internet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do tend to agree with you. Personal insults directed towards you probably aren&#39;t going to have a better effect on your life. But on a societal level obesity should be unacceptable, it will stop huge numbers of people from becoming obese in the first place. </p>

<p>The level of extreme hatred is, while not acceptable, something that should have been predicted and expected. The &#39;fattening&#39; of the Earth is something that is unparalleled in human history. We are in uncharted waters here, and we do know from sound medical science, that the amount of extreme obesity we see is going to (and is having) terrible consequences for those involved. Every appeal to moderation has failed as of so far. Where moderation doesn&#39;t work, extremism grows. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realise that you&#39;re claiming that by making obesity incredibly sociably unacceptable may be kind of valid, but they way that subreddit went out about it was wrong. I just have trouble believing that you can change anyones mind by having an echochamber of a subreddit continually parroting that &quot;hambeasts are what&#39;s wrong with this planet&quot; or whatever. Because I have trouble seeing how it would be effective at all, as well as the fact that being a dick to fat people for no reason is just dumb, I just don&#39;t agree with anything the subreddit claims to uphold or anything.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah and a lot of the time you make more of a negative difference by making fun of someone. A lot of obese people already hate their weight and have low self-confidence. This is often why they overeat or lack motivation to get in shape. So what do you think making fun of these people does to them? It hurts their confidence even more and makes them less likely to improve. In some cases, it causes people to consider suicide. It&#39;s like making fun of depressed people, it&#39;s just a vicious cycle that doesn&#39;t do anyone any good.</p>

<p>If you wanna help people and their eating/fitness habits, do so positively. Be the positive change in the world, not a fucking douchebag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, that&#39;s the part I don&#39;t get. Why is a fat person a reason to be <em>angry</em>?<br/>
On one hand you&#39;re saying YOU have the right to say what you want and live your life how you want it, right? And without sarcasm I say great, that is awesome! Of course you have the right to do what you want, live how you want, without judgement from me.<br/>
This, my friend, this is your RIGHT.<br/>
However, while alluding to your rights, you are complaining about your platform for judging other people is being &quot;taken away&quot;.<br/>
Do you see the predicament?  </p>

<p>Why do you take their decisions or poor lifestyle choices personally? Why do you feel the need to seek out others, and together fuel each others hate? Judging them, posting pictures and laughing at them? Why is that so important to you?  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not helping, clearly. This is not &quot;tough love&quot;. It&#39;s ignorant, and quite frankly,  a little bit narcissistic. What gives <strong>you</strong> the right to judge?<br/>
If you want the right to tell anybody judging you to fuck off and mind their own business. Well then you too need to fuck off and mind your own business.  </p>

<p>Plus, there are so many REAL issues to be LEGITIMATELY angry about. I mean, we are in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for christs sake!  </p>

<p>Not being fat, sure I too get mildly annoyed if I get the seat next to a really heavy person on a flight. I get <em>inconvenienced</em>, not OUTRAGED.  </p>

<p>Use that anger and focus it on something constructive instead. Help the &quot;fatties&quot; close to you, train with them, give them advice. FOCUS! Use that anger to love your friends and family to death instead.  </p>

<p>But hey, who am I to judge, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m from England where we have socialised health care.  Obese people who are too fat to work get a cheque I the mail since they are too fat to work. They refuse to lose weight because they would rather just sit around and eat all day. Even in the US, obesity racks ip a tremendous bill for tax payers. And then on top of that people are not only trying to normalise and accept the pandemic as acceptable, you see people try to promote it as healthy (HAES) and beautiful (real women have curves). And then these fatties try to shame people who are thin and lean. </p>

<p>Honestly being fat says a lot about a person. They&#39;re lazy and not willing to commit to being healthy. If they can&#39;t commit to something as simple as leading a remotely healthy life, they sure as hell can&#39;t commit to anything else worth while. Promoting a culture that accepts fatties is literally killing people. Countless fatties have posted on FPH that they lost weight and got healthy because of the stuff on FPH, so it surely does help a few people out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t punch you, not really- they are visibly trying to do something to protect their friends.  That will probably be enough appeasement, as long as none of you cross the doxing line again.  If they were genuinely trying to be assholes to you and yours, they could have used any number of methods to simply ruin your actual lives.  You have been shown mercy by the Khan, and should probably strongly consider not throwing any more rocks in the direction of those mongols and their legal team.  You see, at this point you amount to a potential advertising bonanza in the form of news coverage.  All that would take is one leak of your IP addresses to the right place, which can be done with plausible denial.  Imagine that- you&#39;d be on the Daily Show, John Oliver, and NBC News!  With your real names and faces and behavior subject to the right-back-atcha of the real world where you will presumably want employment and spouses which will be hard to find.  Because you are you, and everyone will know it.  They could use that newfound coverage, worldwide coverage, to come out strongly on the side of love instead of hate.  Probably set up a foundation against cyberbullying and garner the love of the world.  So they could have simply repaid you in kind, and have chosen not to.  You should send them a fruit basket and thank your pathetic gods for their mercy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, everybody thinks that it is &quot;hating&quot; on fat people and some people compare <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> to Nazi&#39;s hating on the jews. That is ridiculous. Hitler killed the jews, we who shame the fat people on that subbreddit only want them to realize they are killing themselves. We are trying to help these people live. Live to see another day or donut.</p>

<p>There is no hate for someone who knows they are fat and are doing something about it. We cheer them on and congratulate them. The people we despise are the obese people who are trying to make it okay to be unhealthy in the world because they are too lazy to fix their issues. Instead, they would rather ignore the real issue of self control and would want others to accept them for who they are. Except it is such a double standard that gets seen by everybody else except themselves. </p>

<p>Beauty standards are a thing. If you find people aren&#39;t attracted to you, change your standard up, whether it is cause you are overweight or stinky or have hair growing in odd places..</p>

<p>Stop making it okay for them. They deserve a better life. <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> was showing the truth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling bullshit. The majority of the pictures there were of random strangers so how do you differentiate who is trying to better themselves and what not. Hell I seen one photo where a obese woman was buying running shoes and the comments were plain nasty.  Keep it 100 you all don&#39;t give a damn about the health of these people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to argue but you are right and wrong, some people take <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> way too far, but it also never crept into <a href="/r/fitness">/r/fitness</a> or another sub where people are posting pics of weight loss or what not. (even though it wasn&#39;t allowed)</p>

<p>I agree most of the pictures were bad, if not all, but there was a point to most of them. For example, the picture of a big girl saying any guy&#39;s height who starts with 5&#39; aren&#39;t attractive, but then gets offended when someone brings up her weight. </p>

<p>That is one example of a delusional person who pushes their own beauty standards on others but when it comes back to them... they have a big hissy fit.
It&#39;s almost not even a weight thing anymore, it has become a &quot;Really? You&#39;re gonna promote being unhealthy and tell lies to make yourself fit in? No. Stop.&quot; 
 Instead of <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> it should have been <a href="/r/delusionalpeople">/r/delusionalpeople</a></p>

<p>Edit: Also I&#39;d like to point out now that FPH is banned, along with others, my point doesn&#39;t seem to come across. Now everyone is posting against fat people just as a quick joke, to fight the mods, or for whatever reason right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>that was the straw that broke the [insert intolerant slur]&#39;s back.  but the reality is that imgur doesn&#39;t police its own policies at all.  According to their &quot;rules&quot;, you aren&#39;t allowed to post nsfw images on imgur.  i don&#39;t think they have the time or resources (or incentives) to be actively editing submissions.  My guess is that a group of people started reporting the images, leading to the retaliation, precipitating the subreddit ban process which has been in the works since well before the new CEO was hired.</p>

<p>this is just testing the waters.  and it&#39;s likely that the bully meta subs will be deleted before they come for this sub.  It&#39;s a brave new web.  soon there will be language filters on every frontpage sub.</p>

<p>let&#39;s be honest, for all fph is a cesspool, it&#39;s not that much of a stretch to ban a sub which accuses boston marathon bombing or sandy hook survivors of being part of a hoax.  And it&#39;s some small portion of posts along with an accusation of antisemitism that could justify taking down the whole sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t want to be a platform for free speech, don&#39;t advertise yourself as the &quot;front page of the internet,&quot; implying a certain neutral integrity. </p>

<p>Whether or not you want to be a platform for free speech, if you&#39;re promoting a community-oriented social media platform with tens of millions of monthly users (for her living, one might add; this isn&#39;t being done out of the kindness of her heart), enforce consistent standards. </p>

<p>I found <a href="/r/FatPeopleHate">/r/FatPeopleHate</a> funny. I rarely find <a href="/r/ImGoingToHellForThis">/r/ImGoingToHellForThis</a> funny; often, I find it sickening. It makes the front page far more often than FPH did. </p>

<p>That&#39;s just my personal opinion, of course. I&#39;m free to <em>not visit</em> a subreddit that offends me. So is everybody else. &quot;Hey, look, this link leads to a subreddit that offends me. I won&#39;t click it!&quot; It&#39;s... <em>empowering</em>. Personal responsibility is the shit, seriously.  </p>

<p>Incidentally, you won&#39;t find them on the front page, but there are a variety of offensive subreddits with tens of thousands of subscribers in existence which reddit hasn&#39;t touched. Many of them have been around for years. There&#39;s <a href="/r/CoonTown">/r/CoonTown</a>, for instance. There&#39;s <a href="/r/CuteFemaleCorpses">/r/CuteFemaleCorpses</a>. There are subreddits about child murder, and S&amp;M. There are subreddits for sexual deviancies whose adults-only policies are flagrantly violated, with users announcing that they&#39;re under 18 and looking to hook up with people who practice what they&#39;re intrigued by.</p>

<p>Smoking marijuana is still illegal in many states, and in many parts of the world, but <a href="/r/trees">/r/trees</a> is filled with pictures of people doing exactly that. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t tell me that the hen&#39;s teeth rare FPH post hitting the front page is all it took to make a difference between <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> being &quot;unsafe&quot; for the community, but <a href="/r/SexWithHorses">/r/SexWithHorses</a>, <a href="/r/SexWithDogs">/r/SexWithDogs</a>, <a href="/r/RapingWomen">/r/RapingWomen</a>, and <a href="/r/BeatingWomen2">/r/BeatingWomen2</a> (the original was banned, but its sequel has been untouched for years) perfectly fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit used to be a community-driven content linking site with commentary, the key word here being community-driven. Users decided with their single up or down vote what content should be more or less prominent than other content. It was the community that made the decisions.</p>

<p>Now, decisions are being made on behalf of the community by a few mods and admins.</p>

<p>That being said, reddit is privately owned and operated. Reddit Inc. is fully within their power to do whatever they want. Free speech doesn&#39;t apply to companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit used to not have a subreddit dedicated to bullying people.</p>

<p>The entire concept of reddit only works when the user base properly self polices. As the community grows larger and larger, the range of people it attracts gets wider and wider, self-policing gets increasingly unreliable. </p>

<p>I think what we&#39;re seeing now is that reddit has become large enough that it attracts a significant amount of people with ethics sufficiently vacant or skewed that they can no longer rely on the community as a whole to self police.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s how reddit will become like every other Internet community ever.</p>

Quite contrary we encourage men to finally start caring more for themselves than for others. That includes getting offended about feminists, white knights and SJWs. Contrary to popular believe we also aren&#39;t misogynistic or hating women. I invite everybody to have a look and make his own opinion. You might not like our opinions, you might call it bro-science, you might think that we are a cult, you might even think we are just a bunch of laughable, mountain dew gulping, fat neckbeards and keyboard warriors, but besides the relatively new guys who are ranting in anger towards society you won&#39;t find much that would even remotely qualify as agression and surely not hatred.</p>

<p>FPH on the other hand really tried to test out their boundaries. Just last week there were multiple threads about a fattie who got upset and offended when she found out FPH exists and they had nothing better to do than put her face in the sidebar and brigade her youtube video. That&#39;s just one example.</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t care too much if FPH as a sub exists, although I do care that it got removed with shady reasoning. Some of the content they post is funny, but I also believe that it is filled with bitter and frustrated people, who are just jealous that some people eat what they want, get fat from it and still live in total denial of their ruined health and aestetically unpleasing appearance, or even make money out of it, like Tess Munster, while for them it means hard work and dedication as well as sacrifices to keep their bodies slim and fit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a little bit like a reversed tumblr in my opinion.</p>

But of course it&#39;s already announced in plain sight. Reddit is owned by Samuel Newhouse Jr, a <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Who-controls-your-mind-2013.jpg">Jew media</a> mogul.

</blockquote>

<p>So, I know I&#39;m gonna eat shit for this, but if that quote is accurate then whatever it did violated the rules of the website. If that&#39;s the case then there&#39;s your problem, Pao has little to do with it as interim CEO.</p>

<p>Also in this thread we&#39;re all foaming about FPH being banned, but citing Coontown as an example of a worse sub, and I&#39;m frankly not sure what the point is. Coontown doesn&#39;t seem to directly encourage harassment and brigading like FPH did.</p>

<p>Also also, if <a href="/r/coontown">/r/coontown</a> were banned, you don&#39;t think we&#39;d be complaining about that, too? I understand the difference of opinion on how to run reddit, but it&#39;s like in this case there&#39;s no way the admins can win. They either blatantly allow the rules to be broken and allow harassment and violence to be incited on their web service, or they enforce the rules and now they&#39;re against freedom of speech.</p>

<p>I&#39;d link an example if I could still find any, but the sub is banned of course. I&#39;ll take your word that it wasn&#39;t always like that, but I have to doubt the reasoning behind calling it just plain censorship given my experience, since I&#39;ve definitely seen examples of incitement to harassment and worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was honestly surprised it wasn&#39;t much worse. Majority of the posts had blurred/marked out names or little to no personal information, excluding celebrities. The only exceptions I can think of are the relatively rare occasions when people threatened and/or went after the sub. </p>

<p>Maybe I just have the wrong understanding of harassment, though. For the most part they were just making fun of people in a sub called &quot;Fatpeoplehate&quot; and rarely venturing outside that sub, at least as far as Reddit is concerned. I hate to use the race as an example since I don&#39;t really think they are comparable, but I wouldn&#39;t consider it harassment if a black person went to a white supremacy meeting to tell the people there their views are wrong. What I am trying to say is, the few people who some could argue did get harassed essentially came looking for it. Also, even if some people did call for someone to be attacked it normally didn&#39;t happen. I honestly almost never saw anyone&#39;s personal information uploaded and as I mentioned earlier, names were normally marked out. </p>

<p>As far as the pictures being used, I do think the creepy &quot;look at this whale I saw at Wal-mart&quot; posts were a bit much. However, I really didn&#39;t have an issue with people making fun of the pictures people uploaded of themselves. If you&#39;re going to upload pictures of yourself, regardless of whether you&#39;re fat, on a site where anyone can see them you&#39;re putting yourself at risk of your pictures being used by someone else. </p>

<p>However, I am wrong a lot, so what the fuck do I know.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not free speech to compel Ellen Pao, or anyone else, to host content they think is offensive.  Reddit has always been a private, for-profit enterprise— one web site out of millions on the Internet.  If you want to have a discussion board about how raping babies is the new black, you are free to build your own web site and espouse those views free of government intervention.</p>

When it comes down to it, if free speech means we can impose hatred, bigotry or disdain towards our fellow human beings - then what values are we <em>really</em> defending?

<p>Everyone has the basic human right to speak their mind.  That was the idea that reddit was founded on.  That is what makes the internet the most powerful tool in human history, behind fire, the wheel and the bucket.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why look at FPH if you don&#39;t like it? If fat people are so damn proud of their bodies they wouldn&#39;t give two cents about it. I don&#39;t like it when people get skinny shamed for having a fit body so why would I go look for a skinny shaming site? Like hello lard asses wake up its the internet there&#39;s always going to be something you don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>I only created an account on reddit because of FPH, which I will now delete since it&#39;s banned and am now on a search to find another website to hate on fat people.</p>

<p>[Edit] After Boogies video, I&#39;ve decided to find and support new FPH</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, I am a fat person.
Not just a little overweight but full on I have my own gravitational field. I found <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> highly offensive and did my best to stay away from the subreddit because it made me feel bad about myself. Now that very being said this is an outrage! I may not have agreed with what was being said, but they had every right to say it. This offends me more than any post on that subreddit ever could. Where is the line between not being about to talk bad about fat people and not being able to be fat? This is a pandora&#39;s box. This step into censorship is the first stages in true oppression. Oppressing the people&#39;s right to state how they feel, to stop them from displaying their beliefs is a travesty. What&#39;s next, banning religion? Or maybe maybe I shouldn&#39;t be able to say I hate country music? I&#39;m honestly scared. Where will this lead?
&quot;I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it&quot; ~Evelyn Beatrice Hall.
tl;dr I&#39;m fat and hated fph, but I support their right to hate me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why have years and years of this insidiously increasing censorship gone by without a single viable alternative website to Reddit gaining ground? I&#39;ve heard of criticalthought.me and the quality of the content there really reminds me of Reddit&#39;s very early days, but it doesn&#39;t seem to have many users. Can we please all migrate there?</p>

<p>Reddit has nothing to offer us anyway, we&#39;re the ones supplying all of the content. And censorship aside, the quality of discussion that most of reddit&#39;s users are even capable of having has plummeted to rock-bottom. I for one am really sick and tired of trying to talk to people seriously about serious world problems and getting nothing but stupid jokes, knee-jerk reactions, and butthurt in response. I remember when Digg entered the same phase reddit has been in for at least 7 years now, the only difference is everyone switched to reddit within one year when Digg&#39;s quality plummeted, most within the first half year. So what the actual fuck is going on here? </p>

<p>It&#39;s like classic abusive relationship syndrome where we&#39;re not leaving even though we&#39;re being stomped all over. Can we please all organize and collectively say &quot;FUCK YOU&quot; to reddit and just be done with it? Like I said the only content that&#39;s here is what we provide, the only discussion that takes place is what we start, we can turn absolutely any part of the internet into that. We really don&#39;t need reddit, at all. Especially now that it&#39;s doing nothing but getting in the way of the content and type of discussion that most of it&#39;s users actually want . </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have posted this on any other subreddit, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is honestly one of the last places on reddit where users actually keep a critical mind about them. Hope you guys can hear me out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a platform for free-speech? I thought that&#39;s all that reddit was. That&#39;s why I come here. To see the other side of stories and situations. One of the beautiful things about reddit is that anyone can say anything. If we as a reddit community don&#39;t like what they say (and we often don&#39;t) we down vote, we get upset, we explain (rather elegantly or unelegantly) why the said individual is wrong for it. Taking away freedoms is never the answer. </p>

<p>There are plenty of things that people do have control over which others might consider insulting, threatening or offensive; however this subset of offensives is defined by social norms and subjective opinions, unlike those offenses which are facts about the world.

    <div class="md"><p>The internet used to be a tool for people to gain knowledge, share valued ideas and express ones feelings. </p>

<p>FPH argue that their sub was used for all of the above, but what is there to be learnt or shared from a toxic group of people who are disillusioned into thinking they are perfect?</p>

<p>I have seen photos of these fat people haters and their defects range from rancid hair, bad skin, horrendous dress sense, disgusting finger nails, poorly applied make up, and shockingly organized bedrooms in the background. ( <a href="/r/fitshionvsfatshion">/r/fitshionvsfatshion</a> as my source)</p>

<p>These guys are far from perfect but hate on one attribute of people. If you are going to play the superior card get your ducks in order at least and clean yourself up and pay attention to your own appearance. Far more to looking good than just weight.</p>

<p>Step outside and get a tan, instead of spamming all the decent subs out of anger, or find a hobby where you can actually meet people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>that being this parading and crying over an obviously hateful subreddit ban. mind you, for a long time fph was a decent sub with some funny stuff, some tongue in cheek stuff and some overly passive aggressive content but in the recent weeks...... well, have you seen the state of it? people were REALLY angry, offensive, rude.... the list goes on and on and there was nothing good about it anymore. as it grew it just devolved into moronic anger and hate over something as stupid as some people being fat. its dumber than being angry over homosexual people.</p>

<p>everyone in that sub just started feeling god complex (stronger than reddits usual) and the posts in there were going downhill FAST. there is expression of opinions and then there is raw hate which FPH turned into, it wasn&#39;t uncommon to see posts telling people to pretty much kill themselves in an overly sarcastic passive aggressive ways.</p>

<p>what does book burning or taliban has to do with ANY of this? you&#39;re just proving my point further how this sub turned to shit. you just derailed the topic completely and started comparing FPH with religions and book burning.</p>

<p>Is it wrong to be hateful to groups that use suicide bombers? Suicide bombers are not born that way, they are products of the society around them. Fat people were not born that way, they are the product of a dysfunctional society around them. At this point it will take some extremism for people to realize how broken things are. Black people used to be treated like shit, then there were race riots and protests, and calls for equal civil rights and things have gotten better for blacks since then (albeit not perfect). The problem was the inequality and racism, not the blacks. The problem in this case is a society that things being fat is acceptable and has a rampant obesity problem.

<p>Yes, people can become fat. Babies can also be born overweight due to medical conditions, and people CAN have medical conditions (or even mental conditions) that make it more difficult for them to maintain or have a healthy weight. Nobody flat out chooses to be fat.</p>

<p>Is it okay to hate black people for that same reason? I mean, the only reason crime statistics are higher in black areas is that very same reason. </p>

<p>Are you honestly even listening to yourself? You&#39;re trying to say that something harmful to people should be unacceptable? Let&#39;s just burn the fat people, right? And the smokers? And the criminals? Being TOO skinny or having an eating disorder is unhealthy too, can we hate people for that?

    <div class="md"><p>So I joined <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a few years ago because I was genuinely interested in knowing what corporations and the government didn&#39;t want me to know. I was following the Assange and Snowden cases, and I was passingly familiar with 9/11 coverup stories. This sub seemed like a good community for someone with my interests.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I will be leaving now. I&#39;m sorry that I&#39;m not as passionate about being hateful to the obese as you are. I have obese friends and family members, and I wish they were otherwise, but I love them for who they are. The fact that everyone is getting up in arms about not being able to post pictures of overweight strangers and call them &quot;hams&quot; anymore is really repulsive. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, Reddit is a site ran by an organization that does not receive public funding. They don&#39;t have to respect free speech, and frankly shouldn&#39;t be expected to endorse hate speech. Those of you who want to continue discussing why you hate the obese are welcome to do so, provided you find a party willing to host your discussings.</p>

<p>So Pao doesn&#39;t endorse hate speech regarding fat people? Wow. What a fucking asshole.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve cooled off a bit. I guess that sounded a bit bitchy, so I apologize for that. I still stand by my decision to leave, bit thanks for the fun ride, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, and keep your tinfoil shiny!</p>

I was just a simple soldier fighting on the reddit front lines down voting fatass ham planets and upvoting my shitlord brethren when the unthinkable happened our beloved subreddit was struck down by the Emperor Pao and the fat admins. Just when i had started to lose faith in my brethren i saw new shitlord subreddits popping up all over the place and realized now is the time to fight back we must band together to show the evil emperor we will never give up no matter how many subreddits will be banned we will always be shitlords. So today i fight even though i fear it may be my last, today I stand alongside my fellow shitlords to the end</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The space available for free speech is shrinking. Such a big deal is made of such petty offenses that nobody can express anything. This harassment idea is obviously ridiculous. Your weight isn&#39;t automatically known to reddit. This means some fat bitter piece of shit is going to r/Ihatefatpeople and revealing they&#39;re fat, and then getting offended when they are hated. This isn&#39;t a case of harassment, this is a case of one person suppressing the ideas of another. In an era where more things are becoming offensive every week, this ban may be the beginning of a very slippery slope. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you&#39;re picking at their choice of team, not how they look, or posting private pictures of them, it is completely different. Hating on teams or people for the teams they follow is part of life, rarely is it taken seriously, or results in upsetting people. Who are we to mock over weight people?, we all have our own faults, be it private or public, nobody likes to be shamed for it. I used to get bullied at school, I&#39;m sure over weight people get bullied too, difference is people in r/fatpeoplehate post from friends Facebook accounts or scour the internet to shame people, some even taking pictures of people while at their gym. We come on reddit to escape our miserable lives, not to have others knock it.</p>

And let me share a hard truth with you. You&#39;re the only person that can make yourself feel shame. No one else. Stop being such a pussy. I&#39;m a big fat fuck, have been since puberty. I own it, someone telling me I&#39;m fat is like someone telling me I&#39;m a man. I knew that shit before I got out of bed today. My point with the sports teams, was don&#39;t go to those subs, and you won&#39;t know they&#39;re talking shit about you or anyone else. </p>

The best thing is that they&#39;ve removed <a href="/r/fatpeoplehate">/r/fatpeoplehate</a> with the excuse that it was &quot;unsafe&quot; while in the meantime there are still plenty of subreddits full of messed up shit (take <a href="/r/watchpeopledie">/r/watchpeopledie</a> for example).

    <div class="md"><p>Cmon r/conspiracy, where is the flair?<br/>
OK so I admit to lurking on FPH, for a variety of reasons. Mostly I saw it as the extreme opposite reaction to the other extreme opposite thing happening, in which obesity is a worsening problem that is getting a bunch of new social acceptance. It was both funny and hateful- look but don&#39;t touch for my money - I prefer the ethos of being the change you want to see in the world. But it was a source of some information and an artifact of our culture.<br/>
Yesterday I happened upon a FPH post of a pamphlet found in a doctors office - the OP claimed to have briefly confronted the doctor about it - it was HAES (health at every size) propoganda. The comment section zero&#39;d in on the possibility that Nestle co. was distributing these to doctor&#39;s offices, and incurious staff members might make them generally available to the public. This is potentially a public health issue - even if it&#39;s taboo to tell people to not smoke or be fat in social settings, at the doctor, the science should rule.<br/>
So! Where are the good conspiracy theorists speculating that nestle or kraft or coke or pepsi might have something to do with this - advertising dollars, deals, etc? Reddit is a company - AFAIK it&#39;s not a non-profit...</p>

<li>Cool company comes along, does something unique.<br/></li>
<li>People like it and it becomes a very large, popular organization.</li>

<li>People search for an alternative like this company was when it started out.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel sad about this. Unless they quickly reverse their decision, this will probably result in many of us being driven away to rival sites. Reddit has rightly been able to call itself &quot;the front page of the internet&quot; until now - it&#39;s been the main tool that people use to share information widely and collaborate online, and it looks like that may soon change.</p>

<p>There may soon be multiple communities centered around any given interest on multiple sites, all repeating each others&#39; work, all reinventing the wheel. Our abilities to collaborate on any given issue may soon be fractured. This makes me sad.</p>

<p>Reddit is no longer a place of free speech under Ellen Pao.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just want to remind you and anyone else out there that Pao is not the decision maker. She is the one that implements those decisions. She, and CEOs in general, are the executioners - the axemen, for those above them making the decisions (Advance Publications, Inc. is a majority shareholder in Reddit).</p>

<p>Pao was brought in but its not like these ideas and policies are hers. She&#39;s the one who executes them, and ultimately takes responsibility for, but don&#39;t think that replacing Pao will replace the policies. </p>

<p>As always, follow the money. Reddit makes money, and makes decisions based on potential loss or potential profits. If that&#39;s the case, if free speech is detrimental to profits, then it will be censored. If free speech is beneficial to profits, then it will be allowed. </p>

<p>You want to get mad at the executioner for the policies - fine. don&#39;t blame you. but the one who snaps their fingers and says &quot;Make it so&quot; is Advance Publications, and if Pao didn&#39;t march to their beat, she&#39;d be replaced with someone who would. Therefore, blame must be assigned correctly to the shareholders..</p>

<p>But how can a subreddit dedicated to a very broad (forgive the pun) group of people be considered as &quot;harassment of individuals&quot;?</p>

<p>I mean, did they name names in that sub?</p>

Banning people from a private sector website because you don&#39;t want to hear their bullshit anymore is every bit as much an expression of free speach as hating on fat people is. Will reddit ever be as open and free as it was in the olden days?  No, obviously not. The more popular a forum becomes the more gentrified it will be. Get over it. </p>

<p>Isn&#39;t posting strangers pictures from social media and taking sneaky photos of strangers in Wal-Mart kind of skirting that line though? It&#39;s not breaking the rule but it&#39;s close to the spirit of it. </p>

<p>Not saying I support censorship, but I bet if they only ever posted public figures for example, they&#39;d still be around. Or called themselves fathate instead of fatPEOPLEhate maybe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s illogical to be frusterated at the object (fat on someone&#39;s body), while being frusterated at the person who has allowed themselves to become extremely overweight makes much more sense.  However, this urge to seek out food has been wired into our brains for many humans since we&#39;ve historically lived off of very little food from the land over millions of years and it&#39;s not like we can simply turn off this craving like a lightswitch.  On the other hand, this urge, action, and therfore consequence has very negative health consequences that can and do affect structure of the bones and the day to day operations of the organs.  Finally, the ideas of fat seem largely socio-economically based; countries with very little food or resources applaud fat while countries with lots of easily-accessible food and resources discourage fat.</p>

<p>The idea that you think this subreddit wasn&#39;t about personal hate and harassment is naive as fuck. They don&#39;t even stop after the ban. These people are obsessed with telling fat pictures on the internet to commit suicide or, much like the comment I just linked in the picture, for someone else to murder them. Gee, why wouldn&#39;t reddit want murder threats on their site? I can&#39;t imagine.</p>

<p>Bullshit. There are plenty of ways of showing your dissatisfaction with those movements that don&#39;t resort to bullying. It&#39;s so petty, it&#39;s surreal. I literally can not understand how people have nothing better to do in their lives than spend their time devoted to the passionate hatred of overweight people. Even if you like getting angry, surely there are better things to get upset about? It&#39;s not that they&#39;re trying to improve the situation because it doesn&#39;t take a genius to realise that bullying isn&#39;t going to make someone turn around and say &quot;You know what, you&#39;re right!&quot;, so they can&#39;t exactly claim a moral high-ground. They&#39;re not spreading this hatred to solve the problem of obesity, these people probably have anger management issues and are using overweight people as a scapegoat for their personal issues. That is the only explanation I can come up with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not saying that obesity is not a problem. Of course it&#39;s a problem and anyone claiming otherwise is talking nonsense. What I <em>am</em> saying is that people posting on FPH <em>didn&#39;t care</em> about solving the problem. </p>

<p>You claim that &quot;some people need tough love&quot; - that&#39;s nonsense. Making someone feel like shit is an absolutely terrible idea and even if by chance it &quot;worked&quot; in your case, who knows what other problems it caused? People who go around talking about &quot;fat-pride&quot; are in the minority - most people who are overweight are not proud of it and many of them probably feel extremely self-conscious about it. It&#39;s just very basic people skills to realise that shaming someone who is already self-conscious about something into doing something is almost certainly doing more harm than good. </p>

<p>The way to solve the obesity problem is a combination of education and making healthy food cheaper and more widely available. That is the way you solve the problem. A bullying circlejerk is <em>not</em> the way you solve the problem. Are you genuinely claiming that a subreddit that regularly gives 1000+ upvotes to pictures of obese people captioned with disgusting insults is trying to achieve anything constructive?</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve already said, don&#39;t try to claim any kind of a moral high-ground here. If anyone on FPH genuinely thought they were doing something to solve the problem then they&#39;re living in a parallel universe but I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of users were just looking for a group of people to piss on.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t walk up to my family and tell them they&#39;re all fat fucks and I hate them. I would tell them the same kind of shit I tell my girlfriend (and wish she&#39;d tell me - but she&#39;s way too nice and I hate that). &quot;Why didn&#39;t you go to the gym today? You haven&#39;t been in three days,&quot; &quot;you&#39;re not going to lose any weight eating that donut...and you said you wanted to hit 180 lbs by June,&quot; &quot;doing 50 bodyweight squads twice a week for three months hasn&#39;t gotten you anywhere, you might want to actually do some research and find out a real workout plan to help you progress,&quot; &quot;you really could stand to lose some more weight. You&#39;ve done a great job so far but 20 lbs out of the 50 you need to lose isn&#39;t even halfway.&quot; That&#39;s all much better than saying &quot;oh honey you&#39;re just fine - here, have more oreos&quot; or &quot;I understand - you worked hard by doing those 50 bodyweight squats you&#39;ve earned that bowl of ice cream.&quot; Those don&#39;t help anyone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...All of that is absolutely fine. That&#39;s not &quot;tough love&quot;, that&#39;s being honest and absolutely reasonable. That&#39;s exactly what you should do. This is completely different from the kind of rubbish that&#39;s on FPH which is nothing about constructive criticism and everything about bullying and making people feel awful. I never said you should &quot;sugarcoat&quot; things or lie to people, just that there&#39;s <em>an intermediate</em> between telling someone they&#39;re a &quot;fat fuck&quot; and telling something that obesity is absolutely fine and nothing to worry about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I agree. But, at least in my case, it&#39;s not about straight up shaming them but more about telling them what they need to hear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I completely agree... that&#39;s not what FPH is doing though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone misses the point. HAES and FPH are two sides of the same emotive subject, but its just one meme. One side feeds the other, and they both grow. They become idea chambers, mutating and improving the outrage, referencing each other to help spread. One group feeding the other, and vice versa.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an easy trap to fall into because emotions like anger bypass our normal thought processes, outrage comes much more easily than empathy, gives us a sense of control (someone to blame), and usually has a simpler solution. People like simple solutions.</p>

<p>Memes this potent only last as long as they are contained. FPH broke out of the echo chamber and the rest of the site got to see it raw, and in a far wider context than they saw themselves. But a lot of hate subs are places for people who need to feel safe, in control, and part of a group. Everything in moderation I suppose.</p>

<p>No it wasn&#39;t. It was a bunch of shitty bullies. Who the fuck cares if people are fat? If you don&#39;t like fat people, just stay away from them. There&#39;s something wrong with you if you care that much about another group of people....chill the fuck out and live your life. Oh, someone took up two seats on the bus? Do you live on the fucking bus? Who cares! Communities that encourage that type of thinking or hateful rhetoric can go somewhere else. You want complete freedom of speech? Go to 4chan. This website has moderators and votes and is privately owned by Conde Nash....it&#39;s not set up to be, nor should it be looked at, as a bastion of free-speech. It&#39;s an internet community, and just like a real community can decide to try and ban people like Neo-Nazis or the Westboro Baptist Church that promote ideas everyone else in the community feels is harmful, so can Reddit ban sub-reddits. You guys do yourself a great disservice by thinking this is anything other than a little content-farmer website for entertainment purposes.</p>

<p>Why should I care? Honest question. None of those subreddits has ever been accused of harassing someone so hard they killed themselves. None of those subreddits go out of their way to make a huge deal about how cool their hate is on twitter, facebook and other subreddits. The admins said this was about a culture of harassment. You can watch people die without looking up the surviving family and laughing at them. You can think abortions are sexy without flooding facebook with ARE THESE ABORTIONS SEXY YET. I don&#39;t get this rage. In any context.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the major difference right there. If a fatty posts on r/fitness they&#39;re inviting criticism. Hell, as long as no one brigades them, you can even cross post it to a fat hate subreddit and you&#39;ll still probably be ok. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t people understand shitty behavior is caused by deep insecurities and self-loathing? Those fat people feel like shit because they&#39;re fat...and any &#39;unacceptable&#39; behavior you see is probably a result of BEING fat. You ever see a guy talking loud, trying to pick fights with random people? He&#39;s got a small cock, his girlfriend is cheating on him, his father called him a fag his whole life, w/e it is...he&#39;s fundamentally insecure, and that&#39;s why he&#39;s acting like that, because subconsciously he needs to prove something to himself. It&#39;s the same with fat people, any &#39;entitlement&#39;, all the justifications for being fat......it&#39;s a DEFENSE MECHANISM to hide their INSECURITY about being fat! I guarantee you, fat people already know all the mean stuff you could ever say to them (they probably have internalized all those things and know it even more profoundly than you could ever realize), so why the fuck you gotta tell &#39;em again? It&#39;s bullying, pure and simple....bullying of a weak target that&#39;s already crushed inside. THAT&#39;S my problem with it. Give those fat people a break, already. You ever get mad at a fat person, just think &#39;at least I&#39;m not fat&#39; and go about your business, because that person&#39;s life is shitty because they&#39;re fat and they know it already.</p>

<p>So why does everyone burn r/FPH when one person from that sub does something they don&#39;t like, but we&#39;re not allowed to hate on the GROUP (HAES, fat acceptance, some branches of feminism) that likes to preach that being fat is ok? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one was personally talking to Fat people, just a medium in which they could vent their frustrations with a like minded community. If it was such a horrible, witch-hunt inciting, cess pool of a sub-reddit then why did so many people subscribe? Honestly, all your replies are just getting down voted, so just stop. There are INFINITELY worse sub-reddit&#39;s on this site and it is quite frankly pretty weak they would go ahead and ban it. Granted, some of the people on that sub were probably a little insecure, but for you to assume every single person there is insecure is pretty bold, and pretty fucking dumb. Obviously your opinion won, because the sub is banned, quit defending the action because your only going to get down voted and no one cares for you defending the position. Save your breath my precious neck-beard, your probably gonna need it when you actually have to move away from your keyboard</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Says who? You? When did you dictate what was right or wrong? I can hate someone if I want. Basing my hate on things they can&#39;t change is immoral. However, being fat is something you choose.  By choosing the actions that lead to being fat, it all snowballs from there.  If you&#39;re taking up half my seat on a bus, fuck you. If you&#39;re taking up half my seat on an airplane, fuck you. If you&#39;re bitching that you can&#39;t stand up for more than 20 minutes while waiting in line at an amusement park, fuck you.  I don&#39;t have to like you, I especially don&#39;t have to like you for the person that you became due to shitty life choices.  It doesn&#39;t make me a terrible person. Why? Because life isn&#39;t about NOT hurting anyone&#39;s feelings. Feelings will get hurt. Mine do. My parents were smart enough to teach me how to deal with it. Fat people think that OTHER people should have to accommodate for their physical and emotional needs.</p>

<p>Fat people suck.  </p>

<p>You could be the nicest person in the world, but if you&#39;re fat, you&#39;re still imposing yourself on a lot of people. </p>

<p>Why does the opinion of what one redditor thinks matter to if Reddit the company will host content or not? No redditor gets to &quot;dictate&quot; anything in terms of what content is allowed or not allowed on reddit. Their answer to that question would be one of the most meaningless and useless bits of information someone would learn about who&#39;s dictating content on reddit.</p>

<p>Realistically, you will always have someone that hates you, why not be realistic and just accept there will be people you will not like? I don&#39;t go yelling at them everytime I see them, nor do I dictate my opinions on them randomly in public. </p>

When people decide they can dictate how everyone else feels about everything. I get to choose what I love, hate, like, and dislike. That is one of the few things no one can ever take from you.

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t understand is, why does it bother people so much? There are <strong>plenty</strong> of subs that exist only to make fun of people. Cringe, trashy, talesfrominsertprofessionhere, imgoingtohellforthis, insertracehere, atheist, and many more I&#39;m sure. If a sub&#39;s focus is on an opinion I don&#39;t share, I don&#39;t frequent that sub. Why is everyone so against a sub for making fun of fat people? Why are fat people the only species protected from ridicule on reddit? It&#39;s not invasive. no one is forced to view it. Why can&#39;t we just let everyone have their own opinions and thoughts, discuss the things they want, and let them do so in peace? Opinions don&#39;t hurt anyone. Everyone needs to stop obsessing about other people&#39;s discussions. The funniest thing to me is, fat acceptance emphasizes confidence regardless of size. A confident person doesn&#39;t make it their life goal to eradicate the opinions of those who dislike them. That mindset just oozes insecurity and low self esteem, the exact opposite of what fat acceptance is supposed to be promoting.</p>

<p>Sure is, always will be.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s their property/lawns, sure. Do I think they should? No, but I respect their rights. If they are doing it on another person&#39;s property, then no. That&#39;s a crime.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, that&#39;s a crime. But if they want to talk about it, sure. That&#39;s free speech.</p>

<p>The point of free speech is to protect the most vile, once you &quot;determine&quot; what is vile and ban it, it&#39;s all down hill from there. One day you may wake up and your speech is now deemed vile, therefore you are silenced. You should think in the broader aspect of issues, just because you are offended by it, doesn&#39;t mean it should be banned.</p>

<p>So in this case saying &quot;fat people should all be starved to death&quot; would likely be fine to say, while &quot;let&#39;s go beat up my fat neighbor Greg&quot; likely wouldn&#39;t. Since the second example contains a direct call to violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So after reading a lot about Ragen there was a discussion about how her bullshit is  unhealthy and basically harmful to whose who listen to her. I said something (don&#39;t remember the exact wording) but basically suggested something should be done about her. We were talking about terrible education from HAES people so of course i was suggesting a counter education movement. I was told death threats were not tolerated on that sub. I even explained that it wasn&#39;t a death threat and wrote and explanation on the sub as requested by mods. still banned.</p>

<p>edit: yea after looking at it i realize it was ambiguous and it wasn&#39;t totally out of left field for them to see that, but once i explained myself and expanded on my statement it was stupidity to keep me banned.</p>

<p>edit: syntax</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, so much to unpack in this comment.</p>

<p>First off your reading comprehension skills are poor. You should consider a trip back to Elementary school. Please point out where in my comment that I implied the people of FPH would be performing the actions I mentioned.</p>

<p>Second, going along with your assumption here, there DEFINITELY isn&#39;t a precedent of one group of people raping another group of people despite supposedly finding them disgusting. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Jean_Owens">Oh, wait, there is.</a></p>

<p>Ignorance? What is there to be ignorant of regarding FPH? There isn&#39;t some deep meaning to the blind hatred of an entire group of people. People like you have no interest in having a true discussion, you just want to remain superior in every way to the rest of the world. There&#39;s no Shyamalanian twist on FPH - you hate fat people and don&#39;t want to hear otherwise.</p>

<p>Pathetic? No, what&#39;s pathetic is scouring the internet looking for pictures of people that are different from you and insulting them without knowing them as a person (or in your case even considering them to be a person).</p>

<p>Go find another rock to hide under.</p>

<p>First they came for the pedophiles and I freaked the fuck out because I am one, but nothing happened to me anyway.</p>

<p>Then they came for the white supremacists and I continued to freak the fuck out.</p>

<p>(and by &quot;came for&quot; I mean they shut down a few subreddits. it&#39;s totally still equivalent to the death camps, tho)</p>

<p>Why does the opinion of what one redditor thinks matter to if Reddit the company will host content or not? No redditor gets to &quot;dictate&quot; anything in terms of what content is allowed or not allowed on reddit. Their answer to that question would be one of the most meaningless and useless bits of information someone would learn about who&#39;s dictating content on reddit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true, there have been many visionaries in social progression, Martin L. King, FDR... And it&#39;s true, that our world is in fact better because of these guys. </p>

<p>But the idea of a Social Justic Warrior isn&#39;t the idea of a world changing visonary. It&#39;s actually the opposite. It&#39;s the idea a loser, who only ever acts from behind a keyboard (hence the ironic use of &quot;warrior&quot;). It&#39;s a mocking term for people who don&#39;t want to change the world, but rather want to spend all day bitching about it. </p>

<p>There are people out there, literately risking their lives, talking about homosexual equality, birth control, and religious equality in shithole countries that tend to kill people who speak out. And then there are pretentious assholes on tumblr who think they&#39;re brave for blogging that time they being a dick to you during class. </p>

As if, our internal conciousness will turn off and suddently we&#39;ll think, &quot;Yes, hugely obese people are pretty and I want to date them or consider having sex with them.&quot;   Um... no.  If I want to date someone: I&#39;ll judge them on how athletic they are compared to me by their physicality.  I don&#39;t find fat attractive, I like food but not eating all the time, I like leading an active lifestyle, and I want a partner who also likes to lead an active lifestyle that doesn&#39;t involve mounds and mounds of food.  If someone else enjoys eating everything or enjoys forcing themselves to eat, then good for them.  But there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to date them.</p>
